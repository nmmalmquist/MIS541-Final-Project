0,2326534,1.0,5.0,"Liza's class was my worst experience at W&amp;L. Despite seriously giving this class my all and showing up for every class, and the fact that the syllabus says the grade is participation based, Liza gave me a B because my dance technique wasn't good enough. If you take this class and you're not a professional dancer, be prepared to get a B!!"
1,2326534,4.0,2.0,"Her Intro to Modern Dance class was a fun way to fulfill an Arts requirement. She does a lot of technique but it gets better when you actually learn some dances. It is a long class, though, more so at the end of the term since its dark at 6 when class ends. Lots of reading + journal entries and grading is fair pretty fair (based on effort)."
2,2220049,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Sandberg is so kind! I really loved our film class, and I felt it was pretty easy to maintain an A. Participation matters, but it's not that hard to discuss the films even if you get behind on the readings. Intro to film was a really great (and easy!) HL FDR! I would take Prof. Sandberg again every semester if I could."
3,2220049,4.0,2.0,"FILM 233 was a fun, chill class. We watched foreign films then talked about them, and besides a a few more involved group projects, there was not an overwhelming amount of assessments. She's an easy grader, so I got to focus on the subject rather than tests or papers."
4,2220049,4.0,3.0,"Great director. She knows her stuff. Typical W&amp;L,professor, a geek but this mis cool."
5,2220049,4.0,3.0,Tough but good. Learned a ton about film and she knows the industry inside and out. Knows a lot about film around the world
6,2220049,1.0,4.0,honestly get out while you still can
7,2220049,2.0,4.0,it was Not Great but better than her other ones I think??? who even knows godspeed
8,2220049,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this professor! Her classes seem really interesting, but the workload and overall style of teaching makes the topics miserable. Very unwavering with due dates, even if one of her classes you're in is preventing you from finishing a paper for another one of her classes. There are a lot of great theater faculty at W&L. Do not take her!!!!"
9,2220049,1.0,3.0,"Demands a lot but isn't understanding when you may not have as much time as she desires for a one credit class. My friends in other classes found her to be very demanding as well, especially in the amount of outside work. I wouldn't take a class with her again, even if it were a play that I would have very much wanted to be a part of (i.e.: 1984)."
10,2220050,5.0,2.0,He's the BEST teacher at W&amp;L. The man has hung out with Bob Dylan before for god's sake. If you get the chance to take him you have to.
11,2220050,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ball was amazing, and his Beat Generation class was one of the most interesting courses I have taken at W&amp;L. He spent time with many of the writers during that time, and had personal anecdotes for every class. I would definitely recommend taking one of his classes"
12,135188,1.0,5.0,"I recommend you take this class if you want to put yourself through an hour and a half of straight note-taking. You will only do well in this class if you have a photographic memory and can remember everything you hear because his slides have no text. Only four grades and final exam is brutal. Don't take to fulfill an FDR, you'll regret it. "
13,135188,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Bent's ARTH101 on a whim after dropping chem. The material is so interesting &amp; Prof Bent's lectures are incredibly engaging. If you study the images &amp; the readings 4-5 hours for each quiz, then they are actually pretty rewarding to take. GR8 professor, do not be scared away from the class bc of the workload- it's def doable."
14,135188,5.0,4.0,i love george bent!
15,135188,5.0,4.0,Prof. Bent is a wonderful professor. He is so passionate about teaching students and he is a real expert in Renaissance art. I would recommend any W&amp;L student to take at least one class with him!
16,135188,3.0,4.0,"He is a very knowledgeable professor, but will not cut you any slack. He grades very tough with no opportunities for extra credit. Don't take his classes unless you're really passionate about art history."
17,135188,5.0,4.0,Such an amazing guy. Lectures are very interesting and fun. He is very personable and office hours are always enjoyable. He is a hard grader on papers.
18,135188,4.0,4.0,"Great Professor. Really interesting lectures. The one and only downside you might find is that the tests are not easy. If you're into memorizing about 35 pictures' titles, periods, locations, and artists, then this is the class for you."
19,135188,4.0,4.0,"Loved Dr. Bent! So knowledgable and his lectures were fascinating. Took this for an FDR and ended up loving it. However, it does get pretty difficult and there's heavy memorization. There's some disconnect between term sheets and images on tests. DON'T MISS CLASS. Lectures pack in a lot of info you can't get in the book. ALWAYS read the articles."
20,135188,1.0,5.0,"Lectures are brutal and have no text.  Talks too fast.  All about memorization, not about art."
21,135188,5.0,4.0,"Cannot say enough great things about Bent. He is demanding in a way that makes you feel very good about being successful. His lectures are gripping, tests are CHALLENGING (memorize/read everything), and papers should be prepped for as far in advance as he says. Highly recommend for students looking for a rigorous, yet fascinating, course."
22,135188,5.0,4.0,"An absolutely incredible guy, and one of the best professors at W&L. Extremely interesting, knowledgeable and passionate about everything he teaches. He makes an immense effort to enhance all of his students' understanding and appreciation for the material and subject. If you graduate without taking him, you're missing a life changing influence. "
23,135188,5.0,3.0,"I loved my class with Professor Bent. I highly recommend you take any of his classes, especially his Italian Renaissance course. He's a fair grader. His lectures are very entertaining easy to follow. He is my favorite professor I have had so far at Washington and Lee."
24,135188,5.0,5.0,"Professor Bent is not only the best professor I've encountered here, but the best teacher. I'm not majoring in Art History, but he loves what he teaches, and you won't be able to help but love it too. His assignments are challenging and stressful, and it is tough to get an A. However, if you love to learn, take a class of his. You won't regret it. "
25,135188,3.5,5.0,"Brilliant professor. Funny, energetic, witty, and knows his stuff. Makes you look at art history in a completely new light. Challenges your way of thinking and looks to push you out of your comfort zone. Not an easy grader, but he respects hard workers and those who take a genuine interest in his class. Worth the work."
26,135188,5.0,5.0,"He is a life-changing professor. His enthusiasm and interest are unsurpassed by any professor I have ever had. He loves seeing students in office hours and his lectures are captivating--I have never been bored for one minute. Easily my favorite professor, but a very hard grader with specific demands."
27,135188,1.5,5.0,"He knows his stuff, but the class was incredibly difficult.  I had never received a final grade less than an A on any course ever until I took his class, in which I got a B+.  Do not take if you really care about your GPA.  That said, he is incredibly smart and I learned a lot.  Overall - 1/5 would not take again."
28,135188,5.0,5.0,"Professor Bent is an amazing teacher and really cares about his students and subject.  That being said, do not take his class if you are looking for an easy art credit.  You will be intellectually pushed by him and his class can become very difficult.  Make sure you review your notes after each class and start learning the material before quiz time"
29,135188,5.0,5.0,An intellectual force not to be surpassed by anyone at W&L.
30,135188,5.0,5.0,"The most awesome professor I've ever encountered. Helpful, challenging, brilliant - he will really push you but you will love every minute of it."
31,135188,5.0,4.0,"There are very few Professors like Bent. He cares so much for his students and his subject. You'll work hard, but you'll pretty much love every moment of it."
32,135188,5.0,5.0,Amazing. Knows his stuff inside and out. Don't leave W&L without taking one of Bent's classes; you'll find it incredibly rewarding.
33,135188,5.0,4.0,"He is the man and make you love art history. Incredibly well-versed, articulate and intelligent about his subject. He makes his class the optimal W&L classroom experience. You will become a better writer and student by taking one of his classes."
34,135188,4.0,5.0,BENT IS AWESOME. No elaboration necessary.
35,135188,5.0,4.0,Absolutely amazing. He will make you want to be an art history major. Extremely knowledgeable and personal and a huge asset to the university. Professors like Bent are what make W&L so amazing.
36,135188,5.0,3.0,The reason to take art history classes.
37,135188,5.0,3.0,Amazing! He really knows his stuff (backwards AND forwards). There's no question as to whether or not he loves art history. He'll make you love it too!!
38,135188,5.0,5.0,No Comments
39,135188,3.5,5.0,Wonderful!  I loved this class!
40,135188,5.0,5.0,No Comments
41,135188,5.0,5.0,"Professor Bent establishes himself as the best, most informative, engaging and charismatic teacher at Washington and Lee."
42,135188,5.0,5.0,he is a god.
43,135188,5.0,5.0,Makes the material come to life.
44,135188,5.0,4.0,"Quite possibly the best professor at this college. Taking a course with him should be a requirement. He will make you work hard, but it is such a pleasure to do it that it almost can't be considered a class. It is impossible to convey his teaching style. You just have to see for yourself."
45,135188,5.0,4.0,Great Professor! He will make you want to major in art history.
46,1697841,5.0,3.0,Professor Kerin's class was the one of the most engaging and intellectually stimulating course I've taken so far.  She allows for flexibility within the curriculum so she can cater the material to her students' interests.  All of the assigned readings were interesting and made for great class discussions.  I highly recommend her class!
47,1697841,5.0,2.0,I absolutely adore this woman. Like everyone should take one of her classes she is AWESOME. I really think that having a teacher that is passionate about what they are teaching is one of the most valuable tools for a student to have in a class and to engage with and that is exactly Professor Kerin.
48,1697841,5.0,5.0,"Professor Kerin's passion for her field is evident in the way she lectures. She looks at art and religion with an empathetic and insightful eye and inspires her students to do the same. Her midterm and final are very difficult, so if you are not willing to do the work, do not take this class. If you are willing to do the work, absolutely take her."
49,1697841,4.0,4.0,"You will know more Asian art than when you started! Passionate, knowledgeable, and a good lecturer. My critique though is too much reading for barely using that textbook information - just pay attention in class and take notes. Be able to make connections. I'm glad I took this course; she made me appreciate these beautiful pieces!"
50,1697841,2.0,4.0,"Very tardy in returning grades and assignments, even when we only had 2-3 assessments in a term. Either didn't respond to clarification emails or gave curt, unhelpful responses. Sporadic, scattered lectures that were hard to pay attention to. I felt consistently condescended to and dreaded this class, even though I'd used my pick-one on it."
51,1697841,5.0,4.0,Professor Kerin is an amazing lecturer and is very dedicated to her profession. I did not need to take her class but I did because I thought it would be interesting and it was one of the most engaging classes I have taken in college. Her one down side would be that her final exam/exams in general areoverly difficult for the type of class that it is
52,1697841,4.0,5.0,"First, I'd like to say that I have no intention of being an Art History major. I took this class because I like asian art and thought the class sounded interesting. However, I didn't realize how much time I would have to put into this class. Lots of reading, lots of unnecessary memorization for tests."
53,1697841,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kerin is one of my  favorite professors in the Art and Art History department. Her classes are engaging and informative, and her passion for the material is contagious. Truly one of W&L's greatest."
54,1697841,2.0,4.0,Extremely disorganized and unclear about what she wants. Studying for midterms and exams was practically impossible. Either doesn't return grades back or returns them very late. Will absolutely be avoiding in the future.
55,1697841,2.5,3.0,"Melissa Kerin is the love of my life. On the first day of this class, she convinced me that the web of issues surrounding the designation of ""non-Western"" art are the most important things in the world. Very knowledgeable, fascinating class and professor. The syllabus changed frequently, which although was confusing didn't hinder my experience."
56,1697841,4.5,4.0,"She's one of my favorite professors at W&L---and easily one of the most passionate. If you love Asian art--or even if you just want to learn more about art history ""in the periphery,"" I would highly recommend Professor Kerin. She really knows her stuff, makes class interesting, and provides an immense amount of guidance. "
57,1697841,4.5,3.0,"Wonderful professor! She's sweet, interesting, and very helpful. Class is so interesting and the work is never busy, always engaging and meaningful. 10/10 would recommend if interested in arts of Asia."
58,1697841,5.0,3.0,Professor Kerin is one of the most engaging and enthusiastic professors I've had at W&L. She is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject and offers thoughtful lectures that yield interesting class discussion. She is also very kind and understanding and is extremely pleasant to interact with.
59,1697841,1.5,5.0,"Not a great teacher. Not helpful and always late for meetings, if she shows up at all. Doesn't return work for a long time. Not a great WL experience."
60,1697841,1.5,4.0,I'll never take another course with this professor. She is VERY condescending.
61,1697841,5.0,3.0,"Prof Kerin is the best professor I have had so far! She knows what she is talking about. You will have to work your hard to get good grades though, but you will surely learn a lot. she is very helpful, always there, good humored and gives constructive feedback. Do I recommend her? YES YES YES!! You won't regret, I promise. :)"
62,2150453,4.0,3.0,"Professor Youngman is great. This class is really interesting if you want to go into law. Youngman really cares about her students and is easily available outside her class. I would take as many classes with her as I could. She is very reasonable with grading, and if you put forth the basic effort you can get an A."
63,2150453,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Youngman's class can be done in one of two ways. You can either not read and really pay attention in class,  but participate very little. On the other hand, if you do the reading, you can partially pay attention in class to get clarifications on the reading, and participate. The more you participate, the more she likes you."
64,2613307,5.0,3.0,"Just outstanding - she is the type of professor that makes W&L great. Professor Fisher gives copious feedback and is always available to meet. Her classes are also quite interesting and will teach you how to productively think about environmental issues. Typically grading is based off of only a few papers and participation,"
65,2613307,5.0,3.0,She was a new professor last year but she's awesome and I'm definitely taking her courses again. Grades are based on papers cause there are no quizzes but she's a very fair grader and gives lots of good feedback. Highly highly recommend her.
66,1105980,5.0,4.0,"Professor Gavaler is one of my favorite professors I've had as a first year. His superhero seminar is a great class. Very engaging, encourages everyone to participate, and challenges us to think deeper. Overall just a really nice, funny, interesting guy. I would highly recommend taking Gavaler for a writing seminar if he's teaching one."
67,1105980,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gavaler is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is extremely helpful, and an absolutely fantastic professor. Take his classes! He is also very engaging, and discussions are enlightening."
68,1105980,4.0,2.0,Fantastic Professor. I cannot stress how much I loved his class. His interests are so awesome and unique. He's also very approachable and really loves to interact with his students. I would 1010 recommend. 
69,1105980,4.5,5.0,"You will learn a lot in his classes but man are they hard. You will read a book a week and you absolutely cannot fall behind or you will get called out each time and he quizzes daily to ensure this. Outside the difficulty and excessive reading, at the end of the day I take away a lot from his classes."
70,1105980,5.0,2.0,I really enjoyed Gavaler's I See Dead People. I don't like english or writing classes but he made it very interesting and very bearable. I would recommend taking this class and probably any other class that he teaches.
71,1105980,5.0,1.0,"Gavaler's I See Dead People writing class was a great freshman writing seminar. Classes were mainly student discussion, and his expectations for his essays were very clear. He was a fair grader and always willing to help."
72,1105980,4.5,3.0,"TAKE GAVALER FOR FRESHMAN WRITING! unique guy but thats part of why hes good, no idea was ever discounted as ""wrong"" as long as you could explain your reasoning behind it. participating in this class was a lot easier bc of that, he never made me feel stupid. i got a b on everything but im a 100x better writer bc of it."
73,1105980,4.5,3.0,"I See Dead People Seminar was a good option for the writ requirement. Gavaler's enthusiasm makes up for the gothic, horrific and sad novels covered in class. Loads of reading and writing but not impossible. Office hours are mandatory and extremely helpful. Super awesome guy, always willing to go out of his way to help students improve."
74,1105980,4.5,3.0,"Great professor, you gotta come to class, participate and put the work in but he is a fair grader, extremely helpful and made me a lot better at analyzing text and improved the clarity of my writing. there's a fair amount of work but it should rarely give you problems or stress if you stay on top of it."
75,1105980,4.5,3.0,Such an awesome teacher. Really encourages class room discussion. One of my favorites. Looked forward to his class and his analysis of themes and ideas.
76,1105980,5.0,3.0,"Absolute favorite teacher at W&L. Genuinely interested in his students, leads great discussions. Does require outside work and daily quizzes. I only got B's on his papers but he is such a great teacher that it was worth it."
77,1105980,5.0,4.0,"pretty cool, chill guy.  i really enjoyed his class bc it was workshop style and you really got to talk and speak up a lot to express your opinions. participation is definitely important, and there are some busy work assignemtns which aren't too bad. he's very helpful especially during office hours. can be easy to get a b but impossible to get an a"
78,1105980,3.0,2.0,"Weird, nice guy. Lots of class discussions, reading and one page responses. Easy to get a B, tough to get an A."
79,1105980,4.5,2.0,"Absolutely take this teacher. He requires a lot in terms of reading and small response assignments, but they are manageable. He is extremely accommodating and helpful, and is a very fair grader. Definitely come to class and be on time, because he really thinks thats important."
80,1105980,4.0,4.0,Great professor. He expects a lot in terms of reading with daily quizzes and lots of emphasis on participation but also is super encouraging regarding his students ideas. Papers are graded fairly and he provides clear and positive feedback that is applicable to future papers
81,1105980,5.0,2.0,"Gavaler's definitely a cool guy. 105 is all discussion based, which helps with understanding. The papers aren't too bad, and the class is a good one to take def."
82,1105980,3.5,4.0,"So basically, go to class. He's serious about absences affecting your grade. Don't take him if you have trouble getting up in the morning (that's me) or if you're not a very talkative person (also me). Get your two comments in per class and you'll be fine."
83,1105980,4.0,3.0,"Professor Gavaler is enthusiastic and very open to new ideas.  While he does grade fairly tough on the papers, he gives a ton of chances to improve and is very specific with his advice.  I had a great time with him!"
84,1105980,1.5,4.0,"I took the english 105 with this professor, while the readings and the discussions were interesting and the class was set up well he is absolutely no help in improving your writing skills or just about anything else. Dont even bother visiting his office hours to ask how to improve anything, a waste of time."
85,1325122,5.0,3.0,"gives a bit more work than lanier does for intro lab, but is clear on requirements and you learn more as well. "
86,1325122,4.0,3.0,"He is a spunky guy- odd, yet very funny. Gives a significantly greater amount of work than the other first year Bio Lab teacher. Proceed with caution to this class. A lot of work for a 1 credit."
87,1325122,1.0,2.0,"His expectations from the beginning of the course to the end change, which would be fine if he didn't make you design a project after the first few labs. His grading &quot;philosophy&quot; is basically to follow a bell-curve distribution, no rubric either. Even if you implement ALL his feedback (after tracking him down to hear it), probably won't get an A."
88,1325122,3.0,3.0,"Take Lanier! Winder doesn't grade anything. He wants students to put in a lot of work outside of class, but he does not reward them for the work. Grades are based on 2 papers that he doesn't actually read or grade."
89,1325122,5.0,3.0,"Professor Winder is quirky and chill. He will make you work hard for your grade though, but after the class, you will learn a lot more about writing research papers and using all the lab tools. A great experience I would say."
90,1325122,5.0,4.0,"The reviews here don't do Professor Winder justice. He is a great guy, maybe a bit slow on grading your papers, but he gave detailed comments on each and every one of your paper. He gave you constructive comments on every step of your last project. I heard that Prof Lanier is a great professor, but don't be hesitant to take Prof Winder."
91,1325122,1.0,5.0,Avoid him!!! He doesn't ever grade your papers so your grades come from nowhere. Too much work for a 1-credit class! You probably won't get an A even if you are smart and work hard. He is a good person but I hated this class so so much!
92,1325122,1.0,4.0,Do everything you can to get Lanier for Bio lab! Winder is slow to grade things and an unreasonable grader. You can go to him and get help during office hours but then he'll tear apart things he helped you write while he grades. Not helpful in the slightest...
93,1325122,4.0,3.0,Winder is a laid back human being in general which makes him very easy to get along with( but also a little non-task oriented). He makes himself very available to his students and is a very understanding professor. He is more than willing to help his students with whatever they are struggling with.
94,1325122,1.0,5.0,"He is hands down my least favorite professor I have ever had at W&amp;L. I worked hard in his class, completed everything that was asked of me, and I was told that I had done very well in the class. After reviewing my final lab right up, he told me it was &quot;golden,&quot; but when the term grades came out everything had been arbitrarily decided. Do not take!"
95,1325122,1.0,3.0,"Very scattered.  The feedback he gives on papers is vague and let's be honest, lab classes are supposed to be easy if you show up and do the labs.  However, Winder expects every write up to be ready to be published in ""Popular Science""  after the prompt he gave was extremely vague.  Also the fact that there is no syllabus is not helpful."
96,1325122,1.0,4.0,"Very scattered. Does not tell you what you are being graded on and gives little to no feedback (the feedback he does give is very weird and not helpful). Will slash off points on assignments just for fun (and brag to the class later about it). Nice guy, but very quirky. Directions and grading are unclear- no syllabus."
97,1325122,2.0,2.0,"Professor Winder is... interesting to say the least.  He gets distracted super easily, forgets to give out homework until two hours before the class, and just overall doesn't grade like other teachers do at this school.  If you can avoid him, try to.  if not, don't worry, his standards aren't that high."
98,1325122,4.0,2.0,"The bio lab with Winder is super easy. Show up, follow lab procedure, and you'll earn an easy A. Not to mention, Winder is super quirky and makes for an interesting class to say the least."
99,1325122,3.0,4.0,"Professor Winder was a really nice guy who was willing to help whenever he was actually in his office during office hours. The only reservation I have is that he was not in his office when I went to speak with him about my papers during his regular office hours, which really hurt me because my schedule was so full. He grades harshly too."
100,1325122,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE. Winder was horrible. He seems fine at first, but decides your grades arbitrarily. He had no grading standards. I would go into his office for help on lab reports, and leave feeling that I had a clear, successful paper. He would make few changes to my drafts & say things like ""looks good"". He then would give me C's on them. "
101,1325122,2.0,3.0,"Winder means well, but its hard to match his enthusiasm when he adheres to the Attila the Hun school of grading. He will only give one or two A's and compares every paper to one another. The techniques you pick up in lab are alright and you develop quickly as a scientific writer, but I would still question whether it was worth the lower grade."
102,1325122,1.5,4.0,"I'm surprised Professor Winder still has a job here. His office hours aren't that helpful (if he's even in his office), and he has a very ""hands off"" teaching method that's basically just wing it on every paper and hope for a good grade, especially since he's so disorganized that you won't get your last paper back until after your next one's due."
103,1325122,2.5,1.0,I'm surprised he has mostly positive comments. He's not horrible but definitely not good. If you can follow directions on a rubric and put effort into understanding the course material you will do very well. He likes to hear himself talk and will hold you in lab talking about bugs until the end of time. It's unfortunate that 113 is required.
104,1325122,3.5,4.0,"The course itself is not difficult, though Professor Winder's grading style makes it difficult to get a good grade on your papers. I don't know that I learned much from wading into woods creek to count bugs, though I did enjoy the genetics-focused lab work."
105,1325122,1.5,4.0,"Professor Winder is energetic, but he never answers questions fully. I believe he thinks by using a weird form of the Socratic method that he is facilitating learning, but it ends up confusing students more. He grades papers extremely hard if you're a freshman. Office hours are generally unhelpful."
106,1325122,4.5,2.0,"I jumped into the freezing creek  barefoot for Winder... But he still only gave me a B+. Grading is actually pretty fair; try hard on the papers, especially the first one, since he actually does follow the syllabus to the letter regarding grading. Weird dude, but competent. Seems like a reasonable trade-off."
107,1325122,4.5,2.0,It's very clear that he loves his job.  Get ready to hike.
108,1325122,5.0,2.0,Really nice guy and is willing to help in any way that he knows how to.
109,1325122,4.5,2.0,He is very helpful and easy to get along with.
110,120910,4.0,4.0,"The thing you have to know about Conner is that he has no concept of a normal work load. He's a great professor, don't get me wrong, but he probably assigns the most reading in the entire department. I would balance your course load with that in mind, but otherwise he's a good professor I'd say 90% of the time."
111,120910,5.0,4.0,"Made me an English major. He's not an easy grader, but if you keep up with his workload you will be fine. Beyond brilliant."
112,120910,5.0,5.0,"Amazing teacher. Class is all discussion based so you must do the reading- but the books he chooses are actually good. Difficult grader, As are really rare but not impossible. Made me want to be an English major."
113,120910,4.0,5.0,"Connor is one of the toughest grades in the English Dept., but also one of the best teachers.  He knows Irish lit., Shakespeare, and Af.Am. lit. like he wrote it himself, and is a brilliant lecturer. DO NOT take him unless you're going to really give his class effort.  He hates slackers and makes a game of destroying the lazy.  Worth it otherwise."
114,120910,5.0,5.0,"I'm thirty years old, had Prof. Conner in 1998, and I'm coming all the way to this website to tell people to take his classes.  He was one of the only English Profs I had in college or grad school who wasn't afraid to lecture, and his lectures were always fascinating.  He did give me my only B in English at W&L, but I forgive him.  It was worth it."
115,120910,4.5,4.0,"One of the best professors at W&L. He is so articulate and very passionate about the material, and is able to incoporate even the most random comments into a meaningful class discussion. Comments on papers are very helpful and constructive. I would highly recommend this class/ professor--made me want to be an English major."
116,120910,5.0,5.0,Best Professor I've had.
117,120910,4.5,4.0,"Amazing professor, definitely enthusiastic about his material, and if you even partially liked Shakespeare before, you'll love it after Conner's class. Tough grader. You absolutely need to take this class."
118,120910,4.0,5.0,"This teacher is very interested in the subject and loves it.  He is a very interesting guy, but he grades very difficult.  Enjoyed the class but not my grade."
119,120910,5.0,4.0,"Professor Conner was the best English Professor I have ever had in my life.  He used movies, the internet, and of course the literature to enhance his classes.  Not one single lecture was boring...EVER.  The feedback on the essays is superb and really helps to fine tune your writing.  I recommend him to everyone and anyone who come to WLU!!"
120,120910,4.5,3.0,Even though I am not a very strong writer his class was very enjoyable and he picked fun novels to read and study.  He's a pretty tough grader but definitely improves your writing.  Very fun professor and I enjoyed the class trips to see Shakespeare plays in Staunton.
121,120910,5.0,4.0,"Oh my God. There are just no words for this man. Even if you hate the class material, he'll make you love it. And your writing is guaranteed to improve; he's incredibly good at giving feedback and advice, and his office is always open if you want to discuss paper topics or his comments. Outside of class, he's also an amazing adviser and friend."
122,120910,5.0,4.0,"I LOVE Professor Conner! He really taught me how to write and to appreciate literature. I would recommend him to anyone who is willing to work hard in order to learn a lot. His class isn't easy, but if you make an effort, it is almost impossible not to improve. Professor Conner is the MAN!!"
123,120910,5.0,4.0,"Great class and wonderful teacher. Very passionate, articulate, and never boring. This is not an easy class, but your writing is guaranteed to improve if you are willing to work hard."
124,120910,5.0,4.0,"Awesome teacher - passionate and enjoyable and sooooooooo incredible!  Class - if you love Shakespeare, you'll love it.  You go to plays and read a play about every week and a half (8 in 12 weeks)."
125,120910,5.0,4.0,Sooo good. Sooo wonderful. I can't describe...his class is like nirvana.
126,120910,5.0,3.0,Yeats still sucks. lol.
127,120910,5.0,3.0,No Comments
128,120910,5.0,5.0,"Wonderful, passionate.  Has high expectations and will not compromise them.  Well-worth the experience."
129,120910,5.0,4.0,"Plain and simple the man taught me how to write and write very well.  Very approachable and helpful.  Might scare some people b/c he hands out C's on the first 3 of 5 essays like it's his job.  But makes you think you've improved your writing significantly, and well you probably did."
130,120910,3.5,5.0,Really nice and very articulate but grades essays impossibly hard.
131,120910,3.0,5.0,he is a first-class a-hole
132,120910,5.0,3.0,"Awesome Professor, made me want to major in english. i highly recommend him. grading is very tough, hard b, impossible a."
133,120910,5.0,4.0,"Great class, great guy, i recommend taking his class (but don't expect many a's unless your papers are worthy to be published)!"
134,120910,5.0,4.0,it is like listening to a machine talk-- he is that well spoken and articulate
135,120910,2.5,4.0,No Comments
136,120910,3.5,4.0,Tell him that W.B. Yeats sucks and see what he says...
137,120911,3.5,3.0,"He is a unique Professor. If you talk to anyone else in the Department they will agree. However, he is the kind of professor that teaches you how to succeed in any assignment or class you will take. You may hate his teaching style, but you will never regret taking the course. He is very helpful and genuinely cares about his students."
138,120911,3.0,3.0,Beware. You must buy in. He's brilliant. Manipulative. Engaging. Office hours are a must. You HAVE to attend every class. Will change the way you think. Love it or hate it. Good luck
139,120911,4.0,5.0,"You need to take at least one class with him before you graduate. Changes your life. You'll definitely be exhausted from the work and your existential crises, but it's entirely worth it because you gain so much from the experience."
140,120911,2.5,4.0,"Will definitely change the way you think, but the fact that he's allowed to call this a politics class is a joke, its nothing but philosophy so be prepared. Complete lack of communication over what your expected to do in class and I have no idea how he determines grades. Also no idea where they even found this guy."
141,120911,3.5,4.0,"This man is CRAZY. Truly the smartest man I've ever known, but absolutely crazy. Took our class to the Buddhist Monastery a couple of times.His lectures are very impromptu and random, and participation is mandatory. Your final paper is 50% of your final grade, and he requires you to visit the Comm Center five times. You either love him or hate him."
142,120911,5.0,5.0,"One of the most inspiring teachers imaginable, he is brilliant. He is the most passionate teacher possible. He soon became my hero."
143,120911,4.0,5.0,"Rollercoaster ride. One day you'll want to strangle him, the next you'll want to kiss him in the mouth. It's effective, though. You'll stretch muscles in your brain you didn't even know you had, and you'll be proud of your paper, in the end. Although you might also go insane. Still, everybody should ride a rollercoaster, at least once."
144,120911,2.0,5.0,"If you want the course outlined and power pointed, go elsewhere. If you want to understand what a college education is supposed to be, enroll.  I really had to think for myself.  Until I did, he held back.  This kind of faith in my potential I've never experienced before."
145,120911,1.5,5.0,"You can never get a straight answer from this guy. Even something as simple as the syllabus was 8 pages long, single-spaced. I find this incredibly hypocritical given the restrictive word limits he places on you. You could ask him for the time and he would ask ""What do u think it is? How do u feel?"""
146,120911,4.5,4.0,"W&L's most engaging and devoted professor. He will push you to the edge of your potential. He will push you to seek out the little details to piece together the big picture of a liberal education. If you go along for the ride and work hard, your time with Eddie V will be invaluable."
147,120911,4.5,4.0,"In his class I grew personally, thought creatively, and learned to look at academic matters differently. Participation is a must to do well, but it's worth the effort. His unorthodoxy may be intimidating, but he really cares about the students who bother to care. A piece of advice: don't let his personal appeal distract from his academic intellect."
148,120911,1.0,4.0,No need to enroll in this joker's class unless you one day aspire to be a professor and want to learn how not to teach a course.
149,120911,4.5,4.0,"W&L's fairest and finest professor. His class is the epitome of a liberal arts education and you will benefit immensely by taking it. If you work hard, he will reward you. Incredible."
150,120911,2.5,5.0,"Do not take him, terrible"
151,120911,4.0,5.0,"Eddie V is terrifying, and he knows the school thinks he's some kind of genius / academic cult leader.  He plays into that, and lets the students that worship him scare the ones that don't into really reading and working hard.  One on one, though, he's a very nice, very brilliant man who can make difficult ideas clear.  Give him a chance and work!"
152,120911,2.0,5.0,Velasquez is a ****. I dont see why people like him so much. He loves to cut students down and embarrass them. Not an easy class has random reading quizes every day. Have to be a suck up to get good grades
153,120911,4.5,5.0,"This man is divine. This class will change your life. I am so much happier because I took this class. He made me realize why I was at a university and what I cared about. If you want to figure out what education can REALLY be, take one of his classes. I am not kidding."
154,120911,4.5,4.0,The only thing keeping me sane and happy at this insane school was this professor's classes. The pinnacle of what a liberal arts education should be and too often isn't. Velasquez is the best prof to write papers for; he points you in the right direction and lets you come to the important conclusions on your own. An intellectual delight.
155,120911,4.0,2.0,"Previous comments make him sound like some sort of cult leader.  He's very good, but only revolutionary if you've never thought analytically for yourself before.  Definitely take the class, because he really is great.  Just don't drink the juice..."
156,120911,5.0,5.0,loved his class! he really cares about his students and reveals to them a whole new world.
157,120911,2.5,4.0,"Very interesting material. He can be satanic, but still enlightening at the same time. There is a quiz of some form every class. The class is conducted, in great deal, using the Socratic method."
158,120911,4.5,3.0,"He's not an easy B+ as a previous commentator mentioned.  It is, however, entirely possible to do well in his class if you show a genuine interest, do ALL of the work, and put in serious effort.  He isn't clear at all; I rated him high in that area because his lack of clarity is thought provoking.  He teaches you how to LEARN.  Take his classes."
159,120911,5.0,4.0,He is simply one of the finest teachers I have ever had.
160,120911,4.0,5.0,This was a mind altering experience.  WOW!  You can't go to Dubluenell without a course from this guy.
161,120911,3.5,2.0,"He comes across as harsh.  I almost left after the first day.  But then you realize that he's not about making friends, or being popular.  he is demanding and strict.  If you stick with him, you will do well.  He doesn't use low grades to make himself tough, as most professors do.  He rewards the student if she does well.  Excellent professor."
162,120911,4.0,5.0,"Let me put it this way.  I know of no other professor who has had songs written for him, or poetry.  This is the kind of love the guy inspires.  His courses are not described by the subject matter.  They simply go by the &quot;Velasquez&quot; course.  He makes the difference.  He makes the material come to life."
163,120911,4.0,5.0,I spent only one month with the guy in the summer program and now I know I want to go to not other school.  The moment you walk into his class you realize that you are in another world.  I cant even describe it.  I suppose life changing is appropriate.
164,120911,5.0,5.0,"Should professors be allowed to post negative ratings for colleagues they hate&#63;  The negative ratings found here sound like the zealot feminist in politics who can't bear to acknowledge that Eddie Vee is the single best professor at WLU, and who is loved by his students because they recognize excellence."
165,120911,4.0,5.0,eddie v. is the man. you cannot be afraid to speak up and defend your views in his class otherwise you fail. those who enjoy sitting in the back and just taking notes during their classes will definitely come up with the short end of the stick with this professor.
166,120911,2.5,4.0,"The most interesting class I took. His Law&Society Class love him hands down and can't wait to have him for real in '06. He's engaging, respectful, thought provocative...I'm definitely taking him in '06"
167,120911,1.5,3.0,"as you can see below, he has his group of zealots that will forever sing his praises and refer to those who disagree as idiots.  i would call my experience with him more &quot;annoying&quot; than &quot;difficult.&quot;  it's not tough to get a B+ if you put in the effort.  but don't expect an A unless you're willing to kiss his ass and do office hours every other day."
168,120911,4.0,5.0,"There is an easy formula to determine where negative ratings come from.  Those students who want to be pandered, or think they deserve a B just for showing up, are those who complain.  If you really want to learn, seek an unique experience, life changing, Then this is the man for you.  He is envied by all, especially people in his own department."
169,120911,4.5,4.0,"People that give him negative ratings are people who are either: 1) too dumb to keep up or more commonly, 2) didn't listen the first day. It was the first class I ever genuinely looked forward to every single class. An amazing guy."
170,120911,2.0,4.0,I hated this class! Velasquez is intimidating and arrogant. I think I would have liked Political Philosophy with another teacher. Plus he made us come in a lot for two hours when the class was only supposed to be one and not for movies either. Don't take Velasquez! You'll regret it if you do.
171,120911,4.5,5.0,"Eddie V is, in short, a god... riveting. Absolutely amazing professor who makes the material come alive. No other class will compare. Ecstasy for the mind and soul."
172,120911,4.5,5.0,"Velasquez is an amazing professor. He really makes himself available to the students, and although a course with him can lower your GPA, what you actually learn far surpasses any damage there. Everyone should take a class from this man before graduating."
173,120911,4.5,5.0,The last rating shows that it is hard to be indifferent.  That kind of venom though won't stop students from flocking to his classes.  He makes most professor at Dubuenel look like amateurs.  Those who can measure up should stay clear of his courses.  Like the idiot in the last rating.
174,120911,1.0,5.0,"Horrible, Horrible, Terrible, Degrading professor.  I hated, hated, hated his teaching style and the way he conducted his class."
175,120911,5.0,3.0,"Other POL profs hate him, but that's out of jealousy- watch his office hours.  There's a LINE.  Other profs have no line of students waiting to see them, I can tell you that.  The strangest, most wonderful learning experience I've ever met."
176,120911,4.5,5.0,"No words match up to this amazing man.  He is off the charts, teaching like no other person. I will never be the same. Its like going through a religious conversion."
177,120911,5.0,3.0,"The freaking man.  Eddie V is unlike any other professor, ever, and he will make politics come alive for you in strange and magical ways.  Take this class only if you can think creatively and can stand a lot of weirdness."
178,120911,4.5,4.0,People shouldn't be allowed to graduate without taking a Velasquez class. Most challenging and caring professor at this school. Contrary to his antics on the first day of class he really is a very open and concerned professor. I BIG heart Velasquez.
179,120911,4.5,5.0,"Velasquez is an amazing professor, and his class is one of the best i've ever taken.  It really does change your life and make you look at everything differently"
180,120911,4.5,5.0,"So powerful is his teaching, that envious people try to undermine his methods.  I am sure it turns the stomach of other teachers to learn that nothing seems to deter students from flocking to his classes.  The ONLY show in town, folks!"
181,120911,4.5,5.0,"Sex for the brain.  Scared me to death, but only because he wants to make it clear that the standards are the highest.  Once in the lifetime experience."
182,120911,5.0,4.0,"absolutely amazing man, completely brilliant, makes you question everything youve ever been taught. he scared the crap out of me at first, but id go through it all over again, he just pushes and pushes your mind, best professor ive ever had"
183,120911,4.0,5.0,Unique is the word that comes to mind.  No professor at Washington and Lee compares.  I would never have taken political philosophy were it not for my friends.  I will never regret it.  The course changed my life.
184,120911,4.5,4.0,"The best teacher at W&L if you are willing to learn what he wants to teach you.  If you avoid taking his classes while majoring in Politics, you should be ashamed.  His love of political philosophy exceeds any of his colleagues' interest in their field."
185,120911,4.5,5.0,"A Greek GOD!  He is unlike any other teacher you will ever, ever have.  Love him or hate him.  You can't be indifferent.  The stupid conventions of learning go out the window.  Aclass of his own."
186,120911,4.0,5.0,"Awesome!  He does bring pop culture into his courses.  But he does this to make connections between real life and education.  Whoever claims his courses are not substantive, has never taken a course from him."
187,120911,5.0,4.0,Finds a way to make political philosphy come alive.  Not for everyone. Those who want to conventional path should stay away.
188,120911,2.0,3.0,Stupid stupid stupid stuff... relating Matrix and Harry Potter to Politics&#63;  International relations are all about friendship and personal relationships&#63; Does this guy teach anything&#63; Completely worthless courses...

191,120911,5.0,3.0,"This man is the reincarnation of those about whom he teaches. As such, he is borderline insane, but nothing short of genius. If you take his class, be prepared to get your mind peeled. It is an amazing experience, if you have the energy and the effort."
192,120911,4.5,5.0,It is impossible to describe this man.  An experience you will never forget.
193,120911,4.0,3.0,"great class!  participate in class and go by his office, you'll do fine."
194,120911,5.0,5.0,"He is one of the smartest men I have ever met and also one of the nicest.  He forces you to ENGAGE the material, and if you do you won't regret it!"
195,120911,1.0,4.0,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE
196,120911,1.0,5.0,Awful teacher who likes to humiliate students.
197,120911,5.0,3.0,I love this man
198,120911,5.0,4.0,i too have had him cry in my class--and i love him for it!  you must show that you are serious.  he takes his work seriously and thinks you should too.  if you do your work you will be amazed by him and what you learn.  slackers need not apply.
199,120911,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors I've ever had!
200,120911,3.0,4.0,actually cried during class discussion about the reading and had to leave. very passionate about political philosophy. got in my face about not talking enough during class and threatened to fail me for that reason.

202,1138768,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kester is an amazing teacher. Even on Zoom, he was continually engaging and interest in his students. The downside of his class is that it is test heavy. He gives three tests each worth 30% of your grade. These are case study based, so it is difficult to prepare for them. Use his office hours to get hints!"
203,1138768,5.0,3.0,"Funny guy. Super nice. Incredibly helpful in office hours, but may go off on tangent life stories, which are typically pretty cool. I would recommend anyone in the C School take Kester especially you Ibanker types. I missed a week for a funeral and Kester sent me an email saying how I did well on an exam and that I was missed in class. Truly Great!"
204,1138768,5.0,3.0,Great Professor!
205,1138768,5.0,3.0,"This review is for the BUS 355 Cases in Corporate Finance. The class was extremely helpful and Prof. Kester was very kind, always had something very insightful or educational to say. A good balance of &quot;book&quot; contents and &quot;application&quot; as well. Workload is fairly heavy as you must do weekly critiques and spreadsheets for cases. Highly recommend tho!"
206,1138768,4.0,4.0,"Absolutely loved him, but tough class. Would easily take another class with Professor Kester!"
207,1138768,5.0,3.0,One of the most helpful and nice professors I have had at W&amp;L. He was so easy to access outside of class and was incredibly helpful. Genuinely cares about all of his students succeeding and understanding the material. Amazing and I recommend him to everyone.
208,1138768,5.0,3.0,"Kester goes out of his way to make sure every student understands the material. He will meet with you outside of his office hours if needed and really cares about his students. His lectures are clear and so are the assignments and exams, which are few. By far my favorite professor at Washington and Lee. Highly recommend his classes."
209,1138768,5.0,3.0,"One of the best Professors I've had! He is nice, caring, helpful, makes class interesting, teaches you useful stuff, and is willing to go way out of his way to help students. Definitely take him!"
210,1138768,4.5,2.0,Professor Kester is a great lecturer and makes finance interesting by using case method of learning. He is always available for help in office hours and really wants students to understand the material. He is passionate about the subject and has a lot of real world and teaching experience to back it up.
211,1138768,5.0,1.0,"Incredible professor, is very clear and gives entertaining lectures.  His mannerisms are hilarious, we walks around aimlessly while lecturing, bumps into things, and changes course.  Like a real life cable tv screen saver.  He uses case studies instead of a textbook which I found refreshing. Makes the topic very understandable.  Highly recommend."
212,1138768,5.0,3.0,"He is always available, and he uses cases to teach students about the topic. He actually got me interested in investment. MUST TAKE HIM."
213,1138768,5.0,3.0,"Professor Kester has been my favorite teacher at W&L. He demonstrates a genuine interest in the subject and really enjoys teaching it, which makes understanding the topic easier. He's available for office hours when you need and is constantly reminding people to utilize them. If you can, take this class with Kester"
214,1138768,5.0,1.0,"One of the most interesting and best professors at W&L. You learn how to approach finance, not just the tools and language of finance. Take kester"
215,1138768,5.0,3.0,A god among men. All bow before King George.
216,1138768,4.5,3.0,"Awesome Professor. His classes are interesting, tests are fair and all in all a very good person."
217,1138768,5.0,3.0,"Hands down, best professor I have had. Engaging, interesting, intelligent, and full of great stories and useful information. Definitely someone to get to know outside of class as well!"
218,1138768,5.0,1.0,Kester is a great teacher. Makes lectures interesting. Id recommend him
219,1138768,4.5,2.0,George is the dogs boll*x. Superb lecturer.
220,1138768,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher. Really interesting and you learn a lot in the class.
221,1138768,5.0,4.0,Professor Kester is the man. He has awesome stories and funny jokes to go along with an effective and engaging teaching style. Probably one of the best professors I've ever had. He's legit.
222,1138768,4.5,4.0,great prof and lecturer.  class is strongly case based so attendance and participation are essential.  gives very few A's but you will learn a lot.  take him.
223,352348,2.0,3.0,"Be ready to go fast. HW and quizzes to cushion your grade tho. STUDY. I believe she's passionate but passive-aggressive (sometimes rude). Even as an extrovert, I dreaded and feared speaking in class. She will publically humiliate you and claim she's &quot;not calling you out.&quot; Just looking for FDR? Consider another lang. I'll stay bc I like Japanese."
224,352348,3.0,3.0,"This review is for Professor Ikeda's LIT 222 class regarding manga and anime. Easy professor and content, but it was her first time teaching this course so the course criteria and organization were unclear. Digresses for 25 mins+ regularly about her personal experience, which sometimes makes me wonder if I am going to an autobiography, not class."
225,352348,5.0,4.0,"There is a LOT of reading, no doubt about it. In weeks with shorter readings, they generally contain a lot of metaphor and are harder to get through. That being said, it's worth it. Learning the tea procedure was really fun (if a bit stressful) and really, if you just read everything you're assigned, you'll do fine. Take this course!"
226,352348,2.5,5.0,It's tough enough to write a Full page on a five-line poem (the whole semester is about writing on various themessymbolismimagery that show up through hundreds of often Super short poems we read). But the worst part is that we also need to know the historical period and context each of the poems (hundreds of em!) were written inare about.
227,352348,2.5,4.0,"Not a fan.  Her teaching style is to do something once, explaining it poorly in the process, and then expecting us to understand and copy exactly.  Her lecture style is abrasive and somehow pretentious.  However, one-on-one time is incredibly helpful with her, so if you take any of her classes, go to office hours."
228,352348,4.5,3.0,she has facebook haha
229,352348,5.0,4.0,"Not an easy class by any means.  Reading quizzes on every book and you lose points for absences.  She does go out of her way to make sure people understand what's going on though, and her English is flawless, which is uncommon for language professors.  Not easy, but a good learning experience."
230,352348,4.0,4.0,"Prepare yourself for a very intense teacher who does not mess around. That said, she is very passionate about Japanese language and is easy to understand, unlike other Asian Language teachers. Class involves a lot of homework and memorization, but you'll find yourself amazed at how much Japanese you can speak."
231,352348,5.0,3.0,"languages are never easy, but she makes it relatively painless.  she's a stickler about absences, but she genuinely wants her students to learn and do well. not too much homework, tests aren't bad. really nice lady, had us all over for a dinner!"
232,352348,1.5,4.0,Her lectures are the most unorganized things i've ever listened to (and that includes blackout ramblings).  This was supposed to be an easy class and that couldn't be further from the truth.  I easily put as much work into this as two classes that are in my major.
233,352348,2.0,4.0,"Poetry - Only 1/2 way through course, but not the easy interesting class advertised. Work load is huge and nor proportional to the course level. Expect 100-200 pages of reading/week that you will have to honor sign for. Readings are all due at once, but may not be lectured for a week or 2 later. Lectures are disjointed and unclear. BS level is high"
234,352348,5.0,1.0,The best professor I have ever had.  She has helped me with many things beyond the realm of Japanese.  She helped me make some hard decisions and the school is lucky to have a professor like her
235,352348,5.0,1.0,"Awesome, easy, and very helpful.  Really cool cultural tidbits in class, too.  I was very pleased to have taken her Japanese Lit. in trans."
236,352348,5.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher, always willing to help.  Truly cares about the Japanese language.  Assigns way too much work though and is not a class for slackers.  If you do your work and study you should do fine."
237,2119775,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor. Very relatable and excellent at making difficult material manageable. Greatly cares about his students, and very fair."
238,929888,5.0,4.0,The most wonderful professor at W&amp;L. So worth taking if you're at all interested in studio art.
239,929888,3.0,3.0,"Don't take this class if you're not willing to be adaptable and accept whatever odd assignment you're given, or if you can't handle a slightly chaotic work environment without clear grading/assignment guidelines."
240,929888,5.0,3.0,Amazing class. Absolutely would take again.
241,929888,5.0,3.0,"If you can fit this professor or any of her classes into your schedule, whether it's for credit or not, you shouldn't hesitate to do so! Every class I've had with this professor has been an instant favorite. I learn and improve so much every time! She's brilliant and inspiring as a mentor. She brings out the best in everyone's artistic ability!"
242,929888,5.0,2.0,"Beavers is the best hands down. Whether you are good at drawing or have never drawn before taking the class, you will improve drastically because of the way she teaches. She is fair and an excellent professor all around. Take her if you can."
243,929888,4.5,3.0,"She is a great professor, for experienced artists and newbies alike. Even if you think you can't draw, take her class - you'll be amazed at what you can do. She teaches technique, and it's really not too intense. The first class we drew blindfolded. Homework load isn't that demanding. If you're concerned about your grade, just ask how to improve."
244,929888,4.0,4.0,"She does grade based on natural ability sometimes. but if you think about it most professors do. If you are naturally a horrible writer and you take an english class you don't get graded based on improvement, so why should it be any different with an art class&#63; If you are genuinely interested in art then you will get alot out of her class"
245,929888,4.5,4.0,"Leigh Ann's class completely changed my attitude towards drawing. I entered this class thinking it'd be a breeze, but it was a real challenge and I could feel my skills improving every class period. She gives excellent advice, this was definitely the best ar class I've ever taken. She made me want to be an art major."
246,929888,1.0,5.0,Not a fair grader at all! Don't take.
247,929888,1.0,5.0,Don't take her unless you are an excellent artist. After attending every class and completing every assignment above what was asked she still gave me a B. When I asked why she responded that doing all the work does not necessarily mean an A. Grades only on natural ability.
248,929888,2.0,3.0,"Only take this class if you are good at drawing. After receiving a B in this class, I emailed Beavers asking her for a justification for my grade. I didn't miss a class or an assignment, and she claimed that  I improved drastically. My downfall, she said, was that my overall ability was less than the other students. Not how art classes should be."
249,929888,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Beavers is part of the reason I'm going to focus on printmaking for my senior thesis (and maybe for the rest of my career). I almost considered taking an AB hour class for her! The course is great, but unlike the drawing class there is quite a bit of outside studio time required."
250,929888,5.0,2.0,A great class. Very little work outside of class.
251,929888,5.0,2.0,"Beavers is really great, and will tell you that your drawing of cones and cubes is beautiful. My skills definitely improved-- owing to the well designed, though easy going class. Not much outside work, though we did keep a sketchbook."
252,1325156,4.0,3.0,"darznik is amazing. one of the smartest people out there. talented, brilliant, all around incredible, and she has a sense of humor too"
253,1325156,5.0,4.0,She's great.  Down to earth and really helpful.  I'm a creative writing minor but hadn't written personal essays or memoir before.  I wasn't sure if I'd like writing about myself but she pretty much makes the class.
254,1325156,5.0,4.0,"I am absolutely in love with her. Great professor, intelligent beyond comprehension, and always willing to lend a hand. Discussions are always interesting and thought provoking, and she does a good job to remain impartial to any one side."
255,1325156,5.0,3.0,"I am actually obsessed with Professor Darznik! She is such an engaging, intelligent, and genuine teacher who will go out of her way to help you and make sure that you produce the best work possible. She truly cares and wants her students to succeed. Friendly, fun, and approachable, she is definitely one of the best here! One word: AMAZING!"
256,1325156,5.0,4.0,"Wonderful teacher. She is pretty funny and is happy to joke around with college kids in the beginning of class. Nonetheless is a very impressive author herself, and a very apt discussion leader. Highly recommend taking anything with her. She is well worth your tuition."
257,1325156,5.0,3.0,"Easily the best teacher here.  So smart, helpful, fun, inspiring, genuine.  Awesome."
258,1325156,4.5,3.0,"Really great professor, obviously enjoys teaching, although she can be a little disorganized at times. That said, it is hard to manage a creative writing class since it's a little less straightforward than other classes, and she does a really great job. Great writer, too."
259,1325156,5.0,3.0,"Professor Darznik is an amazing teacher.  Brilliant, passionate, and very, very helpful.  Creative writing is very hard to teach, but she really works with each student.  Loved her."
260,1325156,2.5,4.0,Meh - she was so busy pushing her book she was very distracted in class.
261,1325156,5.0,3.0,"Good class, very nice teacher. She's very helpful and is very accessible."
262,1325156,5.0,2.0,"Take Darznik now, because she's a literary genius and sure to publish a compelling enough novel to quit teaching and go into full time writing soon. Extremely easy to get along with, great lecturer, better discussion facilitator, and she assigns interesting works to boot (no more dusty Victorian stuff). Just, you know, be a good student."
263,1325156,5.0,3.0,"She's attentive, funny, and scarily smart.  Fantastic reading list and great class discussion.  Her comments on papers are spot on.  Wonderful professor."
264,1325156,2.5,3.0,"She definitely knows her stuff, but her organization and communication is somewhat lacking. After about a week we completely abandoned the syllabus, and then it became increasingly difficult to keep track of assignments, due dates, and the like. Her specific criticism was good, but her classroom instruction was pretty vague. Not too bad."
265,1325156,4.5,3.0,"She's a great teacher, and she really wants to help you with your work. I have never gotten along with my English professors but she doesn't let her personal opinion get in the way of what she's teaching. If you take her class, you will see different perspectives and learn to write with a lot more clarity. She's great."
266,1325156,5.0,5.0,She's a great professor with an exciting background and future. She's a brilliant writer and is very willing to work with students personally to guide them in that direction. Her course was interesting and her delivery of the material led to exciting discussion.
267,2240615,5.0,3.0,"Really enjoyed Professor Hagen's Ancient Roman History class.  She is really passionate about the subject matter, gives interesting and engaging lectures, and cares about her students.  I really appreciated that she addressed problematic topics that are often overlooked in Roman history, such as the treatment of women, slavery, and racism."
268,929896,4.5,2.0,I took many spanish classes with Senora. She is such a great lady and cares about the students and really wants us to understand the language. She tries to make class interactive by putting us into groups each day. That is my only complaint- groups get old. Just show up and do the homework and you will do fine
269,929896,4.0,2.0,"Awesome Professor. Her class is enjoyable, understandable, and fun.  She is lenient when you need it and very helpful.  Take your spanish with this teacher."
270,929896,5.0,1.0,Easiest Spanish Teacher ever.  If get in this class you are very lucky had a different teacher for 161 much harder and I stuided much more and got a full grade lower.
271,929896,4.5,2.0,"Profesora is the best. She's totally funny and always asks us about our fiestas y cervezas. The class is well paced and the tests are always pretty easy (and similar to the review). In class there are some silly skits and group work, but the emphasis is on grammar and she usually explains it well in English and Spanish. A super lady!"
272,565356,5.0,3.0,"I love Fregnac-Clave! She is a great teacher, but she never makes her students work too hard. She is very understanding of the W&amp;L student body, and she is one of the few professors who literally does not care if you skip class (as long as you are doing well). She is always available to help outside of class! Make sure to do corrections, they help!"
273,565356,2.0,4.0,"She is very disorganized. She constantly changes the syllabus, sometimes forgetting when she cancelled homework. Her grading scale is quite disorganized and there is no way to really know your grade until the midterm and final grades. She expects perfection, but does let you correct and re-correct until you get there. Overall, would not take again."
274,565356,1.5,4.0,"She is not clear or helpful with what is due.  She lost one of my assignments that she knew I turned in and made me redo it, honestly do not take her if you don't have to.   If you must take her for an FDR, don't get behind.  Make flashcards, know your verbs, and do all the homework over until you understand it completely."
275,565356,3.5,4.0,She is a very patient and sweet woman. I took French 264 with her so I thought I would take this class with her too. bad idea. I knew she was a hard grader but figured it couldn't be that bad since she let us do corrections and was very helpful in 264. We had 2-3 page papers due almost twice a week. take a different professor for 273. Too much work
276,565356,3.5,2.0,"I don't know why everyone has a problem with her, she really is simple and pretty sweet! She lets you revise everything, and is an easy grader. Just do what she asks, and you'll be good. "
277,565356,3.0,5.0,"She is nice... but not a great teacher. She will give you useless reading and will make you work a lot. I feel like some of my skills did improve but at a very high costs, especially for a non-major"
278,565356,3.0,4.0,"Fregnac-Clave's class was not enjoyable at all, even though I love French. She constantly changed the syllabus, so deadlines for assignments were never clear. Even though she never gave any official tests, one day she gave us a three page short-answer ""pop quiz"" in class! One day she yelled at our class for making grammar mistakes in our essays."
279,565356,2.0,4.0,"She is very nice and friendly, however I would not recommend this class. She assigns copious amounts of work that she expects you to complete. She expects you to understand concepts on your own, and doesn't help you understand them. It is manageable, but try to take another teacher if you can"
280,565356,3.5,3.0,"I like her. She's spunky and funny, but she goes through material quickly and doesn't always explain until everyone understands."
281,565356,4.0,5.0,"I don't know why anyone would say this professor never smiles! I've taken 3 or 4 courses with her and she definitely has a sense of humor. Yes, she assigns a great deal of work (not a good class for slackers), but if you're willing to actually learn some French you won't be disappointed. Uses literature as well as films, tv, etc. Overall great prof"
282,565356,3.5,4.0,"She has not given an exam in any of the three classes I have taken with her, but there is a LOT of work.  Do not plan on taking her if you don't want to do a lot of reading and writing in French.  Make sure you find out what is collected and what is not...don't try and do everything or you will never finish!"
283,565356,4.0,4.0,"She represents french women at their best: lots of class, lots of finesse but very cold and strict. She never smiles. However You will end up with a very good level in french if you take her class. If you are not that crazy about french avoid her class. Too much work."
284,1325165,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Dan is awesome! His class is pretty hard, but if you do the work and study hard you can get a good grade. He is really helpful and willing to work with students outside of class."
285,1325165,3.0,4.0,"His class is very hard, because he expects a lot. If watching someone write on a board for 55 min is your learning style then he's your man. Really personable, but not great at explaining things and uses a LOT of proofs"
286,1325165,4.0,4.0,Learned a lot in this class. Much attention to detail of example problems in class. Review questions are very similar to exam questions. Do your work and go to office hours.
287,1325165,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Dan is a teacher who really wants you to succeed. You learn a lot at a tough pace. His tests are hard. He will do everything in his power to help you understand, but he will not give good grades. you gotta earn them."
288,1325165,4.5,3.0,Dr. Dan is the man. Do your homework and studyguides and you'll be good to go. It's not hard to get an A.
289,1325165,3.0,4.0,"Very smart and cool. Committed to helping the lost. Always available in office hours. If you can learn to solve problems the way he likes it, then an A+ is definitely reachable"
290,1325165,2.5,3.0,"I had trouble following some of his lectures, but overall he was clear. He teaches simple examples in class, and then expects students to solve fairly complex problems on the test. As a science major I didn?t have too much trouble with the class but if you aren?t that great/interested in math find another professor. Overall a good professor."
291,1325165,3.5,4.0,No Comments
292,1325165,5.0,3.0,He's a very good looking man whose passion for mathematics makes his class fun.  He adds jokes and vocabulary words to his lectures that are dorky but perfectly entertaining.  He's easy to approach during office hours and is patient enough to take the time to explain the solution fully.
293,1325165,2.5,4.0,"Very difficult to follow. Young, almost too smart for his own good.  Although he is open during tutoring hours, his explanations are just as difficult to understand in 1-on-1 tutoring as in class.  AVOID."
294,565361,5.0,2.0,"If you're looking for a course that's closer to a book club, take Brodsky. She'll definitely know if you haven't done the readings, but as long as you do them, you'll be fine. ID tests can be tricky, but you REALLY have to screw up on them to get a bad grade. Make sure you have a clear thesis on papers. Also, the syllabus is more of a question mark"
295,565361,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Brodsky is knowledgeable and passionate about Russian literature. We read a wide variety of famous works from multiple perspectives, and classes were discussions of the novels instead of lectures. As long as you contribute to class discussions, read the books, and write college-level papers with clear thesis statements, you will succeed."
296,565361,3.5,2.0,"She loves Russian Literature. Changed the syllabus like 3 or 4 times which was kinda weird and we didn't read half of the books she had originally assigned. Doesn't really discuss the books in class, more just explains the history behind it."
297,565361,3.0,1.0,"Easy class. She &quot;doesn't believe in penalties&quot; because Literature is supposed to be enjoyed. Lectures are interesting, she knows her stuff. But either I'm a really good writer and my writing is perfect, or she just doesn't really give very much feedback. Make sure to read the books. You WILL fail if you don't. Don't let the midterm fool you."
298,565361,5.0,2.0,One of my favorite teachers at W&L.  Extremely subtle sense of humor.  Pay close attention to her lectures and you won't regret it.
299,565361,2.0,1.0,The laziest professor I have ever had.  She is not the least bit interested in teaching the Russian language or helping her students go to Russia.  She is only interested in literature and making cheap political points about Chechnya.
300,565361,4.0,3.0,"&quot;Broccoli is not compatible with Communism&quot; This class was such fun! She is very easy-going, but  still expects the very best you can do"
301,565361,4.5,3.0,"Brodsky is without a doubt the single best professor I've had at W&L. I have taken 6 classes with her and have learned more from her than I ever could have imagined. But, as others have noted, she's very Russian."
302,565361,4.0,2.0,"I adore Prof. Brodsky. She's brilliant, smart, funny, and passionate about her subject matter. As long as you do the reading and make an honest attempt, you'll do fine. She's a little eccentric, but wonderful."
303,565361,4.5,4.0,"She's Russian...nuff said. Tough, but fair. Just do your work and you're fine. Quite a brilliant woman, actually. The only thing is...she knows it. Heh- Advanced Russian loves you Anna!"
304,565361,5.0,4.0,"the funniest, smartest, most imformative professor! the books are great and the professors lectures are even better!"
305,565361,5.0,4.0,"Wonderful! Absolutely the most fascinating, and interesting course there has ever been!"
306,565361,1.5,5.0,"Run and do not look back! i said run and do not look back!Mean, frustrated, tense. A wonderful person outside class and away from campus! Please take my word for it, avoid the choice i made!"
307,1210482,4.0,4.0,"I loved Professor Horowitz. She is funny, kind and really cares about her students and subject matter. However, I did find her to be a really difficult grader. I went to office hours multiple times and worked through papers which she still gave A-. She's a great teacher- just be ready to be a little frustrated with grades. And PARTICIPATE in class!"
308,1210482,4.0,4.0,"Professor Horowitz is a great professor but I found her to be a tough grader when it came to papers. She loves participation, however you can get away without doing most of the reading"
309,1210482,4.0,4.0,"awesome teacher, very respected (department head of women and gender studies i believe), lots and lots of reading, participation is key, and once you get to know what she wants out of a paper youll be fine. Grade went up significantly from beginning of term to end."
310,1210482,5.0,3.0,"Professor Horowitz really emphasizes fairness in grading, class participation, and class discussion.  She is really passionate about the subject matter and her lectures are interesting and engaging."
311,1210482,5.0,1.0,"Fantastic prof in her first year at W&L. Helpful, engaging, funny, knowledgeable, everything you could want in a history prof."
312,2521201,5.0,3.0,"So glad I took multi with her! Your grade hinges on mastery tests but you get multiple attempts for them &amp; you pass them if you at least show you understand how to solve the problem even if your final answer isn't right. She's super patient &amp; sweet in office hours, she'll work with you for as much time as you need on whatever topics you're stuck on"
313,2521201,1.0,3.0,"Horrible professor, very petty about grading, will take off points even if the answer is correct, passive-aggressive with her students, does not teach the material, you must self learn everything, horrible horrible horrible, definitely avoid, worst professor at w&amp;l, mastery testing is nice but she will not give you credit if the work is not her way"
314,2521201,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Swindle loves teaching and loves math which goes along way. She's very nice, approachable, and is committed to her students. Her Mastery testing system allows students who aren't great at Math get a good grade. It's easy to get lost bcuz she doesn't lecture that much, but she's helpful if you make an effort to get help. Would recommend."
315,2521201,4.0,2.0,"Prof Swindle is really young and definitely has still lots to learn as a professor, but she really loves math and cares about her students. The tests come straight from the homework problem, and the &quot;mastery&quot; grading system gives you the chance of getting decent grades even if you're not too good at math."
316,2521201,4.0,2.0,"Eeeeeeek. Prof Swindle may not have been the best lecturer, but her grading system was pretty fair i.e. she would round up an A- to A if you showed up to class. Tests were pretty easy so long as you did stuff in the book outside of class and questions often mirrored book questions she'd assign for hw. Eeeeeeeeek."
317,2521201,3.0,3.0,"Not my recommendation for your Calc 2 prof. I had an A because I'd learned most of this before, but ended with a B because the final was ridiculous (we'd never seen some of the concepts before in class). Weekly HW quizzes. Not great at explaining some problems. She tries though, and is super enthusiastic. A good mathematician, but trivial grader."
318,2521201,5.0,5.0,"Professor Swindle comes to class everyday enthusiastic about teaching calculus. However, I spent more time reviewing this semester for her class then I did for any other of my classes, and still got a C. If you want an A, you won't find it with her. But if you want to not sleep in a math class and actually learn something, she's your professor."
319,2521201,3.0,5.0,Nice person and good mathematician but doesnt know how to teach the material.
320,2521201,1.0,3.0,"She did not know the material for this course and was not good at explaining questions. Her lessons are tb examples, so if you are confused, you can't look there for help. She couldn't do qs she didnt practice before. Even if the answers are right in the test, she took off points for not doing it her way. Quizzes are every Monday."
321,2521201,1.0,4.0,"I am not exaggerating when I say that Swindle is the worst math teacher I have ever had. She makes classes extremely boring and they are mandatory, though you would be much better off skipping class and watching a khan academy video. Spare yourself and pass on this professor if at all possible."
322,1480824,3.0,2.0,"Class was not difficult, but rather boring. If you kept up with your assignments it was easily manageable, if not terribly exciting."
323,2752635,4.0,3.0,"She is patient, kind, and understanding with her students. She is not very eccentric or anything, just a nice professor. Relies heavily on the textbook, which can be boring (but expected, it's a language class, we need the grammar points), but elaborates well when we do not understand. Easy to communicate with and always willing to help. Thumbs up."
324,716934,5.0,2.0,"Helpful, personable, extremely available. She could have been more rigorous..but the class was sort of oddly split between mathy computer science majors/other math people and non-mathy people trying to avoid calculus. So she's flexible and good at adjusting to her audience. Strongly recommended."
325,716934,3.5,4.0,"Professor Crowley is an angel. She is extremely helpful and is willing to even meet with you outside of class/office hours to help you. Tough grader, but definitely takes your effort in consideration at the end of the semester."
326,716934,3.5,4.0,"The subject matter of her course is exceptionally difficult, she does a better job of dumbing down the material to non-mathlete levels pretty well. I had no idea what was going on most of the time, but she will take pity on you with her grading if you go to her office hours often enough."
327,716934,4.5,5.0,"Very difficult class. She is a little quirky, but very very willing to help students. Lots of office hours that are very beneficial to learning the material. Required class for math majors, freshman think it will be easier than calc, it isnt"
328,716934,1.5,5.0,Most clueless professor I've ever encountered.
329,716934,1.0,4.0,worst teacher ever
330,716934,4.5,3.0,"An amazing person as well as teacher!  Though her hw is extremely long if you wait until the last minute, she is always available to help."
331,716934,5.0,2.0,"Very helpful teacher.  Tests aren't that hard and are graded really easily for partial credit where it doesn't even really exist.  Homework isn't bad, but it is graded for corectness, but it's also pretty light."
332,716934,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Crowley is very intelligent and nice.  But her class is very difficult I took the same class last year in high school and got an A while doing no work. But, in her class I did a bunch of work and got a B+.  However, she is always willing to help her students with their problems."
333,716934,5.0,3.0,"Professor Crowley is an amazing math professor. I had her for Calculus 101, and I never thought I'd take calculus again, but I only took calculus 102 because I was able to get into her section. Yes, she grades the homework, but it really prepares you for her tests. She's really, really clear and helpful."
334,716934,4.5,3.0,"Great lecturer, which I'd never seen in a math teacher before.  Very enthusiastic about the material, especially the more complex theoretical stuff. She is EXTREMELY accessible and helpful, I went to her office every week and she was always very nice and happy to help. I would definitely recommend her as a professor."
335,716934,4.5,3.0,Always there when I needed her.
336,716934,4.5,4.0,Very detailed and clear outline for every lecture.  Write everything she writes on the board.  Always available for help and interested in every student.  Hard and time consuming but doable assignments.
337,716934,3.5,4.0,No Comments
338,716934,4.5,4.0,"Hard grader, but explains the material very well. She is always available for help. The homework takes a long time to do, but if you go to her before handing it in you will do well on it."
339,716934,4.5,5.0,"Her grading will knock you out. HW is graded harder than imaginable. Test questions and the class average reflect that she is still trying to get her bearing as a teacher. I feel like I've learned everything well, but have really gotten tagged on tests for minute details."
340,716934,4.5,5.0,"She makes you learn the material really well.  However, this involves rewriting the textbook for homework (i had 13 pages on one assignment).  If you're not thinking of becoming a math major I'd say avoid at all costs...she's that annoying with her grading policies.  You can get the answer correct and not get full credit. AVOID IF NOT A MATH MAJOR!"
341,716934,5.0,4.0,"Kinda rediculous the way she makes you write up your homework. Showing work and the answer wont even get you 50%. She does a great job explaining things in class. Homeworks and tests are somewhat difficult, class average is low B/high C. Shes a total math dork, but I like her. You end up learning the material pretty well."
342,716934,5.0,3.0,Extremely nice and very helpful both in and out of class. I recommend her to anyone.
343,1583242,5.0,5.0,Awesome
344,1583242,5.0,1.0,"Best professor I've ever had. Really teaches the material well in class, so the textbook is unnecessary. Really funny too"
345,1583242,5.0,1.0,"He has been my favorite professor. He's extremely helpful & really connects the dots. Also, awesome accent! Definitely recommend him & this class"
346,1583242,5.0,2.0,"Ravi is the man. He explains everything clearly and there are no surprises on the tests. Come to class, take notes, and you will do well."
347,1583242,4.5,1.0,"RAVI IS AWESOME! i seriously love this guy. he's young, energetic, clear, and straightforwrd with his teaching and material. basically just read the textbook and you'll be fine. it's definitely not too hard or overwhelming and if you do your work, you will get an a. he has a great attitude and is always willing to help! definitely recommend him!"
348,1583242,4.5,1.0,Ravi is awesome! Econ is not my thing but he makes it make sense!
349,1583242,5.0,2.0,"If you can, take a class with Ravi. The best thing to ever happen to the econ department. Funny, clear, straightforward. And has the greatest accent"
350,1583242,4.5,2.0,Great guy! Clear and engaging in lectures. Quizzes can sometimes be difficult but his tests are pretty easy and straightforward. Highly recommend him!
351,1583242,5.0,3.0,"Ravi is seriously the man.  His tests aren't easy, but if you follow the lectures and (possibly) do the reading, they are straightforward.  He will help you as much as you need, and he's super nice.  Definitely would recommend Ravi."
352,1583242,5.0,1.0,Ravi is the man.  He is an incredible teacher because he is engaging during lectures and breaks down material in a way that is easy to understand.  He is reasonable and his tests are straightforward.  Take this class.
353,1583242,5.0,2.0,Thank God for Ravi. Best thing that ever happened to me at W&L.
354,1583242,5.0,2.0,"Ravi is the best! He's very very helpful, and his notes are crystal clear. His tests are straightforward and you always know what's to be expected. It's nice. Also, he really had a great accent. His courses are great for people interested in econ because he explains everything so well and is good at connecting the dots. Definitely recommend!"
355,1583242,5.0,3.0,"Ravi is awesome. I loved his class. He's very good at what he does, and best of all, writes his notes on the board. tests are extremely straightforward. I like his accent"
356,2549903,2.0,3.0,"Before anything else, Prof. Naven is well-intended in his approach, he's just unorthodox in his grading system/class style. He's very clearly passionate about teaching economics, but he has the tendency to labor over theory rather than application. Naven also digresses about said theory, which makes it hard for someone like myself to pay attention."
357,2549903,1.0,3.0,"Professor Naven is the worst professor Ive had in my 3.5 years at Washington and Lee, including all of the science professors I have also taken. The major part of your grade is in the policy brief. Going to office hours is useless because he will take off for corrections he made. Awful professor and heartless."
358,2549903,2.0,4.0,"I would stay away from Professor Naven if you can. He is a quirky guy and his policies are bizarre. He is the most nit-picky grader I have ever had, and refuses to give any points back even if he took off for something that is right because &quot;that's his syllabus policy.&quot; Goes on tangents so you rush through all the important content in class. Tough."
359,2549903,4.0,3.0,"The tests are way tougher than the class/homework, but the lectures are usually clear and as engaging as intro econ can be. With the scale everyone ends up doing alright if you've kept up."
360,2549903,4.0,3.0,"For intro econ, he does a good job of keeping pretty boring subjects exciting. Its a little annoying how he counts how many times you speak in class, but its not too hard to keep up. Theres only a few tests though and they're really tough, but he curved heavy at the end."
361,2549903,4.0,4.0,"Professor Naven is a nice, funny, and charismatic guy. He's accessible outside of class and is always willing to help his students if you go to office hours. The class isn't easy, but if you read the textbook and go to office hours you should get a decent grade."
362,731282,5.0,4.0,"Orgo is tough regardless of the professor, but Dr. Alty is an absolute ANGEL. She cares about her students so much. For 241/2 the cold tests are a must. Reading textbook & practice problems are also helpful, as lectures mirror content in the book. Tests are challenging but not impossible. Lab grade also helps so don't slack off there. "
363,731282,5.0,5.0,"Don't really have anything original to add - Dr. Alty rocks. Organic is hard, and she makes it clear and relatively easy to learn. DO THE COLD TESTS AND TEXTBOOK PROBLEMS! She is fantastic after class and in office hours if you have questions, and she makes sure she actually answers what you're trying to ask. Work hard and you'll do well (maybe)."
364,731282,5.0,5.0,I took Dr. Alty so I would understand Orgo and have no regrets. This is a hard class; my advice is to use the textbook problems religiously and ASK HER QUESTIONS. Take the cold tests and notice the patterns (which concepts are emphasized).
365,731282,5.0,4.0,"Genuinely wants you to succeed. This woman is an angel. If you are taking Orgo, take her. Be prepared to read the textbook in order to keep up. This class is test heavy so study hard for all, but Alty is as helpful as anything!"
366,731282,5.0,5.0,Organic Chemistry is hard no matter the professor. She is so sweet and tried hard to assist you in your work. Her office hours are great.
367,731282,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Alty was great. While the class itself was very difficult, she did her best to make herself accessible and the material easier to understand for everyone. I would definitely take a class with her again."
368,731282,5.0,3.0,"The lectures were always very clear and helpful, and the learning objectives gave a comprehensive overview of what we were supposed to be learning. Grading could be a little harsh, but she wouldn't write the tests with the intention of murdering us. She would also frequently try to tie the material into something Medicine or Biochem related."
369,731282,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor. Her difficulty rating is just the nature of the class.  She grades hard, but fair.  She definitely knows that most of the people in the class want to go to medical school and she is genuinely doing her best to prepare us.  You can tell that she actually cares about your success. Overall: 5/5 - would recommend without hesitation."
370,731282,5.0,4.0,"Organic Chemistry is one of the hardest courses I have taken at this school, but she did a great job explaining the material and was always available to help us out."
371,731282,5.0,5.0,"Organic Spec was hard, but she tried to make it understandable. Take home tests were open book, hard, but doable. In class test seemed easy after completing the take homes."
372,731282,4.0,4.0,"Fun spring term class.  Medicinal chem. is her research field, so she's knowledgeable and interested in the subject.  She pretty good in office hours if you ask VERY direct and specific questions.  Can be a hard@$$ sometimes, but overall has a fun personality and laid-back teaching style.  Great lecturer!"
373,731282,4.0,4.0,"Presents difficult material in a clear, well-organized fashion. Very helpful in answering questions, and you can almost always find her in her office during the day. Also, she's just super nice."
374,731282,5.0,4.0,Yeah...she's cool.
375,2058386,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Brock is the absolute best, 10/10 professor in every way. I've had 3 classes with her so far (and am registered for another), and each one has been amazing and so fun/interesting! She really cares about students and is easy to work with/talk to if any conflicts/struggles arise. I recommend her to everyone, take a class with her if you can!"
376,2058386,5.0,4.0,Wonderful! Very knowledgeable and very kind. Fair amount of reading but all of it was very interesting. Always made room in class for discussions. Grade yourself policy is not for everyone but it is very interesting and forces you to honestly evaluate your work. I would recommend!
377,2058386,5.0,3.0,"I have taken two classes from Professor Brock and could not recommend her enough. She is so passionate about her classes, especially the ones in her speciality, which is 16th-17th century Scotland. Take her classes!!"
378,2058386,5.0,3.0,Professor Brock is awesome! There really is not much more to say than that. She cares about her students and is super into whatever she is teaching. Class is divided well between lecture and discussion so that makes it interesting as well
379,2058386,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Brock is amazing! She tends to be very passionate about what she teaches and always makes lecture interesting. She does assign readings (this is a history course) and there are papers, but they aren't long. She is a very easy grader and always willing to clarify difficult concepts."
380,450707,3.5,2.0,Great guy. Passionate about what he does. If you get to know he can be a great asset.
381,450707,2.5,4.0,I was not a fan of professor de Maria. After 2 papers he told us he wouldn't be able to help us and to go to the writing center. He also doesn't tell us what is wrong with our papers
382,450707,4.5,2.0,"De is AWESOME. Easily my favorite professor, looked forward to every single class with him. A really cool guy who really cares about his students, I can't recommend him enough."
383,450707,4.0,2.0,"Big Bob is that dude.  Probably the coolest professor on campus.  You can shoot the sh*t with him for hours about sports, music, etc. Great sense of humor."
384,450707,4.5,3.0,"De was hilarious. Great professor and really interesting, awesome guy to just shoot the breeze with. His class was super easy - he could be vague about assignments but was definitely a generous grader."
385,450707,4.5,2.0,Prof de is the man. One of the best at this school. Not a difficult teacher most of the time but challenges you when need be. A great person to just talk with as well.
386,450707,4.5,2.0,De is one of my favorite professors!  He cares so much about each student.  You should take any class with him that you can while he is still here.
387,450707,1.0,4.0,hes a dick
388,450707,4.5,3.0,"The &quot;Italian Stallion&quot; is a Beacon of Hope for any serious journalism major. Just look at what he did to mold that famous News 12 newsman in Philly. And he is so darn cute, you just want to squeeze him."
389,450707,5.0,3.0,Best professor at W&amp;L... far and away!
390,450707,5.0,3.0,"Excellent - that sums him up. You will not be disappointed!  Great teacher, great friend, great mentor."
391,450707,4.5,2.0,"To know him IS to love him, as someone already said. He is the sweetest, nicest, most caring professor I've ever met, and that makes up for the fact that sometimes he doesn't give the greatest feedback on projects. If he thinks you can handle things, he just sends you out there on your own..."
392,450707,5.0,4.0,"Bob DeMaria is a very god man who will give you the skills and teach the way of looking at things that will make you not only a better journalist., but a better student in general."
393,450707,5.0,3.0,he is fabulous!
394,450707,5.0,3.0,"DeMaria has that unique ability to shape young students into top professionals. In fact, this is the man that inspired the journalism icon Greg Coy."
395,450707,5.0,4.0,This man is so hot I could barely concentrate on the subject matter. To know him is to love him.
396,845977,3.0,2.0,"She's very nice after you get used to her. I have her for level 2 German. Classes are pretty boring and she gets off topic easily. Her time management is horrible. As long as you're outgoing, she'll love you. Her tests are extremely easy. She's a good teacher, but can be snarky in a mean way."
397,845977,5.0,3.0,"This is for anyone interested in Hardin for German. Her tests demand that you study. A lot. Like a test should demand. Her lectures are usually engaging and focused. She is extremely nice if you are trying. If you don't care, she stops caring about your grade. Always helpful to students who are trying"
398,845977,2.5,1.0,"This course was incredibly easy.  There were no major projects - only tests and regular book exercises.  For your information, Italian is her 4th language and English is her 3rd.  So she's teaching her 4th language while using her 3rd.  As you can imagine, she knows neither English nor Italian well enough to teach very effectively.  Overall: 2/5"
399,845977,3.0,3.0,"Not as bad as theyre saying.  Hard to understand sometimes and can be snappy/catty, but in general is very nice and caring. always willing to help. tough tests, moderate class. just participate in class and she'll like you. dont get offended if she snaps or yells at you. its just her european way"
400,845977,2.5,2.0,"She's very moody and quick to stereotype students. She likes the more outgoing students and if you're not, she tends to look down on you."
401,845977,2.0,3.0,"Worst class I've ever taken.  Treats students like babies and makes you do stupid, useless projects.  I would suggest spanish."
402,2062494,2.0,3.0,"Professor McGonigal is nice, but loses patience easily. His writing 100 course was heavily philosophy based, but the material was not presented very interestingly. The course made me a better philosophy writer and not necessarily a better writer overall."
403,2062494,1.0,4.0,"Professor McGonigal is without a doubt the worst professor I've had at W&amp;L. From day one, our class was met with unrealistic standards and a striking lack of patience. McGonigal's coldness and arrogance created an atmosphere of fear which made learning difficult, and the blame for any issues that arose from his inability was deflected to students."
404,2062494,3.0,3.0,"Professor McGonigal is nice and understanding, but this writing course was heavy on philosophy and it was not my thing. IF you like philosophy this writing course is for you."
405,2062494,5.0,4.0,"Great Philosophy class, Professor McGonigal is easily accessible and will attentively answer any questions. Class participation is very important, so the assigned reading is key."
406,2062494,3.0,3.0,"Professor McGonigal is incredibly nice and cares about his classes. However, his freshmen writing seminar was a philosophy class that no one understood. His grading for essays did not make sense. In a regular philosophy class, McGonigal could be a great teachers; however, his freshmen writing seminar was not very enjoyable."
407,2062494,1.0,5.0,"McGonigal was the worst professor I have taken at W&amp;L. He assigns hours of dull reading and chapter after chapter, but never specifies what the test will be on. We were left to study dozens of articles, 2 different (expensive) textbooks, and so much more. He gives 2 papers and one exam per term, so you better do well. Participation is important!!!"
408,2062494,3.0,1.0,"This class was super fun, it was like solving puzzles. Class time was pretty boring as most days we just went through a few example problems, but McGonigal was very helpful and caring."
409,2062494,4.5,2.0,McGonigal for philosophy was a great experience. He's incredibly kind and is more than willing to meet with you on his own time to clarify any questions. Sets you up to succeed and succeeding is not hard in the class if you meet with him and put in moderate effort. He also has a sweet accent. Take a class with this guy
410,2062494,3.5,2.0,"Really friendly guy. Always making himself available in office hours, always open to students' questions in class. Takes the material very seriously, but is a very generous grader if you demonstrate effort and grasp the overarching rules. "
411,2207905,1.0,3.0,DONT TAKE THIS
412,2207905,5.0,4.0,Clover is a real gem. If you are interested in photography at all she will make you love it by then end of the term. She is very reachable outside of class and will help you to do your best if you put in the time and work. I would highly recommend. I will have a friend in the arts department as long as I am at W&amp;L.
413,2351267,5.0,2.0,"Fun, relatively laid-back, but very effective language teacher. Uses a lot of repetition for Russian beginners and assigns daily homework. It can be a lot, but don't worry, doing all of the homework is not necessary for an A. It's about participation, tests (they're not that hard if you pay attention) , and a non-zero level effort on homework."
414,2351267,5.0,3.0,"Awesome Professor. Take Russian at W&amp;L. So much fun, and you learn a lot. Even though class meets everyday, it's actually worth it because you learn a lot and she makes it fun."
415,2412718,5.0,4.0,"Lloyd is my favorite professor at W&amp;L. His enthusiasm makes what could otherwise be a dull topic very interesting. You do have to work for a good grade, but he is so approachable and kind it is definitely worth it."
416,2412718,5.0,3.0,"Professor Tanlu is one of the best professors I have ever had. I took a summer course with him, and he made a seemingly mundane subject extremely interesting. Great sense of humor, and very engaging with all students. Very willing to help you do as well as possible in the class (practice problems, unlimited HW attempts). Would 1000% have him again!"
417,2412718,5.0,3.0,"Lloyd is one of the best teachers I have ever had. His passion, enthusiasm, and humor keeps you awake in every class. He thoroughly explains every topic and provides all his lecture notes online. If you email him questions he will respond almost immediately with a detailed explanation. Hands down one of the best out there."
418,2412718,5.0,3.0,Class isn't super easy but he's super accessible and nice and clear about course requirements
419,2412718,5.0,3.0,"Lloyd was amazing--my favorite professor so far. He is approachable and friendly, and teaches the material, which could be dry, in a fun and clear way. Looking forward to taking more classes with him in the future!"
420,100531,4.0,4.0,"Professor Adams is quite passionate about his classes and frequently digresses during class conversations. He is a quirky guy but is a breath of fresh air for English classes. His reading loads are quite substantial, and be prepared to discuss material in class, participating in the seminars is crucial for your grade. Gives great feedback on papers"
421,100531,3.0,3.0,"LOTS of necessary reading between every class. He was a pretty average professor but definitely cares about students and made an effort to know our names. He gave good feedback on papers and was helpful if we had questions about them. However, he can be a little passive aggressive if you offer your opinion on something and he doesn't agree with it"
422,100531,5.0,4.0,"This Professor is not easy, but all of his feedback is very helpful. Overall he grades well and its hard to really do bad in his class. Great overall writing 100 course."
423,100531,5.0,2.0,"He is such a chill, genuine professor! Sometimes a lot of reading was assigned, but it was pretty manageable. He gives good feedback on papers and gave us plenty of advance notice on assignments. Lit classes aren't my strong suit, but because of him, I'm looking to take another lit class with him."
424,100531,5.0,3.0,Prof. Adams is SUPER caring and gives amazing feedback on essays. Read and talk to him and you will do well.
425,100531,2.0,5.0,"There is no possible way to read as much and as fast as he expects you to. Added really stupid extra assignments like &quot;please watch 3 long films this weekend just because I think they're cool, but they have next to nothing to do with what we are discussing in class.&quot; I'd say avoid him at all costs. Too much work to finish with low chances of an A."
426,100531,4.0,3.0,"The topic of this sem was books and their film adaptations and I love this class. Prof Adams is such a caring teacher and is so funny. He helps you a lot with your papers so if you are not good at writing he is the teacher you want. Also, your first paper (only in this writing class, not his other classes) doesn't count."
427,100531,3.5,2.0,I really enjoyed this class.  I learned a lot about film and my writing definitely improved.
428,100531,4.0,2.0,"Fantastic professor. Took Film from him. His lectures were interesting, the reading not too heavy, tests reasonable, essays we could choose our own topic, and in the end I wrote a final essay I'm incredibly proud of. It was a risky essay, but Adams understood what I was trying to convey and gave me very helpful feedback and an A. Would recommend."
429,100531,3.5,2.0,"Brilliant man, but lectures were boring. My writing improved, but I at first had trouble understanding what he wanted in my papers. Read good books. Adams is very helpful at his office hours."
430,100531,4.0,4.0,"Adams is very knowledgeable and is very good at pointing out weaknesses in your writing skills. If you want to learn and improve your writing, take his class, but don't expect a good grade although it's not impossible."
431,100531,4.0,3.0,"I may be biased because I'm an English major, but I really enjoyed his class. Getting an A is not at all impossible, but be willing to work. Be sure to speak to him outside of class about essay ideas; he'll tell you if you're on the right track. He's very nice and happy to help you out."
432,100531,2.0,5.0,"He is basically smarter than any of his students will ever be, which is a big problem when you take his class cause his expectations are outrageous. Thankfully I will not be taking any more Lit classes after his class, since it has become almost unbearable."
433,100531,4.0,4.0,"Adams is that dude. A hard grader so don't expect to cruise, but his class is engaging and the material (in this case Brit Lit) is lively.  Plus he's smart as a muhfuka and knows his sh it.  Realistically if you want to have a shot in his class you need to seek his help outside of class.  Take his classes if you like English. His eyebrows are crazy"
434,100531,2.0,4.0,"Worst professor I've had by far! I took his film as lit class; SO much time spent out of class on work, and he's a severely biased grader. You'll pass if he likes you, and not a shot in h*** if he doesn't. He won't entertain any viewpoints that are not congruent with his own, and when he says write a paragraph, he means two pages. So inconsistent!"
435,100531,4.5,4.0,"If you earn an A, congrats, you're a battle-hardened genius.  He's probably the smartest person in most rooms, and very entertaining in class. But yeah, you'll read until your eyes bleed, write until you can't see straight, and be a better student - and smarter person in general - if you survive it. So for those who actually like learning, pick him"
436,100531,4.0,3.0,"Lots of reading, but not over the top.  Great guy, very well education, interesting class discussions.  He's down to earth.  He is also a difficult grader on essays, but tells you exactly what he wants to see on the next essay.  He assigns essays with  a lot of room to tweek the subject. &quot;write an essay about this book&quot;  it's very open"
437,100531,2.5,4.0,"Alot of reading, but a pretty helpful guy if you go in and talk to him. Don't try to predict his grading scheme, just make sure he likes you."
438,100531,4.5,4.0,Likes to assign substantial reading and is a fair but tough grader on papers. Very helpful if you actually take the time to talk to him.
439,100531,2.5,4.0,interesting. very crazy man. gives ++'s. go talk to him during office hours and he will be very helful in writting papers. talk a lot in class. assigns  A LOT of reading.
440,100531,2.5,4.0,"There is not enough physical time in 12 weeks to read what he expects.  Just never admit you didn't read--fake it.  Harsh grader, don't expect an A.  What you think is great, he thinks is crap and vice versa.  Class is okay--show up and talk a lot."

447,100531,3.0,4.0,Very tough grader compared to other entry level English profs. Merciless when it comes to reading assignments.
448,100531,2.0,5.0,Adams is one of those professors who thinks his class is the only--or most important--one his students are taking.  He assigns way too much reading to plausibly finish in the alotted time without neglecting other class work.  And he's not hot.  At all.
449,100531,1.5,5.0,Very tough grader.  Tons of reading.

458,413877,4.5,5.0,"Organic Chemistry is really hard, and Professor France loves to pick the tricky problems, but she is a great professor; one of the best."
459,413877,4.0,1.0,"it's a breeze, just study."
460,413877,5.0,3.0,"I mean, it's Organic. And she's a nit-picky grader on the weekly quizzes. But on tests, she grades a little easier. She's an excellent professor, she just has so much to cover, so your class will be exactly 57 minutes every day. Do the help sessions and cold quizzes and know reactions inside and out and you'll be fine"
461,413877,4.5,5.0,"Organic is hard, of course. The only way you'll do well is if you work hard, but this will also ensure that you LEARN. You are set for life (or the MCAT) if you take organic with France. She is very approachable, and just a lovely person. Beware, she has a lot of material to cover and will talk fast and for every minute of the class period."
462,413877,4.5,4.0,"She explains the material very well, but you can't be lazy in her class. If you don't do the help sessions you will do horribly. Takes alot of time but she usually grades fairly and you will do fine if you do the assignments."
463,413877,4.0,5.0,Awesome
464,413877,5.0,4.0,"Nothing bad can be said about Dr. France.  Look, she teaches organic chemistry...it's gonna be the hardest class you take in college.  But she is very clear and always available.  People who don't like her basically just didn't do enough work.  Sweet lady."
465,413877,5.0,3.0,"she's an excellent professor and takes the time to explain anything to you.  lab, however, can be a little intimidating."
466,413877,4.0,5.0,"VERY HARD, but more than fair.  Good at explaining tough material.  As long as you come to class and pay attention, you should be fine."
467,413877,1.0,5.0,horrible!!!!!!
468,413877,1.0,5.0,she is awful
469,100537,1.0,5.0,"Her class is interesting and fine. But the term long project is a nightmare. No matter how many efforts you have put into the project you are NOT gonna get a good grade unless you make the exact same suggestions she has in her mind. If you dont care about grades, take her class. Otherwise, avoid at all cost"
470,100537,1.0,4.0,"The entire class is just Bower's subjective opinion.  If she doesn't like your idea, no matter how much time was spent and how creative it may be, you will receive a score in the low 80's.  The semester long group project is a joke; she gives very little feedback and gives all the groups low B's on each draft. Take any other marketing professor."
471,100537,2.0,4.0,"Lectures are fun and interesting, but you never really know what to expect with grading, as she plays huge favorites. Also, term project is miserably tedious and she gives you awful grades but very little meaningful feedback. Not a huge fan"
472,100537,4.5,4.0,I have loved all her classes! She is a great professor and has made me want to pursue a career in advertising!
473,100537,1.0,1.0,"Puhleeez! Does she LOVE to hear herself speak or what&#63; If you disagree with her, you're history. If you're a woman who dares to be more flirtatious than her, expect to get a bad grade. Guys, you get good grades by making googly eyes with her. She LOVES the attention. If you can get over the nonstop senseless talky-talk, she's pretty easy."
474,100537,5.0,4.0,Such a fun professor!
475,100537,5.0,3.0,"Bower is amazing.  Consumer insights was one of my favorite classes (I even used that experience in a job interview).  Lots of discussion, not so much &quot;lecture&quot; as it is being thrown in head first and actually getting a first hand experience.  Hands down best project class (aside from Ad Class)."
476,100537,5.0,3.0,"Bower is awesome.  The previous comments say all of this really well.  She is amazingly interesting, uses great examples,and is funny.  She really connects with students and goes out of her way to help them.  Definitely take her for marketing.  You may find yourself wanting to pursue marketing and advertising..."
477,100537,5.0,4.0,wow
478,100537,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher, Explains material with real life examples which makes learning the info much easier."
479,100537,1.0,5.0,"nice professor, but ALWAYS goes the full two hours, if not overtime, and never stops talking, even if it's just about her husband or celebs she hates. can get really old really fast."
480,100537,5.0,3.0,"yes, she is a good teacher... yes, she is bangin'"
481,100537,5.0,3.0,"One of if not THE best professors at this school.  She is so entertaining you forget you're in class, she connects with all her students, and I try to take any course she's teaching. So her tests are a little harder, it's worth it to spend a few hours a week really enjoying advertising."

484,100542,1.0,5.0,"You will learn nothing in class and get a terrible grade. The tests are not based on the class lectures and he grades based on the way you write rather than what you write. He told me all my answers were correct but he didn't like my wording, so I got a 50% on the midterm that was worth 40% of our final grade. Happened to over half the class."
485,100542,1.5,3.0,"Had him for OB. He is hard to understand, and puts you to sleep but the class is pretty easy. Decent amount of work overall including a big project at the end, but he's not too bad."
486,100542,3.5,3.0,"Had him for OB, and it was fine. Difficult to follow his lectures, but hes a fair grader and hes very helpful in his office hours."
487,100542,4.5,3.0,"Great guy. Good teacher. Very intelligent and helpful. Loves Ireland because he takes his study abroad group there. He'll talk about it, but he seems pretty cool."
488,100542,1.0,3.0,"He's a nice guy and a mildly entertaining story teller but his class sucks. It shouldn't be a real subject. He teaches you nothing, the textbook is retarded, and his tests are pretty hard. He's not a very lenient grader either"
489,100542,5.0,4.0,Dean is a fabulous professor and a great guy. Extremely helpful and willing to work with you.
490,100542,5.0,2.0,Very good teacher and easy to understand

493,377040,2.0,4.0,"It's a difficult course, especially for freshman used to high school level biology. She's often unreasonable, too, which doesn't help that. I learned a lot, though, and the material was engaging enough even though the lectures themselves were dry. I was disappointed by this class because it was hard, boring, and she wasn't friendly. But I got an A."
494,377040,1.0,4.0,Meanest person I've ever met in my life. Tests are unreasonable and she is demeaning and belittling in class. Expects you to already know all of the information she is supposed to be teaching and responds to questions in a very condescending and unhelpful manner. Actual material is interesting but class environment is not conducive to learning
495,377040,3.0,5.0,"Study A LOT EVERYDAY for a B or better. Tests are savage, EXTREMELY specific, and not curved. You won't do well if you don't study from the book AND know EVERYTHING in her recordings of her lectures. Show up to class; she gives group extra credit opportunities and if you keep up with your studies you'll make back the points to get a decent grade."
496,377040,1.0,5.0,Professor Simurda expects students to have a level of background knowledge that not all freshman have. She often chooses not to explain things because &quot;you probably studied this in your high school genetics class&quot;. Her lectures are difficult to follow and she doesn't really allow time for questions. Her tests are hard and her expectations high.
497,377040,4.0,4.0,Dr. Simurda is incredibly smart and knows her stuff. That being said her tests are difficult and she expects you to know the material inside and out. Do what she tells you when you study and put in the hours and you'll be fine. 
498,377040,4.5,4.0,Excellent professor who is very knowledgeable. She gives a lot of work but it is very applicable to the course and she truly wants you to learn. She goes out of her way to help and gives constructive feedback.
499,377040,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. THE OTHER REVIEWS MIGHT MISLEAD YOU INTO THINKING TAKING THIS CLASS IS A GOOD IDEA, BUT TRUST ME, ITS NOT. TAKE DIVERSITY OF LIFE IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY."
500,377040,1.5,5.0,"Actually the devil. Tests are way too hard. I probably could not get an A on her tests even if we were allowed to use our notes and text. Absolutely belittling and expects way too much of freshmen in the first month of school. Her lectures don't translate well to notes and studying for her tests constitutes memorizing every detail that had shown up in her lecture, and other details that heaven only knows where they come from. Please, for your own sanity, don't take this class."
501,377040,2.5,5.0,Expects way too much prior knowledge.  Not very nice either
502,377040,4.0,4.0,"Yeah, she's difficult and if you're looking to cruise through freshman bio, this isn't the way to do it. But on the other hand, if you can get over not getting an easy A, her class is very valuable. She will challenge your understanding and will legitimately make you a better scientist. In the long run, what's more important&#63;"
503,377040,1.0,5.0,the meanest person i have ever met. expects you to have way more prior knowledge than is reasonable.
504,377040,3.0,5.0,"There are several things about Dr. Simurda that were good.  She knows her stuff.  She is accessible and will help you (to what degree is questionable).  However, she makes a seemingly simple biology course rather difficult.   Oh and one more thing, do not tell her that you aren't a bio/science major.  Biggest mistake I made."
505,377040,2.0,5.0,OMG!!! enough said!
506,377040,2.0,4.0,Absolutely miserable.  Lectures are exremely boring and tests were rather difficult.  Not approachable at all.
507,377040,1.0,5.0,"Evil and mean doesn't begin to describe her.  Literally, I didn't want to come to class because of her.  Her lectures sounded like she was screaming nazi propaganda.  Scary as hell in her office."
508,377040,4.5,4.0,"Very difficult, but lectures are clear and she is accessible"

510,714971,5.0,5.0,Had never taken Latin before and will not again but professor Benifiel was by far my favorite professor. She is super caring and wants to make sure you are successful. If you are struggling make sure to go to her office hours and she will do everything in her power to help you.
511,714971,5.0,3.0,"Professor Benefiel is absolutely amazing, the course is fast paced, but she is willing to give help when and where anyone or everyone needs it."
512,714971,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely outstanding professor, and one of the best professors in the entire university. It's worth becoming a Latin minor or major solely because of her in the department. She is so helpful and kind, she teaches the language really well, and she brings so much enthusiasm to class. 10/10 would take her every semester if I could"
513,714971,5.0,5.0,"The kindest, most encouraging, direct professor I have ever had. She really knows what she's talking about and does such an amazing job explaining the material. Has high expectations of her students, but is so understanding and willing to help along the way. 10/10 recommend. If I knew she didn't teach every latin class, I wouldn't have taken latin"
514,714971,5.0,2.0,"Professor Benefiel is hands down the best teacher I have had at W&amp;L. She has tremendous command of the Latin language, and she genuinely wants to share her knowledge with her students. She also makes the class super fun, and engaging."
515,714971,5.0,3.0,Professor Benefiel is incredible. She assigns a fair amount of work but I never felt overwhelmed. Her tests were not difficult at all if you kept up with the translations and attended class. Very knowledgable of the topics and has interesting research too! Definitely one of the best professors at W&amp;L.
516,714971,5.0,3.0,Professor Benefiel is amazing. Take a class with her if you can
517,714971,5.0,4.0,"Great FDR pick! Best to have a background in Latin b/c she goes relatively fast. However, she is very accessible and really cares about your grade. Very understanding and OFFICE HOURS work! Attendance is part of the grade and homework for every class. Quizzes are helpful for test. No midterms! Only 3-4 tests a term. She was my favorite prof!!!!!"
518,714971,5.0,3.0,"Loved her class, very knowledgeable about the subject (Pompeii) and has a definite passion for what she teaches.  Very helpful, both inside and outside of class, and is very easy to talk to.  Am hoping to take a class with her again!"
519,714971,5.0,3.0,"A wonderful lady and academic. You will learn a lot and learn to love what she teaches. She may be tough in her essay grading, but if you show honest effort you'll do great."
520,714971,5.0,4.0,"Professor Benefiel is great, always up beat and happy in class, always willing to answer any question and is incredibly nice when people really have no idea what they are talking about. Very glad I took her class."
521,714971,5.0,1.0,She's amazing! She really knows what she's talking about and she is always very excited about the subject matter. She's also young and easy to get along with.
522,714971,5.0,3.0,Very good teacher.  She knows what she is talking about and is very willing to help you.  Also very friendly.
523,714971,5.0,3.0,Took her Pompeii class spring term - amazing!  She really knows her stuff and I learned so much.  Highly recommended.
524,714971,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher.  She cares about her students.  Like all Latin classes, grading is based on studying- but not too hard.  Very nice overall."
525,714971,5.0,3.0,"Such a nice woman, and who really knows what she's talking about.  Just a wonderful woman who creates a very pleasant environment."
526,944350,5.0,3.0,LOVVEEEE Michelmore. Fav prof fav class!
527,944350,4.0,3.0,Good professor. Very engaging lectures. Pretty left leaning. LOTS of reading and most of it is pointless. All essays and most of the exams are based on readings not lectures.
528,944350,4.0,3.0,"I took Post-WWII US History with her as a freshman, which I wouldn't recommend doing if you're not a history expert as it's a 200-level.  TONS of reading but I learned a lot. Only tests were a midterm and final, both weren't that hard, plus 5 short research projects and a big final project. I ended up doing well, it was just a lot of work."
529,944350,4.5,3.0,Good professor. Not easy but very helpful
530,944350,4.0,3.0,"Michelmore will like you if you express genuine interest in the class and keep up with the reading. Or simply if you're a girl. If you're a male, at least act like you love feminist movements and all that business cause she digs the sheyit out of that.  Bring your writing A game for tests and papers and you should be set"
531,944350,5.0,1.0,Class lectures were straight forward and her enthusiasm kept class interested. Definitely do the readings so you can raise your hand in class once a week and then you're gold. Tests are easy.
532,944350,3.0,2.0,"Pretty lively lectures, keeps you awake because she is pretty loud.  Can be funny at times and is generally understanding of college kids.  Likes to teach about people that have been discriminated against.  Basically picks out a grade for you and that is what you get on everything so make sure to make a good impression."
533,944350,3.5,3.0,No Comments
534,944350,4.0,4.0,"She was brand new this year and so it was obvious that she had to figure a lot of stuff out when it came to teaching and students and grading.  ONLY take this class if you are really interested in history of those oppressed (women, slaves, Native Americans).  Pretty tough grader and lots of reading."
535,311520,1.0,2.0,"DON'T TAKE 211 WITH TUCHLER. You won't learn anything. POGIL is awful, and Tuchler refuses to actually teach or answer straightforward questions. He prioritizes us moving through material instead of actually learning it, & grades individual work very harshly. Be grateful to us students who have suffered through this course so you don't have to!!!!!"
536,311520,4.0,3.0,"Love this guy, I don't know what he's talking about half of the time, though. He moves through the lecture material quickly and his thought process is kind of scattered, or at least difficult to follow for a student taking Chem for the first time. Get ready to put in lots of hours outside of class working through problems + cold tests"
537,311520,5.0,2.0,"Dr. T is a tremendous professor to have for gen chem. His expectations/grading are SUPER straightforward. Sometimes lectures could be a bit hard to follow but not enough to derail your understanding. Listen, just show up to class, do the online homework, and take the cold tests and you'll get an A."
538,311520,5.0,2.0,Dr. T was amazing- very committed to our understanding and a great person in general. Grading is 5 midterms and a cumulative final. The material was easy (well explained) and it's just a lot of work (achieve online textbook work). Doesn't curve but tests are manageable if you keep up with the material and review well. Take benches w/Dr. T!!
539,311520,2.0,3.0,All material in both his upper level chem courses come from the POGIL workbooks. Do everything in it to do well. Group work is required and often frustrating because there is little guidance or help with learning material. It's often difficult to understand his train of thought when he does try to explain. Grades are returned slow as well.
540,311520,3.0,5.0,"Dr. T is clearly brilliant but has a hard time explaining concepts clearly and staying on track. He usually gives corrections for tests but they are poorly written and hard to complete within the time limit. If you work hard and participate in class, you should be fine. Don't be afraid to talk to Dr. T since he's really helpful!"
541,311520,5.0,3.0,Dr. Tuchler was amazing and really cares about his students and their ability to learn rather than grades. Given class this fall was during the pandemic he had to change his curriculum. Make sure you do the cold tests can't say it enough and he does mess up on exams somewhat often. Overall he's amazing.
542,311520,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Tuchler is an amazing and funny professor who is passionate about his subject. While the class may be difficult for someone who has never taken chemistry before, he provides students with flexible office hours, practice tests, and optional readings and homework problems which reinforce the material covered in class. Dr. T wants you to succeed!"
543,311520,5.0,2.0,Dr. T is an absolute gem. Pay attention in class and take every cold test. Will be an easy A. KEYBOARD CAT
544,311520,4.0,4.0,Tuchler is great. His class is hard and he can be disorganized making mistakes on tests. He is very fair though and grades quickly
545,311520,5.0,3.0,Solid teacher that is very helpful and funny. Enthusiastic about his class. I would highly recommend him. All you have to do to get an A is take the cold tests
546,311520,5.0,3.0,"Dr T is the best professor for Chem 110. People who think the class was extremely difficult or that he is a tough grader are either just not very good at chem or didn't study correctly. Chemistry is a hard subject so no matter who your prof is you are going to have to work for an A. Study every day, go to office hours and you'll be fine"
547,311520,3.0,3.0,"The class was very confusing and frustrating most of the time. The flipped classroom style was a struggle, but Dr. Tuchler was very receptive to feedback and was helpful in office hours. He seemed disorganized a lot but this could have been from the fact that this was the first year of the flipped classroom."
548,311520,5.0,5.0,Dr. Tuchler really cares about his students and it shines through in his office hours and in lab periods- make sure you ask him questions and take advantage of his recorded lectures! Very difficult class but couldn't have gotten through it with any of the other chemistry professors
549,311520,4.0,3.0,"Tuchler's really good at teaching intro Chem. Not so much for PChem Quantum. He's an incredible person and will go the extra mile to help you in office hours, but he frequently misspeaks and makes mistakes (even on tests). But this just goes to show you - these topics are hard for everyone. At least you'll have a prof who genuinely cares about you."
550,311520,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Tuchler is a great professor! His lectures are sometimes long, but chemistry is a very hard to thing to generalize and that's what he did really well. Some topics are way harder than others, but his office hours are VERY helpful and if you don't take advantage of them, then you're not taking full advantage of Dr. Tuchler."
551,311520,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Tuchler is an outstanding guy and professor at W&L. He is definitely one of my favorite professors, and he is always there for his students."
552,311520,5.0,4.0,Great professor! A genuinely nice person and takes a real interest in his students. Keyboard cat!
553,311520,2.0,5.0,bad experience  Does not explain well mistakes  He makes the material complicated ( it really isnt)  
554,311520,4.5,4.0,Dr. Tuchler is one of the best professors I've ever had ever! His tests are really tough and long and he's really strict on only having 55 minutes but all of that makes you really have to know the information. He's incredibly helpful and is enthusiastic about the material and is always available to help outside of class and is just the coolest guy!
555,311520,5.0,4.0,"Dr. T is one of my favorite profs I've had.  The class was tough and he has high expectations, but between lectures, practice problems, and office hours he gives you plenty of resources to reach those expectations."
556,311520,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors in this school. He was extremely helpful, and as long as you go to class and keep up, it's not hard to do well. Dr. T makes this course a lot of fun--take him!"
557,311520,4.5,3.0,Absolutely fantastic professor. If you hate chemistry but are willing to work at it Tuchler will give you as much help as you ask for. The professor made the course for me. If you're taking general Chem you don't want any other professor. Highly reccoment
558,311520,4.0,3.0,Great professor. Can be confusing at times tho.
559,311520,4.5,2.0,"PROFESSOR TUCHLER IS THE MAN. Great personality, great class dynamic. His class will take some time, but very reasonable in expectations. Do the cold tests... if you can get an A on them, tests will be no problem."
560,311520,4.0,3.0,one of the best chem profs here. really interesting and nice guy who will probably keep you awake in class
561,311520,5.0,3.0,Tuchler is great. Don't hesitate - take his course.
562,311520,4.5,3.0,"Loved Tuchler.  He is most definitely a Physical chemist, so his class is great for math-minded students.  Tests are challenging, but it is definitely worth having him as a professor.  Hilarious guy."
563,311520,2.5,4.0,"very nice guy but found it hard to follow during class as he goes on random tangents and hard to understand, hes always willing to help and go over things with you outside of class but he isnt great at explaining things in an easy to understand way, had to use the book more than most other classes"
564,311520,4.5,3.0,"Professor Tuchler is a boss. Seriously, take a class with him to fulfill your lab credit if you're not a science major. If you're a chem major, take as many of his classes as possible. Can't recommend highly enough."
565,311520,3.0,3.0,"Tuchler is hilarious, but his thoughts in lectures can be a little hard to follow sometimes. Enjoys what he does and does his best to help you enjoy it too."
566,311520,4.5,3.0,"Wonderful professor!  He tends to go through tough topics pretty quickly during lecture, but he's more than willing to explain things if you ask for help.  Really funny and smart guy - I think sometimes his mind is miles away from what he's talking about."

569,311520,5.0,3.0,Fabulous Prof.  Very engaging with a great sense of humor.  Makes class interesting.  Always available for help and explains things several ways to get the point across.
570,311520,4.0,4.0,Funny guy! Really knows his stuff and is super helpful.  Makes class fun.  Just a really cool guy and an awesome professor.  Definately would recommend him!
571,311520,4.5,3.0,Dr. Tuchler is a great guy and great teacher.  He's funny and cares about the students.  Another great professor in the intro chem trio!
572,311520,4.5,3.0,"very funny and nice. Really cares about his students and is understanding. Harder to understand his lectures, but very clear in small group settings or one on one sessions."
573,311520,5.0,3.0,"this is a top notch guy and you should take the time to get to know him,  though he is a bit of a science nerd."
574,311520,2.0,4.0,"The guy is obviously quite smart, but has trouble connecting with students in a lecture setting.  Don't bother coming to class anytime he lectures.  You will learn more by diffusion as you sleep with a book on your head.  Nice, goofy guy though."
575,311520,5.0,5.0,"One of the best teachers in the school, and my favorite person in the Science Department.  Great guy, extra helpful, comprehensive teaching style, and cheerful person.  While Dr. U likes making sure everyone knows that he knows their name, Tuchler is there to help.  Great!-"

579,151778,5.0,3.0,Must take De Laney while your here.
580,151778,5.0,3.0,"One of the most engaging lecturers at W&L, he used relevant personal anecdotes and funny historical specifics to keep everyone interested. You can tell he really cares about his students and is approachable- go to his office hours, even for personal stuff. He cares about race issues but doesn't show bias or resentment."
581,151778,2.0,3.0,"This was my first experience taking a college History course and it made me decide against a History major. DeLaney is exceedingly patronizing and I had an uncharacteristically difficult time participating in class. Overly tough and non-constructive grader, no clear writing rubric. If you want to stay enthusiastic about History, take someone else."
582,151778,2.0,5.0,"Worst class I've taken at W and L. Uninteresting readings that were never discussed in class, or if they were, it was a unilateral discussion by Professor Delaney. He is a really tough grader with a narrow view of what to write that does not match up with how any other department on campus or basically any interested reader would want to read."
583,151778,3.5,2.0,Professor DeLaney is a must. He cares deeply about social issues and human rights and really tries to share his appreciation for history with his students. He is such a nice older man. Take a class with him!
584,151778,5.0,3.0,So wonderful! Made me wish I was a history major.
585,151778,4.5,3.0,"I've had Professor Delaney for several classes, and it's been a great experience everytime. He's an excellent professor!!!"
586,151778,4.5,3.0,"I loved Professor Delaney. I took a seminar about the Civil Rights Movement, and it was the best class I've taken so far at W&L. He really made history interesting, and I always liked our discussions in class. He isn't an easy grader, but I would take any class of his in a second."
587,151778,5.0,3.0,"Professor DeLaney is a wonderful teacher who cares about his students.  He does not hand out easy A's, but you will come out of his courses having learned a lot.  He is always available and willing to help students.  By far one of my favorites at W&L.  An all around great guy!"
588,151778,1.0,5.0,"He is a boring, disorganized teacher that will destroy your motivation for history. He is an angry revisionist with serious racial issues. I thought it would be interesting to take a course from a former janitor turned college history professor -- but I was wrong.  The Peter Principle applies as he is in a position far exceeding his capability."
589,151778,2.0,4.0,"Lectures were horribly boring.  Did NOT like the teaching style because there was very little organization.  Amazing man, but a so-so professor."
590,151778,2.0,3.0,"DeLaney is the most patronizing professor I've ever had.  For some reason he's the darling of the school, but his classes are some of the most boring I've ever taken.  He's rude in and outside the classroom, unless you're one of his favorites, in which case his behavior is sickening.  Don't believe the hype - try someone else in the department."
591,151778,1.5,4.0,We talked about Jesuits in Canada... NOT American History.  Expected students to know too much for a 100 level class.  Didn't learn my name and didn't help when I went to his office last year.   Grades essays harshly and lectures were obscure.  I do not recommend his class.  :(
592,151778,4.0,2.0,If you have any interest in American history take his class. You don't really have to read much (so long as you raise your hand early in class) and the tests are not bad. He is sort of evil in the way he calls on people that don't talk/read.
593,151778,5.0,3.0,He grades a bit harshly so expect to be mad when you see your friends not studying and getting an A in another class while you struggle for a C.  Worth the GPA bruising because he is a great teacher and an awesome guy.
594,151778,5.0,3.0,Nicest teacher at W&L
595,151778,4.5,3.0,"Great professor, knows so much about the material, and his stories can be pretty funny. Getting called on may seem a bit intimidating, but he rarely says anything derogatory about a wrong answer. One of my favorite classes in my past 2 years."
596,151778,5.0,4.0,Great teacher.  Cares about his students and is extremely nice.  His classes are stimulating.
597,151778,3.0,3.0,Seems to take a sadistic pleasure in calling on students in class; he seems almost disappointed when you know the correct answer. Definitely plays favorites. Make sure you read the outside reading books!
598,151778,5.0,4.0,Either the best or second best prof. in the history department.  Professor DeLaney is an amazing man.
599,151778,3.5,2.0,Classes are completely lectures and a lot of information.  Just study notes day before test and you're golden.
600,151778,4.0,2.0,A great guy who cares about the material.  His anecdotes can be interesting.
601,151778,5.0,3.0,"He may seem intimidating during lectures and it's kind of scary when he calls on you, but he's such a nice guy and he really cares about his students. Lectures usually aren't boring and it's important to come prepared because if you don't speak up he will call on you."
602,151778,5.0,2.0,"he really knows his stuff. he's a really nice guy and is extremely helpful. the classes aren't that bad, but the tests are kinda difficult. we didn't get a study guide with possible ID's so figuring out what was going to be on the tests was a pain."
603,151778,5.0,1.0,"Really nice guy. Yes, the class is boring, but you can do really well with minimal effort. It's a great option for people who are looking to get rid of a gen ed."
604,151778,1.5,3.0,No Comments
605,151778,4.5,2.0,"The class is really easy, and he's very eager to help as well as a lenient grader."
606,151778,3.0,2.0,"Yeah, he's monotone, but knows a lot and the tests are easy - just skim through for IDs which he gives in a study guide."
607,151778,1.0,3.0,"The most boring man on the planet.  Classes are completely lecture - delivered in monotone.  Tests aren't terrible, all you need to do is read the main 2 text books - not supplement books."
608,151778,5.0,3.0,Excellent Professor! Class is based just as much on discussions as lectures. Class participation is important.
609,151782,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely loved Prof. Braunshcneider! She leads very engaging discussions about the readings and challenges you to think in new ways, and has a great balance between student- and teacher-led discussions. Definitely read before class, and take advantage of office hours! She is super helpful and easy to talk with about improving your writing."
610,151782,4.5,3.0,"Ignore section cuz I took about 3 classes with her including my capstone. I dont know how no one has mentioned this but SHE HAS HAIRY ARMPITS. Just a warning. Great teacher, always exciting, interesting discussion, despite what may seem like boring topics or books. She is unapologetically  feminist but not aggressively- only if you say dumb things"
611,151782,3.0,4.0,"This class helped me decide not to be an English major. Grading is atrocious; to get an A for class participation, she has to feel as if the quality of class discussion would suffer dramatically in your absence. Good luck. Grading depends on the person and gender.  Some people's papers made me wonder how they were accepted, much less passing."
612,151782,5.0,4.0,She is a great professor! She leads a lively and interesting classroom discussion which she guides but also allows for all comments. Do the reading beforehand and come prepared to analyze.  Go to office hours for help before turning in papers.  I want to take all of my english courses with her now!
613,151782,5.0,4.0,"Great professor! Tough grader, but extemely helpful if you go to her office hours.  Participate in class and do the reading beforehand and you'll do well.  Encourages all comments - no one is wrong in their opinion, but she will still share what she thinks about your thoughts in a respectful way.  Take her courses!"
614,151782,2.0,4.0,"Class is mandatory, discussion is forced, despite the fact that no one knows that they are talking about.  If you are a male, do not take this class.  In the winter of 2009, there was one guy in her british lit class. One."
615,151782,4.0,5.0,"Transformation and Metamorphosis is a pretty hard freshman english class. You read about 9 books, write 6 essays starting with 3 pages ending with 7. Takes a lot of time, and from my position i wish i hadn't taken this class during pledgeship. She's really nice, but a very tough grader."
616,151782,4.5,4.0,"Prof Braunschneider is a very very nice lady who is very helpful when you go to her. She will help you a lot with your papers, but her classes gets to be really loonngg. She also assigns an un Godly amount of reading everyday."
617,151782,5.0,4.0,Great individual- lively discussions and meaningful analysis. Really helps students work through dense texts to discover deeper meanings. Picked some difficult books but her ability to teach them made them seem more than manageable. She totally opened my eyes to the English major. Would definitely take another class with her.
618,151782,5.0,3.0,"she is so entertaining to have class with.  she really loves this victorian brit stuff (esp the womens work). hard grader on papers.  also, some boys say she is unfair... but just don't be obnoxiously fratty and i bet you'll be fine."
619,151782,4.0,4.0,"Extremely intelligent woman, but tough paper grader. Don't expect a great grade unless you come up with interesting ideas for your paper and spend ample time taking her past comments into consideration. Participate in class, and read the assigned literature! Very opinionated in areas concerning animals, gender relations, etc."
620,151782,4.0,4.0,"I like her.  She's really excited about helping you delve deeper and discover new things.  Yeah, she's pretty feminist, but I never felt impossed upon, and her views, if anything, enriched the class. OFFICE HOURS--GO TO THEM!!  I would definately take another class taught by her."
621,151782,5.0,4.0,Very articulate and excited about the topic and literature.  Unapologetically feminist.  Fair but fairly tough grader.  Fun to visit during office hours and very accessible.  Facilitates lively discussions and expects participation.
622,151782,5.0,4.0,"Excellent professor; class discussions were key, but very helpful in understanding the books. Not too difficult a grader, but interested in deeper analysis. Don't take her class if you don't plan to participate. I would definitely take another of her classes."
623,151782,5.0,4.0,Very nice woman who truely cares about her students... but kind of one sided with things concerning women's studies.  Work load was kind of heavy at times but she wasn't that hard of a grader.  Don't know if I would want to take anoter class with her.
624,151782,1.0,4.0,"Very biased, one-sided teaching on the topic of women's studies... did not enjoy the class at all."
625,151782,5.0,3.0,Very helpful. Actually feel as if I took something out of the class. Interesting readings.
626,151782,4.0,3.0,Very engaged in student writing and success. Frequent discussions in class and mandatory appointments during office hours to go over papers.
627,2298090,3.0,3.0,"Professor Rajbanshi is highly intelligent and insightful which leads to thoughtful class discussions and analysis of assigned texts. You'll write a lot and your writing skills will improve a lot through her constructive feedback and frequent in-class workshops. Go to class, participate, and complete your assigned work, and you will do great!"
628,2298090,4.0,4.0,"Amazing teacher! She is highly knowledgeable in her subject area and knows how to discuss these ideas in effective and informative ways! Grading is not arbitrary. Although she is a wonderful teacher, she is EXTREMELY uptight. If you miss class more than two times, no matter excused or unexcused, your grade is cut in HALF at the end of the semester."
629,309491,5.0,3.0,LORIG ROCKS! His Sensation and perception class is one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at W&amp;L. He lets the students guide discussion so we can talk about what we're interested in. His tests are long answer responses to questions and I really enjoyed how much they made me think and and grow as a writer.
630,309491,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Lorig is a great professor and makes his lectures enjoyable. There are only 3 tests which account for 84% of your grade so if you do bad on one, it's hard to get a good grade in the class. There is a lot of reading from the textbook and this class requires a lot of time. However, this class teaches you so much beyond the material. Take it!"
631,309491,5.0,4.0,"He's retiring so it doesn't really matter but he's awesome. Really knowledgeable and entertaining in class, but his texts can be painful to study for."
632,309491,5.0,4.0,Dr. Lorig is awesome!
633,309491,4.5,2.0,"I loved this class. And he was an awesome professor. Attendance wasn't mandatory, but the lecturesdiscussions were too interesting not to go to. The tests were ROUGH, but he was a fair grader. The more sources you have on his open-ended tests the better. There's never an answer. "
634,309491,4.0,5.0,This is the hardest class I've ever taken in my life but also the most rewarding and most interesting class I've ever taken. I really enjoyed the class and I would definitely recommend taking it but it is a lot of work so keep that in mind.
635,309491,5.0,3.0,"He knows everything about everything. He may seem daunting at first, but he's really just teaching you how to learn. Once you learn his style, you'll know exactly what to look for on his tests and you'll know exactly what he wants. Definitely go to his office hours."
636,309491,4.5,5.0,Great professor. Very engaging lectures with a lot of interesting tangents. Take VERY good notes in class even on the tangents as they could all show up on the tests. Don't be intimidated by a bad grade on the first test or two--they get easier as time goes on. Just don't try to cram in this class--it won't work.
637,309491,4.0,2.0,"My favorite teacher at W&L.  Brain and Behavior is a challenging class, but the vast knowledge you gain from it makes it worth it.  It is definitely possible to get an A, as long as you keep up with the reading and take succinct notes.  I suggest reading and highlighting a chapter one day and then reviewing it the next.  Recommendation: TAKE IT"
638,309491,3.5,5.0,"He is probably my favorite teach at W&L. Brain and behavior is hard,(I didn't get the best grade) but you learn so many amazing this it's worth it. TAKE THIS CLASS"
639,309491,5.0,5.0,The class is hard but it gone be done. There are two approaches to conquer it.  One you can make flashcards a week ahead of the test and just keep doing them every night until you get the most of the words. The second strategy is the higlhight and rewrite  where you go through the book highlighting the key terms and rewriting them.
640,309491,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Lorig was such a great lecturer! Class wasn't mandatory, but you never want to miss one because they are so interesting. Take lots of notes and keep up with the reading and you will do fine. Prepare for the tests like you should and you'll get the grade you deserve."
641,309491,5.0,5.0,"Great teacher, very hard, loves people who are interested in learning."
642,309491,5.0,5.0,"Great and interesting class. Although the tests were hard and there was a lot of material, it is is one of the most interesting classes that I've taken at W&L. You may have some trouble if you're not a &quot;science person,&quot; but Prof. Lorig is very helpful if you do need it."
643,309491,4.5,5.0,"He's pretty tough, but really fun."
644,309491,2.5,4.0,Interesting fellow who knows a lot. Yet he loves teaching student through frustration....
645,309491,4.0,4.0,Challenging professor.  Expects a lot from students.
646,309491,1.5,4.0,Odd guy.  Hard to read.  Nice enough but does not explain his expectations well at all.  Better suited for research than teaching.
647,309491,5.0,4.0,"Knows his stuff and can be quite humorous.  If you keep up with your reading this will be your average class.  If you slack off, this class will be HARD... VERY HARD.  Trust me."
648,309491,4.0,3.0,"Not a bad course, if you're a science major. Don't take it unless you are. Good bit of work, but manageable if you keep on top of it. Tests take some getting used to. Expects you to figure out a lot on your own. Generally nice, helpful guy though."
649,1198325,3.5,4.0,Decently hard grader. Huge on participation and will call you out in class if you're don't know something. Extremely high expectations of students.
650,1198325,4.5,4.0,"Boetsch is actually the coolest dude.  Take any class with him you possibly can. Tough class, have to stay up to date with homework, participation is huge with him.  Cares about people who care, and trust me he will know.  If you actually wanna learn a language take his class.  Inspiring man and W&L grad. Pretty sure hes got his own scholarship too"
651,1198325,4.5,2.0,"LOVE prof boetsch! take any class you can with him. he's the man, super helpful, loves what he does and really cares about his students"
652,1198325,5.0,3.0,He is a GREAT professor! The class is hard but he makes it as fun as it could be. You have to keep up with the daily studying but Boetsch is incredibly helpful
653,1198325,5.0,4.0,I love Prof. Boetsch
654,1198325,4.5,2.0,Really good teacher in that you'll actually learn the language but the tests can be rather hard because they're unforgiving. If you ask for help outside of class then he is super helpful and will like you more.
655,1198325,4.0,4.0,"Boetch is AWESOME. Tough teacher, but if you go see him, he'll walk you through what he wants. He responds well to interested, active students. Attendance is important, and so is timeliness. He's a tough grader, but he's fair. Interesting person too. I'm a native speaker and learned a lot about good writing in Spanish and systematic poetry analysis"
656,1198325,4.5,3.0,No Comments
657,1198325,4.0,4.0,"Prof Boetsch is a cool guy, but a very hard teacher. He expects you to primarily teach yourself; he clarifies some points in class but this class depends primarily on independent study. If you keep up with the material, class will go much smoother, as most of class time is spent talking. Tests are pretty difficult, and expect a few pop quizzes."
658,1198331,5.0,2.0,"She's very clear and straight forward with no surprises. She's not too hard of a grader and also gives extra credit. Compared to what I've heard about the other intro. classes, I think her's is the best to take in terms of clarity and difficulty. She also really cares about every student understanding the material."
659,1198331,4.5,2.0,"I loved Shizuka. She is really really nice and explains everything very clearly. Her practice tests are very indicative of what's going to be on the real thing. Her class is a pretty easy, but thorough, introduction to microeconomics."
660,1198331,2.0,1.0,Lectures are basically straight from the book. Her accent is ridiculous and extremely entertaining. Seems like a lot of people who can't talk about Econ at all still seem to get a decent grade. Easy to get in the B+/A- range.
661,1198331,3.5,4.0,"I love Shizuka. She's hilarious without actually meaning to be, which makes classes enjoyable. Her tests were difficult and she graded them strictly, but she's so helpful during office hours and really approachable and sweet. Also really helpful that she writes everything you need to know on the board during class."
662,1198331,3.0,2.0,"Had her for econ 101 and she is pretty easy. 24% of your grade is homework which is nice. pop quizzes only count for extra credit. She is very picky on tests, but there are only two, not including the final, and they aren't too hard. she has a pretty heavy accent, but she writes everything on the board so it usually doesn't get in the way."
663,2124041,5.0,3.0,"Professor Khalifa is the man. He cares about everyone and just wants his students to do well. If you do the work and ask for help, you will be rewarded"
664,2124041,5.0,3.0,Khalifa's an awesome dude. Go to his office hours. Put in the work and he'll respect that.
665,2124041,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor. Very helpful during office hours
666,389401,5.0,1.0,Best Math Prof. you will ever meet.
667,389401,5.0,4.0,"Good VERY CLEAR lecturer, though sometimes he spends too much time on proving things that seem obvious, especially towards the end of the term. Tests are easy conceptually, but if you flip negatives or make integration errors, you'll be docked. So, grades are based as much on performance in high pressure test situations as much as understanding."
668,389401,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Siehler is really great, and he responds to students who show interest.  The homework is not mandatory, but if anyone hopes to succeed in the class, it is. There is usually a graded activity every week (open notes), a quiz every other week, and a test every 3 weeks.  If you put in the time, you will do well. I would recommend him to a friend."
669,389401,4.5,3.0,"The kindest man in existence! He radiates joy like spring sunshine. In lecturing, he moves quickly and describes everything in words, a blessing! Go to his office hours if you need help, he will work tirelessly until you understand. Also, so funny and adorable! If you are an internet geek, you will love him! Also, he's an elf. Straight out of LotR."
670,389401,2.5,3.0,he's a nice guy who is clearly very smart and understand the subject matter. i think he just has some trouble translating what he knows to a lower level of math comprehension. if i told him i didnt understand something he would literally just stare at me like i was an idiot
671,389401,3.5,4.0,"If you have any interest in math, you'll like Siehler. He loves his numbers & is entertaining to watch. His tests are pretty fair, and he doesn't give much collected homework. Make sure you understand everything though, because since there isn't mandatory practice you are totally responsible for getting what he teaches. He'll help you if you ask."
672,389401,5.0,3.0,"Professor Siehler is great!  He's a really nice guy and his notes are crystal clear and very organized.  For my course, you had to keep yourself sharp on the material (not much homework, a good thing), but he was very helpful.  Really cool guy to talk to and in general."
673,389401,2.0,5.0,"He is extremely hard and can make you feel dumb when you ask for help outside of class, but he does curve the final. I wouldn't reccomend taking from him unless you love calculus"
674,389401,4.0,5.0,"discrete 121 was a lot harder than i expected, but prof. siehler is extremely helpful- take advantage of his office hours!"
675,389401,2.5,5.0,"He wills spend way too much time talking about aspects of calc you don't need to know.  The material is much easier than he makes it out to be.  Ok guy, not the best teacher"
676,389401,2.5,4.0,"Great class, easy to follow, really engaging ... if you are GREAT at math. If you're like me (i.e. only taking it for a gen. ed.) STAY FAR, FAR AWAY! He makes himself available to help, but if you aren't into math, he can't really &quot;dumb&quot; it down when you ask him to explain. He just gives 'hints' and looks at you funny if you still don't get it."
677,389401,4.5,5.0,"He is a cool teacher and a funny man in a weird way. He is really hard. And most of his problem sets are just ridiculously hard compared to the tests. IF you are not good at math, you are gonna have a HARD time with him."
678,389401,3.5,5.0,"I have to say that Siehler is probably the coolest teachers I have ever met. I loved going to his class, he has so much energy! Still, I almost failed it. His class is really hard, but he is always willing to help"
679,389401,3.5,3.0,He is very enthusiastic about the subject and likes to make jokes/ try to get people involved.  I would have done better in his class if he didn't give problem sets which Multivariable students could not help me with.
680,389401,5.0,3.0,Expresses material clearly and gives good notes to study.  I loved his grading system (usually 1 test a week or 1 homework that would count as half a test).  He moved at a fast pace but it was necessary to cover our material. Challenging course but you will learn
681,389401,5.0,3.0,"Great Prof!!! Excellent teacher, really passionate about the material and it shows. He has so much fun with the subject that it HAS to rub off on you too! Ask him about anything! he’s very friendly and is more than willing to help."
682,389401,2.5,4.0,Hated him. Hated him. Hated him.
683,389401,4.5,4.0,"I think he is an excellent professor who really know s his stuff.  He reduces everything he can to simplest terms, and if you're having trouble with something, just go ask him about it.  I defintely wants everyone to do well, and if you're not happy with him, then you're not giving him a chance.  He's a good guy with a lot to offer."
684,389401,4.5,2.0,"The nicest guy you'll ever meet, mild mannered, clear in his demands (even if he is a little difficult to hear because he's so soft spoken).  It's clear he loves what he's doing, and he does his very best to ensure that everyone understands."
685,389401,4.5,3.0,"this guy rocks!! he is wayy too smart to be teaching this 101 class and even though he makes calc harder than it is, he really makes you think. he'll spend a lot of extra time helping students. even though his class may seem hard, it's not hard to make a good grade. definately recommend him!"
686,389401,1.0,5.0,he is the worst professor at W&L. Avoid at all costs
687,389401,5.0,3.0,How can you not give him all 5s on this...
688,389401,4.5,3.0,"Everyone says that he's too smart.  I don't see that, I think he makes the concepts very easy to understand and waits until the class understands before moving on and moves at a slow pace.  Also very nice and very willing to help."
689,389401,3.0,4.0,"Terrible professor. He's smart & knows the material by heart but if you aren't mathy like him, you are screwed. I had to get a tutor because he couldn't help me. He tried, though. That's something, i guess. Seriously, if you aren't good in math keep away from him. He makes things way too hard but th"

691,389401,5.0,3.0,Great teacher.  Brilliant guy and always available.  I wonder how anyone could think anything less than stellar.  Would gladly have him again.
692,389401,5.0,2.0,AWESOME!
693,389401,4.5,2.0,"Siehler is a very brilliant man, sometimes a little to smart when it comes to explaining concepts, but very willing to sit down and help students. Overall a good teacher who is a nice guy."
694,389401,4.0,4.0,he's chill but way too smart for the likes of me. almost too good for a low level class. knew exactly what he was talking about. always available and has a great website to study from old tests. overall good prof.
695,389401,4.5,3.0,"Class was pretty boring, but he really wanted everyone to understand and he was always, always available for help"
696,389401,3.5,3.0,"what a creepy guy. his class is not too difficult, but it's pretty boring. the whole receding hairline yet hair down to shoulders look just doesn't really do it for me. when he prances from board to board it's entertaining though."
697,389401,2.5,2.0,One of the most boring teachers I have ever had.  Does a very poor job of explaining the information and spends the entire class proving formulas you never have to prove on tests
698,389401,1.5,4.0,"In a word, weird. Never turns around once he starts writing on the board. Famous for making calc a lot harder than it needs to be. Tries really hard to be nice, but has a hard time relating to students. Text book example of a scizophrenic."
699,389401,4.0,4.0,No Comments
700,1429786,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor, would recommend."
701,1429786,4.0,2.0,"Logic can be a difficult concept, but I think he did a great job of explaining it and moving at a manageable pace. He is very accommodating and even changed the date of a test because we told him we didn't feel ready. There is little outside work, but that means your grade depends on only 4 tests plus participation."
702,1429786,5.0,2.0,"Professor Goldberg is awesome. There is not a lot of homework besides the readings, and he does tutorials so a lot of times you only have class twice a week. I love his dry humor and the discussions are super fun. He is very knowledgeable and open to any questions."
703,1429786,3.0,4.0,"He's nice enough. I had him for PHIL-170 (logic) and he was interesting, but told me and others that sometimes the lessons wouldn't &quot;click&quot; and that there was nothing he could do. Not really what I expect for a professor to take a passive role in a small class. I guess he's fine if you're in a normal philosophy class or you're apt to logic..."
704,1429786,5.0,3.0,"Love him. He finds ways to keep discussion interesting. I personally find him really funny, but his sense of humor is dry and requires that you take him light-heartedly. Sometimes it seems like he's cutting students off or being rude (which is where I think people beef with him), but he's more just trying to share the right answer."
705,1429786,5.0,3.0,"Really awesome guy. Super nice and doesn't take himself too seriously. His logic class is not hard. The only problem is that the material is hard to wrap your head around initially. However, he very clearly tells you what will be on the test, and if you put in the effort an A is very Attainable. Very available outside of class."
706,1429786,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I've ever had. Extremely rude, incompetent at lecturing, and harsh grader. I almost changed my major because of him."
707,1429786,5.0,1.0,"Funniest Professor I ever had even though he doesn't try to be funny. He has a really dry sense of humor, but he is really good at his stuff and get better each day you are in his class."
708,1429786,5.0,3.0,"Class discussed things like time, cause and effect, and possible worlds. Things never got boring, though the prof did go off on tangents sometimes."
709,1429786,5.0,2.0,What can be more interesting than studying the nature of existence&#63; Cool class overall. Great prof-especially great we had snacks in class.
710,1429786,3.5,2.0,Goldberg is a nice guy but a bit quirky. He seemed a bit unsure about the material we were covering but still managed to make most of it fairly interesting. The tests were straight forward and he is willing to help if you ask.
711,1429786,5.0,3.0,He knows how to teach. This is more than can be said of most people.
712,1429786,5.0,4.0,Fantastic prof but hard class. (Also had him in logic. It was a good class.)
713,1429786,1.5,4.0,"Nice guy, strange guy, very confusing and vague, feel like I didnt learn much in the class and he grades tough"
714,1429786,2.5,4.0,"He can be a good teacher if you agree with him, but if your style is that of a jock or non-nerd it will make your experience more difficult. He is a little pretentious, but if you try you can do well."
715,1429786,4.0,4.0,"Great professor! Prof. Goldberg's grading is tough, as is the material, but with hard work one can do well. He is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met, which makes class interesting and entertaining. I highly recommend his courses."
716,1429786,5.0,3.0,Had him for Logic. Fantastic class. I'd highly recommend it.
717,1429786,4.5,5.0,He's a hard grader but he'll take the time to work with you. The class was fascinating.
718,1429786,2.0,5.0,I heard that Modern Philosophy was interesting so I took Goldberg's class which turned out to be the biggest academic mistake of my college career. The readings are excruciating and the papers are nearly impossible to do well on. He encourages students to visit his office yet it does little to help your grade. Overall a very bad experience
719,1429786,2.0,4.0,Tough grader and lectures are boring.  Disappointing class
720,160026,4.0,3.0,"Professor Merchant is extremely knowledgeable, loves listening to students' contributions to discussions, and loves questions.  The reading load was intense.  He allows students to turn in rough drafts to be edited before turning in the final draft for the grade - essential, and doing this can yield an A-A if you work for it.  Would take again."
721,160026,4.5,4.0,"Participation is a must with Merchant, seems like papers are often graded with participation in mind, he loves outside sources, if you read and give him a rough draft of work you can easily get a B but you have to go above and beyond to get higher than that--which isn't too hard to do with him"
722,160026,2.0,5.0,"His class was too hard for what it was. I am a history major who makes B+ or higher in my history classes, but I could not get higher than a C from him. If he doesn't like the way that you write, you're screwed. I went to his office hours and never felt like he was particularly helpful. I don't recommend him."
723,160026,5.0,5.0,"I have taken several classes with Merchant now, and he is my advisor.  In my opinion one of the best teachers in the school.  He expects a lot out of every student and you can't slack off, but he keeps the lectures and discussions interesting, the readings relevant, and is very helpful during office hours. Don't slack though, he'll call you out."
724,160026,3.0,5.0,"Major amount of reading. Grading is fairly ambiguous, but rewrites are allowed. The class was one of the more difficult B's that I ever received, but it was full of useful information. If possible, take it pass fail because its incredibly informative and interesting"
725,160026,5.0,4.0,"Absorbs a tremendous amount of reading about the subject and incorporates it into lectures. Incisive, humorous and quick."
726,160026,4.0,4.0,"You should take at least one of his classes. He is a tough grader, especially on the papers. Work hard in this class. You will learn how to write well. Your papers will come back in covered in red, but he lets you write a first draft, an actual paper, and a rewrite, so you have as many chances as you need. I failed my first paper but still got a B."
727,160026,3.5,5.0,"Spring Term. Holt Merchant. 9 AM. Money. Do it. Don't be afraid to ask for a rewrite. Don't expect an A, either. Do it anyway."
728,160026,2.5,3.0,"He's a nice guy, but I will summarize and say that his class made picking a major between history and politics and easy call - I'd rather take a Rush or Velazquez class any day of the week."
729,160026,5.0,5.0,"Very tough, but fair, grader. His lectures are amazing, and he's a cool person."
730,160026,3.0,5.0,"Holt Merchant is the worst professor at W&L.  His lectures have little to do with the reading, and he does not grade well at all.  If Herodotus handed in a paper, Merchant would give him a D and write &quot;unclear thesis&quot; on it."
731,160026,5.0,4.0,Had him for five classes now. he's awesome if you take the time to go and see him. always ask for rewrite if you think you did badly on a paper - he'll let you do it.  greatest teacher here - bit a really hard grader on papers.
732,160026,5.0,4.0,"History Department has lots of great profs, but I think Merchant stands above all.  Great lecturer, assigns neat books.  Only take ANY of his classes if your writing skills are on point, and don't dare quibble for space on papers.  One of the smartest guys I've ever met."
733,160026,5.0,4.0,"Along with Professor DeLaney, Merchant is the King of All History.  The man loves history, and if you don't love it when you're finished with one of his classes, you must be a math major."
734,160026,5.0,5.0,This guy ROCKS. Work your butt off and don't leave W&L without taking his classes.
735,160026,4.5,4.0,Excellent lectures. Pushed you to do better.
736,160026,4.5,4.0,No Comments
737,160026,5.0,5.0,"Merchant is tough, but taught me how to write.  One of the most valuable classes I took at W+L."
738,160026,5.0,4.0,"clearly loves the South. Easy to get a B as your semester grade, very hard to get an A- or A. Very picky about writing and grammar. Cares very much about teaching and keeping W&L a true teaching institution."
739,160026,3.5,3.0,He likes Bobby Lee and the Braves.
740,1843484,4.0,3.0,I loved Sakas! She deserves an awesome rep as a new professor. She was so helpful in office hours and tried her best to make what is sometimes a dry subject for non majors more interesting. Sweetest lady and really interested in helping her students learn. Class isn't super hard or super easy. If you do the work and study and you will do well.
741,1843484,5.0,1.0,AWESOME TEACHER! She really revolutionized my interest for spanish. She was very patient/understanding/and helpful in class. She wants her students to understand and it shows. I would HIGHLY recommend taking from her.
742,1843484,4.0,3.0,"I loved Professor Sakas. Class can at times get a little dry because the in-class work is straight out of the textbook, but Sakas really tries to make what you're learning interesting. She's a really nice, really understanding lady who honestly wants to see her students succeed."
743,1843484,5.0,2.0,"I loved Professor Sakas. She defies all stereotypes about new teachers! She was very helpful in and out of class. She is willing to meet you where you are in the Spanish and will do anything to help you succeed. I desperately wish I could take her for my second year of Spanish. Very understanding, very friendly, and an overall awesome teacher!"
744,1491241,5.0,3.0,I love Professor Verhage! She took the really complicated readings and made them easy to understand while encouraging participation and listening to our thoughts. She gave helpful feedback on papers and was very willing to meet outside of class to go over anything I had questions about. She really brought the philosophy alive and applied it.
745,1491241,4.5,4.0,"I absolutely LOVED Professor Verhage!  She is extremely knowledgeable about her field and tries to spark interest.  She is very non-intimidating and is very available for help.  You're going to have to work to get a good grade, but she's not an unfair grader.  If you go to office hours, read, & participate in class discussion, you'll do very well!"
746,1491241,4.5,4.0,"I was in Existentialism.  Professor Verhage generally teaches subjects which are very complex, and the writers themselves can often be very hard to parse.  It takes a lot of reading to do well.  Nevertheless, Professor Verhage is a great professor and is really great at explaining away confusions that might generate from readings."
747,1491241,2.0,4.0,"I know I would have LOVED this class (I'm a WGS minor) if I had taken it with ANYONE but her! She's unnecessarily difficult, purposefully illusive, and cold. No one but her can be right but her. Take it with Fulcher instead she's great!!"
748,1491241,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. If you take an interest in her class and ask relevant questions, she will like you. If you go to office hours and are enthusiastic about your thoughts, she will enjoy working with you. She loves philosophy, is a fair grader, and wants to help her students. Don't avoid her."
749,1491241,1.0,4.0,"AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! She is boring,hard grader, will not tell you *exactly* what she wants, and generally does not respond to students emails. Unless you absolutely have to take this class with her, I would not recommend her!!"
750,1491241,1.5,4.0,"Overall, a really dry professor.First, she's ridiculously quiet, so if you don't sit in the first two rows dont plan on being able to follow everything. Also, she never really explains exactly what she wants in papers. She's actually really nice, but just not a good teacher."
751,1491241,3.5,4.0,"She talks quietly, so try to sit near the front.  She definitely knows what she is talking about, but the material can be very dry and in-class discussions can be boring sometimes too, especially depending on the topic and your level of interest in it.  The reading is very dense and takes time to complete."
752,1931564,1.0,4.0,The only thing I care about in making my schedule for next semester is not having her in the lab
753,1931564,4.0,4.0,"She's actually pretty great!! Just as long as you're organized in lab and with the TechnoProject, it's a breeze. I found the labs very helpful to illustrate the theoretical physics concepts."
754,1931564,3.5,3.0,She is extremely helpful. If you reach out for help she goes above and beyond. Very fast email replies. Lab is long but her enthusiasm makes if go by quickly.  
755,1931564,1.0,5.0,She is a bad teacher. Sucks at explaining and when she does try she will end up confusing you instead. Also the 3 hour long lab will just be a stretch of boredom.
756,1931564,1.0,5.0,"I had an awful time in her class.  I took AP Physics in high school and thought this class would be a breeze, but she is so unclear and such a bad teacher.  Avoid if at all possible."
757,1636658,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Shester is my favorite professor that I have had so far. She is so accessible and willing to help, so if you do not succeed, that is on you. She is caring and understanding and truly wants to help."
758,1636658,5.0,3.0,"If you enjoy Econ, Dr. Shester is an excellent professor. She is both accessible outside of class and helpful in office hours. Do the reading and pay attention, and you should do well."
759,1636658,2.0,3.0,"After four years this is my first negative review of a W&amp;L professor. Often came to class unprepared and did not promptly return assignments. Received a B+ in the class overall, but received &lt;10 comments on 5-page paper C paper; Im not confident Dr. Shester read it. Nothing personal, shes very nice, but there are far far better W&amp;L professors."
760,1636658,4.0,4.0,Her classes are really interesting and you will definitely learn a lot. She's not an easy grader but she'll help you if you need her to.
761,1636658,5.0,4.0,"Professor Shester is one of the best professors I've ever had. It was a tough class, but worth every minute."
762,1636658,5.0,3.0,"Professor Shester's 101 class was well-organized with the perfect balance of well-articulated in-class lectures and outside coursework to ensure that you'll leave with a clear understanding of the course material. Professor Shester is completely brilliant, but also extremely approachable and super helpful outside of class as well."
763,1636658,5.0,4.0,"Shester is a must-take at W&L--she's one of the best. Whether it be an intro micro, urban econ, or an advanced level course you will learn a ton and become a much better student. You'll read and study some really cool papers and actually feel for what it means to be a real economist."
764,1636658,4.0,3.0,"All of her lectures were very clear and informative, definitely worth going to every class if you're shooting for an A. Overall a great micro professor."
765,1636658,5.0,2.0,"Professor Shester gave me a amazing intro to micro. She is super enthusiastic, and will somehow always keep your attention throughout the whole lecture. I always feel confident going into exams because she prepares us well, and even takes time out of her evenings before tests to have a review session. She also gives generous curves..."
766,1636658,4.5,1.0,"Very clear, helpful, and not a lot of work."
767,1636658,5.0,2.0,"She is so clear, interesting to learn from, and gives great help on work in office hours.  Do the work and go to her if there is confusion and you will do great.  Love her sm"
768,1636658,4.0,4.0,Really fun and interesting in class---very difficult grader on tests and essays however. An A- or B+ is definitely possible but A's are few and far between. The course itself was interesting but became repetitive because of the very nature of the topic (Women and the Economy)
769,1636658,4.0,3.0,"The class is very fast-paced, but as long as you keep up with studying you will be fine. Ask for help if needed because the lectures are so long that there is not much time for questions during class. Tests and grades are fair."
770,1636658,5.0,4.0,Professor Shester is one of the clearest and most engaging professors I have had. She expects a lot from her students but you learn more as a result. She often meets outside of her posted office hours and is very helpful. People who don't like her probably feel that way because they didn't work hard enough but still feel entitled to a good grade.
771,1636658,2.0,2.0,"Decent in class, but her voice gets annoying.  I wish she had more ability to meet at different times than her office hours.  Those don't work for everybody!"
772,1636658,5.0,5.0,"STRONGLY recommended. High workload, but low stress. The work is a GOOD thing. Those in other seminar sections were unprepared when it came time to write the proposal. Class is mostly student-led discussion, but she would chime in and (very clearly) explain the tricky points. I learned so much in this class. Super friendly and helpful."
773,1636658,5.0,3.0,Super clear and organized. I wasn't interested in the class but she made things easier. Tests are harder than examples in notes but possible to do if you study worst-case scenario examples. Super nice and helpful in office hours.
774,1636658,5.0,2.0,"Professor Shester is a great teacher- very approachable and helpful. Her notes and examples are very clear. If you pay attention in class, take good notes, and study for the exams, you'll do well."
775,1636658,4.5,3.0,"This was her first school year at Washington & Lee. She is very helpful, and does things in the best interest of her students! Wonderful Professor!"
776,1636658,4.5,3.0,I had Shester for Micro and I really enjoyed her class. The class is a lecture style and there isnt much student interactions. Her tests are harder than the material covered but not impossible.
777,1636658,5.0,3.0,"I had Shester for Microecon 101 & she's definitely the nicest professor I have this term. If you have a question/don't understand something, she uses really approachable examples. She writes her notes really clearly so being organized for exams isn't a mess. If you study for each exam (not super hard or super easy), you'll be fine."
778,1636658,4.5,3.0,"Her tests are fair (not too easy, but not overly difficult) and she is very approachable. Class can be kind of dull at times, but she writes the notes on the board in a way that makes it very easy to study and she doesn't go too fast either."
779,2044213,4.0,2.0,"It's clear he caters to his audience. His lectures are straightforward and easy to grasp. Do well on the few actual assignments in the class, but participation is key to do well in that class. Best professor to take POL105 w/ if you are fine with sitting and agreeing to everything he has to say."
780,2044213,5.0,3.0,"For starters, using Fridays to cover current global events was great. His lectures are also awesome, but he balances them with a lot of class participation and group discussion type stuff, so you stay engaged. Another bonus is that you're graded mostly on writing assignments, so you can be a little more lax with notes and focus on participating"
781,2044213,5.0,3.0,"Really cool guy. Prof. Cantey is super knowledgeable and well-versed in Global Politics . His goal with the class is to not produce Politics majors, but to make his students more well-rounded global citizens, and he does a greta job of it. Captivating lectures, and not too much work. Hands down one of the best professors on campus. Must take!!!"
782,2044213,4.5,3.0,"If you have any interest whatsoever in global politics, take a class with Professor Cantey. His lectures are clear and insightful, and he knows how to engage students to make any topic interesting. He speaks arabic, has connections with the intelligence community, and is knowledgeable on all-things foreign affairs. Would take any class he offers."
783,2044213,4.0,3.0,"Soft-spoken, but in a captivating way. Great lectures, very knowledgeable. Big on participation, though, which makes it difficult sometimes. The weekly news quizzes were killer, though, since they're out of 5, so missing one (4/5) leaves you with an 80, unfortunately. Overall, would highly recommend, and hope to take another class with him."
784,2044213,4.5,4.0,"Cantey is a great professor, very eloquent and compelling lecturer. Not the easiest grader. He expects a lot out of his students and inspires them to work harder. "
785,2044213,4.5,3.0,"Cantey is one of the most engaging professors I've had at W&L. He's travelled all over the world and has amazing insight into the intelligence community. Very approachable, helpful, and engaging. You have to participate though, as he takes participation seriously. He isn't the easiest grader, but pay attention in class and read, and you'll do well."
786,233800,1.0,5.0,"Revered as a great teacher around campus, but the buck stops there.  He does not care about his students outside of class and has continually shown favor to male ones. He would rather watch you fail than help you succeed. Too big for his britches. "
787,233800,5.0,4.0,"Best teacher I've ever had in my life. If you are even remotely interested in pursuing a science degree, make sure he is your Chem-110 professor. Teaches more than is tested on, so you get a really good understanding of everything. As long as you follow his advice (take good notes, go to oh, do HW, do cold tests), you will be fine grade-wise."
788,233800,1.0,5.0,"Literally the best professor and man you will ever meet at W&amp;L. The reason why I am writing this and giving him a poor grade is simply to help others like me who have never taken chem before and are looking to take chem 110 here. Take Tuchler or Desjardins, you may learn a little less but your GPA will thank you. He is an extremely tough grader."
789,233800,5.0,4.0,"Professor Uffelman was one of the first teachers I had at W&amp;L and I am so thankful. His class is hard but he is a teacher who makes the class fun and is more than willing to work with you outside of class. He truly wants all his kids to succeed and if you're willing to buckle down and put the work in, you can be very successful in this class."
790,233800,5.0,4.0,"Super accommodating and cares for his students a ton. For this class, cold tests are SUPER helpful because there are so many you can predict what your test will have on it. Qs come from HW- try them then go to office hrs, he will help but expect that you do the solving; same for the EC opportunities. End-of-term quiz on amino acid structures &amp; pKas"
791,233800,5.0,4.0,"Dr. U is the best professor I've ever had. His class is definitely not an easy A, but you can do well (and really understand the material) if you do what he says - that means lots of time and tons of repetition. Great sense of humor and cares so much about his students. A W&amp;L gem. I would trust this man with my life. DO THE COLD TESTS."
792,233800,4.0,5.0,Professor Uffelman cares about you as a student and wants you to succeed. That being said he is an incredibly tough grader and expects you to be putting in at least 2 hrs a day 7 days a week to succeed in his class. The class average for the course is a 2.6 (B-). He makes himself accessible for office hours and appreciates hard work.
793,233800,5.0,4.0,"I can't say enough about Dr. U. I feel fortunate to have taken his class during my first semester in college. It is challenging, but he is clear in his expectations. I recommend going to speak to him in his office--he loves helping students with hw or life in general. I wasn't good at chemistry coming into college, but he taught me how to succeed"
794,233800,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors at W&L. Absolutely genuine and cares about his students. Makes office hours in the evenings and on weekends so they are very accessible. DO THE COLD TESTS
795,233800,4.0,5.0,Worst grader I've ever had. Avoid him at all costs!
796,233800,4.5,4.0,"Dr. U is by far the kindest, most genuine professor. He truly cares for every single one of his students and goes out of his way to help. That being said, the class is extremely difficult, but completely worth it if you want to be prepared for higher level science classes. Overall great guy. "
797,233800,5.0,3.0,"He is a GREAT professor! He is trully interested in his students. He expects that you commit time to the class. If you do spent the time to study and use the PLENTY resources that he provides you are guaranteed to be fine! He is available, helpfull, clear in his explanations. He is a tough grader but, all of the above!"
798,233800,5.0,4.0,"A very passionate professor and tries his best to motivate you to devote the needed time to the course. Do not be worried if you have a rough start at the beginning, I made a D+ and a C+ on my first two tests and ended up with an A-. DO THE COLD TESTS...ALL OF THEM. He commonly reuses problems and problem styles. You'll know your stuff come finals"
799,233800,4.5,5.0,"Uffelman is obsessed with his class and his students; he will know your entire name until his death day. That being said, he is very good at explaining but expects a huge amount of dedication timewise. If you do everything he says, you should be fine. Don't expect to get an easy A; out of all the GenChem professors, he probably grades the harshest."
800,233800,4.5,4.0,"Dr. U really takes an interest in each of his students, he knows your name on the first day of class, but grades are just numbers to him and you get what you get despite how much he likes you. With that in mind, he's really good at making you feel ok about a bad grade. Study a ton and you'll be ok, and all cold tests (do them) are on sakai to help."
801,233800,3.0,4.0,"A wonderful really helpful guy who is extremely dedicated to his students. However, if you are not great at chemistry or math I would recommend taking chem 110 with one of the other profs. His teaching style can be very confusing and makes concepts more difficult than needed in an intro course, compared to the others who ""teach down"" a little more"
802,233800,5.0,3.0,"Dr. U is awesome. He loves teaching and it shows. People who complain about the difficulty of the course either a) don't have the algebra background required, b) aren't willing to put forth the effort he demands (which is still way less than he puts into working at W&L), or c) just aren't cut out for it. Coming from someone with no Chem background."
803,233800,5.0,3.0,"Does not an easy class, but he makes that clear from the start. Willing to put in a lot of work to help students, and really cares if they succeed. Lectures are interesting and have an infinite supply of puns."
804,233800,5.0,3.0,Dr. U is awesome! Very helpful and friendly. He makes the class  worthwhile and interesting!
805,233800,4.0,4.0,"Super helpful, the material is challenging but he makes it fun with all his chem puns!"
806,233800,5.0,4.0,"Dr. U is the man!  He is the best professor that I have ever had.  Chem 111 is a difficult course just by its nature, and Dr. U is a demanding professor, but I loved the class.  To succeed, one must devote 2 hours a day, 7 days a week to the class (his words).  However, if you do so, you will   have had the best education possible.  I love Dr. U!"
807,233800,4.5,5.0,Dr. U is a really sweet guy.  He is crazy about Chemistry; so if you aren't it is sometimes hard to connect with him.  He is very enthusiastic about his class and willing to help anyone who asks.  Really hard class.  Expect to put in a lot of time and know in advance that the tests are quite difficult & require preparation.
808,233800,4.5,5.0,Dr. U is a really sweet guy.  He is crazy about Chemistry; so if you aren't it is sometimes hard to connect with him.  He is very enthusiastic about his class and willing to help anyone who asks.  Really hard class.  Expect to put in a lot of time and know in advance that the tests are quite difficult & require preparation.
809,233800,4.5,4.0,"Uffelman is the man! I had this class at 8:00 am every morning, if this class was taught by any other professor I would have slept-in more. Uffelman?s tests are hard and the class requires time and effort to pass but he rewards time studying with a good grade. The only professor who should be teaching Chem 111"
810,233800,4.5,5.0,HE IS THE MAN. PERIOD.
811,233800,5.0,4.0,"Probably the only professor who learns all his students' names the first week of classes. Chem is challenging, but he clearly explains the material and is always available to help you whether it be during office hours or at night. He takes time to get to know you and is always available for advice."
812,233800,4.5,4.0,"Hands down, THE most entertaining professor I've ever had. He loves chemistry so much that he quite literally bounces around in front of the class as a means of communicating his lecture points. Extremely available, LOVES his students and wants them to succeed. If I wasn't worried about graduating on time, I'd take this class over and over."
813,233800,4.5,3.0,"Dr. U is the best science teacher I have ever had in the hardest science class I've ever had. You have to study for the tests, but it is definitely possible to do well."
814,233800,2.5,5.0,"Professor Uffelman is stuck in 5th grade. He makes the easy stuff seem really really hard. His jokes are retarded and he get excited about chemistry lab equipment. Attending class is a waste of time, just read the lectures. Probably he is a great scientist, but he is definetely not a good teacher."
815,233800,5.0,4.0,I love him! If you study the cold tests and weekly problem set quizzies really well the tests shouldn't be too hard. Class isn't too boring because he is such a wonderful man!
816,233800,5.0,4.0,"I could never say or allow anyone else to say anything bad about Dr. U. He is my fave prof at W&L, and just an awesome person. I visit him in my spare time for no particular reason other than to chat and get a cookie. He's unbelievably intelligent and knows more than you could ever hope to learn in your life, he can and will answer any question."
817,233800,5.0,3.0,Dr. Uffelman is one of the best professors I've ever had; he is one of the most helpful and is genuinely interested in his students.  His lectures are entertaining and he actually makes you consider becoming a chem major.
818,233800,5.0,3.0,Great Prof.  Always available to help.  Great sense of humor and genuinely interested in students.
819,233800,4.0,4.0,"Simultaneouly one of the kindest and most intelligent people I've ever met. Almost makes me want to be a chem major. Tough, but truly cares about his students and will do anything possible to help them succeed.  Take this class!"
820,233800,5.0,4.0,My favorite professor by far.
821,233800,5.0,4.0,"Dr. U is my favorite professor.  You can tell he's just brilliant, and he genuinely cares about all of his students.  Tough, obviously, but still makes you want to major in chemistry just for the professors.  Oh, and the jokes...yeah..."
822,233800,5.0,3.0,"Extremely smart and has a great sense of humor, maybe a bit dorky, but still hilarious. HUGE Harry Potter nerd."
823,233800,2.5,3.0,One of the most condescending professors I've had.
824,233800,5.0,5.0,"too smart for his own good. he is really nice, understanding, intelligent and super super smart."
825,233800,4.5,4.0,So so nice.  He is challenging but could never day a bad thing about him because he is so sweet.  Really cares about his students.
826,233800,5.0,3.0,"Some people found the class hard, but its chem afterall. He is the most amazing teacher at this school. If i were a woman I would have his babies. He is an awesome professor."
827,233800,5.0,4.0,"Best professor at the school.  Smartest man I've ever met.  The guy has a photographic memory and will remember your name and face after meeting you only once.  If he can get me into med school, he can help you out too."
828,233800,5.0,5.0,"Lets Hear it for CAPTAIN SMALLTALK!  He will know your name within the first week (Very flattering, i might add) and more about Biology, geology, physics, and terrible jokes than anyone i have ever met.  Fellas, he knows his****."
829,233800,5.0,4.0,AMAZING!!!!
830,233800,5.0,4.0,"Uffelman will make you like chemistry.  He is such a good teacher, he makes some of the most abstract concepts understandable.  His class is tough, but if you actually enjoy learning new things, sign up for his."
831,233800,4.5,5.0,No Comments
832,233800,5.0,5.0,"AMAZING PROFESSOR!!! one of the genuinely nicest guys i've ever met in my life! the class was soooo hard, but his notes and lectures were by far the easiest to follow. he's always ready to help and got to know EVERYONE in the class. Even though i'm not in the class anymore he still helps me"
833,233800,5.0,5.0,"AMAZING PROFESSOR!!! the class was nearly impossible but he went out of his way to know all of us in a large class, and was always accessible for help... made potentially really boring lectures seem interesting with his jokes."
834,233800,5.0,3.0,No Comments
835,233800,5.0,3.0,always helpful with office hours.  corny little jokes crack me up...very funny
836,1399123,5.0,4.0,"He was my independent study advisor, so I was more or less on my own. Still, Professor Shay was always there if I needed him, and when we did meet, he clearly communicated his expectations and shared some helpful tips. Shay is my favorite W&L professor, and the subject matter he teaches is right up my alley."
837,1399123,5.0,4.0,"Great prof, great class, a lot of work, but 110% worth it."
838,946521,1.0,5.0,"Stay away from this guy! He is a total robot and has extremely high expectations for his students. If you are not a math person do NOT take this class. He assigns an absurd amount of work and if you fall behind you are left behind. Also, he has no understanding of student's lives outside of the classroom--stay far far away!"
839,946521,4.0,4.0,Guse is a great guy. Lectures in this class were kinda all over the place but it was his first time teaching the class. He's super helpful outside of class. The class itself definitely wasn't easy but you'll end up with a good grade at the end if you put in some effort. I'd take Guse for 202 if you can.
840,946521,5.0,5.0,"Micro Theory is a hard class, but Professor Guse explains it very well and is a fair teacher. Highly recommend coming to office hours, as he will explain things very thoroughly if you ask him to do so. There are daily pop quizzes though, so be sure to read carefully before class."
841,946521,5.0,4.0,"My favorite Professor at W&amp;L! He is a mathy person which is something I really appreciated. He explains everything so well, and multiple times too if you ask him to. Honestly a great teacher and an awesome person. He is the reason I decide to stick with Economics!"
842,946521,4.0,4.0,Micro Theory is a hard class but taking it with Guse is the way to go. He is a really good teacher and always makes himself available to meet even if office hours don't work. The homework sets are hard but help you master the material and are indicative of the exams. He lets you have a cheat sheet for both the midterm and the final which is huge
843,946521,4.0,4.0,Professor Guse was great this semester. He had very fair grading criteria and always made himself available outside of class. The daily quizzes and Aplia assignments were also great because they balance out your grade if you do poorly on one of the midterms. Every test is straightforward and is based on material discussed in class.
844,946521,3.5,3.0,Quizzes every day of class. Notes are very random. Goes on tangents sometimes. Overall not a bad class
845,946521,5.0,3.0,"Great lecturer and really helpful in office hours. Many complain about the difficulty, but a very basic understanding of calculus is all that you need to get an A. Attendance is not mandatory, but he flips a coin to decide if there's a quiz every day."
846,946521,2.5,5.0,"Guse is the man. By far the most difficult class, but this means if you put in the work and make a good grade it's the most rewarding grade you will ever receive. I personally had to relearn calculus for this class, so study up if you're confused at all.  I came out of this class with a much better understanding of economics and math. "
847,946521,3.5,4.0,"Professor Guse's Econ 210 is a right of passage for Econ majors; it separates the ones who got from the ones who don't. Very calculus-centric, so study up before taking the class. Study 30+ for the midterm and the final and you will come out with an A. Most rewarding class I've taken at W&L so far. Guse is awesome"
848,946521,4.5,5.0,Really really tough class but Guse makes it less tough on you by helping out a lot. Take it but by no means expect an A! My favorite econ class at w&l so far
849,946521,5.0,4.0,"This class is extremely difficult, and most people receive some type of B. However, Prof. Guse is one of the best lecturers I have had at w&l and if you take detailed notes you will have a major head start on the HWs. Go to office hours and start the HWs early and this class is manageable for most"
850,946521,2.0,5.0,Guse makes a terribly boring class not that bad. He's a nice guy and a below average lecturer in terms of clarity. Most people wind up with a B. Don't be intimidated. Keep up with the work. Do HW's in a group. Study for exams ahead of time. Make a baller cheat sheet.
851,946521,4.5,5.0,"The class is hard to begin with and he has very high expectations anyway. that being said his lectures are excellent as long as you can take his theoretical math and apply it, often without concrete examples. If you're a math genius this class is a breeze, and if not you better go to office hours for every homework"
852,946521,3.0,5.0,"This class was extremely hard, and Guse certainly will not take it easy on you. However, if you make his office hours routinely, expect to end up with a decent grade in the class."
853,946521,4.0,4.0,"This guy is the man. It's a hard class, but he really knows what he's talking about. Easy to take notes, and he's helpful outside of class. Tests are hard but he curves them a lot. You just have to stay up to date with the work. Really good guy"
854,946521,4.5,5.0,"Micro theory is an inherently difficult class that he perhaps makes even harder by using math-speak instead of normal english. Don't be intimidated though, if you do your work and study very hard you'll probably end up with some kind of B after the curve"
855,946521,4.0,5.0,Lectures are very math-intensive. Pop quizzes and homeworks are hard to do well on. Exams were even harder but curved heavily
856,946521,4.5,4.0,"Don't take his class expecting an A, it's extremely hard to get one. His exams are on a totally different level with the usual problem sets. Otherwise, he is very helpful and friendly, so do go to office hours if you're struggling. ECON 302 is an interesting class, very math-intensive but once you get hold of the fundamentals it'll become easier."
857,946521,4.5,5.0,"Awesome professor if you speak math. Nightmarish if you don't. Don't procrastinate the problem sets and make sure you understand them. Good sense of humor and interesting to listen to, if you're follow everything."
858,946521,2.5,5.0,"Well, he certainly knows his subject. However, he seems to explain information in a deliberately opaque manner. And, unless you are extremely good at math you will not get a good grade in this course."
859,946521,4.0,4.0,"Guse is a good guy, but not the best lecturer. If you really want to understand the material, you need to go in for office hours. The text for the class is pretty tough to get through, and the homework is nearly impossible. Don't take this and expect and A. He curves grades so that the majority of students fall between a 2.8-3.2."
860,946521,4.0,5.0,"Class is very mathy but unavoidable if you are an econ major.  The homeworks take forever and you have no shot at getting them right unless you meet with him for an extended period of time every week. Nearly impossible to do well on tests but there is a huge curve on them. Don't really learn a lot of material, but learn how to think."
861,946521,2.5,5.0,He is wayyy hard.
862,946521,3.5,5.0,He is one of the best teachers in the school and his shirts are awesome.
863,946521,4.0,5.0,"Mediocre lecturer, but otherwise a brilliant and helpful prof. HW sheets can take a long time to do correctly, but he is very available and willing to help.  Guse's 210 is a must-take."
864,946521,4.5,4.0,"Excellent teacher! Super smart and helpful and approachable, always willing to help no matter how many questions you have. Class is really challenging but also fun and I feel like I learn a lot from this class than any other econ class I've taken."
865,946521,5.0,1.0,"THE GUSE IS THE MAN!!! Fun class, not too hard."
866,946521,5.0,2.0,"The whole point of the curve is so that you don't have to ace the exam. If you get an 80% , you will probably get an A+. I echo the other who say that Guse IS THE MAN!!!"
867,946521,1.5,5.0,"I'm surprised by some of these other ratings, because the consensus towards Guse in my class was decidedly negative.  Admitted to us in class he would not have even aced his own exam.  If you like being completely confused, I guess he's your man."
868,946521,4.5,5.0,Best teacher at W&L
869,946521,5.0,2.0,The greatest Econ professor there ever was.
870,946521,5.0,2.0,"Great Professor, actually teaches econ unlike some professors in the department. Very clear."
871,946521,1.5,5.0,Nearly impossible to learn anything in his class without learning strictly from the book...his confusion over simple calculus symbols makes him impossible to understand....avoid in any intro class
872,1755483,3.0,5.0,Dr higgs is a tough lecturer to follow. His exams are hard and so are the quizzes and homework. But he is very understanding and allows a lot of room for extra points. He also does an end of year curve which helps alot. Over all I would take again just because he genuinely cares about his students.  
873,1755483,4.0,4.0,"His lectures were a little hard for me to follow, but he gives amazing help during office hours. He is a funny guy and is super relaxed. Gives some online homework and quizzes. Exams are my harder than any of my other classes, but also chemistry doesn't come naturally to me. I had to study a TON for this class."
874,1755483,5.0,5.0,"Organic Chemistry is one of the hardest classes at W&L. Conceptually the material is very difficult and involves a lot of rote memorization. That being said,  Higgs makes the class very enjoyable. He's funny, exceptionally smart, and makes the class very enjoyable.  Quizzes and tests are difficult, but he is clear about his expectations."
875,1755483,5.0,5.0,He actually made organic enjoyable. So much so that I'm taking him again next semester.
876,1755483,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Higgs is probably the best professor I have ever had at W&L. He makes his expectations very clear right from the beginning and he is ALWAYS willing to make time to help you out. Super approachable, funny, and overall just a great guy. We're lucky to have him teach here. "
877,1755483,3.0,5.0,"The first month's material he did not explain well and even admitted this during office hours. He is inexperienced but is improving in his teaching methods, and that is expected. Overall, an okay professor, but nothing special"
878,1755483,5.0,4.0,"Organic is a tough class regardless who teaches it, but Dr. Higgs makes the class a lot more enjoyable. He is always willing to help anyone and is really passionate about the subject. Amazing office hours and overall just an amazing professor."
879,1755483,5.0,4.0,"Unbelievably helpful. He is one of the best professors I have ever had, especially considering it was his first year teaching. Organic is a very difficult class, but he makes the material very clear and interesting. His genuine enthusiasm and care makes students willing to put in the work for his class. I can't recommend him highly enough."
880,1755483,4.5,5.0,"Dr.Higgs is a wonderful professor, always very willing to make time for his students and stay late to answer questions.  He's very approachable and it is astonishing how good of a professor he is for his first year of teaching.  The class is entertaining and while Organic is a very difficult class, he makes it enjoyable to come to class."
881,1755483,4.5,5.0,"Very helpful. Very nice guy. Good professor, though the lectures seem to gloss over some of the details that you are later expected to recall. Overall, I hope he chooses to teach here for a while. W&L is lucky to have him."
882,1755483,5.0,4.0,"Great guy. Hard grader but it's a difficult class, so that should be expected."
883,1755483,4.5,5.0,"I took Organic his first year.  His course was modeled on Dr. France's, which means you will master OCHEM but will have to study very hard just to pass.  He's actually a really great professor, amazing for his first year, and very helpful both in and outside of class.  Parting wisdom: if you're taking OCHEM at W&L, you're gonna have a bad time."
884,1864029,1.0,5.0,"Super strict on deadlines, even if one minute past its late. Her tests are unnecessarily difficult and provided astronomical amount of work after each class."
885,1864029,4.5,3.0,"I think that she learned from her experience last year as a first year professor. Lectures could be a little boring at times, but the material she presented was always crystal clear. All the assignments were very manageable, although she is a very picky grader. She's very nice and was extremely helpful. Would definitely take a class from her again!"
886,1864029,2.0,5.0,"Very strict homework policy, boring lecturer, and her tests are absurdly long and not well structured. If i can help it I will never take a course from her again."
887,1864029,1.0,5.0,"Real brutal, her lectures are very boring and not very helpful relating to the homework or test material. She is very strict on homework policy and her tests are insanely hard. I would avoid at all costs. Worst teacher I've had at W&L so far."
888,1864029,1.0,5.0,"Lectures are useless. does offer lots of office hours but they are also useless. tests are impossible. Avoid at all costs, worst teacher I've experienced in 3 years at WnL"
889,1864029,1.0,4.0,"This class was incredibly boring. She's a better sleep aid than ZZZquil. I'm even a math/science person and it was all I could do to keep from snoozing, even in the middle of the morning.  She takes off for the stupidest stuff and puts problems on the tests that are way harder than the examples in class.  Overall: 1/5 would not recommend."
890,2046309,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Brotzman is amazing!! Pov 101 wasn't that easy, but I learned so much about poverty and its relationship to my hometown. I found the material to be very important and applicable to my future. I wish everyone could take it."
891,2046309,3.5,3.0,This is a class everyone should take.  She doesnt hand out A's but really makes you work for it and at the end of the day you learn a lot from her.   She can be a little condescending but it's in a humorous way.
892,2046309,3.5,3.0,"Very passionate about the topic, and challenges the students to reevaluate their ideas. Fair grader."
893,2046309,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Brotzman is a new professor, but she is very interesting and knowledgeable in poverty studies. She is always prepared and has interesting topics. Daily readings aren't necessary to do all the time, and can be excessive at times. She is a very fair grader. The class discussions got heated, but Professor Brotzman never let on to her own beliefs."
894,2756965,3.0,3.0,"Professor Rodriguez-Newhall is passionate about teaching and her students. That being said, she assigns an unmanageable amount of readings that are primarily based on theories. She's easily accessible and perfectly willing to help students, but the assignments are tedious and I would not take one of her classes again."
895,1186151,5.0,3.0,"Professor Humston is an absolutely amazing man who is very understanding to his students. The topics he covers are very interesting and useful for everyday situations. There are not a whole lot of activities for homework, as it mainly consists of online textbook reading or scientific research paper readings."
896,1186151,5.0,4.0,"Humston is my favorite teacher on campus. I would take every class of his if I had the chance. He is super passionate about his work and it shows through in his teaching. In Fisheries Management, Humston thrived... therefore so did the class. Awesome guy, awesome classes, would highly recommend."
897,1186151,4.0,4.0,"This class was interesting and seems to be better than other intro bio courses. He is a hard grader and is very specific and is quick to take points off on tests. If you study, you can get a good grade in the class. Highly recommend"
898,1186151,3.0,3.0,"Humston is overall caring teacher who wants you to be successful in the class. The class requires studying but if you put in effort you should end up with an A-. He is very helpful at office hours and will make sure you understand the topic. Papers are easy As, tests are a little harder."
899,1186151,5.0,3.0,Prof. Humston is awesome please take him if you can his BIO is far less painful than any of the other professors
900,1186151,5.0,4.0,Makes lectures super interesting. Very accessible outside of class. Fair grader and will explain exactly where you missed points.
901,1186151,5.0,3.0,"super cool guy, loves fishing, loves the environment. Debates are easy as long as you dont put them off til the last minute. Papers he grades a little tougher but there are only two. No final, and you learn a lot. This class made me want to major in enviro. Dont really have to do the readings, but its better if you do, he loves participation"
902,1186151,5.0,2.0,"I could not be more of a fan of Dr. Humston. Hands down the best professor Ive ever had at W&amp;L, and I know for a fact that many, many other students share that opinion. A genuinely caring guy who makes class an absolute joy. Im about to take my second class with him and cant wait. Do yourself a favor: take a class with him!"
903,1186151,5.0,2.0,Great professor and a  genuinely good guy. The class is interesting and tests are very fair. Put in the moderate amount of work and you can get an A no problem.
904,1186151,5.0,2.0,"He's the best. Class is entirely discussion based. No tests-- rather than memorizing information, you read academic papers for homework and discuss in class. Graded on participation (though if scared to speak in class, allowed to speak to him privately for other options--he is so kind), 3 essays and a debate (with 2 other students). Low pressure."
905,1186151,5.0,3.0,"Humston is a great professor who is super enthusiastic about what he's teaching. Even if you're not big into science, he makes his lectures enjoyable and the tests are pretty straight forward."
906,1186151,5.0,2.0,Such a gem
907,1186151,5.0,2.0,Prof Humston is the MAN! This was by far the easiest BIOL 111 course to take. I barely studied for any of his tests and easily got A's on them. He does expect you to work hard on your papers but he's so available for help that as long as you go and see him you'll be in good shape! I would recommend him over and over again!!
908,1186151,5.0,2.0,"Had Robert for Bio and Env. Genuine, smart, and helpful. He really cares that you grasp the material. He will cover less topics than other teachers, but he'll break it down much more thoroughly. Fly-fisherman, statistician, and outdoorsman. Overall, awesome guy. Definitely someone to take for several classes. Great adviser material. "
909,1186151,5.0,2.0,I took this class almost 2 years ago and still find myself using the information I learned here in my current classes. Grey professor and a great guy!
910,1186151,5.0,1.0,"Humston is an amazing intro to Bio professor. The material you cover in the class is very involving and you learn how to critically read research papers. That being said, he's not the most rigorous of the Bio professors. If you'd like an easier A or to fulfill a science requirement, I'd recommend Humston. He is always there for his students."
911,1186151,5.0,2.0,Humston is the man.  He is the best teacher I ever had.  He makes class fun and engaging.  I learned a ton in his class.  If you meet with him he is really nice and very helpful.  I would recommend him to both science kids and people looking to get rid of science credits
912,1186151,5.0,1.0,"Marine Bio was AWESOME! HE didn't assign a book, so you save $200 or something like that. The material was pretty simple, although it can seem kinda boring if you aren't into some of it. Tegrity is the key to survival. Probably one of the easier 111 sections. Really cool guy, definitely made me feel comfortable talking in class."
913,1186151,5.0,1.0,"I found a lot of the class readings and Prof. Humston's lectures to be boring. But Prof. Humston is a great guy, I went to meet with him once and he is very passionate about the subject and really wants to help. I found him to be a very easy grader. Not too much work. Overall, great guy, I just wasn't too interested in environmental studies."
914,1186151,4.5,2.0,Humston is a great professor. Easy to talk to and friendly and the class really isn't that hard. Do well on the papers and express an interest inthe subject and you'll come out with a good grade. Highly suggest this class.
915,1186151,5.0,2.0,A living legend!
916,1186151,3.5,4.0,"Class isn't too hard. He grades pretty hard on the 3 papers but the workload is minimal. Nightly readings get old after a while and his lectures begin to become more boring. Overall, not a bad class to take for an FDR."
917,1186151,4.5,2.0,"Good Prof. Really cares about his students so take the time to get to know him by going to office hours. Not a very difficult class, but interesting. Regular reading but not a huge amount."
918,1186151,5.0,3.0,"A great teacher, he's kept the class interesting and really informative.  The articles and journals we read add another perspective to the class as well.  A fair grader and a really cool guy.  He's just furthered my interest in biology even more.  I definitely recommend taking his class if possible.  Well worth it!"
919,1186151,5.0,4.0,"He is my favorite professor!  Great guy who is fun, funny and you'll learn a lot with ease.  He is not an outrageous grader and knows how to keep a class on its toes and interested.  Pretend to be a Buffalo Bills fan!"
920,2238824,4.0,2.0,"Professor Bragaw is one of the most passionate politics professors I've met. He has a tendency to let his lectures drift to topics loosely related to the subject at hand, but that's just part of how he teaches. Feedback is limited, but he is eager to help and meet with students."
921,2238824,4.0,3.0,"People have varied opinions on Bragaw because he's somewhat ADD, but in the end he's a funny guy who puts a lot of thought into his lectures and will provide you with an interesting class. I did very little of the reading, didn't read the book for the final 2 essays at all, got a B+ on the final and A- in class. Gives very limited feedback."
922,2238826,4.0,3.0,"Very organized: in class structured participation days, 3 difficult homeworks, final paper, final presentation, midterm, exam. All worth 20%. Manageable and allows for group work on homeworks. Exams can be a little tough if you leave it for night before."
923,2238826,5.0,3.0,"I've had him for two classes and despite what people say he's a very clear and organized lecturer. Super enthusiastic about the material, conveys it well, and generally answers questions well too. He's also really easy to reach outside of class. He's probably the most organized prof I've had in the Williams school and he obv enjoys teaching."
924,2238826,4.0,2.0,"Goodenberge's microeconomics is a good class.  He barely assigns any homework, the lectures are easy to follow, and the tests aren't as hard as the other reviewers are making them sound.  He gave a 15% curve on the last test so it's not like he wants us all to do poorly."
925,2238826,2.0,5.0,seriously don't take him. his tests are ridiculously hard and barely cover any of the material learned in class. he's also is not available to meet often.
926,2238826,1.0,4.0,"For these tests, which make up 75% of your grade, he gives you a very comprehensive review guide of what you have covered up to this point.  The tests then proceed to not have anything on them related to the review or what you have covered at all.  Also, he is not good at actually teaching the material, and everyone in my class agrees."
927,2238826,2.0,4.0,"A pretty poor prof that made me struggle when I took honors econ just last year. Even when you think you might know what you're doing, he'll grade tests ridiculously, unnecessarily hard and/or include a bunch of stuff you've never seen before. Don't recommend."
928,2404711,1.0,5.0,He sucks.
929,2404711,3.0,4.0,Curves the tests but they are still quite hard. Tries hard but I felt like he wasn't effective.
930,2404711,4.0,3.0,"Has changed how he teaches Stats. Tests are harder than average, but if you know the material, you will do fine. Tests still end up being slightly curved. He gets a slightly bad rep, but he's been very good this semester. I wouldn't &quot;avoid&quot; INTR 202 with Verdon at all. If you honestly learn what he's teaching, his tests are completely fine."
931,2404711,1.0,4.0,Super hard tests. Awkward instructor. Wish I took it with someone else.
932,2404711,4.0,3.0,"Andrew Verdon is an absolute chiller. Awkward in the best way, super understanding, and very funny. His lectures can be boring and he essentially reads straight from the textbook. Homework rocks because a 60% equates to 100%. However, tests are BRUTAL. They are extremely long and the curve saves everyone. Chances are if you failed you got a B-"
933,2404711,5.0,4.0,"My mans. Andy is a bro. He will make all of his tests impossible, but don't worry everyone will do bad and he curves it so that a F becomes a B. Also a D on your homework becomes an A. He may have the worst social skills I have ever seen, but has managed to constantly make fun of himself in an amazingly hysterical way."
934,358765,5.0,1.0,"This guy is hilarious! He also wants to help each student which is great. Also, the exam is open notes, open internet, open anything and he gives you a long time to take it. You can't help but pass."
935,358765,4.0,1.0,Fitness or Fatness - pretty much Awesome with a capital A.
936,358765,4.0,1.0,I love Franke! He tries to be so hard core with his tennis class.
937,358765,5.0,1.0,Franke is a god among men
938,358765,5.0,1.0,Franke=The Man  Talk to him about turkey hunting and you will walk on water.
939,358765,5.0,1.0,Franke is the Man!  Enough said.
940,358765,3.5,3.0,I second the original review—Coach Franke thinks his tennis class is a branch of the armed services.
941,358765,5.0,3.0,"&quot;Fitness or Fatness&quot; echoes Coach Franke. For a school that requires 5 gym credits, this man runs his tennis class like a boot camp. Expect to run, do excercises, and lots of tennis drills. Still, a pretty cool guy. Expect to run for an hour to"
942,1829239,5.0,4.0,Dr. T is awesome! I love her and would gladly take another class with her. She's not a super tough grader but she obviously expects you to put some effort in. Be prepared to look stuff up all the time for labs and pre-class assignments. Any projects are always group projects. Not an easy class but Dr. T really cares about us and will always help.
943,1829239,3.0,4.0,If you want an A get ready to learn like 40% of the material outside of the tutorials and workshops. you won't survive the labs without spending hours googling for each lab. a good mentor but her feedback in grading seems arbitrary and gives confusing advice if you go to her for help. didn't survive without working with other ppl in the class.
944,1829239,5.0,4.0,"people tend to not like her as a calc teacher, but shes a really good bio teacher. Gives so many opportunities for extra credit. Has quizzes that you can take unlimited times and they are open book. Literally so much group work though, spend so much time on that class I learned so much Straight out of russia, learn to translate bad grammar"
945,1829239,4.0,4.0,"She's really intimidating to begin with, but she will definitely warm up over the term. She has structured the class to ensure that people will all different familiarities with Calculus will be comfortable and also challenged. Do the book notes, and study for her quizzes as those are great grade buffers for the challenging tests."
946,1829239,5.0,4.0,"I don't see why the last person hated Dr. T so much, she rocks!  Yes, her class is very tough, but what class here isn't?  She's such a smart person and is so interesting to talk to.  I loved her Biological Rhythms class, even if it was at 8 am."
947,1829239,5.0,4.0,Dr. T was one of my favorite professors at W&L- go to office hours and get to know her!! She truly cares and works hard to make the course the most beneficial for her students. The course isn't as much about fundamental biology as I would've liked buttt learned a ton by a great professor!
948,1829239,5.0,4.0,GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! Dr. T rewards students who put in lots of time and ask her questions in office hours.
949,1829239,3.0,3.0,Group projects. 1 question quizzes 2-3 times a week that are super easy if you do the problems given ahead of time. Tests are hard. Exam harder. Not much extra credit. Grading on tests is confusing and changes for everyone.  
950,1829239,2.5,3.0,"Grading is really obscure and changes from student to student. Expects a lot but isnt always clear on how to please or give her what she wants. A TONNNNN of group work almost nothing else, which can be really good if youve got a good group and reallyyyy bad if you dont. No tests only projects, quizzes, and readingwriting  assignments."
951,1829239,4.0,3.0,Great professor.  It was a lot of work but I learned A TON and developed many professional skills.  She was always there to help you out if you ask for it.
952,1829239,3.0,3.0,"She is very nice and very accessible outside of class....always willing to help. However, the workload is a lot. She will email you with assignments Sunday night (that will sometimes take 2+ hours) and expect them to be submitted by 9AM Monday morning. Most of the time, you have less than 24 hours to complete an assignment."
953,1894779,2.5,2.0,"Burstein is blunt as a professor. He is sort of crude in his sense of humor. If that is your style, you will thoroughly enjoy the class. He's very big on participation. However, when papers come into play GO SEE HIM with ideas before you write. He will help with structure and format, plus aid in solidifying ideas. Odd professor. Enjoyable class. "
954,1894779,1.5,2.0,"Professor Burstein is a very smart man, and he knows it. As such, he likes students that reflect his opinion of a subject rather than those that challenge that opinion. Do exactly what he does and repeat exactly what he says and you'll get an easy A. His office hours are not particularly helpful, though, and his essay help is negligible."
955,2228603,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Walle is my favorite professor here! She makes Gothic literature sound like the most interesting topic in the world, and her class assignments are fair and easy. YOU MUST READ FOR THIS CLASS (she doesn't take participation lightly). I've received an A on every essay because I always talked with her before writing, do that. Seriously amazing."
956,2228603,5.0,2.0,I took the Gothic Novel writing seminar and it wasn't necessarily a topic I was super interested in but I ended up loving it! Professor Walle was super engaging and her assignments make you learn and love everything there is about gothic novels! Would definitely take another one of her classes if I have the chance.
957,2228603,4.0,2.0,"Average amount of writing for an intro to writing course, but above average reading where all of the essays were based off of the books, so you have to read. Very good feedback on essays and helped me learn well."
958,2228603,5.0,3.0,"Professor Walle is a kind, caring, and supportive person. She is always available outside of class, no matter what. She truly tries to get to know all of her students personally. She is brilliant, but also humble. Everyone loves her!! Class discussions are engaging and fun. She does not hand out As for papers, but if you work hard, you will receive"
959,2228603,5.0,3.0,"Professor Walle is the reason I'm majoring in English! Definitely lots of reading, but it's very interesting and relevant! Very respectful of and interested in students' ideas! Go to her office hours, she is more than willing to help you work through your ideas for any assignment! Participate, read, and listen to her feedback and you'll be good!"
960,2228603,5.0,3.0,"Professor Walle is my absolute fave! Her classes are discussion based and super-interesting, and she is willing to discuss anything relevant to the text. The reading and essay prompts are super interesting, and if you have an idea for an essay that does not fall under the prompt, she will let you pursue it. Awesome professor!!"
961,2228603,5.0,3.0,"So, so wonderful! She was by far my favorite professor for the semester! There's quite a bit of reading, but not an overwhelming amount. Almost every class was discussion based, and she started out with what we thought was interesting and taught us the important stuff from there. Go to class, write well, and participate and you'll do great!"
962,2228603,5.0,3.0,Great prof for first year writing seminar. Leads discussions really well and picks interesting readings. Grades papers very fairly
963,2228603,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor at W&L to date. Assigned lots of reading, but all relevant to the class. All essays had a choice of prompts and could easily be tailored to each individual as long as she clears it ahead of time. Created a fun environment from an otherwise boring FDR, absolutely will take a class from her again."
964,2122110,5.0,4.0,"Intermediate Latin w/ Dance was a LOT of work, but I definitely think it was all worth it, and I learned more from him in this class than any other Latin class I've taken. He's a very genuine and great person and wants to see everyone succeed, just be prepared to put in effort! Be prepared for a lot of Cicero."
965,2122110,4.0,4.0,"He seems like a chill professor, but that could not be further from the truth. Professor Dance has very high expectations for his students' work. He wants to see everyone succeed. You can definitely get away with not doing much in/out of class, just know you'll fail. This class is very time consuming.... expect to put in a lot of work."
966,2122110,5.0,4.0,Amazing professor! He cares so much. He is very very very difficult but if you participate and do your readings it will be well worth it. This is by far one of my favorite classes!
967,2122110,4.0,3.0,"Professor Dance is great. He is very passionate about the topics he is teaching and loves to have discussions. He is a little tough on grading tests and papers, however participation is a large part of the grade so it balances out nicely!"
968,2122110,4.0,3.0,"Professor Dance is a solid professor! He has clear expectations (do the reading ahead of class so that you will be prepared to site read in class). If you do the homework and study for the tests, you should do well. Final exam was not cumulative, just a final test. He is a tough professor, but hard work pays off with him."
969,2122110,4.0,4.0,"Professor Dance is wonderfully enthusiastic. He makes you read and argue directly from the Latin, not from your own translations. He's definitely difficult and has a sixth sense for detecting unprepared students and hounding them. However he will get you excited about your course work. I'd definitely take him again."
970,1800584,1.0,4.0,The worst professor ever. He appears to be so sweet but do not be fooled. His J201 class is so much work. You are guaranteed to have at least 3 writing assignments due a week. Once I received a fact error F on an assignment after copying and pasting a lede he wrote for me. He likes things his way and there are no exceptions.
971,1800584,5.0,3.0,A true legend
972,1800584,4.0,3.0,"Professor Cumming is an awesome professor and a really sweet guy. He may not be the easiest grader and can tend to forget things, but once you get to know him you'll love his class."
973,1800584,3.0,3.0,"Although he can be very spacey, Professor Cumming is a great man who is willing to help if you seek him out. He is not always clear with assignment guidelines, however he does put thought and time into feedback and grading."
974,1800584,3.0,3.0,"He is very knowledgeable about journalism, however he is never clear on what he wants. Easily distracted and gets off topic. Gives assignments with no clear direction. Class can be entertaining but I don't feel like I am really learning."
975,1800584,5.0,3.0,Journalism 201 is a tough class regardless of who you take it with. Chances are you probably won't get an A. But Cumming is a super helpful professor and easily reachable outside of the classroom. If you go to office hours you can get so much more out of the class. I would definitely take another class with him.
976,1800584,4.0,3.0,So far my favorite professor at w&l. I was shocked at how helpful he was with problems I encountered during reporting on my final story for the class (he even did a little reporting for me). Super outgoing guy even though he's a bit spacey and reminded me why I think a lot of people in the communications industry are so great
977,1800584,3.0,2.0,"Space cadet. Really nice guy and is very smart and helpful one on one. HIs problem is an utter lack of structure. don't know about his journalism classes, but I went the entire semester and barely knew what I was supposed to be doing. I didn't really get much instruction on how to write. Couldn't recall what we talked about in class. Very nice guy"
978,1800584,5.0,3.0,"Professor Cumming is the most devoted teachers you'll find on campus. His interest in the Civil Rights Movement becomes vivid in his teachings. Also, his journalistic background urges students to think of the influence of the press and to be journalists ourselves.We had weekly movies (with popcorn) as another teaching method.Favorite teacher ever."
979,1995159,3.0,3.0,"Your typical ""Rocks for Jocks"" teacher. Relatively easy class, but hands out a lot of busy work... if you plan on majoring I'd stay away as she doesn't teach the material exceptionally well. Highly recommend for non-majors, she's really nice and is much easier compared to her peers"
980,1995159,2.5,4.0,"New to teaching, so lectures aren't great. Tough grader and hard on deadlines. Pulls out some wonky questions for tests, and you can expect to simply not know at least 10%  of them."
981,1995160,5.0,1.0,"Every girl should take self-defense! It's super low key (classes last 30-60 minutes, not 2 hours), but I feel a lot better about my ability to protect myself and get away if I'm assaulted. Lisa is fantastic, and is always full of energy despite her insane schedule as a public safety officer."
982,864665,4.5,4.0,"Kirakofe is extremely knowledgeable, has hilarious anecdotes from his travels around the world; has an incredible breadth and depth of knowledge of the Muslim world. ""Politics and Islam"" was not a religion class; it delved into political Islam and it's effects in western Europe and post-9/11 terrorism. Read the books - those are critical to exams."
983,864665,4.5,4.0,"Kirakofe is a former senior staffer for the U.S Senate on Foreign Relations, and consistently proved that he's an expert in U.S foreign relations. An excellent class; slightly unstructured in class discussion, but I learned in incredible depth about current events in the Middle East and Eurasia. Watched and analyzed Mubarak's fall live."
984,864665,5.0,2.0,"Great class! I took Global Politics with him and I really liked how broad the topics are. This is a class where you'll learn about so many other things and perspectives. He tries to enlarge your circle of knowledge but also let you focus on something you're interested in for the term paper. Yes, he assigns a lot of reading, but it definitely helps!"
985,864665,5.0,2.0,"This was one of the best classes I took at Washington and Lee, especially because it connected textbook material to current events. Professor Kiracofe is incredibly insightful as a US foreign policy expert. His classes were very well structured and he has always been very helpful with assignments, as well as other advice, such as grad school/jobs."
986,864665,3.0,2.0,"Enjoyed the class because I liked learning about current events. I can't tell you much about globalization theories though. Lots of reading, but he doesn't enforce the reading with his lectures. Not easy to contact outside of the classroom and rarely emails back. Classes are extremely laid back. Not good for you if you plan on majoring in politics."
987,864665,4.0,2.0,Kiracofe is an amusing person. He knows pretty much everything about everything and goes off on long tangents. Read the text and the tests are very fair and does his best to accommodate students if there are any problems.
988,864665,2.5,2.0,Kiracofe is that f*cking dude for Global Politics.  The man knows just about everything about everything.  His tests are pretty easy if you read and study the textbooks.  Besides the fact his classes are usually boring as all get out there's not a whole lot wrong with them.  Just bring a computer and you can entertain yourself.
989,864665,2.0,3.0,"Really knows his stuff. Tests are based almost entirely off of textbook, making class pretty worthless. Class discussions are random. Class is also definitely not mandatory. People skipped all the time. Keep up with the readings - cramming is really tough in this class. Overall a really smart, interesting, nice guy."
990,864665,4.0,4.0,"Very knowledeable, knows his stuff. Classes are very interesting but the tests are fairly tough. Overall, great professor; you'll learn a lot."
991,864665,4.0,2.0,"Lectures are a bit scattered but always entertaining. He is an interesting person and very knowledgeable on the subject. His tests are pretty much all on the readings so do them, study them, and you will be alright. I highly enjoyed his class and highly recommend taking him."
992,864665,2.0,4.0,His lectures are very scattered and unstructured. His tests are based solely on the textbooks. You must keep up with the reading and have a very good memory (especially of names) or else you will do poorly.
993,864665,5.0,3.0,"Awesome Professor, really takes an appreciation of his students, and he has so much to teach from his experience with G'int, highly recommend his class"
994,864665,4.5,4.0,"Great Class, Best Section.  Clear, insightful.  I would highly recommend it."
995,864665,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professor's I have ever had.  I entered the class, Islam and Politics, with no experience in Islamic studies.  After a month with Prof. Kiracofe I discovered that I wanted to focus the rest of my college studies on Islamic affairs.  Prof. Kiracofe helped arrange a semester abroad.  Take his class."
996,864665,1.5,3.0,"I am unsure if Kiracofe is even full time at W&L. I think he might go to VMI as well. Anyway, his lectures are pointless and you are unable to grab any important material from them.  Due to this fact you have no idea what is going to be on tests. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! It's a simple as that."
997,864665,1.0,3.0,"I took this class because people say the prof is easy.  This is not the case.  No matter how hard you try you will get the same B as everyone else, including the kid in back eating glue.  His lectures consist of ADHD ramblings and meaningless diagrams on the board.  If you want to learn, take someone else.  If you want an easy A, you won't get that"
998,864665,2.0,2.0,"He is a really nice guy and so into politics, but his teaching style is really to stick to the readings and not branch out much more than that. Definitely a lecturer, you won't really get a word in, and his tests are totally random but all based in the massive amounts of reading and fairly easy if you actually DID the reading."
999,864665,3.0,3.0,"really nice guy, willing to work with you. grades fairly easily. tests really random."
1000,864665,2.0,3.0,"A really boring teacher, doesn't even really teach but just reads from the text. His tests aren't hard but they are totally random-he does a really poor job making it clear what material will be tested."
1001,1702296,4.5,2.0,Very straightforward but boring class. Tests were predictable and pretty fair. You can really tell she knows her stuff about statistics if you go to her office hours. she's a safe option
1002,1702295,5.0,3.0,"Coach Uhl is excited to see his students work hard. As long as you are willing to be punctual and put in the work while you're in class, you and him will get along very well. Helps to have experience running beforehand but is not a requirement."
1003,1702295,5.0,1.0,he is an amazing person and coach! super caring and understanding. 10/10 would recommend
1004,1702295,5.0,1.0,"One of my favorite people ever. If you get the change to take any class with him, you will not regret it. He is an outstanding teacher, coach, and all-around person. One of my biggest role models as he cares so much for those around him and is always supporting you in any and every way that he can. I am very thankful for his influence on me."
1005,1702295,5.0,1.0,This was a weight-training class. He is extremely nice and helpful. Make sure you are punctual--that is half the battle! You'll be fine!  :D
1006,2199983,5.0,3.0,Amazing Guy! Great class. You have to do homework every day to do well
1007,2199983,4.0,3.0,"Professor Leva is an amazing professor because he is very kind, accommodating, and accessible. If you put in the daily work with VHL, actually read the textbook before a test or quiz, and actively participate in class, you'll learn French well and get a really good grade!"
1008,2199983,4.0,3.0,"Great class. I loved it. I learned a lot, and Professor Leva makes it easy and fun."
1009,2199983,5.0,2.0,"Leva is a great guy, and overall the class is pretty easy. He tries to make a lot of sports references to relate to french and it's hilarious. Not a great teacher but you get through the class. Awesome person, okay teacher."
1010,2199983,3.0,4.0,Not the best but not the worst.
1011,2199983,3.0,3.0,"Leva is all around a good guy. Fine for French. I struggled but because it is french, not due to him. He helps you out and if the class is not understanding it he'll make it open book. Nice guy, and American so he understands the problems."
1012,2163124,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Schreiber is one of the best professors I have had in college. In addition to this course, Ive taken every one he has offered and always been impressed with how easily he can explain difficult concepts and answer questions. Hell always make time for you in office hours and is incredibly helpful! The class is difficult but definitely worth it!"
1013,2163124,5.0,4.0,"My favorite professor! Explains things in a way a 5 year old could understand. Very interesting lectures, a cool and funny guy. Tests are multiple choice but are ""circle all that apply"" which screws with your mind. Reading is a good supplement but not absolutely necessary b/c his lectures are so clear and helpful. Absolutely loved this class!"
1014,2163124,5.0,3.0,He's great. Difficult subject matter but he presents it in hilarious ways (i.e. jumping across the room to demonstrate neurons firing) that make the concepts easy to comprehend. Makes it very clear what will be on the exam. Textbook reading is optional if you take lots of notes in class and fill out the study guides in detail. Lab is awesome too!
1015,2163124,4.0,4.0,"Fair grader but he will make you work for it. He really wants you to learn and is ready to help if you approach him. Do attend class and keep up with the reading, and the quizzes/tests won't be bad.  If yo are taking his spring term class prepare for A LOT of work, but it is all very interesting and informational so it's very much worth it"
1016,750006,5.0,4.0,"Kramer is the best teacher you will ever have. Take his class if at all possible. He will talk you through anything, even if it has nothing to do with his class. In short, Kramer is the man."
1017,750006,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors at W&L! Genuinely excited about what he's teaching and keeps class engaging. A lot of reading is involved, but he clarifies it well and is an energetic teacher. The semester was fantastic!"
1018,750006,5.0,2.0,FAV. TEACHER IN THE WHOLE WORLD. just had to come to this site to write it.
1019,750006,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher, excited about what he's teaching and keeps class interesting, my favorite teacher this term.  Highly recommend. Do the homework and do well on the vocab quizzes and youll be fine"
1020,750006,1.5,3.0,"Kramer is hands down the worst professor at this university. He doesn't teach, he just summarizes the plot of the novels we read because he refuses to prepare for class. He watches the clock hoping class will be over. He is a hard grader for what should be an easy course. Avoid this terrible, terrible professor if you can."
1021,750006,5.0,2.0,He's the man.
1022,750006,5.0,3.0,makes german fun. class is very lively and he explains concepts well.
1023,92603,5.0,4.0,"Very knowledgeable, clear and articulate.  He uses his own supplement, which includes very pertinent cases and well-thought out notes and articles.  Easily one of my favorite professors.  It helps that I love the subject matter, but even students who have no interest in international matters loved the class."
1024,92603,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I've had. Bring your A game because he's tough, but you'll learn SO much."
1025,92603,4.5,4.0,"One of the best profs I've had.  Visiting professor in Ottawa, wish he was full-time here.  EXTREMELY knowledgable and great experience.  If interested in Human rights, int'l criminal law -- he's the guy!"
1026,92603,5.0,4.0,one of the best profs at W&l.  Very intelligent.  Stimulating class discussions.  You WILL learn tons from him.
1027,2613694,5.0,2.0,"One of the most caring and real professors ever. As long as you put the effort in, you're going to do well. Cares so much about her students and the issues discussed in class."
1028,2613694,5.0,1.0,"The absolute sweetest, most empathetic professor out there"
1029,2613694,5.0,3.0,"Im not trying to be dramatic... but if you havent taken one of Professor Charleys classes MAKE THIS YOUR PRIORITY. She is everything you wish for in a professor - brilliant, understanding, and pushes for your best without breaking you. Honestly life changing and refreshing to see a professor who balances caring with challenging. TAKE HER."
1030,2613694,5.0,2.0,"Professor Charley brings her passion for empathy and her desire to cultivate meaningful community to the classroom every time. It seems abundantly clear that the passion she brings to her work extends far beyond educational purposes, but rather to fulfill a much broader goal of a more just society. She embodies the Shepherd mantra: people matter."
1031,2310594,2.0,5.0,Incredibly tough class. I would say I am a good math student and the way he formats his class made it very difficult to grasp topics. A lot of the content that you would practice would be way harder than seen in class. I spent most of my time trying to relearn the content from YouTube.
1032,2310594,1.0,5.0,"I have a lot of respect for professors even if I don't do well in their class. But this professor has to be the worst professor I have ever had. Obviously smart, but terrible teacher. He overcomplicates his 20 min lectures over Zoom taught over ppt and then expects you to work through to the practice problems yourself. My brain is rotting."
1033,2310594,1.0,4.0,"Attending lectures and office hours did not help at all. He does not like when you ask him questions. He makes simple calculus more difficult than it has to be and did not fairly assess us on our calculus I skills. He is also not very approachable and not willing to help. Even if you're a math genius, do not take his class."
1034,2310594,1.0,4.0,He sucks. Just actually sucks. don't know how else to put it. Is the worlds most awkward human being ever. so awkward he cant even teach. Doesn't know my name and its week 11. I haven't heard of a single person who actually likes him. Don't take his class unless you want self-inflicted torture.
1035,2310594,2.0,4.0,If I could describe his grading in two words it would be: stupid tough. It is safe to assume that if he can take off points from your homework then he will. Likes to teach via videos he posts. THE HOMEWORK / PRACTICE PROBLEMS WILL APPEAR ON TESTS (word for word) so memorize them if you can.
1036,2310594,2.0,5.0,"Hardy's class was incredibly difficult because he would over-complicate problems and tell us you just have to look and realize how to simplify it, so I found it hard to actually practice the calc concepts. Moves very fast and does not explain well. The only reason I passed was because he made HW 50% of our grade."
1037,2310594,2.0,4.0,"Professor Hardy is one of the worst teachers I've ever had. He overcomplicates and speeds through all of the material. Furthermore, his grading and feedback on tests and HW are minimal and very unclear. His office hours are worthless as he practically refuses to help."
1038,2310594,2.0,4.0,"The course material is extremely difficult, and Professor Hardy moves through concepts at a fast pace. He also spends too much time explaining proofs instead of working example problems. Without prior knowledge of integrals and integrating volume, students will struggle. The homework, tests, and final were all difficult and frustrating."
1039,2310594,1.0,5.0,"So hard to follow in lecture, writes really fast and does not explain concepts well. Had to get a textbook to teach myself concepts. Least caring teacher I've had. Not very helpful or understanding if it doesn't come naturally to you and expects a ton of prior knowledge and doesn't care if you do well. Class and hw/tests are 100% different."
1040,2310594,1.0,4.0,If you like listening to a teacher lecture every day from start to beginning without giving examples he's the one for you. Every day he will put up an abstract proof and expect you to know everything that semi relates to this abstract proof whether or not you understand it. Office hours seem like a huge burden to him.
1041,2310594,5.0,3.0,"A guy who wants to make people all fall in love with math which is so beautiful and makes me wanna cry. As long as you do his homework well, you will be fine. Absolutely love him."
1042,2310594,2.0,4.0,Horrible. That's all I can really say. I don't usually do professor reviews but this guy is bad enough that I thought I would give it a try. Doesn't seem to care if you don't understand whats going and certainly doesn't want to go out of his way to help you. His grading is ridiculous and his feedback makes little to no sense. Will not take again.
1043,2310594,5.0,3.0,He is the BEST ever! You will learn so much in his class because he is always there to help you and wants you to succeed. He is a genuinely good person and a wonderful teacher.
1044,2310594,4.0,4.0,"Calc II is a difficult class especially for non-majors/engineering. He definitely tries to make sure that people are not left behind. We had a group test that really helped me. Tests were 30%, Final 20%, Homework 50%, which was huge. Homework was not a gimmie. In the end a difficult final was curved up to not destroy my final grade."
1045,2310594,4.0,4.0,"Awesome, quirky professor. Tough class but he makes it understandable. Words of the day and juggling before class are two of his most notable features"
1046,2310594,4.0,3.0,"At first, I thought he was one of the weirdest people I had ever met. But he gives a lot of partial credit on tests and it helps a lot. Homework is 50% of your grade for accuracy. He will never learn your name unless you do well on tests. One time he assigned a group test and it was brutal. He likes to juggle in class."
1047,1872322,2.5,2.0,Definitely tries to make the class entertaining and loves it when students participate. He is more helpful on feedback in office hours. Leland can be a picky grader but just follow the advice he gives for writing papers. I had him for children's literature and never read the books because I read them years before and was still able to participate. 
1048,1872322,4.5,4.0,"Amazing professor, best English professor I have had along with Keen. Talks just like the Foghorn Leghorn character from Bugs Bunny. Hilarious and Inspirational. He will go over your essay with you for 60-90 minutes each session and will repeat that until you and him are satisfied with your writing. "
1049,1872322,2.0,4.0,"very unclear. Took the class to fill an FDR. However he was helpful in office hours, but grading was tough. Readings are interesting but felt irrelevant to the class"
1050,1872322,1.5,3.0,"Very unclear on assignments and comments for revisions. Grades more to show that you've ""progressed"" throughout the semester so expect low grades at the beginning that might improve. Despite getting a 4 on the AP Lit exam, I got mediocre grades after multiple essay revisions. No mid-term or final which can be good or bad."
1051,2552258,5.0,2.0,"Professor Weissman is kind and amazing! His Ethics of International Relations class was fascinating. There is definitely reading to do but the lectures and assignments are interesting. You will have reflections and papers, but nothing crazy and it will not dominate your schedule. Pay attention, participate, try your best, and you will do great."
1052,2552258,5.0,1.0,"This was both an interesting and easy class. Professor Weissman is a super nice guy and really cares about the material he is teaching. With this being said, he cares a lot more about what you have to say than anything else, so his grading is definitely on the easy side. Highly recommend"
1053,2552258,5.0,2.0,"Professor Weissman is a great teacher all around. He gives good feedback on papers, doesn't give too much homework, is passionate about what he teaches, and is able to make difficult concepts understandable as he is extremely knowledgeable in the field of emerging technology."
1054,2552258,5.0,2.0,This professor was amazing. The homework is not long. There are only 4 papers to write no quizzes or tests. But more importantly the material is the most interesting ever. He started off by talking about human cloning and went up from there. Always very enthusiastic + understanding. Highly recommend. Coolest learning.
1055,2552258,5.0,2.0,"Professor Weissman is incredible. This was his first semester at W&amp;L, and he taught a freshman seminar. He was loved by every student in the class. He cares far more about the subject matter than grades, so he does grade on the easier side. He could not be a nicer and more reasonable teacher, especially when it comes to absences and grades."
1056,1872327,4.0,2.0,"As a nonmath major, I like to think Beanland is your best option if you are taking calculus for math credit. He has a fun personality and I felt he really cares about his students. The textbook is a must."
1057,1872327,4.0,2.0,Professor Beanland is not a dull math professor and attempts to keep boring math lectures interesting. It is calculus. So if you think it will be hard stay away. If you do not know your math skills Beanlnd is a great professor to try it with.
1058,1872327,4.0,3.0,best math professor
1059,1872327,4.0,5.0,"I really enjoyed Beanland's class - super engaging and so funny. But I also really had to work for my grade. I've always struggled in math, and Beanland's lectures were pretty fast-paced. Did a lot of learning on my own. The TA was great tho, and Beanland does want you to succeed!"
1060,1872327,4.0,5.0,"This was a weird class. We kinda learned math via discussion and did lots of homework. He's malleable and does care about his students, but he's only on campus three days a week. Take this class with friends, and it'll be fun, but otherwise you really gotta be great at math."
1061,1872327,3.0,3.0,Professor Beanland is a really nice person that he is always caring and willing to help students out. But I wouldn't say he's a great professor in terms of his lectures. His classes are fun but far from enough to prepare you well for the exams. You really have to teach yourself outside of class.
1062,1872327,4.0,1.0,Not a good teacher I would agree. He seems a little bit unorganised and you should definitely learn stuff by yourself outside class. But he is caring and grades fairly. He is humorous and hot though. ;)
1063,1872327,5.0,3.0,He's an amazing teacher!
1064,1872327,5.0,4.0,"Professor Beanland is still relatively new to statistics and probability, but he did a very solid job. He was always approachable and never graded too harshly either. The tests were very fair, and they were based on homework and in-class problems that we worked throughout the semester. I would definitely recommend taking a course with him."
1065,1872327,4.5,3.0,Professor Beanland was awesome this past semester. He was very easy to understand and was extremely helpful during office hours when I went to talk to him. His tests are a little tough but his quizzes and homework prepare you pretty well for them.
1066,1872327,4.5,4.0,Professor Beanland is hands down one of my favorite professors I have this semester. He is super funny and makes Calc 102 easy to understand. Always willing to help out during office hours and is very understanding. His tests are sort of hard but the way he formats his quizzes helps me learn so much. Definitely recommend him 
1067,1872327,3.5,3.0,"Professor Beanland is hilarious, and he presents the material in very entertaining ways. Office hours are very helpful. Really wants students to understand material."
1068,1872327,1.0,5.0,Not a fan
1069,1872327,4.5,3.0,Beanland in very engaging and entertaining. He is very helpful in office hours.  
1070,1872327,5.0,4.0,Overall excellent. Highly recommend to anyone.  
1071,1872327,1.0,5.0,I could not discourage anyone from taking a class with Beanland enough.
1072,1872327,4.5,3.0,"He was new to statistics but he did a really good job. He's approachable, smart and very willing to help. The class was pretty straightforward."
1073,1872327,5.0,4.0,Excellent experience. Very tough course. Makes you work hard but he is very accessible and helps a lot in office hours. 
1074,1872327,1.0,5.0,"Seems like a nice guy, but very poor at teaching the material. Also, very condescending towards students who do not understand the material, just very unprofessional and a terrible experience. Thought I wanted to major in math, but not anymore."
1075,1872327,1.0,4.0,"Terrible teacher. Totally unhelpful in office hours. Turns the course into a contest for who sucks up the most. If you're unfortunate enough to have to take a class with him, make sure you laugh at his jokes, otherwise it's impossible to get a good grade."
1076,1872327,3.5,3.0,"Beanland is engaging and funny, which keeps the class interesting, but his calc 102 class is pretty difficult. Every class he just does problems on the board the whole time and then the tests are much harder versions of these problems. The quiz system is great and keeps your grade up. Be prepared for hard tests, but with some work an A is possible"
1077,1872327,5.0,3.0,"Best teacher Ive ever had, hands down. And thats coming from a kid who literally failed the class. He teaches very well in class. The course is structured in a way where students understand how material builds on itself. Great guy, Incredible Teacher. "
1078,1872327,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, his presentations are engaging and interesting. He is an excellent professor to take after high school calculus."
1079,1872327,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Beanland is pretty clear and straightforward, do the optional HW if you have time. His office hours are helpful but super crowded since they're for all his classes. He usually has night study sessions before tests to go over study guides that he provides. His quiz system is the best, 3 chances per problem and your final score counts as a test."
1080,575947,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Wall is an amazing teacher--she facilitates discussion very well without letting the balance shift too much towards either herself or the students, she smoothly incorporates formal lectures into discussion, she is extremely helpful with writing and is a very fair grader. I highly recommend her"
1081,575947,2.0,5.0,k
1082,575947,2.0,5.0,"Don't take her classes. Period. The grading is completely subjective, even for an English class."
1083,575947,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, always willing to meet with students outside of class. Extremely helpful and leads very exciting discussions. She genuinely cares about her students, and tries to improve their writing skills. Her grading is tough, but very constructive."
1084,575947,3.5,5.0,"Hard grader, few A's given. I don't recommend taking her classes, there are simply easier graders at W&L. Very &quot;helpful&quot; and willing to meet outside of class. The problem is that different people think in different ways, and if your brain doesn't work like her's does, you're not going to do well, regardless of how many times you meet with her."
1085,575947,4.5,3.0,"I can't offer too much more than has already been said. She is a relatively difficult grader, but fair for the most part. Take advantage of office hours before EVERY paper, its a huge help, plus she likes to see the effort. Class discussions can get a bit tangental at times, but if you participate its fun."
1086,575947,4.5,4.0,"Hard grader, but very fair.  She is very willing to meet for a conference to discuss papers, which is extremely helpful.  Very nice, overall a great teacher. I highly recommend her."
1087,575947,3.0,5.0,"She's really nice and makes class pretty interesting, but she is an extremely difficult grader. Very reluctant to give A's. She is happy to conference with you before and after any paper you write, but don't count on making an A in her class."
1088,575947,5.0,2.0,I am definately not an English person but she made the course interesting. Only 5 papers and no final exam. Not too much reading either. Very fair grader. Be sure to go to see her before writing a paper. She gives you lots of helpful ideas and it gets you on her good side. Overall a very good teacher.
1089,575947,4.5,3.0,"She isn't that great. If you do everything on time, then you'll do fine. Also conference b4 every paper helps."
1090,575947,5.0,2.0,"She is awesome! I despised English before I had her, but she encourages you and it helps! Her classes are interesting. She also integrates some creative activities to make the classes more fun. Best English teacher I've ever had. The conferences with her definitely helps. Take advantage of it!"
1091,2185683,5.0,3.0,"Professor McClain's class is lecture and discussion/groupwork-based.  He's great at explaining the course material; if I ever felt confused about something learned in class, I would go to his office hours for 15 minutes and fully understand afterward.  Overall, he's a compassionate, friendly person and an amazing professor."
1092,2185683,4.0,2.0,"Professor McClain is a caring guy, super lighthearted, and a great presenter. However, his classes lack many practice problems and homework, so test problems are a bit unpredictable. Tests were open notes and unlimited attempts, but his online format was tedious and sometimes contained errors. I am not sure how much I really learned."
1093,2185683,5.0,3.0,"Professor McClain is a great lecturer, has lots of energy, and is just a great guy. He wants you to gain applicable skills, not just theoretical knowledge. Final grade was mostly dependent on lab reports. Professor McClain is also very willing to clarify things outside class and even spend time in the lab troubleshooting a circuit with you."
1094,2185683,5.0,2.0,"He really wants you to learn. There are chances to re-do similar problems on tests to regain points, and most test questions are combinations of homework problems. Lectures are easier to follow if you read through the chapter beforehand and he will work through example questions. Lab is also very reasonable, make time for the project though!"
1095,2185683,5.0,4.0,"Prof. McClain rocks!! His class makes me want to major in physics. I found electromagnetism, optics, and the little bit of modern physics to be really interesting, and the tests weren't terribly bad."
1096,2185683,4.0,4.0,He is very knowledgeable and always available for office hours.  He expects you to have read once in class but not too much homework outside of class.  He often teaches at very high level but tests are not even at level of homework problems.
1097,1845717,5.0,3.0,Prof. Hansen is an adjunct assistant professor of politics who taught POL-111 last year (AY 2012-2013). He is a true gentleman who treats all his students with respect and teaches in a very conversational and comfortable manner. His class has convinced me to pursue a degree in Politics with a concentration in Political Philosophy.
1098,2050521,5.0,3.0,Excellent.
1099,2050521,5.0,2.0,100%
1100,2050521,1.0,3.0,He has interesting content in his classes but he often prioritizes his needs and time over that of his students.
1101,2050521,5.0,2.0,"TAKE HIM. Professor Tallie gives fun, energetic lectures that make his students become as interested in the topic as he is. He also genuinely cares about his students, never tries to trick you, and is always available to talk about life or your schoolwork after class or in office hours. Like the other review said, his perspective is needed."
1102,2050521,5.0,1.0,"I took T.J Tallie for for a global history class. It was one of the few classes that I took where I genuinely felt like a better person after every class. He's hilarious, inspirational, and offers a perspective that the homogenous W&L desperatly needs. Also you WILL get an A, only cursory effort is required. 20% of our grade was a map quiz so...."
1103,573914,4.5,3.0,Literally best teacher I have ever had in my life. He will definitely make a positive impact in your life.
1104,573914,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Jack's class was always fun and interesting.  His tests are straight off of the powerpoints, so if you memorize them and understand the concepts you are golden.  He likes to get the class involved, (he will use your names in questions on tests), and he gets very creative in how he asks test questions.  His course was great!"
1105,573914,4.5,5.0,"Dr, Jack is my favorite teacher I have had at W&L! He is very hard, and don't miss a class, but he makes you want to do well. His tests are fair, but hard. He is a great teacher and extremely helpful. If you don't like Bio I wouldnt take this class though. D. Jack is a very sweet man"
1106,573914,5.0,4.0,JUST THE # 1!!!!!!
1107,573914,4.5,4.0,"Intelligent, friendly, cheerful man.  Tries to make class material engaging and more meaningful by utilizing CNN and simulated case studies.  Very helpful during office hours and cares about your personal academic development and college life. Tests often take the entire allotted time and are detail-oriented. Textbook helpful in expanding class not"
1108,573914,4.5,5.0,"Can be completely two faced. Kind and caring one minute and seems like he hates you the next. Very unpredictable. You can never be sure what you'll get when dealing with him personally. On the whole, however, he is a fair, challenging professor who will make you work for your grade but ultimately will reward you for your efforts in class or lab."
1109,573914,5.0,3.0,Nice guy and very understanding
1110,573914,4.5,4.0,Very nice and helpful once you get to know him. Is not too damanding on the workload but his tests are definitely challenging and detailed.
1111,573914,4.0,3.0,"A mixed bag.  Totally Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde.  A sweet guy sometimes, but the devil other times.  Kind of babies his students...very detail-oriented tests.  But sadly, he is by far the best the biology department has to offer.  By far."
1112,1636828,5.0,4.0,My favorite accounting professor at W&L.
1113,1636828,3.5,4.0,"Shes strict but not unbearable. Her lectures are straight forward, but she has a strict attendance and no late hw policy. her tests are also pretty hard. There are alot worse accounting professors than her"
1114,324084,1.0,5.0,doesnt actually teach anything on the test. 
1115,324084,3.0,3.0,He's a little quiet but nice. Write down everything he says in his lectures and study it all. The quizzes are only moderately difficult but the way he graded the free response sections is painful. Overall fine though just make sure to study the lectures and case studies very carefully
1116,324084,1.0,5.0,"Like someone else said, I also took Ecology for fun. It was my least favorite class I've taken so far at W&amp;L, and I am planning on doing ecology for my career. This semester was the worst of my life largely because of this class. The tests are extraordinarily difficult, and test on things he mentions once."
1117,324084,1.0,5.0,He says he's understanding of students' difficulties but he's not. He expects you to understand complex scientific literature as well as he does when he's been reading some of the papers for over 20 years. His quiz questions are mostly based on things he mentions in passing during class. I took ecology for fun and he's made me dislike the topic.
1118,324084,4.0,4.0,"Yes, Professor Hurd's class was very difficult: at midterms, I was failing. If you don't know how to study for a science class (odds are good, if you're in Intro to Bio), buckle up! As a senior, I really needed to keep my GPA up for grad school apps, and he personally met with me for an hour once a week to help me with the material. Reach out!"
1119,324084,2.0,4.0,"The only way I ever did well on a test was by reading the chapters 4 times before the test. He cherry picks questions from the lecture and textbook that are not even close to being necessary information or anything reflective of what was covered in class. Dr. Hurd is a nice and smart man, but try to avoid this section as much as you can."
1120,324084,1.5,3.0,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Hands down worst professor I have had at W&L. Rather than a review of general biology concepts, it covered a range of topics that don't prepare you for genetics or any human science. I had a class of 15 people, but he didn't know my name by the end and didn't help at all. His tests are very unclear and graded harshly."
1121,324084,1.5,5.0,"He is unclear about expectations, tests on material he doesn't cover in class, spends time in class discussing things he never tests on, and then acts like we're stupid when we can't get ""A""s.  Avoid at all costs."
1122,324084,2.5,4.0,"Difficult class, even though I loved the material. It was really unclear what concepts were used for the tests. That said, he was always willing to meet outside of class and go over anything with which I had difficulty."
1123,324084,3.5,4.0,"Prof. Hurd is approchable and clear in his expectations. He is always willing to help and I would recommend seeing him before a test to review. His tests are hard because they cover material from both the lecture  and the textbook, some of it rather obscure."
1124,324084,5.0,3.0,Ecology is also cool. College is supposed to be hard.  Is life any easier&#63;
1125,324084,5.0,3.0,zoology is cool
1126,324084,4.5,3.0,He may seem a little intimadating but he is actually helpful if you approach himw with questions. And if you pay attention in class and read the assigned chapters then this shouldn't be too hard of a class.
1127,324084,1.0,4.0,Hard. Doesn't have office hours and he doesn't even give you his e-mail address.
1128,324084,1.0,2.0,I hate him
1129,324084,3.5,3.0,"Professor Hurd is getting a bad reputation on here, and that shouldn't be the case. He is very clear in his expectations and in what he will test on. His lectures cover most of the material, and he tells you to pay attention to particular things in the book for what they do not. He's very helpful."
1130,324084,1.0,5.0,"Honestly, this guy should not be a teacher.  He doesn't care about his intro students at all.  Does not test what he says he will test.  Not approachable or available.  I cannot emphasize how much this guy sucks.  As it has been said before, unless you are premed, avoid his class at all costs."
1131,324084,1.0,5.0,"Horrible teacher, unless you take him for upper level courses"
1132,324084,3.5,5.0,No Comments
1133,324084,1.5,4.0,"not helpful at all, plays favorites, arrogant"
1134,324084,5.0,5.0,No Comments
1135,324084,4.0,5.0,"He's not that bad.  The test questions are rather vague and difficult (especially fill in the blanks).  The class is tough, however he is very willing to help and he seems to be interested in what he is teaching."
1136,324084,1.0,5.0,"Hurd is out to screw you over, he truly hates students and teaching.  Test questions are purposly vague, b/c he gets pleasure out of failing people.  Do not take Bio 111 unless you have to, find another GE"
1137,1219060,2.0,5.0,Not a good professor. Test averages are always in the 70's and he is content with that. Does not teach material and then gives challenging exams. Avoid if you want to like accounting.
1138,1219060,1.5,4.0,What everyone else said... nice and smart guy who just doesnt get the whole teaching thing. Going to class is a waste of your time but if you are very good at learning from the textbook then you can manage a decent grade
1139,1219060,1.0,3.0,Advanced accounting is relatively interesting material but he makes it as painful as possible. Often goes on incomprehensible tangents and confuses himself. Frequently gets practice problems wrong in class. Sometimes comes off as lazy and incompetent. I've had almost every accounting professor at W&L and I have rated him the worst.
1140,1219060,1.5,5.0,He rambles on and on and fails to actually teach the material he expects you to know. Nice guy and clearly knows his stuff but he hasn't figured out how to teach
1141,1219060,1.5,5.0,Nice guy but lectures are useless and all over the place. Tests are hard. Don't actually learn anything. I genuinely like accounting but despise this class. AVOID
1142,1219060,2.0,5.0,"Lectures are all over the place and the tests are hard and unpredictable. Maybe this makes us study harder and learn more as a result, but really its just annoying"
1143,1219060,2.0,4.0,Really awful professor. His lectures are useless. He's makes really tough tests and doesn't curve. He doesn't know the names of any of his students. Has no business being a teacher
1144,1219060,3.5,4.0,Nice guy.  Pretty easy class.
1145,1219060,1.5,2.0,"Had him for FSA. Extremely boring and a very poor teacher. Goes off on tangents and has trouble communicating his thoughts. However, he enjoys the material and is a pretty nice guy."
1146,1219060,4.5,2.0,Uses an effective / easy online HW system which almost exactly replicates the exam problems.
1147,1219060,1.5,3.0,"Such a nice guy, but in my opinion a really bad professor. He speaks extremely verbosely which becomes confusing and distracting and he rarely finishes a thought... or a daily lesson plan for that matter. He definitely means well, but he's really confusing and disorganized and ultimately fails to actually teach."
1148,324087,4.5,2.0,"I know him personally. He's a genius, walking enciclopedy, no need books - everything is in his head. Also he's hilarious."
1149,324087,3.0,2.0,"I don't understand why McCaughrin gets such a bad rep.  His assignments are hard to decipher at first glance, but if you actually listen in class and go in for help you find that the material is extremely easy. Minimal reading outside of class, readily available to meet (literally the man doesn't sleep), and he's hilarious."
1150,324087,4.5,3.0,One of the best at W&L.  A genius with the material who also will take the time to work with his students individually.  What a delightful class.
1151,324087,1.0,5.0,"This was one of the worst classes I've ever taken at wnl. Yes he's a crazy genius like everyone says and he's a really nice decent guy, but he's not a professor. He doesn't know how to teach. Avoid this class. Even if you are good at game theory, why would you take this class&#63; you don't learn about global politics at all."
1152,324087,1.5,5.0,"Boring, monotonous, and prone to going off on tangents. Eccentric professor, knows his subject but not how to teach it. If you like math, great, because the whole course was dedicated to his love of &quot;game theory&quot; (not a bit of &quot;Global Politics&quot; which the course was supposed to cover). It killed my love of politics. Don't take McCaughrin's class!"
1153,324087,1.0,5.0,"McCaughrin is a genius but he can't teach. I hated coming to class and it turned me off of politics. Besides that, I feel as if I learned nothing besides how to decode his encrypted tests"
1154,324087,1.0,5.0,"Bizarre. A genius (remains of an astounding memory shoot off at random) but frequently mumbling on about some tangent (g luck tracking how he got there), or trying to explicate simple concepts w/bewildering analogies. (Once even tried to show redundancy of IntlRe and GPol by string theory equations + arrows). Also, incomprehensible handouts."
1155,324087,4.5,4.0,"Good Professor, in his own world though, youll get emails at 3:40 in the morning.  Crazy guy but always a good story for posterity's sake.  Yea... I took McCaughrin."
1156,324087,5.0,1.0,greatest class and professor ever.
1157,324087,5.0,1.0,"no note taking, no homework, don't have to do the reading, only take home tests...awesome"
1158,324087,5.0,3.0,"Brilliant, knowledgeable, eloquent. He'll give you as many hours as you want in his office of discussion on ALL subjects, from history to music. He is a walking encyclopedia. He never uses notes, it's all in his head."
1159,324087,2.5,3.0,"Class is either very easy or difficult dependent on the type of student you are.  If you are math orientated then I reccomend taking the class, but if you are more righting based and interested in normal politics then I wouldn't take him.  I found the class very interesting, but I'm not very interested in normal politcs and it was very little work"
1160,324087,1.0,5.0,"First of all, it is obvious that  McCaughrin is INCREDIBLY intelligent, and a very interesting person. But not an especially wonderful teacher. His tests are literally written in hieroglyphs, and have to be translated. He doesn't do office hours, and I don't think we actually discussed &quot;Global Politics&quot; at all. Just Game Theory, lots of math."
1161,324087,3.5,1.0,A really bright but strange prof.  If you put in the effort to understand him you are granted a great learning experience and offered interesting and useful knowledge.  Lots of math for a Politics class - avoid if you have no analytical skills.
1162,324087,4.0,3.0,"If you actually pay attention in his class, you will learn an incredible amount. Many are overwhelmed at first by how difficult his class sounds but give him a chance. He has taught me more about game theory and the politics of choice than I ever thought possible. Don't be scared away, you will learn a lot and his tests aren't so bad."
1163,324087,1.0,5.0,"An enigma, wrapped inside a puzzle, with the voice of Kermit the Frog."
1164,324087,4.5,5.0,"Prof. McCaughrin taught me in the mid-80s.  As the class progressed, I began to appreciate how brilliant he is, and how deep his knowledge and insight is.  He was very flexible and often held class outdoors, if we wanted. At that time, he let each student choose a type of final exam.  Mine was a one on one Q&A -- a very satisfying experience."
1165,324087,1.0,5.0,"Terrible. It takes 25 minutes of the hour for him to explain what his tests are asking because he refuses to use real words or sentences. He cannot answer questions in a helpful way. If you like international relations, don't take this class. If you do, you'll be signing on for a stats class."
1166,324087,3.5,2.0,Really objective.  Oddball but a smart guy that teaches a lot of game theory.  I'd take a class to see if you like it or not.
1167,324087,1.0,5.0,****ing terrible
1168,324087,2.0,3.0,"No attendance policy.  That was nice.  If you could learn it on your own and decipher his tests it actually was alright.  IF (big IF) you listen to his lectures they are actually kind of funny.  I don't know, I liked him."
1169,324087,4.5,3.0,"McCaughrin is the coolest.  The other comments are outrageous. He is absolutely brilliant.  He is the only POL Prof. who understands anything about social science.  I learned more from him than all of the other professors I took combined. He teaches strategic behavior, the understanding of which is unquestionably one of the most important tools anyone can have to understand life. It is unfortunate that most students are neither smart enough nor dedicated enough to appreciate him.  Give him a chance."
1170,324087,1.0,5.0,satan with a calculator. i'd rather be hungover for the rest of life than sit through this man's class for an hour- yeah- that bad.
1171,324087,1.0,5.0,No Comments
1172,324087,1.0,5.0,"It's the same as everybody else says, although he never mentioned the KGB to our class...actually, he probably did, but I was probably asleep by then.  DO NOT TAKE AFTER LUNCH.  His tests are in heiroglyphics.  I learned very little in this class."
1173,324087,1.0,2.0,"This is the most boring man alive.  He is hands down the worst professor at W&L except for Holt Merchant.  I swear, he thinks the KGB is after him.  For that reason, he has nothing in his office except a computer and a coffee maker.  You see him walking aimlessly on the hill at 2 or 3 am."
1174,324087,1.5,4.0,"You'll be taken aback the first class. Until you understand his gibberish, you might feel overwhelmed. It's completely a numbers class of game theory nonsense. he sometimes mentioned random dates of obscure wars. if you actually like int'l relations, dont take this class."
1175,324087,1.0,3.0,"What did I learn in this class&#63;  &quot;Life is nasty, brutish, and short&quot;, because he says it at least 5 times per class.  Hope you like game theory, because that's all you learn.  The quizzes are confusing, and unless Russia and Germany are the only nations out there, there is nothing International here"
1176,324087,1.0,4.0,"Worst in the department, at least."
1177,324087,1.0,3.0,"Worst class taken at W&L.  Learned nothing.  Spends half the test period translating his jibberish tests because he refuses to wirte the f*cking things in coherent english.  Offers help sessions that might as well be taped sessions from the class.  Moruse, reclusive, and borish."
1178,324087,1.0,3.0,The most horrendous teacher at W&L
1179,324087,2.0,3.0,More concerned with his own subjective opinion than anything else.  Can't comprehend how he can share a department with Eddie V.
1180,324087,1.5,4.0,"All material was based on game theory; the final was a project based on statistics. This is a hit or miss class, you'll either do well or really poorly. Do not take if math is not your best subject. Classes are boring, the teacher is unhelpful, and I learned absolutely nothing. Ask upperclassmen..."
1181,324087,1.5,5.0,"Horrible, and is afraid the KGB is after him."
1182,324087,1.5,3.0,"H-O-T, hot! Take this class if you want to drool and pant lustfully pretty much all hour."
1183,324087,3.0,3.0,"His intro stuff will bore you, upper level is where he gets good. Oddball genius who will challenge you to keep up. Fluent in Russian."
1184,324087,4.0,1.0,"If you understand Math and enjoy game theory, take McCaughrin"
1185,324087,3.0,1.0,"Game theory is good, McCaughrin is strange. Classes are sometimes good, often boring, always easy."
1186,324087,3.0,1.0,No Comments
1187,324087,2.0,1.0,You'll learn nothing.
1188,324087,1.0,1.0,"He's a horrible teacher, you will learn nothing in the class, but it is easy.  You should put in about a solid 15 min. of studying each week and get an A.  No midterm, final, or papers, just weekly quizzes."
1189,1040889,5.0,3.0,Jeff is one of the best professors at this school. Take his class
1190,1040889,5.0,3.0,"Jeff is simply the best. He cares deeply about his students. He is very clear when he lectures. He is great at answering questions when students don't understand. Most importantly, he is a hilarious guy and makes his classes feel quick with his foolish sense of humor. Geo isn't the easiest class, but Jeff without a doubt makes it a great experience"
1191,1040889,5.0,3.0,Jeff is one of the best professors at W&amp;L. He knows the material very well and is even better at explaining it. The weekly quizzes helped my grade a lot and the lab portion of the class was typically interesting. Highly recommend Rahl for 100A. Really such a good guy
1192,1040889,5.0,3.0,Legend.
1193,1040889,5.0,3.0,"Jeff is the man. I took his intro class during my freshman year and, while at times difficult, he is always there to help and make sure that you're doing as well as you can be. He is very accessible, teaches in a way that is not very difficult to understand, and is my favorite teacher that I have had at this school."
1194,1040889,4.5,3.0,"good teacher. hes super passionate and often times got so excited about the subject that he had to stop in the middle of lecture to talk about how cool it was, which was funny and made it memorable. material in history of geology is dry, and his tests/papers had very deep/broad topics which made them difficult, but overall, decent class"
1195,1040889,4.0,3.0,Rahl is a real smart guy who genuinely cares about what he's teaching.  By &quot;really cares&quot; I mean he truly lives and breathes Geology and is a self-proclaimed nerd.  He's not near as easy as he originally seems though - you got to bring the heat on tests or else you will get exposed and put in a big hole for the rest of the term.
1196,1040889,5.0,3.0,"Lots of notes. If you take good notes and skim over the readings you will do well on tests. Pretty much tells you what's going to be on test. Really excited about teaching. Loves to help students and genuinely loves what he does. Labs were boring, but Jeff is a really cool guy. Good prof, good guy, boring class."
1197,1040889,5.0,2.0,Great guy... interesting class.
1198,1040889,4.5,2.0,"aside from being an all-around great guy, jeff loves what he teaches and wants you to love it too. he is extremely approachable and intelligent, so do not hesitate to ask him anything."
1199,2759167,5.0,1.0,"Probably the easiest class I've taken at W&amp;L. Professor Sigler is super sweet and caringyou can tell that she used to be an elementary school teacher. She loves to bring insightful guest speakers, and although it was a piece of cake, I found the class material interesting. I 100% recommend her to anybody looking for an easy A."
1200,172568,5.0,2.0,"His lectures are good and very interesting. He expects heavy detailed knowledge on the tests. Overall, he's not too hard and I got an A both semesters even during pledgeship. I hope he comes back for an occasional class after retirement."
1201,172568,4.0,2.0,If you have a music background this class is a breeze.
1202,172568,4.5,3.0,Prof. Gaylard is an extremely nice person. He is really helpful if you have any questions. The class isn't hard but you need spend time working on the test.
1203,172568,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Gaylard is really approachable. His classes are well-prepared. As long as you preview every class, you know everything he talks about even if you know almost nothing about music before the class like me. Also, go to extra concerts for extra credits. That really helps."
1204,172568,4.5,2.0,"Professor Gaylard is hands down one of the most special people at W&L. He is kind, compassionate, and brilliant, and he truly cares about his students succeeding. He can seem distant during class, and some of his lectures can be dry. But go to his office, get to know him, and you will see how good of a guy he is.  "
1205,172568,5.0,2.0,"Class was interesting, and I thought Prof. Gaylard was a really cool guy.  I have no musical background and still found the class relatively easy, almost no work outside of class."
1206,172568,4.5,2.0,"Extremely knowledgeable about subject matter, and very passionate about music. His tests were not exceptionally difficult, seeing as he almost always gave study guides that outlined the quizzes. Amazing pianist, the pieces he played in class were amazing. It's a quality class, and not terribly difficult."
1207,172568,3.5,3.0,"Professor Gaylard is very accessible and fair. He goes over the material and plays examples as many times as people request for him to do so. Warning: if you have never played an instrument, don't take this class. Although there is little work outside of class, you really have to understand all the musical elements taught in order to do well."
1208,172568,4.5,2.0,"dr. gaylard is so smart and knowledgeable.  i loved his class.  it's easy if you have any musical background, but if you don't it might be hard."
1209,172568,4.0,2.0,"Easy A for anyone with any muscial background. For those who don't, the only way to learn is by practice, so it might take a little more time. He's not willing for this to be a joke class, though, so if you don't know your stuff, you won't do well.  He's a little dry, but a kind man who's definately knowledgable & passionate about his subject."
1210,172568,5.0,4.0,Don't take his class if you're a pledge
1211,172568,5.0,4.0,Two words.. Example one.

1213,172568,5.0,3.0,"very knowledgeable, accessible to students"
1214,1067547,5.0,3.0,"It's a shame she went to Oxford, she was absolutely fantastic"
1215,1067547,5.0,3.0,Great tacher. Class discussions are excellent.
1216,1067547,4.0,2.0,"Extremely interesting teacher. She really knows her field, and she encourages excellent class discussion. Take her class!"
1217,1067547,5.0,3.0,One of the best classes I have taken at W&L. Great class discussions. Professor is smart and funny.
1218,1067547,5.0,4.0,Readings are not even really required because she explains everything we need to take out of it in class. Brilliant and interesting person. Very little work. An extremely easy B but getting an A seems almost impossible
1219,1067547,4.5,3.0,"Extremely intelligent, from Turkey and has a unique perspective on International Politics.  Definitely have to work and be willing to memorize theory, but concepts and debate in class were some of the best I've had.  Definitely take upper level classes with her."
1220,1067547,2.0,2.0,"Although she assigns a lot of reading, she repeats exactly what was said in the reading and even explains it. I found that if I actually did the readings, I couldn't pay attention in class. She does occasionally attempt to stimulate discussion, but basically she just lectures and explains exactly what the readings said."
1221,1067547,3.0,4.0,"Good professor, extremely nice.  The material can get thick at times but she is always willing to discuss it with you one on one.  Take advantage of any rewrite opportunities she gives."
1222,1067547,3.5,3.0,"She is a good teacher, smart and funny.  She chose a solid overview of international issues to study.  Two small critiques: She has unrealistic workload expectations and we got no grades back until the end of the term.  I really liked her as a person and a professor, but would not take her again unless the reading load was lower."
1223,1067547,4.0,3.0,Great teacher! Very interesting.  She's young but really knows what she is talking about.
1224,2744860,4.0,1.0,"Professor Dogan is a super kind person who will make sure you succeed if you participate in class and put forth genuine effort. She does tend to rely on her prepared powerpoints during lectures, which can drag at times. Overall, her Intro to Anthropology class was a solid choice for fulfilling an FDR."
1225,2744860,5.0,2.0,Professor Dogan is clearly passionate about what shes teaching and genuinely cares about her students. She allows two unexcused absences and drops the lowest quiz grade. Grading was very clear and lenient
1226,2744860,5.0,2.0,"Professor Dogan is a really sweet person and is very passionate about her subject area. Her lectures are informative but easy to follow. There were three exams and she dropped our lowest grade. There were a few papers, but she is lenient grader. Most assigned reading is discussed in class and not absolutely mandated. Would definitely recommend!"
1227,2527773,5.0,3.0,"Really funny and approachable teacher. You're probably going to get an assignment that is totally different than anything you've ever done before, but don't stress it, he'll help you through it if you show you're willing to try."
1228,2527773,5.0,2.0,"Professor Moffa is a genuine guy who cares for his students and also education. You can tell in the way he teaches. His first year lecture on Educating on Democracy was a great class, highly participatory, but easy. Moffa is the best!!!"
1229,2527773,5.0,2.0,Moffa is a Fantastic Professor. You need the textbook but the course is not heavy on it. Lecture and discussion-based but you could never be bored of a Professor Moffa lecture.
1230,2744871,5.0,2.0,"She was great. Always had clear expectations and wanted students to succeed. Sometimes communication was difficult when asking certain questions because her English is not the best, but it usually did not seriously affect ability to learn. Randomly took attendance twice maybe."
1231,2744871,5.0,3.0,Dr. Wang was fantastic this past term. It was her first time teaching at W&amp;L and she did amazing. Her lectures in class were specific and full of examples to make sure students understood the concepts. She also held many office hour sessions throughout the week and was almost always available to help during other times of the day. Take her courses!
1232,2744871,5.0,2.0,Professor Wang is a great professor. She is very knowledgable and cares about her students. She is always willing to help and is very accessible both during office hours and outside of office hours. She is also funny and tells jokes to keep the class engaged. Her class is well-structured and she grades in a timely manner.
1233,1770025,5.0,4.0,Was an 8:30 class and no one skipped unless they were sick. GREAT professor! You learn a ton and it doesn't feel like busy work. must do the reading to do well on exams and get participation points. His lectures are amazing! He's hilarious and has no issue using profanity in class. Is def available outside of class. My favorite teacher at W&amp;L
1234,1770025,5.0,4.0,"Tough class, but with a professor who made it worth it. The material was well worth studying and you can tell that he's passionate about what he teaches. However, the readings got much heavier toward the end of the term, which became difficult to keep up with."
1235,1770025,5.0,1.0,I will name my first child for this man. A god among men.
1236,1770025,5.0,1.0,The best teacher at school. You should take one of his classes before you graduate!
1237,1770025,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, great class. He makes German be fun. Students know exactly what to expect from him, very easy going professor."
1238,1770025,5.0,3.0,Professor Youngman is a great professor!  He's engaging and passionate about German and lots of fun. Very fair grader and clear about what he expects.
1239,1770025,5.0,4.0,"Best teacher in the school. Very enthusiastic, extremely helpful. You won't find a teacher with more varied interests or who cares as much about each student  as this guy. Tough grader for sure, but I'd rather get a mediocre grade with this teacher than a good grade with someone else."
1240,1770025,5.0,3.0,"He may be new, but he's in my opinion the best teacher at the school. Extremely helpful, very flexible deadlines as long as you communicate with him."
1241,1327658,3.0,2.0,"Ado is so hot its almost distracting, but in a good way."
1242,1327658,3.0,2.0,Ado is so hot. And she's a great teacher. Best spanish class to take.

1245,1702444,5.0,2.0,"Professor Rupke is brilliant. His classes are the definition of an excellent liberal arts education; he covers individual topics, like evolution for example, from various perspectives that allow the students to glean fresh and eye-opening information. Grades are not the point of his classes -- pure academic pursuit drives the content and character."
1246,1702444,5.0,1.0,"Rupke is one of the sweetest guys ever. He has very realistic expectations and is very passionate about his subject. He is a bit boring, but the class is easy and he really cares about what he is teaching. Overall great guy, and his class did not require much work."
1247,1702444,5.0,2.0,"Professor Rupke is one of the best professors I have had here. He enjoyed teaching us, had realistic expectations, and was always fun to interact with. I will definitely take more of his classes next year. I would recommend him to anyone and everyone."
1248,1702444,4.5,2.0,"Seriously the nicest guy. Lectures are interesting. Always available to meet about the 3 short papers and 2 presentations. Willing to give a higher grade if you rewrite a paper. Not much discussion, which I liked. Also, he's a freaking genius with a cool accent."
1249,2568750,5.0,4.0,"As the reviews say, take it with Gray. I've had friends in Dr. Alty's class that failed out first semester, a curve probably would've done them well. Dr. Gray is a genius and she is very concerned about her students. First semester is flipped classroom, 2nd is lecture. Equally hard, but she really makes the class bearable. "
1250,2568750,5.0,3.0,Probably my favorite professor I have had at W&L so far. Knows a lot about Orgo and will challenge you but definitely worth it. Always available for office hours which are super helpful especially leading up to exams.
1251,2568750,5.0,4.0,Dr. Gray is easily the best professor I have had at W&amp;L. She is very kind and considerate. She holds office hours often but if you can not make them she will be sure to make time for you. She explains the material clearly and answers questions in a very clear way that shows her expertise and knowledge. Take Orgo with Dr. Gray!!
1252,2568750,5.0,3.0,"Truly one of the best Ochem professors out there, alongside the GOAT Prof Alty. Cares so much about her students and takes time to thoroughly explain concepts, especially during office hours. Of course Ochem is hard, you should know that coming in, but she makes it much more tolerable."
1253,2568750,5.0,4.0,"I can't speak highly enough of Dr. Gray. She is SO accessible, caring, and smart. She gives clear explanations and expectations, and holds office hours almost every day (and extra before exams). All assessments were exactly what she said we should expect, plus she curves the final grade. Glad I took her again - my favorite professor thus far!"
1254,2568750,5.0,4.0,"There is no way for this calss to be easy, but Dr. Gray does an amazing job explaining concepts and is always available to help students. She grades pretty harshly but will curve the class at the end of the term. You have to be ready to do lots of practice problems. I would highly recommend Dr. Gray to any science major."
1255,2568750,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Gray is fantastic! She's very caring, positive, and knowledgeable. She clearly explains concepts, and holds office hours almost every day (and extra ones before exams). She offers tons of cold quizzes/exams, too. If you put in the work, you'll do well. Orgo is difficult, but because of her, it was one of my favorite classes!"
1256,2568750,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gray is amazing even though this is her first year teaching. She genuinely cares for her students and would go out of her way to make sure that you understand the material. Her lectures mostly follows what the book says, but the Klein textbook is good in explaining Orgo so I am not annoyed by that."
1257,2568750,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gray is super sweet and caring. Her lectures are very straight-forward, and she is good at explaining complicated concepts. Before major tests, she holds evening office hours. I highly recommend her for organic chemistry!"
1258,2107959,5.0,1.0,very relaxed. good at basketball which makes sense because he is the coach. leads a fun class and vibes with the students. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
1259,1612355,3.5,3.0,Pretty simple and straight forward statistics class. Test questions were straight out of the book. Dry sense of humor and opens up.
1260,1612355,5.0,4.0,Great teacher. Young and enthusiastic. Really opens up as the semester goes along.
1261,1892938,4.0,5.0,"Super nice and friendly, but you will not get an A."
1262,1892938,4.5,3.0,"Professor Bowden is a great professor and extremely organized, she uses Sakai heavily. It requires A LOT of time outside of class for shooting, developing, and printing photos, so don't take it with a heavy schedule. Make sure you take at least 1 more roll than she suggests per project to go ""above and beyond"" her expectations."
1263,2767435,2.0,4.0,"I was SO excited to take this class but it ended up being my worst experience at W&amp;L so far. Prof. Hinkle gives unclear instructions, her lectures jump from topic to topic, and she treats you as though you are foolish when you ask questions. She is also incredibly difficult to reach outside of class."
1264,590416,2.0,4.0,"Professor Fulcher is clearly passionate about the subject and has many opportunities for extra credit. However, in the classroom, she relies heavily on information-packed lectures that leave little room for discussion. The tests are intended to trick students and highlight information that was barely mentioned in class."
1265,590416,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Fulcher made her lectures interesting by telling personal anecdotes and sharing videos of her children. However, it is obvious that she can be lazy when it comes to grading- Don't get me wrong I know teaching is extremely difficult, she just doesn't have the best attitude! Definitely use Quizlet to learn the vocabulary words"
1266,590416,4.0,4.0,"She is really nice and makes the class really interesting. Office hours are something you should not miss, she is very helpful! Tough grader, though...  I took her developmental class and LOVED it! Learned such important things!"
1267,590416,4.0,2.0,"Professor Fulcher's class is lecture-style with a LOT of note-taking. I definitely recommend bringing a computer to take notes so that you can write everything she is saying. Her lectures are very interesting, and I thoroughly enjoyed the class. She is available for help if you want it, but doesn't go out of her way. "
1268,590416,2.5,3.0,"Interesting material and the lectures usually had some sort of hands on or puzzle/problem activity. Tests are hard, if you study for them you'll do fine and if you memorize all the vocab from the textbook you'll do great. She is lazy so you do need to stay on top of things, final exam is pretty brutal but study and youll be fine"
1269,590416,3.0,3.0,"She was a fairly laid back teacher. Attendance wasn't mandatory, but I highly suggest it. Tests were straight forward. It wasn't necessary to read the textbook, but it was the difference between and C and a B."
1270,590416,1.0,5.0,she does not like the class. she does not explain ANYTHING well. and her tests are NOT a true measure of what you should learn in the class.
1271,590416,2.0,3.0,"Lecture style with a lot of notes. Tests are pretty easy, but the fill-in-the-blank sections are hard so you will need to study. Not hard to get a B if you listen in class."
1272,590416,2.5,5.0,I like her but i hate the class. there are some ridiculously large amount of reading to do. and I am overwhelmed by her FILL IN THE BLANKS in the tests.
1273,590416,5.0,3.0,"Very knowledgable. Lots of note-taking and reading. Tests are fairly hard...just read everything and study hard. Tests are MC, fill in the blank, and short answer"
1274,590416,4.5,2.0,I like her a lot!
1275,590416,5.0,2.0,very clear in her lectures although talks very quietly. interesting class and easy assignments. very easy to talk to about pretty much anything.
1276,590416,5.0,3.0,"Fulcher is an awesome teacher. I really really loved this class. it was so interesting and she really knows what she's talking about. the tests are very straight forward and as long as you read the material and study you'll be fine. easy b tough a. It is so interesting though, i would take this class again if i could."
1277,590416,5.0,4.0,"Developmental is a great class, Fulcher is pretty relaxed"
1278,2042456,3.0,3.0,Lot's of weird small assignments that aren't necessarily hard but tough to keep up with and remember. Being able to resubmit papers is nice but her feedback is given through audio clips instead of being written which is super annoying. She's nice enough but kind of awkward. The class topics get kind of boring after reading about the same things.
1279,2042456,2.5,3.0,"Weird grade scale- fine once you get used to it. Has interesting ideas and topics but lectures/themes are redundant. Really liked the assigned readings (which yes, you should do and do thoroughly) but class discussion got extremely tedious. Really admire her as a human being but as a young professor there's room to grow."
1280,2042456,5.0,2.0,"If you don't make an A in this class it is essentially your own fault. She'll send back your first paper with a low grade and many things to fix BUT you can edit and resubmit drafts for a higher grade as many times as you want and each resubmission will receive a new grade... Four papers throughout the term and not especially long, also interesting"
1281,2042456,4.5,3.0,"Interesting enough.  Assigns 4 relatively lengthy papers and one short one, but she gives lots of feedback and lets you revise them as many times as you want before the end of the semester. She encourages you to go to office hours. Very hip, young, and feminist. Take that as you will."
1282,2120285,2.0,4.0,"Very smart guy. Gives impossibly long tests that you have 1 day to complete. If taking this course, plan on dedicating your day to accounting whenever a test is assigned. Tests are long (16 to 21 pages). Posts powerpoints that are helpful but makes learning accounting a bore. Once again, super intelligent person. Office hours are apparently helpful"
1283,2120285,4.0,4.0,Professor Evans' lectures and expectations for the class were very clear and straight forward. He really cares about his students and wants to get to know you outside of class. Gives multiple extra credit opportunities which was very helpful.
1284,2120285,1.0,2.0,"He is one of the kind and the most cruel and cold-hearted professor I've ever had. I'm interested in accounting and did well at first, but thanks to him, now I have zero passion and interet in it. I can't believe someone could give such tedious lectures and thanks him for letting me know that good accountant doesn't make a good teacher."
1285,2120285,5.0,2.0,"Professor Evans was my favorite professor that I had this year. His tests were extremely fair, and if you paid attention at all in class, you could easily make an A on exams. We rarely had homework, and it wasn't hard whenever we did. Professor Evans was always available outside of class, and he really cared about us doing well. Great class."
1286,2120285,4.0,1.0,"People tend to not like him but if you do the work can be incredibly easy class. He gives at least 10% extra credit on each test often more. He might not have the most exciting and engaging  class but is extremely organized, attentive, and more than fair. Don't be fooled by the haters."
1287,2120285,2.0,4.0,"He spent an entire class lecturing on a made-up manufacturing company which included pictures of his patio furniture in the slideshow. He never opens his eyes when he lectures. Best part of the class is when he shows up in his orthopedic tennis shoes and faded jeans. Dan Evans can retile a bathroom, swing a 9 Iron, and explain social security."
1288,2120285,1.5,4.0,"Seems like a good guy, probably would like him if he was my grandpa and not my accounting professor. Lectures are unbearably boring, the content isn't hard but you wouldn't know that in this class. Expect to call your mom crying after the tests. He's obviously good at his profession but great accountants don't make great teachers."
1289,414302,1.0,5.0,The class average for the exam was 39% Need I say more?
1290,414302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Levy's lectures in 312 were somewhat long and unfocused, for sure, but he more than makes up for that by being available outside of class in and out of office hours. He will help you out with anything outside of class. The topics he goes over during review day are directly tied to what the test will assess you on, so pay attention. "
1291,414302,3.0,4.0,"He rambles on during class, and he sometimes doesn't even know what he was doing while teaching the course material. However, if you visit him in Office Hours, he will basically give you all the answers, which made me feel like I learned absolutely nothing. Lots of rambling. Lots and lots."
1292,414302,1.0,4.0,He makes his quizzes after he reviews the material with the class and adds things he mentioned maybe once in the first week. of class. He rambles on for hours and you can barely hear him half the time. Cannot effectively communicate course material. Took this class because I thought it would be interesting. I leave class furious every quiz we have.
1293,414302,5.0,2.0,"Great guy, easy class. You just have to learn to work with him &amp; it will be an easy A."
1294,414302,4.0,2.0,"Easy tests, easy homework. For homework you can always go to office hours and he'll code the whole assignment for you. Boring class, but overall cool teacher."
1295,414302,1.0,3.0,Terrible professor.
1296,414302,5.0,4.0,"Super patient and helpful. I was failing his Theory of Computation class, and he told me to drop out unless I came to his office hours every week for help. I did and each week he walked me through the assignments as well as retaught me concepts for his exams. I ended up with an A- for the semester. He was incredibly patient and kind to me."
1297,414302,1.0,5.0,"Don't take any of his classes. He is unclear, not organized, and doesn't care about his students. This was his first year teaching this class, and he made no effort to prepare any lectures or review the assignments that he was assigning. If you go to his office hours, he doesn't even attempt to help you."
1298,414302,4.0,3.0,Professor Levy is a great teacher. The only bad thing is that he digresses too much sometimes.
1299,414302,3.5,2.0,nice and helpful but boring to the point that comprehension is lost
1300,414302,4.0,1.0,"Easier than I thought it would be, Levy's a pretty awesome guy.  Don't ****him off, he knows karate."
1301,414302,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher, made CompSci interesting to a Politics/History double major.  A lot of people in my section got around a B or A, but that's because he works hard to get everyone on track."
1302,414302,4.0,2.0,No Comments
1303,414302,4.0,3.0,"Drink lots of coffee before class, his voice can put you to sleep. Material is somewhat difficult, but he grades leniently and much of the final grade is based on labs. He likes when you come to office hours."
1304,414302,4.0,4.0,"Good prof, though work can be hard and explanations not always clear... but he is good."
1305,2191982,3.0,4.0,Lambeth is a piece of work. His classes are basically all online. I did not enjoy sitting through class.
1306,442997,2.0,5.0,"Without lectures, we never understood basic material and the lab field trips were useless. Most days, we stood around, cluelessly looking at rocks on the side of the highway. Assignments were difficult and usually impossible unless you went to him for help multiple times. He gets a redeeming point for being funny and a nice guy."
1307,442997,1.0,5.0,"This class was atrocious. With no lectures, you have to teach yourself all the material outside of 8-hour classes. Dave was disorganized, demanding, and often flat-out unwilling to answer questions, which made lab assignments impossible without attending office hours. One peer missed a field trip and had to drive out to every stop alone. Heinous."
1308,442997,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Dave's perspective on what an intro-level geology course should be is completely flawed. His lack on classroom learning causes major confusion in the field, making the field trips that have significant potential very useless. One time, he expected us to use software for a lab that he couldn't figure out himself. Would clearly not recommend."
1309,442997,1.0,5.0,"While Dr. Dave is a great guy, his approach to an introductory level Geology class is horrible. The lack of lectures and explanation of content causes the field emphasis portion of the course to have almost zero impact on learning. The difficult lab assignments are also expected to be completed individually. An impossible task w/o meeting with him."
1310,442997,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Dave, while he is passionate about the course, doesn't know how to teach it. Plain and simple. Extremely disorganized, super critical with grading, and extremely demanding with work load. If you aren't a geology major and get stuck with this class, drop it."
1311,442997,4.0,3.0,"Professor Harbor is great. He's super chill, and definitely cares about the subject. The lectures were a little boring on Zoom, but in person he's really fun and leads a really engaging class. His schedule/grading is a bit scattered, but he knows that and is really lenient. Fun class, would definitely take again."
1312,442997,3.0,5.0,"Throughout the semester, he is the most difficult teacher to get along with as he is so demanding with the workload and an extremely critical grader, but, all in all, you will learn a lot and be thankful after the class that you took him. His class will make every other semester of college that much easier."
1313,442997,3.0,4.0,"Give a lot of work: looks for effort more than accuracy wants you to attempt and give your best effort. Very hard class and extremely time-consuming, but doable. Grades will be a lot better at the end of the term than the beginning. Don't give him a reason to dislike you."
1314,442997,3.0,5.0,"Most work of any class. Answers questions with questions. Great guy, but VERY time-consuming class."
1315,442997,4.0,4.0,Tough professor but wonderful person. Not always clear about assignments. Most teaching occurred in the field. Take careful notes and ask lots of big picture questions. Assigned readings in textbooks along with prep questions. Google the answers; textbook not needed. Very accommodating. I learned a lot about geology and hope to take another class.
1316,442997,4.5,4.0,"My class got to travel and study under him in Maryland and Utah (spring term). He made geology, a subject I find quite dull, entertaining. Because of the setting we were in (beaches, mountains, canyons) his long lectures felt real and practical. Harbor's the man. For an A, make sure to note Everything you see in your field book like he'll say to."
1317,442997,5.0,1.0,Awesome guy.
1318,442997,1.0,5.0,Has absolutely zero teaching ability. Only answers questions with questions. The most frustrating professor to take
1319,442997,1.0,5.0,"Completely useless professor. Answers any question you ask with ""I dunno, what do you think?"" Tests are hard and on material not mentioned in class. He doesn't seem to grasp the material well enough to actually teach it. By far the worst teacher I've ever had at any level."
1320,442997,4.5,4.0,"Lets face it if you have Dave for a class your time at W&L will be 50 times better. He is EXTREMELY approachable, you can ask him anything and he is extremely understanding with late work (although I don't recommend). He expects a lot when grading, but don't let that stop you from taking him. He makes you care about the subject with out you knowing"
1321,442997,4.0,4.0,"Excellent course, difficult concepts but his teaching method allows you to learn on your own.  Field work is essential and incredibly fun; I wouldn't have taken the course if we had to spend more than an hour a week in that basement lab."
1322,442997,4.0,4.0,"It's not rocks for jocks. The field trips are good, and you get to go to great places like Devil's Marbleyard and the cave. Of course, a lot of the time the trips aren't that great, and you end up spending 8 hours a week in labs/class. It's rough, but I figure it's better than chem or bio if you're not into science. Dave's is awesome! Great guy!"
1323,442997,2.5,5.0,"Great person--funny and very nice.  When asked a question, he says, &quot;Well, what do you think&#63;&quot;  Not the response I want.  Fun class, but don't expect a decent grade as it's really hard (especially if you thought geo was your way out of science gen ed).  However, he curves everything."
1324,442997,4.0,3.0,He's one of my favorite professors.  Just go and talk to him and he will explain stuff to you.  P.S. ask him about T-shirt grading.
1325,442997,2.5,2.0,"Here's the deal with Harbor- he teaches by the Socratic Method.  That means he won't EVER answer your question directly.  This drives non-science majors crazy, but honestly it is the best way to learn how to DO science, not just memorize sci. facts."
1326,442997,1.5,4.0,"I got a D in this class and I never get D's.  He's hard, which is fine, but in addition his teaching is all over the place.  Geology is something that needs explanation, but you pretty much have to learn it completely on your own."
1327,442997,2.0,2.0,"He does not directly answer questions. He does not teach you anything, he just lets you read a barely-helpful textbook and then chaperones field trips every class...most decidedly uninformative."
1328,1116795,5.0,3.0,"Great guy, awesome professor. Learned a lot more coding and data analysis than I thought I would, but it turned out to be pretty interesting and very useful. Workload was not heavy, just short sociological study articles on interesting topics. Loves to work with students outside of class."
1329,1116795,5.0,2.0,He is such a cute man! He's very sweet and caring and makes sure everyone understands him. He is very understanding and easy to get along with. Highly recommend taking his class. You will learn so much in an amazing enviornment.
1330,1116795,5.0,3.0,"Take whatever class he is teaching! He is AMAZING! Wish I could major in Sociology just to have him as my advisor. Very helpful, office hours are incredible. He makes it extremely interesting. You will understand the reason why you're working on projects, and actually learn a lot. Don't leave W&L without taking a class without him! So worth it!"
1331,1116795,5.0,2.0,"Perhaps the best professor I ever had. He is funny, engaging, and has an unbiased approach to sociological analysis. You can tell he is in it to teach and learn, not just publish and perish or push some sort of agenda. Definitely take a course with this guy, you won't regret it."
1332,1116795,4.0,2.0,Professor Eastwood was an excellent professor. The class was easy without being too boring. 
1333,1116795,5.0,2.0,"Professor Eastwood is an absolutely incredible professor.  He is very clear, interesting, funny, and a great person!  He truly makes an effort to get to know his students and is almost always available for office hours if you have questions or just want to chat.  I would highly recommend Professor Eastwood."
1334,1116795,5.0,2.0,Eastwood is a great guy. I had little interest in sociology before this course but am now begging to be off the waitlist for his 202 class. He is genuinely concerned about his students and always makes sure everyone understands before continuing. Highly recommended.
1335,1116795,5.0,2.0,"So great! Interesting lectures, not too much work. He's very passionate about what he does and loves to talk to and help students!"
1336,1116795,2.5,4.0,"Fairly straightforward class, lecture oriented with a good deal of discussion. Assignments are clearly outlined at the beginning of the course but reading are not enforced outside of discussion. Good teacher"
1337,1116795,4.0,3.0,Loved loved loved Eastwood! His class was pretty easy but enjoyable and he made it interesting and not a crazy workload. Loves to hear students opinions and really tries to get to know his students. If you go to his office hours you'll find yourself talking to him for 45 minutes and want to major in sociology.
1338,1116795,4.0,3.0,"One of my favorite classes- and professors, with barely any prior interest in sociology. He is nice, funny, engaging and an all around great professor. I loved coming to class and he did a great job of facilitating group discussion. He NEVER shoots you down and always encourages students to state their opinions. Prof. Eastwood is the best"
1339,1116795,5.0,3.0,"The best teacher I've had at W&L.  I'm almost done with my sophomore year, but solely because of him, I'm going to double major in Sociology as well.  He is brilliant and everyone should take a class with him."
1340,1116795,4.5,1.0,"This guy is awesome. The workload is minimal, he's an easy grader, and even though you don't particularly need to pay attention to do well, if you find the material engaging he really knows what he's talking about and truly has a passion for teaching the material. Definitely take any class he's teaching."
1341,1116795,5.0,2.0,"LOVE HIM! He's kind of new, and the subject material is really engaging... but he makes class discussion really fun, easy-flowing, and engaging. The assignments are interesting and midterms not too bad. Def. take him!"
1342,2108045,5.0,3.0,Professor Hu is very helpful and charming. Students have a lot of freedom in the class. She is my favorite professor in the school.
1343,2108045,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hu is a great teacher. Logic is not that hard, but sometimes it's tricky. I went to her office hour frequently and she always gave me useful feedback. She is patient, and she would make sure you solve your problems before leaving her office. Some homework are required but it won't take a lot of time, besides it's actually helpful."
1344,2108045,5.0,3.0,"I took intro to logic class. She is a really good instructor. There is no reading required before each class. As long as you are listening in class, it's really not that hard. 4 tests, a final, and some assignments made up the term. I don't usually go to her office hour, but I heard it's really helpful. Also, take extra credits!"
1345,2108045,1.0,3.0,"Jing Hu could be the worst professor to have ever stepped foot on the beautiful Collonade of Washington & Lee. In her first semester, she's already infamous for her ambiguity, lack of knowledge about the subject, and her unreasonable/unclear expectations. Avoid at all costs."
1346,1641123,4.5,2.0,"Very sweet, very nice, and I was very sad to see her leave WLU."
1347,1641123,2.0,1.0,"extremely easy, if you want an easy a take this class. she can be very very very boring. the class was never structured and many classes we would talk about our favorite food, what kinds of cars our parents had, etc."
1348,1641123,4.0,2.0,"Good professor. She is obviously passionate about environmental studies, which comes out in her class. Class is very discussion based, so read the material beforehand and come to class prepared to talk.  She gave us a midterm study guide with all of the possible questions to the midterm, which was nice. And the final is a paper/project, not a test."
1349,1421990,5.0,4.0,This class is great! You will just gain a lot of knowledge. Professor Grazjl is amazing. 
1350,1421990,5.0,3.0,"Grazjl is absolutely fantastic. Had him for econ 100, and it was just a really great class. His lectures are clear and concise, with excellent examples, and he makes sure to involve everyone. If you pay attention and take notes, you'll do fine on the tests. He's also pretty funny. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for an econ class."
1351,1421990,4.0,3.0,"Prof Grajzl is a fast-paced, enthusiastic teacher and the best econ prof I've had. Encourages questions and participations, has fun metaphors to explain concepts and the exams cover material discussed in class. The one thing I didn't like is, he got political really often, and always towards the end of class leaving no opportunity for debate."
1352,1421990,5.0,3.0,This class is straightforward and fast-paced. Expectations and not ridiculous and are well-organized in the syllabus. He does what he can to make each topic entertaining and encourages frequent opportunities to participate in class.
1353,1421990,5.0,4.0,Such a great professor. Expectations are clear. Lectures can be a bit boring but that comes with the domain. Professor Grajzl always tried his best to present the info in an entertaining way.
1354,1421990,5.0,3.0,"Professor Grajzl is awesome, his lectures are super engaging, he really cares about his students and loves it when we participate. There is no pressure in the class and he truly is very knowledgable and excited about economics. I definitely reccommend taking him!"
1355,1421990,5.0,3.0,"Professor Grajzl is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He is extremely knowledgeable about econ and is an amazing lecturer. He is also just a great guy in general- however, he moves very quickly through the material so I would recommend going to office hours."
1356,1421990,5.0,5.0,"Grajzl really makes you work for it but he has a great way of explaining really hard concepts. Class is just homework, a few quizzes, and then a midterm and final. Makes it kinda hard to get ahead but if you're putting in the effort you'll end up with a grade that reflects that. I'd take Grajzl again if I had the chance."
1357,1421990,5.0,4.0,"Slovenian accent but the clearest and most articulate lecturer I ever had. Truly brilliant, passionate about his research, kind, and a tough but fair grader. He made me happy to work harder and is the reason why I ended up with a major and career in econ."
1358,1421990,5.0,4.0,"Awesome professor that would try to help you all the time. Extremely clear lecture and fair quizzes, the tests are difficult but study the homework and you will be fine. This is my last class with Prof. Grajzl, wish he offered more classes for me to take!"
1359,1421990,4.5,5.0,"Math econ is a brutal class but Grajzl makes it tolerable. We were worried about our grades all semester but he curved in the end. really smart guy who truly cares about his students, but if you are not math wiz DO NOT take 220 you will hate it"
1360,1421990,5.0,4.0,"Super awesome lecturer, makes microecon great. then you take his tests, which are rather difficult. Actually an awesome, hardworking professor who gives tough tests. Do your homework and pay attention, and you can do really well. Offers to be an advisor to students who ask good questions in class, even if they aren't A students."
1361,1421990,5.0,4.0,Really cool stuff in this class. Grajzl clearly has a passion for institutional economics and it shows in how well designed this class is. The midterm is hard but overall it is a manageable course
1362,1421990,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, passionate and pay a lot of attention on the students."
1363,1421990,5.0,4.0,"Grajzl is the man. He is very helpful and incredibly smart. Great teacher, I would definitely recommend."
1364,1421990,5.0,4.0,Great Professor! Makes learning Econ a lot of fun; his lectures are well-organized and the book is never used. He is very intelligent and has a great personality to boot. Very helpful in office hours and tests are difficult but fair.
1365,1421990,5.0,3.0,"Challenging material, but reasonable workload. Extremely helpful professor, you feel like he's 100% on your side. Funny, too. Lectures are very pleasant."
1366,1421990,5.0,4.0,He's not easy but if you get economics you're fine and if you really pay close attention to his lectures then you'll be alright no matter what. He clearly and consistently explains everything in class at a machine gun pace. Don't bother using the book unless you don't pay attention
1367,1421990,4.5,2.0,"Great class. 5 HW's all semester, although they each took a reasonable chunk of time. Remarkably organized. As long as you get everything that he put on the board, you can do well. He would post GREAT study guides onto Sakai. I wish I could take 102 and the Theory classes with him!"
1368,1421990,4.5,4.0,Interesting professor and class. High expectations but when he lectures he lays out everything you need to know. Come to class sharp and ready to think hard
1369,1421990,5.0,5.0,Difficult class unless you are just very good at econ. He's extremely clear though and helpful in office hours. very smart and nice guy
1370,1421990,5.0,4.0,Terrific professor! You can tell he is kind of a math guy but he doesn't ever give anything overly difficult. Tests are straightforward and because of his info-packed lectures you don't really need to read the book
1371,1421990,4.0,4.0,brilliant prof. lectures fast but if you are very attentive and can follow him you will gain a fantastic understanding of the material. tests can be hard but he curves
1372,1421990,3.0,3.0,Straight-forward. Not too much homework. Pretty short and clear tests. I'd recommend him!!
1373,1421990,5.0,3.0,He?s one of the best professors at W&L. He can move a little fast sometimes but if you try and keep up you'll be fine and an A is defiantly possible.
1374,1421990,5.0,3.0,"Professor Grajzl is the best teacher I've had at W&L. I took two classes with him one year and I'm taking another next year. He comes to class already having written up the notes so he presents them as clearly as possible. He is incredibly smart, but he is also great at translating that into teaching. I honestly can't say a bad thing about him."
1375,1421990,4.0,3.0,"Good teacher, writes all the notes on the board during class with all the graphs and everything too, take all the notes and understand them and the problem sets he assigns and you will get an easy 100 on the problem sets and do fine on the tests, they are just like the problem sets"
1376,1421990,5.0,3.0,"Professor Grajzl is the absolute man.  He's unbelievably brilliant and a great lecturer, something that doesn't always go together.  As long as you try, he appreciates your work and grades accordingly.  He's extremely approachable and his accent makes you actually want to listen to what he's saying."
1377,1421990,1.5,2.0,"If you go to him for help, you'll get at least a B. Class attendence isn't required, but necessary. Ask a lot of questions. Expect to get a D on the tests/exams and ace the class."
1378,565933,5.0,4.0,TAKE HER.
1379,565933,4.5,4.0,"I was told to take a class with Professor Keen if I could, so I woke up three times a week for an 8:00 AM. But it was worth it, as it was one of the best classes I've taken. If she has the time to teach again in the future, seriously, take a class with her."
1380,565933,5.0,3.0,Professor Keen is absolutely amazing! I had her my first term for writing and it was by far my favorite class. She is somewhat of a tough grader but if you go in and talk to her during office hours she will give you specific things to change that will improve your grade on your next paper. Everyone should take one of her classes before graduating!
1381,565933,5.0,3.0,Prof. Keen is absolutely wonderful. Her Schools of Magic writing seminar was fantastic. She required only one formal draft and allows you to work in your own way on the other three papers. No busy-work &quot;writing exercises&quot; to be found; she offers TONS of advice for improving your writing. Very fair grader. Incredibly knowledgeable and fun. Take her!
1382,565933,5.0,3.0,"tops. a very friendly, engaging person to boot."
1383,565933,5.0,4.0,"I graduated from W&L several years ago and still enjoy keeping in touch with Professor Keen.  She is approachable and brilliant!  Go talk to her about your papers; she is super, super helpful! Really helps you talk through your own ideas and organize your thoughts.  Also great at catching random writing errors w/out making you feel stupid."
1384,565933,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful Professor. Very engaging, interesting, and nice. I always wanted to go to class even though it started at 8:30 am! Very helpful- go to office hours w/ paper topics or drafts and its very possible to do well.  She won't make you feel stupid and is open to different opinions. I learned a ton in her class and highly recommend her."
1385,565933,5.0,5.0,Brilliant and delightful. Pleasure to hav as a prof. Really engaging classroom. too bad she feels a need to prove herself as a &quot;stickler&quot; for the rules. on rare occasion can be unreasonable and merciless.
1386,565933,5.0,4.0,"hands down a superior professor. unbiased and fair, but you must do the reading if you want to do well. very helpful outside of class---she will gladly read your drafts! she was very engaging and insightful, and always in a good mood. I would take another of her classes in a heartbeat."
1387,565933,5.0,4.0,"this is hands down the best professor i have had at school.  she assigns very interesting books, which you really must read to get a good grade.  also, she is a genius. another english professor cited her as &quot;the smartest woman on campus&quot; a word of advice: for the papers, start earlyish and GO TALK TO HER. she'll read a whole draft in about 2 min"
1388,565933,5.0,4.0,"And she's off, full steam ahead and you better keep up. A very helpful prof who definitely knows her stuff. Keeps students engaged in small classes. Tough grader."
1389,565933,5.0,1.0,"Wonderful professor. Very engaging. Class might be at 8 a.m., but it's completely worth it. She's not a terribly tough grader and gets to know her students well. Lectures are always interesting."
1390,565933,5.0,3.0,"A great writer herself, Prof. Keen is an extremely helpful creative writing teacher.  Her comments gave the classes a great flow and pace."
1391,565933,5.0,4.0,No Comments
1392,565934,2.0,5.0,"Critical, but not constructively so. The worst experience I have had in a class at W&L."
1393,565934,5.0,4.0,"The best professor I have ever had. His lectures were incredibly insightful, and he was hilarious.  You are seriously cheating yourself if you do not take a class of his. You will become a better writer and reader. I cannot recommend him more highly. "
1394,565934,4.5,5.0,"Incredibly brilliant but tough Professor. He reads and offers advice on all drafts before you turn them in. Gives incredibly detailed comments on paper. I ended up pulling an A because he has an adjusted grading scale, which is nice."
1395,565934,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Warren's Environmental Poetry class has been my favorite class of my college career.  I am a science major and very skeptical in my writing ability, but he was very helpful in improving my writing.  That said, he is a tough grader on papers, but incredibly fair.  If you put in the work, he rewarded you. Sad he's leaving for Alaska"
1396,565934,2.5,4.0,"Possibly one of the most engaging and intelligent professors I have had at W&L. Lectures are always interesting. That being said, he is an incredibly harsh grader, so if you are thinking of being an English major, don't take him your 1st year because you might be discouraged by the grades you receive"
1397,565934,3.0,3.0,Any class you take with Warren is going to be about nature: be warned if you?re not into that sort of thing. Readings weren?t exceptionally interesting. GO TO OFFICE HOURS: He becomes more invested in you. Also reads papers if you bring them. Will I take another class of his&#63; Not if I can help it.
1398,565934,4.5,4.0,"Some of the best and most interesting lectures I've ever attended, tough grader though."
1399,565934,4.0,4.0,"Tough grader: expect 1 or 2 C+ papers. If you work hard though and listen to his suggestions your grade can improve. Got much better as a writer taking his course. Reading isn't very interesting which makes writing papers tough, but if you put in effort and your grade can improve. class is boring and mandatory"
1400,565934,4.0,5.0,Ahab incarnate.
1401,565934,2.5,5.0,"Very hard grader. Expects steady improvement, but does not clearly teach students how to improve. Does not provide examples of good writing and expects each student to enter the class as a practiced analyzer."
1402,565934,3.0,4.0,"Great guy, very smart. Doesn't know how to teach students to rise to his level, however. Expect to struggle if you aren't a master writer - expectations are too high"
1403,565934,4.5,4.0,"Challenges you to improve your writing and cut down on filler. If you do the reading, participate, and try to get his feedback on essays in progress you'll do great. He has a keen sense of humor, and is really interested in his students, If you talk to him he becomes more invested in you, and your grades might show it"
1404,565934,1.5,5.0,"Prof Warren is extremely hard and tells you all the things you are doing wrong and none you are doing right. He also doesnt direct you in the right way after tearing you to pieces. He is a genuinely nice man, but I didn't enjoy his class at all"
1405,565934,5.0,3.0,great prof
1406,565934,5.0,3.0,"really interesting prof... made discussions engaging, thought-provoking, enjoyable. An A is definitely hard to get, but i managed to pull off a B+ on a lot of things. go see him to discuss your thesis/ideas before writing papers and have good solid things to say -- he'll see that you're interested and help you out, which i think helped my grade"
1407,565934,5.0,4.0,"Yo, he is the man. Who else would take his students hiking&#63; He is tough as hell as a grader but fair nonetheless. B is easy to get. A is another story. Make you work really hard to perfection, but if you score an A, that means you're really good and deserve it. The BEST in the business...oh yeah, and did I mention his humor...he cussed..yeah really"
1408,565934,1.0,3.0,boo
1409,565934,5.0,3.0,"Professor Warren is a great teacher, he has an uncanny ability to keep me engaged in the material even at 8:30 in the morning"
1410,565934,5.0,3.0,"The readings were all related to the environment, which really didn't interest me.  But he's a great teacher and he knows his stuff. He likes participation, and really encourages students to come to him for help.  I never did, but I think if I had gone to him, I could have gotten an A instead of a B.  Genuinely nice guy."
1411,565934,5.0,4.0,No Comments
1412,2132656,5.0,3.0,He's the professor that shows me how cmpsci can be fun
1413,2132656,5.0,4.0,"While the class itself was hard, Professor Helmuth did a great job at making the material understandable, and was always open to meeting to help with labs. He was a good lecturer and did a good mix of lecture and class interaction for the course. Straightforward in expectations, and understanding and helpful. Would 100% recommend."
1414,2132656,5.0,2.0,I was in the first class that Helmuth taught and he was amazing!  He was such a great lecturer and was a quirky fun person to listen to.  He was helpful in lab and his expectations were clear and instructions easy to follow.
1415,2724532,5.0,3.0,"Took Sammons multiple times and this class was definitely my favorite. Sammons not only was very knowledgeable during the class, but was also visibly enthusiastic, which made it 10x more enjoyable!"
1416,2724532,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sammons is an excellent professor, who truly knows what he is doing. He provides amazing facilitation during class discussion, excellent lectures on broad topics, and good feedback outside of class. If you take Sammons, you can almost guarantee your semester with him will be great!"
1417,2724532,5.0,3.0,Great professor who is very clear in what he expects and wants. Can get a little monotonous but he tries his best to make it interesting. Pretty standard history class with a lot of material to cover. Tries to get as many different perspectives as he can. Gives some of the best feedback I've ever received.
1418,2724532,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sammons is new to W&amp;L circa 2021. I took his History of American Capitalism first-year seminar my freshman fall. The course design was excellent, full of interesting reads with topics ranging all the way back to slavery to modern cryptocurrency. Be prepared to read, write, and share. It isn't easy, but Sammons and his class are worth it."
1419,2724532,5.0,3.0,I had an amazing time taking a class from Professor Sammons. He assigns lots of readings and stresses the use of primary sources to promote critical thinking and writing. The classes are always upbeat and insightful. Professor Sammons is an exquisite teacher that has an impressive knowledge of American history and the development of capitalism.
1420,2724532,5.0,3.0,"GOAT professor. A must take for any student at Washington &amp; Lee. A lot of reading but they're all interesting, except for the 100 page one about grain elevators. Future Nobel Peace Prize winner. Harvard is calling his name."
1421,1962678,3.0,2.0,"Olga is a very nice person. She is from Russia and teaches the grammar aspect of the Russian Language. For the most part, if you make an effort to show up, do homework, and participate in class (even if you are completely wrong) you will get a good grade. Honestly cares about students understanding, no matter how long it takes."
1422,729789,5.0,4.0,"After taking two courses with Dr. Murdock, I can safely say that she has been one of the best, most inspirational professors I've ever had.  She is incredibly intelligent but also very relatable and understanding. She is always willing to help you out whether it be organizing a paper or planning out your post-w&l future. Truly an gem!"
1423,729789,5.0,3.0,I had so much fun taking Murdock's class. Abnormal was my favorite class I've ever taken in my life and I would take it again if I could. Dr. Murdock is very clear about what information is important and she is very good at answering your questions.
1424,729789,5.0,4.0,Professor Murdock is an angel! Super clear and helpful outside of class. Tough grader but she is the nicest professor I've had here and wants her students to do well.
1425,729789,4.5,2.0,"After 2 classes with her, Prof. Murdock has become one of my favorite professors at W&L. She is incredibly nice and helpful, her lectures are clear, and the class overall is not difficult if you pay attention and take good notes. Also, she's really funny."
1426,729789,4.0,4.0,"very clear teacher, uses power points religiously. very helpful outside of class. interesting lecturer."
1427,729789,5.0,4.0,"Excellent class,  hard tests"
1428,729789,3.5,5.0,No Comments
1429,475839,5.0,3.0,"JTD is fantastic. If you can get him, do it, because he's probably the most in-demand prof here"
1430,475839,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors at W&L, if not the best. You will do yourself a disservice by not taking his courses. He's an extremely intelligent man who cares about his students, and also happens to be a great, funny guy. Class will not be a pre-written lecture, he's quick enough to respond to the conversation in the room. You'll learn a lot!"
1431,475839,5.0,4.0,genuinely interested in his students and genuinely interesting course. best professor at W&L
1432,475839,5.0,4.0,"Brilliant, engaging, caring, funny, available, accepting, unbelievable. Take all of his classes."
1433,475839,5.0,2.0,"JTD is the boss of Global Politics. If you want to major in politics and focus on global, you should take all his classes. Wrote his own Global textbook and it's so good you can use it as a source for the papers you write in his class. Princeton graduate, genius analyst and writer, great sense of humor. High standards but worth the effort."
1434,475839,5.0,2.0,"Go to class, go see him in his office hours, write 3 good papers and you will get a solid grade. Very straight forward POL  105 class.  You will get out of it what you put it. Reading isn't exactly required, because there are no tests or exams. He is a really good guy, who does care about his students."
1435,475839,4.5,4.0,Great Prof. Extremely interesting and helpful. I learned so much in his class and had a true understanding of the material. Engaging in class and very open to different ideas. Highly recommended
1436,475839,5.0,4.0,Prof. Dickovick is the best professor in the politics department.  Period.
1437,475839,4.5,4.0,I'm kind of obsessed with him.
1438,475839,5.0,3.0,Prof. Dickovick is amazing.  I've never met a professor who is so interested in his students and cares so much about how they are doing.  Do yourself a favor and take a class with him before you graduate.
1439,475839,4.5,4.0,"Great professor that assigns great readings and leads class conversations that really probe the issues.  Tends to have all the work due in the last week, so that will be very stressful and you will leave campus without any clue what grade you are earning.  Otherwise a great prof."
1440,475839,4.0,4.0,"Professor Dickovick is amazing.  You shouldn't graduate from W&L without taking a class from him-- it's an amazing experience.  They way he runs his classes is incredibly engaging.  Not an easy grader, but you know you deserve it if you do well."
1441,475839,5.0,3.0,"Great guy - we always had a good time in class.  Lots of discussion, lots of reading but it's really worth it.  Some of the readings are dry but others are really great.  If you can find a way to game the system to get Dickovick, do it."
1442,475839,5.0,3.0,"He is the best thing that happened to W&L, ever."
1443,475839,5.0,4.0,"Stands out as the best politics professor I've ever had.  He cares about his students and goes out of his way to make sure everyone understands what's going on, but still expects a lot of work.  Relatively easy B - difficult A.  A great person."
1444,475839,5.0,3.0,"Professor Dickovick is great! He was my 1st politics professor here and I've loved him- not an easy grader, but not awfully hard either. Very nice, and a good class environment."
1445,475839,4.5,3.0,I LOVE HIM!  He is one of the most engaging politics teachers that I have ever had.  He loves teaching and his students.
1446,475839,5.0,4.0,"He is an amazing professor. Assigns quite a bit of reading and is a tough grader- so dont take his class if u want an easy A. However u learn a LOT. i was never bored once during class, and he's really funny too. I would highly recommend his class to anyone who is willing to put in some work!"
1447,475839,5.0,4.0,"I am a Pro. Dickovick fan! Great class dicussions. Really encourages students to examine look beyond their immediate reactions to see all sides of an arguement. Reading can be a little intense sometimes, but the conversion, writing and study skills I learned were well worth it.  Take this class!"
1448,475839,4.5,4.0,"very helpful during office hours and is a great facilitator of class discussion. I felt the class was very productive. Sometimes the reading can get a little heavy but, if you are interested in the topic you will not mind it at all. FYI: He went to Princeton."
1449,475839,3.0,3.0,I was told that you cannot learn anything about politics in a politics class.  After taking this class....I agree.  TOO MUCH READING
1450,475839,5.0,3.0,Dickovick is the man.  He makes material interesting and is good at facilitating a conversation in class.  One of the best Prof's ive ever had
1451,475839,4.0,3.0,Dickovick rocks my world!  I love how he pushes/encourages students to explore all (or many) sides of a political debate/issue before they form their opinion.
1452,475839,4.0,3.0,"For a a guy right out of school, he acts likes he's been teaching for years. The workload seems a bit much at times, but I found him very interesting. Only about 4 or 5 grades; most of the work is reading and discussion based. I reccommened him."
1453,1438420,4.0,4.0,"The lectures and structure of class were great. Lepage is very nice and creates a comfortable class environment. It was an easy class until preparing for exams, which required an insane amount of memorization. It was doable, but required a lot of effort. Do not take the class if you struggle with memorization!"
1454,1438420,5.0,3.0,"The professor is an amazing orator and warm figure, and the subject matter is so interesting. Professor Lepage is passionate and it really shows through her love of the material. I wish I had taken this class earlier because now I want to take more of her classes! "
1455,1438420,5.0,4.0,"Professor Lepage is a wonderful teacher. I took her Dutch Art class, and we really got to dive into the specifics of Dutch life and how that translated into the art. It was incredibly interesting, and Professor Lepage was extremely knowledgeable on the topic. Absolutely loved her lectures. If you like art history, take a class with Lepage."
1456,1438420,5.0,4.0,Take a class with LePage if you can. Shes one of W&Ls best.
1457,1438420,5.0,4.0,"Took Prof. Lepage's survey course Winter 2020 when we got sent home, and while she was a great professor before, she went above and beyond to make sure the transition to remote classes was as painless as possible. Her lectures were always comprehensive, organized, and straightforward but still interesting. Provided very helpful study materials."
1458,1438420,5.0,3.0,"Prof Lepage is the greatest. This class helped me to understand history in completely new ways but if you can get into any of her classes, don't miss the opportunity!"
1459,1438420,5.0,3.0,"Very passionate and understanding, and always there to help! Puts a lot of effort into even intro courses. Of all of my classes that went online, this one was the best."
1460,1438420,5.0,3.0,I love Professor Lepage! I think she really cares about her students and about her subject matter and it shows! her passion and enthusiasm has inspired me to keep taking ARTH courses! I loved the vast array of material and Professor Lepage's kindness and compassion in her teaching. I felt comfortable and excited in this learning environment.
1461,1438420,3.0,4.0,"I found this class pretty boring and was looking at the clock a whole bunch. She really loves what she's teaching, but it didn't really translate to making the class engaging or interesting. It was hard to know what she wanted on the papers even with going to office hours."
1462,1438420,5.0,3.0,"Lepage is great, and she's super passionate about the material. She changed my mind about art for sure and now I'm considering possibly minoring in art history. Her grading criteria is a little specific but once you figure it out, you'll do well. You don't necessarily need to read the books but it helps. Take her and this class if you can."
1463,1438420,5.0,3.0,"The professors were amazing and so passionate about their work. They were dedicated and extremely enthusiastic about the project. The best parts were working as a team, having these 2 professors, the relationships we formed, meeting community members. Well planned and organized. Lots of work to paint the mural but I couldn't have enjoyed it more."
1464,1438420,5.0,3.0,"Prof Lepage is a true gem!! Her lectures are fantastic and she encourages participation. The tests are all memorization, so that can be difficult because of the amount you have to memorize, but otherwise that's the only challenge. I took her for ARTH102 and it was a super interesting class, especially for an FDR."
1465,1438420,5.0,3.0,Professor Lepage is by far one of my favorite professors at W&amp;L. Very knowledgeable. She's passionate about Meso art and the material is really interesting. I wish Id taken classes with her earlier. The final project is a lot of work and very time consuming but I learned a lot. Exams are easy though you have to memorize a lot.
1466,1438420,5.0,4.0,Prof Lepage is passionate about border art and she'll inspire you to care too! This class is discussion heavy and there is a fair amount of reading. Grades based on a short paper and a big research paper at the end plus blogging. We met many artists. Take it. you'll learn a lot about a contemporary issue from a passionate and caring prof!
1467,1438420,5.0,2.0,"Shes great! Go to her about papers and think through your argument beforehand and you should be fine. If you put in effort she'll reward you. Also super interesting course, learn a lot about the politics surrounding the border currently."
1468,1438420,5.0,3.0,"Prof Lepage is amazing. For Arth, the memorization is pretty minimal. She wants to know you understand material, the Historical context, and artistic styles. Very reasonable expectations. Not terribly difficult. I have had her twice and she gets very excited about any class. She is very helpful in and outside of class."
1469,1438420,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Lepage really cares about Latino Art history herself and sometimes forgets that her students are not so passionate or knowledgable about the material. There are not many grades, and her expectations for the written assignments are not extremely clear. Her tests are always in the same format and entail a lot of memorization of lecture notes."
1470,1438420,4.5,3.0,"My favorite part of the class was Mexican murals, but the I learned tons about Argentinian and Columbian artists that I never heard of.  Definitely take this class if you ever consider traveling to Latin America. Several exams. You have to study but the guidelines are clear and she gives out great study guides. One of my favorite profs so far!"
1471,1438420,4.5,2.0,"Very nice woman.  The class was extremely interesting and the grading was very fair.  Tests were not hard, but you do need to study a bit.  Take her!"
1472,1438420,5.0,3.0,Months later I am still telling all of my friends about this class. One of the best classes that I have taken. Meeting Cheech was the highlight of my year. Fantastic class!
1473,1438420,4.5,3.0,Great class and prof! Meeting Cheech was amazing.Ideal amount of work for the spring term. Def rec. taking this class.
1474,1438420,4.0,3.0,Great class and prof. Very clear about expectations. Easy quizzes. Def worth taking!
1475,1438420,5.0,3.0,I am taking this class for LACS credit but love the material so much that I'm considering a minor in art history. Prof Lepage makes the material interesting and entertaining and is extremely helpful. I'm planning to take her Baroque class next term! Highly recommend!
1476,1438420,5.0,1.0,She is very helpful. I like her. Mexican murals is a VERY easy Spring Term class. Go for it!
1477,1438420,4.0,2.0,I love Professor Lepage. She really knows her material and loves her students. Taking her classes is a joy and she makes in challenging and fascinating without killing you with work. She is super helpful and does everything she can to ensure that her students have the resources to do well on quizzes and exams. Awesome professor.
1478,1438420,4.5,4.0,I took this class as an FDR but decided to major in Art History because of Prof. Lepage. She is passionate about the material and extemely accessible. I can't say enough good things about Prof. Lepage!
1479,1438420,4.5,3.0,I took this class as an FDR but decided to major in art history because of Prof. Lepage. She is passionate about the material and extemely accessible. I loved writing the final paper and appreciated that we could pick our own topics. I can't say enough great things about Prof. Lepage!
1480,1438420,2.0,3.0,"If you have ever taken a survey art history class from the renaissance to the present, don't take this - it's a lot of review. Be sure to attend every class as there are no make-up times for quizzes or tests missed. And ask her to be specific with what she wants for each paper. I would recommend taking classes from Profs. Simpson or Bent instead."
1481,1823447,4.0,2.0,Good
1482,1823447,3.0,2.0,There is a slight language barrier with Bini (maybe more cultural) but he is awesome! Easy A if you pay attention and participate and also kind of hot in an older guy kind of way. Two thumbs up!
1483,1823447,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Bini is great for Italian Crime Film! this spring term class meets 3x a week in afternoons to watch and discuss movies. Some days of heavy reading, but overall one of the most manageable and fun classes offered."
1484,502493,5.0,4.0,"Anybody who is serious about Journalism should take Richardson. He's not easy, but he is really helpful and approachable. He might call you out on a mistake, but he never makes you feel bad when he critiques your work. You just have to know that he doesn't like to give A's."
1485,502493,5.0,4.0,"He holds a high standard of journalistic reporting but that's how we learn, right?  He is very experienced, funny, and a wonderful person.  Take him if you are really into Journalism."
1486,502493,4.5,4.0,went to class because he was funny. learned a lot. taking another class with him in the winter.
1487,502493,5.0,4.0,"Not the easiest professor, but I learned so much. His grading scale is a little hard but still fair. He is very tech-savvy and responds to emails very quickly. He was always available to help students. Overall, I loved having him as a professor and I and I would love to have him as a professor in the future."
1488,502493,3.5,5.0,Richardson is really tough. In both classes I've had with him - one journalism and one politics - he has relied heavily on the textbook. He expects you to remember a lot of information so reading is absolutely necessary.
1489,502493,3.5,2.0,"Professor Richardson is humorous, yet clearly passionate about the subject that he teaches.  The man has a lot of experience in the journalism industry and he definitely knows his stuff.  He offers a fair amount of extra credit, so if you take advantage of that and just do the assigned readings, you will do well in the course."
1490,502493,2.0,5.0,"The man is an establishment at the journalism department. Well qualified, but don't expect to get any grade higher than a C no matter how many hours you work. Personable outside of class, but this has no reflection on grades."
1491,502493,1.0,5.0,"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. worst thing that has happened to this school."
1492,502493,1.0,4.0,"he was not understanding of the fact that msot of the people in the class were not journalism majors, as the class had been reclassified as a politics class. one of the worst teachers I have had at W&L.  way too full of himself."
1493,502493,1.0,5.0,"you hate him or love him, and most of that depends on how he views you.  god forbid he doesn't choose you as one of his favorites...best to keep off his radar."
1494,502493,2.0,4.0,"Unless you're a passionate journalism major, avoid"
1495,502493,3.5,4.0,"good prof. tough grader. very knowledgable. quite pedantic though. expect a low grade no matter how hard you study. tends to make his mind up about you right from the start so if you're a j major, watch out."
1496,502493,5.0,4.0,"He is simply wonderful. Great adviser, great professor, hard grader, but fair. Wants you to learn. Will give you props if you impress him (but he's hard to impress). Really cares about you, your life and whether or not you learn. Fantastically funny (watch for the jokes at the beginning of class)."
1497,502493,5.0,4.0,"Everyone summed it up pretty well already - some say he's a hard grader, but I think you get the grade you really deserve. He does not suffer fools gladly, but if you work hard and pay attention in class you will feel his appreciation.  A great guy from whom I learned a great deal.  One of the most useful classes (for the real-world) I ever took."
1498,502493,4.0,5.0,"Tough grader. Great all-around guy. Just watch what you say to him, because if he think's you're an idiot, your grade will reflect it."
1499,502493,5.0,5.0,"HE'S BALD, HE'S WEEDY, AND HE HAS GLASSES.....HEEEEEEEEEEEEE'S PROFESSOR BRIAN RICHARDSON!DIG THE CHARLES MANSON PHOTO IN HIS OFFICE RIGHT AS YOU WALK IN.FUNNY JOKES, FUNNY MANNERISMS. MAD PROPS FOR THE KNOWLEDGE OF POPULAR &quot;BEAT&quot; MUSIC."
1500,502493,1.0,5.0,"the sign on his door says it all: if you were smarter, i'd be nicer. doesn't give a crap for his students. knowledgeable, but an ass. and a lot of work. be prepared to get a low grade."
1501,502493,5.0,4.0,Very organized. Serious yet wildly entertaining.
1502,502493,5.0,4.0,"Great guy, great teacher.  Tough but fair.  Very funny, and not in the HP Porter-oh-my-god-look-at-this-trainwreck-of-a-person way most professors are, but funny in a genuinely amusing way."
1503,168671,4.0,4.0,"Professor Sukow is great at breaking down complicated concepts in simpler terms. Lectures touch on concepts from the book and sometimes involve long derivations, so make sure to utilize the textbook. Office hours proved extremely helpful. Tests were large, but half of each was take home with open notes. He is generous with partial credit."
1504,168671,4.0,4.0,"A very smart guy, but sometimes it will be difficult to understand his words. Office hour is very nice. He will be patient to answer your questions."
1505,168671,4.0,3.0,"Super interesting professor but MAN his classes are hard (except probably his spring class). A ton of homework and extremely difficult material. The hardest classes you'll take at W&amp;L. Be prepared for a lot of stress and frustration. Collaboration with classmates is key. Lectures are entertaining, but he's a little hard to reach outside class."
1506,168671,5.0,5.0,"Hands down the hardest and yet most rewarding class I've ever taken at W&L. Dr. Sukow is undoubtedly the physics department's strongest theorist. Unfortunately, he is very very strict. If you're one of those C-school majors going for the easy A, don't take this class. If you want to learn physics, take Dr. Sukow."
1507,168671,4.0,3.0,"His tests aren't the easiest, but he is a very fair grader and is always there to help you out if you ask for it."
1508,168671,1.5,5.0,"I will never recommend this professor to others. He cannot even teach and tries to be funny somehow but not funny at all. He does not require attendance but he wants to see you there. his lectures are useless. Everyone basically had to study from the textbook, not from the lecture. DONT TAKE HIS CLASS ITS HARD AND USELESS."
1509,168671,5.0,5.0,"Fantastic professor. He knows what he is talking about and makes going to class extremely interesting, even for the most boring of topics. Funny guy as well, he's never at loss for puns for sure. Didn't had him for intro, but would recommend him to anyone. Gives lots of partial credit."
1510,168671,4.0,4.0,"Awesome teacher, great at keeping a class engaged and interested in the material. Really knows his stuff, and always has a joke up his sleeve to keep class interesting. Beware, his tests are tougher than the other sections."
1511,168671,4.0,4.0,A fantastic professor whose skill at imparting comprehension unto his beloved students is matched only by his lightening-quick wit and jaw-dropping good looks.
1512,168671,1.0,5.0,"It's a disgrace to our university that this man is still allowed to teach.  I would do anything possible to never take one if his classes.  If you're thinking about becoming a major in something he teaches, I'd consider switching majors."
1513,168671,1.0,5.0,This man will stab you in the back
1514,168671,4.5,3.0,An awesome teacher and an awesome guy.
1515,168671,4.5,4.0,Fantastic teacher for a not very interesting subject. He is very organized and his expectations are clear from day one of the class and his grading policies are very fair.
1516,168671,3.0,2.0,"NOT very nice at all!!  He was an okay guy at first, but then I tried to talk to him about rescheduling an exam and he was awful."
1517,168671,5.0,4.0,"He loves science and he wants all of his students to love it too, and it's hard not to when he makes it so interesting.  Not to mention his corny jokes and quirky way of relating to students makes his classes truly enjoyable.  If you have to take a lab science, Astronomy is it."
1518,168671,5.0,3.0,"Awesome, just awesome!  I hate science but this guy makes it bareable because he's funny and extremely nice.  Great teacher and you learn, too.  Best teacher I've had at W&L, too bad I'm a C-school major. Bonus: on Halloween, he comes to class in costume"
1519,168671,4.5,2.0,a very nice guy
1520,168671,4.5,4.0,No Comments
1521,2235112,5.0,3.0,Taking a class online can be hard. Dr. Mickel knew how to make it interesting and to give feedback in a helpful way. He takes time if you have questions. You can tell he likes teaching and knows his stuff. Material is actually useful and relevant. I'd take another class of his.
1522,2235112,2.0,2.0,"YAWN. Lectures were boring and so not helpful. I don't feel like I learned anything useful in this class, and it was such an easy A."
1523,2235112,5.0,4.0,Solid class and great prof. He takes time to help you when you need it and gives lots of feedback. It is clear he cares about your success. Few classes actually prepare you with applicable skills like this one.
1524,2235112,5.0,3.0,Great and knowledgeable
1525,2235112,5.0,4.0,Dr. Mickel is awesome! He's engaged in the class and really wants his students to succeed. Anytime I had questions he was always going the extra mile to make sure they were answered. This is one of those classes that I really think will be useful to me as I look for jobs and move forward in my professional career. You definitly work for your grade
1526,2235112,5.0,4.0,It is a shame that W&amp;L's best professors isn't actually in the comp. sci. department. I took Dr. Mickel for a databases course and learned so much. He goes out of his way to make time to help students during office hours. He's awesome. Highly recommend taking him if you have the chance.
1527,2235112,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mickel is new to W&L, but one of the best professors I've taken here. He is incredibly knowledgeable about all things computer related and really wants students to learn. He makes himself accessible to answer questions at any time of the day, even during an exam he will get back to you within minutes.  He is a nice guy and fair grader."
1528,109289,3.0,1.0,"Sanders class is something that everyone should experience for themselves. He often goes off on tangents about random things, but that makes the class fun. The work is very easy, his quizzes are graded out of 10 but he usually gives 16 questions, do your journals and you'll certainly do well. Overall I would highly recommend him to anyone"
1529,109289,3.5,2.0,"Great man.  Go to class on Fridays.  If you do the work, you're golden."
1530,109289,2.5,2.0,"The man is crazy. Expect to learn more about the loch ness monster, bigfoot, and his family ghost Max than about ancient egypt. Almost no work involved and you only need to attend classes on friday for his weekly quizzes which are a joke. He is the kind of teacher that gives everyone a B+ no matter how well or poorly you do."
1531,109289,5.0,3.0,I have taken just about all of his classes.  Great Proferssor.
1532,109289,4.0,2.0,"Sanders is the man! His class is awesome, he is humurous, laid back, and a true gentleman.  A little disorganized sometimes, but his stories are interesting he gives sound affects and some crazy facts.  His reading quizes are even better.  Take the class to at least experiance the legend of Prof. Sanders!"
1533,109289,3.5,1.0,"Sanders is the man!! i love the guy! He is sooo laid back and easy going.  Each day in class you hear a new and crazy story of some sort.  His class brings a smile to my face, you won't regret taking it at all"
1534,109289,3.0,2.0,"Seriously cool guy. Sanders is what professors should be like. Smart, principled, well-mannered, and humorous. Genuine through and through. His family's roots at W&L go back to the 1700's. Take this man's classes if only to experience the legend that is Dr. Sanders."
1535,109289,1.0,2.0,"Easily the most disorganized prof i've ever encountered.  Totally unpredictable, impossible to know what to do and when to do it.  Avoid at all costs if you actually like history."
1536,109289,3.0,2.0,"One of the old school types. Very funny and laid back. Definitely a cool guy. Lectures are boring, however, and disorganized. Supposed to be an easy A - we'll see."
1537,109289,2.0,2.0,crazy man horrible teacher fun class not too hard if he likes you youll get a decent grade
1538,109289,3.5,4.0,"Hey, this guy's really cool.  Get's lost in lectures and starts giving the battle scenes sound effects ... He likes the Tories ... and a Kipling fan ... This is what Professors are supposed to be ..."
1539,109289,5.0,3.0,Do not miss this man or his classes. You will remember him forever.
1540,109289,2.5,1.0,"real guy, hilarious..didnt learn much about the topic of the class, but learned alot about life. take him if you can"
1541,109289,1.5,2.0,Didn't learn much - hardly got halfway through the material we should have - lectures were random and confusing
1542,109289,5.0,1.0,Bottom Line:  Sanders is the Man!!!
1543,109289,1.0,2.0,No Comments
1544,109289,2.0,1.0,"Really easy, boring, and worthless class"
1545,109289,5.0,1.0,Best professor I have ever had and will ever have. The stories and rants are the funniest things I've ever heard come out of the mouth of a professor in any class.
1546,2040557,3.0,1.0,Learned so many things beyond the classroom with Dr. Flexington. If only I remembered all of them. (The chemistry towards the ends makes things blurry)
1547,2040557,4.5,5.0,"Wow is he hard. Probably the hardest professor Ive ever done. Wasnt always clear with what He wanted me to do, which would have been helpful since it was my first time. He gets very upset if you dont participate as well. But going downtown with him got me some extra credit, so I was able to get an A."
1548,2040557,5.0,1.0,"The class was a blurr for the most part, but Indefinitely had a good time."
1549,2040557,3.5,1.0,"Really just an incredible professor, knows how to have a good time too. A 5-star prof in every way, but my clarity rating was a little low because things got a little blurry towards the end..."
1550,2040557,5.0,1.0,Professor Flexington could probably start his own cult with all the knowledge he has in that head. Not to mention he's super cute. 10/10 would stare at his face for an hour every day again. 
1551,2040557,5.0,1.0,Dr. Flexington really made me question my beliefs about the world. Great guy with an astounding presence. Just make sure you attend all of his classes. I can't see that being a problem with how great of a mentor he is. 
1552,910068,4.0,2.0,"Professor Botta's courses are manageable and enjoyable. If you put in the work, it is easy to get a good grade. She is fair and cares about her students. Overall recommend."
1553,910068,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed taking Professor Botta for Spanish 220. She is very sweet and accessible outside of class, but be prepared to have lots of readings. We had a paper, a midterm, and a final. Paying attention in class is important and good note taking will help you do well."
1554,910068,5.0,1.0,Botta is an amazing professor who you will not regret taking. She is extremely kind and truly cares about her students- also a very lenient grader.
1555,910068,5.0,2.0,Super lovable person! Pretty lenient grader and it's clear that she really cares for her students.
1556,910068,5.0,2.0,Barely any homework. Loveable teacher. Cares about her students. You can know almost zero spanish and still do well in her classes.
1557,910068,5.0,2.0,Profesora Botta is one of my favorite people on this planet. You will absolutely not regret taking her class.
1558,910068,5.0,2.0,"super sweet lady, VHL homework every night including weekends, but its all manageable. 6 chapter tests, two orals, and two essays none are too rough"
1559,910068,3.5,3.0,Professor Botta is incredibly sweet and truly wants her students to learn the material. She's not an incredibly hard grader and just wants everyone to improve their spanish. Definitely take her!
1560,910068,4.5,1.0,"Profesora Botta is the sweetest woman in the Spanish department.  She doesn't make the material harder than it needs to be - overall you hardly have to exert yourself to get an A.  I should say that her English is pretty poor, though. (my class was 100% in Spanish) Overall: 5/5 would take again, sin vacilar ni un poquito."
1561,910068,5.0,2.0,Absolutely wonderful! Take a class with her!
1562,910068,3.0,2.0,"Sweet woman. Grade consists of a couple quizzes and two big tests plus the final (which wasn?t cumulative), and two 5-minute plays. She?s really into Spanish theatre. We read 9 or 10 short stories (which is what the plays are based from). Pretty painless material."
1563,910068,4.0,1.0,Really nice prof- very easy but classes are entertaining and get you to enjoy the language. Take a class with her!
1564,910068,5.0,1.0,"Botta is a really nice prof. Tests and quizzes are covered in class. Really fair teacher. Compositions are short and easy to write. Wants students to do well. Only drawback is that she requires two dramatic acting scenes based on readings, but if you can suck it up and get through these, the class is enjoyable and easy. Definitely recommend Botta"
1565,910068,4.0,2.0,Very nice and sweet. Show up to class with something to say and you'll be fine. Nothing tricky or complicated about her or the class at all; very straightforward and to the point.
1566,910068,3.0,1.0,Professor Botta's class is fairly easy if you do the reading and come to class. She is super nice and lets you speak in English a fair amount.  The only bad part was when she made us act in class (her expertise is in Spanish theater). Good way to fulfill the Lit. requirement.
1567,910068,5.0,1.0,Great teacher.  Very nice.  Very helpful.  Interesting works.  Great way to complete the Lit gen ed.
1568,910068,3.0,2.0,Probably one of my favorite teachers.  She is truly interested in making sure that you understand what is going.  She is very fair and doesn't try to be tricky.

1570,910068,5.0,1.0,"She is a fantastic teacher, really sweet and fun.  She took our class on a field trip to DC.  She wants to make sure that everyone understands, and that everyone is able to keep up.  She handled our class really well, even though we had so many different levels of Spanish.  A lot of times she even hands out typed notes."
1571,910068,4.5,2.0,"She is the sweetest teacher ever! I really enjoyed her class, and she is one of the best Spanish teachers I've ever had. I learned a lot. There's not too much work, and the tests aren't bad at all."
1572,631549,5.0,2.0,"Owen is really the best professor on campus!! He is so gentle, patient, and knowledgeable, and everything he required is reasonable and manageable. He is really the best, and I would love to more classes with him."
1573,631549,5.0,2.0,Owen is a great teacher. He really knows his theatre inside and out and cares about improving his class. No question is stupid and no experience is not valuable. This was a truly enjoyable way to learn about the underside of theater.
1574,631549,5.0,1.0,"Good guy, and easy class. Most grades come from textbook quizzes which are just there to make sure you read them, have simple questions on them."
1575,631549,3.5,2.0,"Easy class, hear Mish is an easier grader... but if you do the assigned work you'll get an A"

1577,969476,5.0,3.0,"Prof Reiter can be intimidating at first, but she's a really great prof who knows a lot and creates interesting discussions. She's not too difficult and allows for you to focus on the topics your interested in. She does care heavily about participation but chiming up occasionally in class will be enough. Really solid professor all around"
1578,969476,4.5,4.0,"passionate about material, very enthusiastic, but crazy hard grader. will have to work for your grade. participation is a huge factor in class. "
1579,969476,5.0,2.0,spring term business ethics course...she is one of the best teachers i've ever had at w&l...really goes out of her way to interact with students and make class discussion interesting. i loved this class.
1580,969476,4.5,3.0,"Awesome professor.  Fun and interesting class.  Lots of reading.  Then again, it was a spring term course.  Case studies were interesting.  She brings a lot to the table."
1581,316168,5.0,3.0,"Really fun class. Absolutely loved it and always had me engaged. Sometimes the class gets too sidetracked to get through all the material, but he's available outside to help. He explained things well, and the tests were pretty easy and actually fun. The first two were in groups, though the tests aren't hard enough to necessitate one. "
1582,316168,4.0,3.0,"Professor Dresden is a great choice for 221. He's the funniest professor I've had at W&amp;L. He assigns homework after every class but it isn't bad at all. Grading is based on 3 exams, 2 of which are done in groups of 2/3. Would highly recommend!"
1583,316168,2.0,5.0,"Great human, iffy teacher. Lessons usually aren't covered before the hw for it is due. If you already know Calc 2, this is the class for you. Or maybe not. Tests are very loosely related to the math covered in class, and 3 tests  90% of your grade. Resources barely help. He uses q's wolfram explicitly can't do. If you need structure, don't take."
1584,316168,5.0,3.0,His class was virtual this term and he never made you keep your camera on in class. The tests are done in groups and open note with an oral exam that only helps you. Assigns a decent amount of homework but very doable. Spends half the class going over homework and the other half doing lecture. Overall highly recommend Dresden.
1585,316168,5.0,2.0,If there was a tier ranking of professors Dresden is easily S/God tier. Automatic pick one.
1586,316168,5.0,3.0,Dr. Dre is a legend. He makes Ellen DeGeneres jokes about natural logs (ln) and he uses the film UP to teach us about life. He is also an excellent math teacher who is always available to help.
1587,316168,5.0,5.0,"Awesome professor, good class"
1588,316168,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, even if you arent a great math student. He is readily available and loves to help."
1589,316168,5.0,4.0,"Tough, but fair. Lots of homework, but I felt that I really understood the material. Hi, Dr. Dre! Hope you have a great summer!"
1590,316168,5.0,1.0,"Really easy class. The quizzes are almost exactly the same as the hw problems, and the tests weren't challenging. Final was long, but easy."
1591,316168,5.0,4.0,"Professor Dresden is VERY clear during the lectures, and the homework is not mandatory (but essential). The material is hard, but he is helpful during office hours and willing to meet at other times. He helps us out a lot on homework quizzes and is very funny. Would take again"
1592,316168,4.0,4.0,Professor Dresden is great. His class is very organized and the lectures are easy to follow. He literally writes down every word he says on the chalkboard which is very helpful when taking notes. The homework problems are difficult but he goes over them in class right before the quizzes. Great professor and would take again.
1593,316168,4.5,5.0,"Nice guy, but is always covered in chalk. Sometimes he mumbles and sometimes makes obscure references to movies I've never seen. But yeah, a good teacher. "
1594,316168,5.0,2.0,Professor Dresden is literally the best! He is so helpful and amazing in class. His notes are very clear and he will go out of his way to make sure you understand the information. Awesome use of colored chalk.
1595,316168,4.5,4.0,"Dresden is a great professor.  If you enjoy math, you'll enjoy his classes.  I've had him for quite a few classes, and it's always been a good choice.  Though he assigns a lot of homework, he wants students to succeed.  His office hours are incredibly helpful. If you have the chance, take one of his classes - you'll get a lot out of it."
1596,316168,5.0,1.0,"Great friend, great professor, great mentor, and the sole reason a math hater like me become a math major."
1597,316168,5.0,3.0,You need to take a class with him before you graduate. He is the man.
1598,316168,5.0,4.0,"The man. The reason I am a math major. Brilliant teacher and an absolutely nice guy. Incredibly clear in class. His tests are challenging, but Dr. Dre is incredibly forgiving. If I could, I would take Professor Dresden every semester."
1599,316168,5.0,2.0,He reaches out to all levels of students in class whether you might not be sure about math or you are planning to be an math major. 100% worth taking.
1600,316168,4.0,2.0,He's the man. Cool in class and makes everything crystal clear. And he looks funny too!
1601,316168,5.0,3.0,Dr. Dre is most definitely someone you want to take. He is dedicated to helping people out and often writes out stuff on the board with an almost OCD clarity.
1602,316168,5.0,4.0,"It says something about him that the only negative comment people can in in 5 pages worth is that if you're bad at math calculus will be hard. Even so, if you go to his office hours he will help you until you get it. SO so nice and totally adorable. He is a great teacher, even for someone like me who hates math. Dresden is awesome!!!! Take him!!!!!"
1603,316168,4.5,2.0,"I LOVED Professor Dresden even though I hate Calculus.  I would recommend his classes to anyone, because he loves the subject, is hilarious, and if you do the work you will definitely do well in his course.  He is SUPER helpful if you come to office hours, and he is always covered in chalk."
1604,316168,4.5,3.0,"Excellent teacher... I am biased because I love math, but i thought that he kept the class interesting. He wants students to do well so he is available for extra help and gave several take home tests. Definitely take his class if you can!"
1605,316168,4.5,2.0,"Dresden is the man, not too hard, and will give take home tests if grades are getting low in the class. Just do some of you homework and review your quizes. HE IS THE MAN"
1606,316168,4.5,2.0,"Nice guy who is animated enough to keep even people disinterested in math paying attention. He explains things very clearly, and made the material comprehensible for someone who isn't mathematically inclined (like me). I had him for 102 also, and both classes certainly required you to to the homework, but it wasn't onerous and tests weren't bad."
1607,316168,5.0,3.0,"Dresden's the man. I leave my last class tired and feel completely rejuvenated after his. Dresden is good at explaining things, and he'll understand your intentions when you ask questions. I like that about him."
1608,316168,5.0,2.0,"besides being constantly covered in chalk dust, dresden is awesome. i hate math, and calc never made much sense, but he makes it fun and interesting, and he makes calc comprehensible. generally the quizzes and homework are on the same level, but the tests are harder, and longer. also, 4 classes a week always become 3 classes a week."
1609,316168,5.0,3.0,"i love him. he's one of the best professors! he knows how to get students understand and keep me going to class and awake in class. the tests are easier than homework, and he won't test things he didn't mention before. take the dresden's math!!"
1610,316168,2.5,4.0,"A pretty funny guy, but a very hard teacher.  If you are not good at math you will likely struggle in the Calc 101 class."
1611,316168,3.0,4.0,"He does keep you awake with those jokes. I like him, but... well, it's calculus. If you like calculus, you should like this class. If not, it'll be a bear; especially the tests."
1612,316168,4.0,4.0,CLass was fun and interesting and his corny jokes keep you awake.  The tests are MUCH more difficult than the homework and reviews so watch out.
1613,316168,2.5,4.0,"I made a 5 on my AP Calc AB exam and am struggling to pass this class. He is not a good teacher, he seems disinterested in teaching low level math classes, his tests are much harder than the homework. Take computer science."
1614,316168,5.0,2.0,professor dresden in the best teacher. He explains every concept fully is really amusing to listen to. Best math class I have ever had.
1615,316168,4.5,1.0,I LOVE Prof. Dresden. He makes math bearable! His corny jokes and the easy material made it my favorite class- just watch out for it to get harder in the last month!
1616,316168,4.5,2.0,No Comments
1617,316168,5.0,2.0,he might wear lifts- but he's the easiest math teacher- and most forgiving.
1618,316168,3.0,3.0,"Pretty good teacher. Not my favorite, but it could be worse."
1619,316168,5.0,5.0,"While his tests are incredibly difficult and unfair with a mean of 72%, Dr. Dresden is an awesome teacher and Calculus is my favorite class."
1620,316168,4.5,5.0,"I love this guy! He is SOOOOOOOOOO cool! I want to be a math major just because he teaches math classes! And what a sharp dresser, too! Always in style."
1621,316168,5.0,5.0,"What an awesome guy! So clever, and a sharp dresser! Funny, too!"
1622,316168,2.5,4.0,"He's a fun guy, but he makes the class way too hard."
1623,316168,5.0,3.0,"The class is definitely challenging, but he's always willing to help. Lots of enthusiasm makes class fun."
1624,316168,4.0,3.0,"A little weird, but funny. Clearly loves teaching. Lots of prep for exams and likes challenging you. Do the homework and practice exams and you'll do well."
1625,2525963,4.0,4.0,"Professor Brindle is very sweet and enthusiastic about his expertise. He is willing to answer any questions you have, and his exams are challenging."
1626,2525963,5.0,4.0,"One of my favorite professors at W&amp;L! Dr. Brindle designs this class to be engaging by incorporating a mixture of lectures, discussions, a class sleep study, and various projects. He prioritizes learning and engagement and maintains a difficult but manageable workload. Be sure to make it to class and take good notes"
1627,2525963,5.0,3.0,Professor Brindle is literally the sweetest thing since chocolate. Take him for Brain and Behavior no matter what!!! Just make sure you read before class and take good notes and you'll be okay.
1628,2525963,5.0,2.0,Brindle is such a great professor and made the class so interesting. Would definitely recommend!
1629,1958667,5.0,3.0,"Jemma is really a great professor in teaching acting. You would have a lot of fun in her class if you love theater and performance. However, it doesn't mean an easy A. You need to make effort to do your rehearsal and reflect on yourself, but you will be fine if you follow her instructions and finish the tasks. "
1630,1958667,5.0,4.0,"I had her for acting, and we tried an &quot;ungrading&quot; method where you assessed yourself then suggested a grade for your performance. It was by no means an easy class, but if you are willing to try and be honest about your work you will learn a lot. She was always accessible outside of class, and gave thorough and useful feedback to students."
1631,1958667,5.0,3.0,"Jemma is a wonderful person. I spent a week with her in New York in addition to taking her class, and she's not the kind of person who gets boring. She's a little intimidating when you first meet her, but she's just great!"
1632,1958667,5.0,4.0,"Jemma is by far one of my favorite professors of all time.  She is super interesting and fun to talk to.  She is a tough grader, but it's all for your benefit.  Not an easy course, but definitely a fun and engaging one!"
1633,1958667,4.0,4.0,"Jemma (yes, you will call her Jemma) is there for you. She is a very tough grader but she is happy to help you in any way she can. You will have a lot of small papers and projects, and some of them (especially towards the end) are very hard. This is not your easy A, theater class. That being said, I did learn a lot and would probably take it again."
1634,1958667,5.0,4.0,"Jemma is amazing. Yes, she is tough so don't take her for an easy A. She cares intensely about her students and theater, and she is very knowledgeable. If you want to learn and be pushed to become a better person, take her."
1635,1958667,4.0,2.0,"Jemma was my director and I would gladly audition for another play with her. She really cares about her cast and wants to make sure we're doing well, both on and offstage.  If you're trying hard she'll take that into consideration. Know your lines and don't mess around in rehearsal and you'll get an A."
1636,1958667,2.5,5.0,"She thinks everyone in her class is a theater major, really demanding, also can be a bit rude sometimes. She is, however, very knowledgeable and talented: you will learn a lot from that class."
1637,1958667,1.5,4.0,Very very serious about theater.
1638,1958667,5.0,3.0,"Professor Levy, who insists you refer to her as Jemma or Coach, is a great professor. If you're interested in Theatre I highly recommend her. She's extremely knowledgeable and helpful. However, don't expect to just get an A while trying to get your art FDR requirement. You won't get an A unless you put in the amount of work she expects from you."
1639,1946385,1.0,2.0,"He tries to be funny, but he is not. "
1640,1946385,3.0,4.0,"He is super strict. He knows what he is talking about, but his class is boring. PRESENCE IS MANDATORY, AND HE DOESN'T TOLERATE PEOPLE WHO ARE LATE (not even 1 min)."
1641,1946385,5.0,3.0,"Very strict attendance policy for sure, but overall he's a great guy who handled my accommodations very well (and mine are weird). An enjoyable class and it wasn't graded too harshly. Easy quizzes too (sometimes I didn't do the reading, read a quick sparknotes, and got a 100). Always went back and read it later, but overall accessible and fun."
1642,1946385,4.0,3.0,"Super interesting, funny, and entertaining professor. He kept class interesting and engaged the class very well. He's a fair grader and spreads points out well so nothing is weighted too heavily."
1643,1946385,4.0,2.0,"Hes a really really weird guy, and not that I would say he was one of my favorite professors, his class was definitely one of my favorites.  He *tries* to make jokes and they usually don't work but thats one of the best parts of the class.  I had him for The Good Wife, again, very weird, but a good time overall.  SUPER EASY GRADER"
1644,1946385,4.0,3.0,Kao is a funny guy who keeps class interesting. The novels we read were great and he grades very fairly. He explained really complex concepts well. Attendance policy is strict but I'd definitely recommend.
1645,1946385,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors at W&L! I've taken many classes taught by Professor Kao, and they have all been great. Lectures are interesting and sometimes funny, and there are many opportunities to participate. He is always available to help you with assignments and gives valuable feedback on papers. I highly recommend taking his classes. "
1646,1946385,3.5,3.0,Highly recommend Professor Kao--learned a lot and ended up writing some of the better papers I've written at W&L. He usually keeps class discussion pretty interesting.
1647,1946385,2.5,3.0,"Professor Kao knows what he is talking about, that much is clear. The reading material for this class is sometimes dry and difficult to understand, but other times it is fine. Sometimes he isn't clear with what he wants done for a particular assignment. He also allows only one absence, so if you get sick often your grade will suffer."
1648,1137430,5.0,1.0,"This class was amazing! If you are not a math-minded individual and are only taking a class for an FDR, this is the perfect class. Professor Finch is very engaging and the classroom environment is very collaborative. Homework is manageable and Professor Finch is great to work with both in and out of class."
1649,1137430,3.0,4.0,"Super sweet and really cares. Office hours are helpful. She's really smart but isn't always good about explaining the material so her students understand it. Is a fair grader. You'll do fine if you put in the work, but if you're just taking calc for the FDR, I'd recommend going the computer science route, instead."
1650,1137430,2.0,5.0,"I am taking Calc 101 with her and I do not recommend it. The homework is hard and the tests are even harder. The problems on the test do not correspond to the homework problems. Professor Finch teaches in a very abstract way that is hard to understand unless you are a math genius. Office hours help somewhat, but the texts are hard regardless."
1651,1137430,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Finch is one of the best professors I've ever had, she's super reasonable with her tests (given that they are quite difficult). If you pay attention in class, do the homework, and really work during group time in class, you can do well in the class. She definitely knows lots about math and is trying to make sure that you don't fail."
1652,1137430,1.0,5.0,"I am speechless, I am stunned how worse a professor can be!!Although, she is very passionate about math and about what she teaches. But she is HORRIBLE at teaching. it! Teaching style very unorganized, will always test you on what is not being taught, and a tough B. She crushed my dream of majoring in math. I am sure I will not take anymore MATH!!!"
1653,1137430,2.5,5.0,A very tough professor. Tests are tough and her style of grading is very strict. Have decided to not continue on with Math after taking her class as it has severely lowered my confidence in my math skills. Definitely don't take her class if you are simultaneously taking other tough courses.
1654,1137430,1.5,5.0,WORST TEACHER EVER. STAY AWAY. NEVER SHOWED UP TO OFFICE HOURS. WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR HELP DURING EXAM WEEK. TESTS ARE RIDICULOUSLY HARD AND DO NOT RELATE TO WHAT WAS TAUGHT IN CLASS.
1655,1137430,2.0,5.0,"Finch is very nice, insanely good at math and very passionate about it, but  cannot teach it. She gives homework every night, ""classwork"" in last five minutes of class, and makes the tests unbearably hard. She is by far the WORST professor I have ever had. She goes way too fast in lectures, and makes test problems algebraic nightmares. Stay away!"
1656,1137430,2.5,4.0,"I've always considered math to be my best subject until this class. Dr. Finch is very smart, but is very hard to follow and the tests are literally impossible. I must say, it definitely left me feeling defeated and not wanting to continue with math. "
1657,1137430,4.5,4.0,"She is a nice professor who is always willing to help her students.  math221 is a very hard class by nature-and she is a tough grader.  Dont take 221 if you are not 100% comfortable with calc 102.  She doesn't take attendance, but you need to go to class to learn the material.  She gives ample opportunities for extra credit. Would take again."
1658,1137430,2.5,4.0,"She is a very nice and well intentioned professor. She is also extremely bright and loves what she does. However, make sure you have a solid background in calculus prior to taking this class. It is very hard, and you need to do a good job of interpreting what she writes on the board because it doesn't always come with an explanation."
1659,1137430,4.0,4.0,"The tests in this class were hard, and Dr. Finch sometimes has a tendency to write really fast, but other than that I have no complaints. She presented the material well, was really nice, and was absolutely hilarious. She posts plenty of practice tests and homework solutions online. As long as you keep up with the homework you should be fine."
1660,1137430,4.5,3.0,Very good teacher
1661,1137430,4.5,3.0,I dont agree with many of the comments here. Thought whe was a good teacher even though absent often. Seemed like she had plenty of office hours and was very understanding on tests hw and class attendance
1662,1137430,4.5,1.0,Was frightened of taking the class with her because of all the negative comments. The class turned out to be really easy and pretty fun. The test are fair and she throws in lots of easy assignments/quizzes to help grades go up.
1663,1137430,1.0,5.0,Awful professor. Very unreasonable. Stay away
1664,1137430,1.5,5.0,"this class was ridiculous. I did well in high school calculus, so I was expecting a decent grade in this intro level course. Overall, I struggled to pass the class. Finch was a terrible professor and did not seem like she wanted to help any of her students succeed. The tests were far more difficult than the work we learned. Very disappointing."
1665,1137430,1.5,4.0,"STAY AWAY. Very poor professor. Intelligent, but TERRIBLE teacher. Expects everyone to function on her high level... which is NOT POSSIBLE for Calc I. Positively unreasonable on tests (does not test on lectures/ homework) and assignments are difficult to decipher. Do whatever you can to get out of her class."
1666,1137430,3.5,3.0,"She comes off as pretty frightening at first, but once she has control of the class, she gets a lot better. She's actually really nice once you get to know her."
1667,1137430,1.5,4.0,"Hate to say it, but terrible professor. If you get her for intro calc, switch out"
1668,1137430,2.0,4.0,"She's smart, but not the best teacher.  The E part of the class is pretty useless and time consuming.  Take a calc 101 that meets four times a week and learn something-the tuesday off is not worth it."
1669,1137430,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Finch is a very nice person. If you go to see her at office hours, she is very helpful and whenever you need to miss class she is very understanding. That said, the course is hard. The test do tend to have problems that she didn't teach you, but she's generally fair about scaling and such when everyone does bad. Study hard and you should be ok."
1670,1137430,2.0,4.0,Absolutely worst professor ever. Stay away!!! She never tests on what she teaches (when she teaches at all). She's absent a lot which screws up the whole schedule. Unless you're a certified genius stay away!!!!
1671,1137430,1.0,5.0,"terrible! too much work. material on test is not discussed in class. noone likes her, you will not like her. drop this class before it is too late. bad bad bad"
1672,1137430,5.0,3.0,"Professor Finch is an excellent professor. I hated calculus before I took this course. Although there is a of work involved sometimes, it feels very rewarding when it is finished. She is so helpful outside of class and very available."
1673,1137430,2.5,5.0,She does not teach you what she expects you to know.  Assignments will come before lectures.  Maple labs and ridiculous webassign.com homework assignments take a lot of time.  SAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!
1674,1137430,2.0,5.0,"Very smart and very willing to help, but not much of a lecturer so expect to use the book lots.  Tests are hard, but fair and opportunities for extra credit abound."
1675,768791,4.0,4.0,"Bell is a solid choice for a philosophy class. She's passionate about the subject, involves the class in discussions, and gives interesting reading and paper topics. They made me think. She is a little disorganized with her lectures, and we fell behind a bit, but it didn't hurt anyone's grade in the long run. Overall, good class, would take again."
1676,768791,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bell is my favourite professor. Her grading method is amazing -she emphasises learning over grades, so as long as you're doing what she asks an easy A is guaranteed. The readings she chooses are thought-provoking, classes are a comfortable space and I have grown a lot from the discussions we have had. Taking a class with her again, def!"
1677,768791,3.0,2.0,"Prof Bell is typically great. She was a little unorganized in this class, but it did not take away too much for the class. It was very easy to get an A if you did the work and showed up."
1678,768791,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bell is amazing, makes a lot of really difficult topics easy to understand, and facilitates great class discussion. Also if you put in a good amount of effort she will work with you to ensure you get the grade you want, it is not difficult to get an A in the class. Take her if you can!"
1679,768791,4.0,3.0,"Lots to read, but was very interesting readings. Very helpful when you asked for it, and conducted great class discussions. A difficult grader, but nothing too ridiculous. Would recommend to others."
1680,768791,3.5,4.0,Assigns a lot of reading; so much reading that you wonder if she has forgotten that you're taking other classes.  She is a very tough grader on papers--she knows what she wants and if you don't provide her with that you will receive a bad grade.  She is very enthusiastic about the subject and provides good insight into interesting topics. 
1681,768791,5.0,4.0,Coach Bell is amazing. She invests in her students as human beings and as young minds. Always has a fresh perspective on topics and most importantly she is crystal clear in her expectations and always willing to help. You have to do the work but she will give you the tools you need to be successful.
1682,768791,4.5,3.0,It's simple…YOU HAVE TO TAKE A CLASS WITH HER BEFORE YOU GRADUATE!!!
1683,768791,4.5,3.0,"Always finds interesting topics for class discussion and reading material is always 'out there', but in a good way.  Will definitely make you reevaluate your understanding of ethics and politics from a philosophical standpoint, which is exactly what I was looking for in my philosophy class.  Grades papers fairly, though reading journals are a pain."
1684,768791,4.5,3.0,This class is def a good one if you want to take a beginning philo class and not have a difficult time.  The reading is very managable and no exams!
1685,768791,5.0,3.0,Great professor.  No clue what the person who posted about disagreeing w/her is talking about.  Learn to write a decent argument and you'll see she's a fair grader--hopefully you'll even learn something.
1686,768791,4.5,3.0,"Amazing Professor.  Very Knowledgeable in the area and therefore across disciplines (Poverty, Philosophy, Sociology, etc).  The workload was extremely manageable.  While the papers were a bit heavy for a philosophy class (15 pages&#63;), they were doable, and I felt that they helped to tie the class together.  Such an incredibly nice and helpful person"
1687,768791,4.0,2.0,"Discussions + No Exams = a good course.  The readings can be a bit dull, but the discussions help you understand the material.  Not a particularly difficult grader, but you should agree with her opinions.  Oh and you should probably talk to her before writing your papers--it helped me a ton.  I took the class for interest's sake and now love phil."
1688,768791,3.5,3.0,Don't disagree with her opinions when you write your papers...it will never help your grade
1689,768791,3.0,2.0,"Ehh...I dont know if I'd recommend or not. She's not extremely difficult which I liked, and the workload was manageable.  However bell made the topics, which could have been conducive to some interesting discussions, pretty boring.  Take the class if you want a solid b or b+, but don't take it if you are expecting a fun interesting class."
1690,2595619,2.0,3.0,"Very nice, but incredibly boring. Not a difficult class, but I didn't learn anything."
1691,2755364,5.0,2.0,Professor Hernandez is awesome. She geniunely cares for her students and classes are well structured. I would strongly recommend her for any Spanish class.
1692,2755364,2.0,1.0,"Not a good professor. Her class was pretty useless. She is super caring and understanding if you have any issues outside of class, but you won't actually learn anything in class. For grading, she doesn't want you to interpret the works for yourself - she wants you to tell her exactly what she told you in class. I didn't get anything out of it."
1693,2384676,5.0,4.0,"If you're not a music major, I would not recommend taking applied voice with Professor Parker. Although he's a great guy and you'll learn a lot, the required 5 hours of practice outside of lessons makes the class a lotespecially for a 1 credit course. Professor Parker is a super sweet guy, and I love his relevant(?) tangents in lessons."
1694,2384676,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Parker is such a nice person and teaches the concepts well. Goes on weirdly relevant(???) tangents. Experience in Western music is helpful but not mandatory. P much all lecture. Take good notes each class, especially on the pieces he goes over. For each biweekly test, know the chapters of that unit well and the class notes, and you'll do fine."
1695,2591539,5.0,3.0,"I would not have made it through beat reporting without Professor Swasy. She truly cares about her students and if they're learning. She was always around if I needed advice or had questions. She may have favorites, but all you need to do to be one of them is work hard and show interest - she definitely notices a good work ethic!"
1696,2591539,2.0,4.0,"Readings are sparse but she doesn't make use of the material we read in class. The majority of her classes were guest speakers instead of her teaching; she even used a recording of a colleague's lecture once. Also, the content in the quizzes were trivial (i.e., when was this thing invented, etc). Needed more hands-on work like writing workshops."
1697,2591539,5.0,3.0,Professor Swasy is awesome! She really knows her stuff and will push students to be their best selves with lively class discussions. She gives great feedback on papers/journalistic stories and is great at providing help before such assignments are due. Tests are tricky and detailed on class readings (mostly articles) but overall great professor.
1698,584502,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I've ever had. Not extremely difficult, I feel like I actually learned a ton. Relatively light workload, and no surprises when it comes to exams or assignments. Tests are weighted pretty heavily, but he teaches the material well. Also very accessible outside of class."
1699,584502,5.0,2.0,"Excellent teacher. Very nice, very smart. Lectures are really interesting and easy to understand. Straightforward tests and grading. One of the best professors."
1700,584502,5.0,4.0,The best teacher I've ever had by far. Really smart and interesting. Professor Hoover is the man.
1701,584502,5.0,2.0,"Puzzles and Critical Thought was a great class. Highly recommended as a spring course. Prof Hoover is a great teacher, he's engaging and kept the class interesting. You'll actually learn a lot too."
1702,584502,4.0,5.0,"If you're looking a hot stud to share a collossal burger with or if you want a manly man who wrestles mountain lion then this is the class for you!  He will always be willing to sit in front of a fire and discuss the future of bullets and ostrich farms.  Oh yeah, but class is a bit hard."
1703,2591546,4.0,2.0,"Professor Bhalla is great! She is still adjusting and learning new strategies in the classroom, and she does a good job of engaging students to get feedback on what works and what doesn't. Her classes definitely depend on student engagement. Her guidance on some projects/assingnments is often unclear at first, but she'll clarify if you tell her."
1704,1807182,1.0,3.0,"His lectures are painful and anecdotal, as are his office hours. Not helpful if you ask him what he wants on papers or the essay-based exams. Subjective grader. Boring, boring, boring."
1705,1807182,2.0,2.0,"He is passionate about the subject, however, he isn't very good at giving the information. He rarely gives explanations on many terms, and just gives sweeping statements without much substance. Class is boring and you will have to teach yourself the majority of it. However, the course works is very easy so you should leave with a good gradE."
1706,1807182,4.0,1.0,"He is a fairly easy grader and is VERY passionate about his subject. However, his example are outdated and he adds a personal story to everything done in class. The first half of the class is group based."
1707,1807182,4.0,2.0,"Great and very nice guy. People say the class is very boring which it is, but if you give the class a chance you will learn a lot from it, and take away key aspects from the class that will help you down the road. His midterm and exam are extremely fair. Grades all assignment fairly and gives a lot of feedback."
1708,1997646,5.0,4.0,"TAKE HIM! McCormick was such an inspirational teacher to have especially first semester freshman. He lets you grade yourself and there are different formats of tracking your progress, e.g. journals, reading logs, etc. His passion and joy for the language motivates you and I know a lot of people who pick up minors bc of him!"
1709,1997646,5.0,4.0,"Professor Mccormick was an amazing teacher. I had not done French for a year and a half before his class, and I was able to catch up pretty quickly. Tests are pretty hard but manageable, and he was a very care and kind person who was considerate to students' work loads."
1710,1997646,5.0,3.0,"Professor McCormick is one of the best professors you will have at Washington and Lee. Whether it's for Italian, French, or MRST, you'll be happy you got to meet him. I cannot praise him enough!"
1711,1997646,5.0,3.0,"Great communicator of the material. I came in thinking I'd probably just finish my language requirement and be done with French, but now I'm thinking about minoring in it after taking this class. He's helpful during office hours, and his assignments all actually help you learn the language. Absolutely would recommend for any French class."
1712,1997646,4.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors I've ever had. Regretting that I can't take him again next semester.  Hilarious, down-to-earth, and takes a genuine interest in his students. Participation is essential, tests aren't super hard if you studykeep up "
1713,2423633,5.0,2.0,Dr. Hill is funny and energetic every class which actually made an 8:30 bearable. He made me a much better writer and the topics we wrote on were actually interesting. Definitely take any of his classes if you get the chance. I would highly recommend taking his Shut Up &amp; Play course to any incoming freshman.
1714,2423633,5.0,3.0,AMAZING CLASS
1715,2423633,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Hill knows how to make learning fun, engaging and relatable for everyone. The work load is very reasonable. Classes are fun and intense but always pertain to the readings. He is insightful and efficient in returning assignments. Definitely cares and wants his students to do well."
1716,1661781,5.0,4.0,Professor Smith (aka Rob) is an amazing teacher. I truly enjoyed learning from him this semester...he knows so much and is enthusiastic about theater and passes that enthusiasm onto his students. Thanks.
1717,1803095,4.0,4.0,"Great professor who is passionate about teaching biology, but expect to work and read lots of journal articles. On the bright side, I was able to journal articles a lot better after learning from her. "
1718,2661219,1.0,3.0,This professor is insecure in teaching and takes it out on students. Her course is messy and unstructured and is difficult to learn. She relies completely on readings and student discussion. She requires a discussion due before each class and then creates the lecture based off of the discussion. This professor does not teach if she can help it.
1719,2661219,3.0,3.0,"The class description seemed amazing as it was about comedy, but the incredibly heavy and dense readings every night were almost completely irrelevent given that almost 75% of our grade was our final project that was almost all personal research."
1720,2661219,3.0,4.0,Very nice lady but for this class the final was super hard and the material wasnt the most engaging for someone not really into the field of SOAN. She grades fair though!
1721,2661221,5.0,3.0,"Not super accessible outside class in person. Otherwise, this dude is awesome! Responds to emails very quickly. He gives fantastic lectures, and will definitely roast (in a very kind way) the idiot football players in the class, which is a nice change from the usual. He takes the time to get to know us, and is just in general a nice guy. Recommend!"
1722,2661221,5.0,3.0,Really awesome dude! He grades papers slowly and two papers make up a lot of the grade. He is fair and the class is fun! I may be biased as I do enjoy reading greek tragedies though.
1723,1344364,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Always willing to help, really interested in his subject matter and his students. If you put in effort, he will help you every step of the way if you ask for it."
1724,1344364,5.0,3.0,"This was a GREAT class. I liked almost all of the texts we read, and discussions were always entertaining. Professor Carlisle was very helpful when I sent him emails, and he will let you submit a draft of essays for revision. I would definitely take this class again."
1725,1749871,4.5,3.0,"Loved his class!  He makes learning Spanish interesting and fun, even for students who aren't very interested, or are just taking the class because they need language credits.  "
1726,1749871,5.0,2.0,"He is a great teacher.  Very funny.  He sticks to the syllabus religiously.  Does not grade tests too hard, but you definitely have to study.  There is only about 3 hours of homework per week. "
1727,1749871,4.5,2.0,javi is the man! he makes spanish super fun and knows what he is talking about.
1728,1749871,5.0,1.0,"This guy is the best, take his class if you want to enjoy spanish."
1729,1749871,5.0,2.0,"For elementary Spanish, he is THE BEST. He is the best professor I have had in my freshmen year. He makes the class real fun and interactive. You will love him. My recommendation would be to take him whenever you get the chance."
1730,1749871,5.0,1.0,greatest teacher ever!
1731,1749871,5.0,3.0,"Javier is the man but Catalina, the TA this year, she is THE ONE to be talking about."
1732,1749871,4.5,3.0,"He's a bro. Make sure you go to his office hours, because that's when he is really helpful."
1733,1749871,4.5,3.0,Javi is the man
1734,1801087,5.0,3.0,A great professor and a really nice guy. I took the infamous &quot;Overthrow the State&quot; class(which was awesome) in 2020 and he taught it extremely well. Gave a copious amounts of great feedback on all big writing assignments and really helped me improve. Class discussion was great. If it was a more normal year it would have probably been even better.
1735,1801087,5.0,3.0,"If you go into office hours his midterm paper and final paper are a breeze. He will give you an A on both if you discuss with him what he wants. A few weekly reading quizzes, but he understands that you won't get all of the reading done. Great class."
1736,1801087,5.0,5.0,Brace for Igniting your inner Gonzalez!  Professor gildner Has the Ability to Reinvent your Marginal Attitude toward latin american studies.  (please pardon my english.)  Very highly rate professor.  Dreamy eyes cannot keep eyes off.  I have allergy often attend tired so need caffeine and eat candy for diabetes but very comfortable in class.
1737,1801087,4.5,4.0,Great professor- picks interesting discussion topics and helped me learn how to formulate arguments.
1738,1801087,4.5,4.0,Good prof. Interesting class. Lots of reading but most of it really interesting.
1739,1801087,3.0,3.0,"Nice guy, not so great professor. SO HARD to get in contact with--sometimes won't email back. Doesn't show up to office hours sometimes. But when he does, you should go, because when he's there it's really helpful. Posts 60 pages of reading at 7 PM the night before and expects you to read it all. Overall nice guy, just not super on top of things."
1740,2767745,5.0,1.0,Her pre lab lectures are very clear and she is super helpful and caring
1741,2767745,5.0,2.0,"Literal girl-boss. Lab has the perfect mix of not being over-bearing but really helping you understand the chemical principles we're studying. She does an amazing job teaching, and she'll make sure you're not confused abt anything before leaving. Best of all, she's just an amazing human being."
1742,371591,5.0,1.0,Greatest Professor ever!
1743,371591,5.0,1.0,"This professor is awesome, if you know Calculus well, you'll enjoy this class for sure. "
1744,371591,1.0,3.0,"Terrible. Never learned students names or gave extra time to do some work. Messes up in class, and outside of class. For example, he didn't finish teaching a lesson in class, and never addressed it again (it showed up later on the test so you had to teach yourself). He also messes up assigning the homework AND tests so that was suffering. 0/10"
1745,371591,2.0,3.0,"DO NOT TAKE. Each lecture he messed up a couple times, people sometimes even fail assignments because the notes are wrong. The only reason I did well in this class is because I have already taken calculus 2. He hasn't a clue what is going on in the class."
1746,371591,1.0,3.0,"Professor Feldman's lectures are horrible, he goes off on tangents about small meaningless parts of problems, often forgets how to do problems, and assigns long online homework assignments every class that usually did not line up with the lecture. Totally unavailable, posts all tests late, I got an A because of previous calc experience. DO NOT TAKE"
1747,371591,1.0,4.0,"He fails to engage the class and teaches straight from the textbook. Throughout the course, all of the work was online (tests, quizzes, homework) on web assign and open notes and collaboration was allowed. In an effort to completely screw everyone in the class over, he made the final exam closed book and in person, something we hadnt done all year"
1748,371591,1.0,3.0,"Should not be teaching- he doesn't know how to do the math himself and the majority of class is spent by students correcting him and teaching him. I had already learned most of the material so it wasn't as big of a deal, but I would have struggled if I didn't already know everything. Only teacher by giving examples, doesn't actually teach concepts."
1749,371591,2.0,4.0,"Bro this dude just pulled out a class roster with barely two-thirds of our class on it, after having gotten all the names right everyday for the last week. He rolled in a few minutes late the day after a lecture on tardiness, and then took 17 minutes to take attendance, adamantly defending that we're not registered on Canvas or Webassign... we are"
1750,371591,2.0,3.0,"Took his class over zoom, and I would have been better off reading the textbook and watching Youtube than attending. His lectures are confusing and he often gets confused himself. He spends too much time on simple algebra and calculus operations and not enough on framing the problems explaining new methods to use. Don't take virtually!"
1751,371591,5.0,3.0,"Best professor. If you can, take him over any other math professor! You'll be saving yourself from lots of unnecessary struggle. His lectures are always very clear and helpful. The homework problems help you build confidence and practice. The tests never include surprises. One of the kindest and clearest professors! Last few classes were online."
1752,371591,1.0,4.0,Professor Feldman is one of the worst math professors Ive ever had. He is the toughest grader Ive ever encountered. Very hard to understand his lectures. Tests definitely reflect a good amount of material he covers in class but be prepared to show every single step of your work or he will count off copious amounts of points.
1753,371591,4.0,4.0,Pretty tough class. Dr. Feldman is a cool guy and you can do well just make sure to pay close attention to his lectures. They are a little dry but can be helpful with lots of examples.
1754,371591,2.0,5.0,"Took AP Calc in high school and did well. The material is virtually the same, he just does not establish clear expectations for quizzes or test. The pickiest grader i've ever had. DO NOT TAKE CALC WITH HIM!!!"
1755,371591,3.0,4.0,"Okay prof. If you've taken calc before, he's alright but he's very nit-picky and loves to focus only on the topics that he likes best."
1756,371591,4.0,2.0,"If you want a straightforward calculus class, Feldman's your man. He can be hard to nail down for help outside of class, but unless it's your first time taking calc it isn't really an issue, because he's a very good lecturer. Don't buy the textbook though, you get a free e-copy when you buy Webassign access at the beginning of the semester."
1757,371591,4.0,3.0,"Feldman's the best choice for a math professor, but he's still a pretty weird guy. His class is pretty easy, especially if you've taken calc before, and he's definitely willing to help you. Don't buy the textbook, you have to buy access to Webassign ($100) for the class and you get an ebook with that, but you will very rarely even use that."
1758,371591,4.0,2.0,Prof. Feldman is a great teacher if you have already taken calc before. I thought that his tests and quizzes were very fair. Most of the problems looked like the homework notes.
1759,371591,4.0,2.0,"Easy class if you've taken Calc in HS. Boring at times but super fair quizzes and exams. If you can get through boring lectures, it's an easy A."
1760,371591,5.0,4.0,"Feldman is da man. He really exemplifies how mathematics can be fun. He truly has a passion for learning, and prefers Crunch bars over apples."
1761,371591,2.0,4.0,tests and quizzes aren't like homework. his notes don't provide good examples to prepare you. homework is an easy A+ but quizzes and exams have unexpected problems
1762,371591,5.0,3.0,Feldman is awesome.  Take him at all costs.
1763,371591,5.0,3.0,"Incredibly clear and insightful lectures. If you do the suggested problems and pay attention to lectures, you will do well. Kinda quirky but is very passionate about what he does."
1764,371591,4.5,2.0,"Feldman is an excellent professor. I particularly appreciated how explicit he was with his expectations, and what we did in class and in homework directly correlated with his quizzes and tests. Whenever I had a question, he would explain it before I had the opportunity to raise my hand. If you struggle in his class, it's not due to his teaching."
1765,371591,4.0,3.0,"Professor Feldman is a nice person, and always willing to help. At times the material can be confusing, but he is willing to explain anything further. It is best to do the homework (as in you definitely need the practice to pass the tests). Gives quizzes every Tuesday about the previous week's material, good grade booster. DO THE HOMEWORK!!!"
1766,371591,2.5,3.0,"If you work hard and participate in class an A is definitely possible. HW is graded on webassign and it ends up counting about as much as the final so try on those. Tests were much easier than the suggested HW, his study guides helped a lot. Many points on the final were based on material from the last week of class so the average was a C+ on it."
1767,371591,5.0,1.0,Feldman is the man
1768,371591,3.5,2.0,"He's a pretty typical math professor. Not the best I've had here at W&L, though.  When I go to his office hours it seems like he just wants me to leave. Overall, he's pretty effective teacher though - I know a lot about differential equations now. My participation grade was bad despite the fact that I asked a lot of questions. Overall: 3.5/5."
1769,371591,2.5,4.0,"I can see him being good for people who took calc before or are interested in/good at math, but im not and i was completely lost from beginning to end of the course. he tended to be condescending when i went for help so i didnt go often. his teaching style is do an example problem on the board, say ""and thats how it is!"" and move on w/o explaining"
1770,371591,1.5,5.0,"Incredibly boring lecturer. Better sleep aid than ZzzQuil. Horrible office hour times (8-10 am, when most freshmen get stuck with classes). Gives impossible group projects which results in hour and a half long wait lines outside his office door, spiraling down the stairs and out the door. 5 very hard tests. DO NOT TAKE DURING PLEDGESHIP"
1771,371591,5.0,2.0,Professor Feldman is one of the few math teachers I have had who can actually teach the subject without confusing me. If you pay attention in class it is hard to do poorly on his tests/quizzes. A very fair teacher and is funny  in his own way.
1772,371591,4.0,4.0,"Solid professor and nice guy. Pretty clear. Calc 101 at W&L is significantly harder than AB in high school, no matter who you get."
1773,371591,4.0,1.0,"LOVE professor feldman!  so easy and clear... if you ever need help on projects just go to him for office hours. he can be kind of dull during lectures (then again, it is calc which is a generally dry subject) but overall he's very straight-forwrd, clear, and nice. one of the easiest a's i've had in math ever! he's a great guy overall"
1774,371591,5.0,3.0,"So sweet, very straightforward with assignments and very approachable in office hours.  Also, typically cancels classes right before breaks, which is extremely nice.  I would go out of my way to take another class of his."
1775,371591,4.5,2.0,"Class was pretty easy because tests were on exactly what was covered in class. He was doing POD's in the beginning (problem of the day) which came out of the book, in addition to webassign homework but after reading days they stopped. i recommend not buying the book and just borrowing someone else's unless you plan to take more math classes."
1776,371591,5.0,4.0,Pace of class made it difficult. Cover a lot of material. Really nice and smart guy. Very approachable. Wants students to do well. Very knowledgeable. Tests are exactly what is covered in class. Wasted money on the textbook though since he just uses his own notes and assigns homework via webassign. good prof. highly recommend
1777,371591,5.0,4.0,Pace of class made it difficult. Cover a lot of material. Really nice and smart guy. Very approachable. Wants students to do well. Very knowledgeable.

1778,371591,5.0,4.0,"Feldman is the man.  He's nice and definitely willing to help.  Strongly recommend him.  Loves teaching, extremely smart."
1779,371591,3.0,3.0,"Feldman is a really nice guy, doesn't go out of his way to help. Some of his stuff is confusing and the tests are pretty much outlined in his review sheets."
1780,371591,3.0,4.0,"Feldman is a very standard, boring math teacher. He goes over examples in class and teaches mostly from the textbook. His slight unfairness in grading on tests is negated by his easy &quot;projects,&quot; open-note and open-book take home assignments engineered for you to improve your grade."
1781,371591,2.5,4.0,"I wouldn't recommend him, although his teaching strategies are solid. He provided very little motivation and struggles to evoke any discussion beyond mathematics."
1782,371591,4.5,3.0,Such a nice guy!! He will definitely help anytime.
1783,371591,3.5,3.0,"Pretty standard Math professor, explains how to do it, works through some problems, answers any questions."
1784,371591,5.0,2.0,"In class mostly went through exmaples, which is enough for me. Did up review sheets for tests, which were wonderfully helpful. Never went to him for help, but I have the feeling he'd be more than happy  to."

1786,371591,5.0,3.0,No Comments
1787,1424285,4.0,3.0,"I was lucky to be in such a good group for our combined paper/project proposal, which was not difficult but did require dedicating some time to it. On the other hand, I always did my individual assignments within the hour before the deadline and still got an A; although there was quite a bit of content, it's definitely manageable considering that."
1788,1424285,2.0,5.0,"There's a reason Sackman's lecture had a waitlist before Ayoub's even filled halfway. She's nice as a person but in class, can't explain things very well. Almost all of class is group work with little teaching. She expects test answers to be extremely detailed and on the chance she does lecture, she flies through it with little detail."
1789,1424285,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Ayoub is one of my favorite professors I have had. She is very intelligent and always willing to help a student if they reach out to her. She is a difficult professor, but really prepares you for her tests and you really learn the material. Her tests are fair and she also grades fair. Tough, but very worth it!"
1790,1424285,3.0,4.0,Dr. Ayoub is pretty tough. She goes through content pretty quickly so you need to be prepared to review all of your notes after class and do some self teaching. She can be tough but does care about her students and wants you to succeed. Her lab is pretty difficult but she will give you good feedback if you put in hard work the first time.
1791,1424285,1.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Ayoub for intro bio, genetics and genetics lab. I love genetics and I have not had a bad experience with a professor at W&amp;L, but Dr. Ayoub is the exception. She was abrasive, passive aggressive, and discouraged questions. I feel that her abrasiveness got in the way of my learning and I would discourage friends from taking her class."
1792,1424285,1.0,5.0,Prof. Ayoub is not the best. She's often rude and condescending when students ask questions and often can't answer them. Hardly lectures in class and assigns LOTS of group work that she never really explains well. Good thing about this class is that group work and homework are great grade boosters. Take with caution and be prepared to work HARD.
1793,1424285,1.0,4.0,"Condescending, unorganized, and doesn't think non-science majors are capable of handling the content offered spring term... for non-science majors."
1794,1424285,4.0,4.0,"Ayoub is much better than the older reviews say she was back when she first started--she's really blossomed as a professor and her lectures are pretty easy to understand. She encourages critical thinking and always makes herself available. She will work with you, and an A is definitely possible if you work with her for it."
1795,1424285,4.0,4.0,"I think Prof Ayoub is great! Really interesting, very helpful, clear, very open to meeting with you if you have issues. Really understands what an intro bio class should be, and good at helping business/liberal arts majors understand the material. I see from other comments she may be hard in upper level courses, but she is great at 100 level."
1796,1424285,1.5,5.0,"Professor Ayoub can't lecture without her notes/powerpoint and gets lost if a student asks her a question. The only way to pass is to watch all of her lectures on Tegrity just to figure out what topics she covers, and then go learn that information from the textbook."
1797,1424285,3.0,4.0,"I had Cabe for Genetics Lecture and Ayoub for lab, which ended up working very well. Although I have heard negative things about her lectures, her lab is very interesting (spider silk gene sequencing), and she is helpful in and out of lab. I enjoyed the lab; even though she can be confusing at times, she will go out of her way to help you learn."
1798,1424285,1.5,4.0,"Utterly terrible as a professor. If you were to take away her lecture outline, she simply would not be able to teach the course. The only way to get through this course is to say goodbye to sleep and read your textbook cover to cover - her lectures are absolutely useless."
1799,1424285,2.0,4.0,Ayoub's teaching style is extremely confusing and it is often times left up to the students to teach themselves the material from the book. The only way I started surviving the class was re-watching all the sections of class I didn't understand on Tegrity and looking up the stuff in the textbook... which was mostly everything
1800,1424285,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Ayoub isn't as bad as people are making her out to be. She's new and still figuring out the best way to run lectures, but I thought she actually did a decent job teaching genetics during her second year here. She was helpful in office hours also."
1801,1424285,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Ayoub isn't as bad as these comments suggest. I had her for genetics in her second year here, and while she definitely has room for improvement, i think she did a fine job teaching the course. She may not be the best now, but with time and experience I think she'll be a fine teacher. Very helpful outside of class."
1802,1424285,1.5,4.0,Not a great teacher.  Not helpful and seems to  &quot;have it out&quot; for her students.  Her presentations seem to be filled with mistakes and when asked questions she can be easily confused.  Not a great WL experience.
1803,1424285,2.0,5.0,"Not helpful in office hours Makes tons of mistakes in lectures. I felt embarassed for prospective students who visited the class, horrible first-impression of W&L."
1804,1424285,2.0,5.0,"Not helpful in office hours (will just tell you &quot;uhhh, go check the book&quot;, even if that's what you're confused on). Makes tons of mistakes in lectures. I felt embarassed for prospective students who visited the class, horrible first-impression of W&L."
1805,1424285,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Ayoub is preeeeeeetttyyy terrible, ask anybody who took who her class this year (this is her first-year at W&L)."
1806,1641376,5.0,4.0,"One of the best teachers on campus, and everyone who takes her knows it. Super passionate and knowledgeable, she brings out the best in the entire class. Probably the most engaging course I had that year. She grades relatively hard, but if you put real effort in it shouldn't be hard to get a B+ or A-. And her feedback on work is stellar. 11/10 prof"
1807,1641376,5.0,3.0,"Her poetry class was phenomenal. Brilliant woman and poet. She always leaves notes on your work. Take it seriously; it's not a blow-off class. She created a great environment where we felt encouraged to share, and by the end, we knew how to run workshop on our own! I took it because I wanted to write more and better poetry and this class was it. A+"
1808,1641376,2.0,4.0,"I took this class for a creative writing credit as an English major and found it much harder than what it is coded for. Professor Green is a strict grader who does not give the benefit of the doubt when giving letter grades (ex. puts in an A- as a 90, not a 93). She did not respond to emails and was unclear about expectations."
1809,1641376,5.0,3.0,"Professor Green is a awesome, she is very caring, understanding and passionate about the nature, poetry and writing. She gives great feedback to help with my papers, and she grades fairly, focusing on the ideas and the big picture instead of trivial things in paper."
1810,1641376,4.0,4.0,"Professor Green is super nice and very helpful. You can get a good grade if you do all the work and actively particpate in every class. She's not that tough of a grader but she also has high expectations, so priortize her work when you can. You're going to read alot of confusing books, but the papers you write about them don't have to be very long."
1811,1641376,5.0,3.0,"If you want to become a better writer, read a wide array of work, and learn from a teacher who's willing to invest in you, take Professor Green's class. It was a highlight of my week."
1812,1641376,5.0,3.0,I absolutely loved Professor Green's class. She is very passionate and engaged with the topic and students. Office hours were extremely helpful and she was always caring
1813,1641376,4.0,4.0,"She is a harsh grader at first, but once you know what she is looking for your grade should go up. Participation will save your grade so participate!"
1814,1641376,5.0,3.0,Professor Green is wonderful! I had her for Writ100 and for Eco-Writing (spring term). She gives great feedback and encourages students to find their niche (especially with creative writing). Eco-Writing inspired me to write poetry on my own and gave me the toolset needed to do that successfully. She gives A- but rarely As.
1815,1641376,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor. Even if you think you won't be keen on the course, I encourage you to take a course with Prof. Green. Caring, intelligent, funny, inspirational, and nonjudgmental."
1816,1641376,4.0,3.0,"An amazing teacher. She yearns for students to try and do their best and remains present and available throughout the semester. Absurdly smart and values/encourages voicing different perspectives. She is a real person to all her students, and I'm honored to have been taught so much by her."
1817,1641376,5.0,3.0,"I've taken two of Prof. Green's courses. Each time, she has been an attentive, sincere, and enthusiastic. She teaches courses that are meaningful to her, thereby inspiring and intriguing her students. She accommodates the varying needs of students and encourages creativity, freedom of thought, and stumbling every now and then in pursuit of growth."
1818,1641376,4.5,3.0,"Inspiring discussion and awesome teacher. You can get by without reading in class discussion as long as you are at least familiar. You must know the content for midterms/finals which are take-home and open book. Can be harsh grader but you'll get better once you know what she expects. She's thoughtful, interesting, and super nice."
1819,1641376,2.0,4.0,Your grades are good as long as she likes you. Not really approachable. Hardly write anything on the board.
1820,1641376,4.5,3.0,"Not too much reading, class was all discussion. Was tedious at times because we spent too much time on certain subjects, but overall not terrible. Go to her office hours. Grades will improve as class goes on."
1821,1641376,5.0,2.0,"I took enviro studies as a freshman who was just trying to get rid of an fdr. Prof. Green was very fair with her grades. If you do the reading and make an effort to participate- you will get an A. It is not a hard class, but you must do the reading."
1822,1641376,5.0,2.0,"This class was great. I hate writing and Green made it bearable. She comes off as annoying at first and kind of strict but in the end she is quirky and if you do what your supposed to your set. Fair grader, just go in and meet with her on papers. The daily sakai posts sucked but beats other homework. Only 4 papers all fall"
1823,1641376,5.0,3.0,Had her both WRIT 100 And Environmental Studies. A great teacher that really cares about what she teaches and what you learn. Tough grader at first but she really strives to get you to produce your best work. Definitely recommend her.
1824,1641376,4.5,2.0,Great teacher. Really cares about subject and wants students to understand. Grades nicely on presentations and such. Little harder grader on papers but that's because she expects you to come in and conference with her to get them fixed. She's fantastic. Had her for environmental as well. GREAT teacher.
1825,1641376,5.0,1.0,"Awesome teacher, don't say something without having text support unless you like getting viciously put down. Grades nicely, and is very willing to help you. I liked the class and I still eat meat!"
1826,1641376,4.0,2.0,"Leah Green is a great teacher, I had her for Sacred & Daily Env Lit. freshman year. At first, she can come off as annoying but is very helpful and truly wants students to care for the material. Go to class, participate, and go to your writing conferences and you will do great! She is definitely one of my favorite teachers now"
1827,2093986,3.0,4.0,"Professor Reyes is very encouraging and offers lots of ways to participate in class. However, he is hard to get in touch with and is unwilling to work with his students outside of class. Reading over the textbook before class and participating is key! This is a good class to take if you're already confident in your Spanish but need a refresher."
1828,2093986,5.0,3.0,"So nice and easy to communicate with. He offers many chances to participate, which helps boost your grade a lot. He knows how to teach a lecture while still keeping students engaged. There are a lot of tests, but it is nice because it gives you many chances to improve your grade. Homework isn't unbearable at all."
1829,2093986,5.0,3.0,"Professor Reyes wants his students to succeed and does everything he can to get them there. If you put in the effort for this class, and he sees that, you will do well. Class is very participation heavy."
1830,2093986,4.0,4.0,"Professor Reyes really cares about his students and wants you to succeed. He is always open to meet and help you study or clarify things taught in class. However, you will have to work hard to get a good grade and participate in class, but that is likely the same for any Span 164 class. At least with Reyes, you have someone who is fair and cares!"
1831,2093986,5.0,3.0,"Reyes really really cares about his students. After you get past the layers of sarcasm, you find an incredibly fun guy who really just wants to help you learn Spanish. His attitude can be a little annoying about the online program. Still, he's EXTREMELY intelligent, and he's very helpful if you go talk to office hours."
1832,2093986,5.0,4.0,He is an incredible Professor! He knows a lot about what he teaches and makes class fun and interesting. Very willing to go out of his way for his students.
1833,2093986,3.0,3.0,Class itself is not bad but tests are graded by the computer and lots of points are docked for very small things.
1834,2093986,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite professors by far. Class participation is a must but don't be intimidated, his classes are fun and laid back. Truly cares about students. Will do anything to help. Provides ways to boost participation outside of class. Tests are oral and take home. Overall, easy class and a great professor."
1835,2093986,3.5,4.0,"A bit difficult of a professor, but it really helps you to learn Spanish. Is really big on participation, and it's essential to get a good grade, but again, it helps to improve your speaking skills. A funny and cheerful guy, and I look forward to more classes with him."
1836,2438059,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Athauda is a nice person, but her grading is incredibly strict and there are very few non-test grades in the grade-book. Her tests are inconsistent in difficulty, and are often too long to complete in the class period."
1837,1964988,5.0,3.0,"Professor Barton Myers has been my favorite professor by far at Washington and Lee. Not only is he extremely well-versed in US history, but he is an engaging lecturer. Additionally, his class discussions on the books he assigns help greatly, meaning that writing the papers is relatively easy. He is a good teacher to have a genuine friendship with."
1838,1964988,5.0,4.0,"I could not imagine my experience at W&amp;L without Professor Myers. He is warm, extremely knowledgeable, and tough but fair. You'll learn a lot, read a lot, write a lot, and be a better student for it. He's a great person and professor and I recommend coming to office hours to get to know him. You will not regret taking a Professor Myers class."
1839,1964988,5.0,3.0,"I took US History to 1876 as a First Year. Really good professor, especially if you're interested in history. Lectures are really engaging. Books are a major part of the class as 80% of the grade comes from tests and papers about the books. Would definitely take the class &amp; Prof. Myers again"
1840,1964988,5.0,3.0,"As someone who never really enjoyed history classes, Dr. Myers was an absolute joy to have as a professor. The content was meaningful and enjoyable to cover. His lectures also didn't throw too much material at you at once. Exam and essay material is almost exclusively related to out of class readings. Would definitely recommend!"
1841,1964988,5.0,4.0,"Easily the best professor I've had to date. He is incredibly passionate about history, intelligent. Lectures are engaging and require a lot of participation. Even though it's a lot of work (especially for a non-history major), I highly recommend any of his classes."
1842,1964988,5.0,3.0,"He's not super easy but he's a great professor and one of the best at W&amp;L. I had him for three history classes and he was just as engaging in 107 as 247. Definitely take him over Benechal for 107. If you read and write well and contribute to class discussions, you'll do well. Good writing and speaking skills are essential. A must take professor."
1843,1964988,5.0,4.0,"Most energetic lecturer you could ever hope for, and legitimately one of the most knowledgeable military historians there is (can rack off multiple sources for ANY obscure military question). Lecture and paper heavy, but he rewards students who show interest and put effort into the papers. All around legend, would recommend any class he teaches"
1844,1964988,5.0,3.0,"10/10 recommend. He is very passionate about what he does and even made me consider becoming a historian after taking his class. Lots of reading, a few papers and quizzes, and a research paper but nothing too hard for a 200-level class. W&amp;L is lucky to have such a young and respected Civil War historian. Take as many of his classes as possible!"
1845,1964988,4.0,4.0,"One of the most respected Civil War historians today. Engaging and fascinating lectures. Cares immensely about his students. Accessible, approachable. Civil War course almost entirely focused on military history. Beware of unannounced, undocumented pop quizzes. He will drop them out of nowhere and kill your grade you've worked a semester to build."
1846,1964988,5.0,3.0,"Washington and Lee is lucky to have such a distinguished and passionate scholar in their ranks. As a young professor, he has already surpassed most of his colleagues in his scholarship -- publishing 3 books, numerous articles, and giving keynote addresses at prestigious civil war history events. Don't miss you opportunity to take a class!"
1847,1964988,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I've ever had here.  Very knowledgeable and interesting.  His papers were not easy, but I learned a lot from them.  Would definitely recommend taking any of his classes."
1848,1964988,4.5,3.0,"He makes you want to be in class. I had to take his Civil War History class as an FDR. He his so excited and passionate about what he teaches that it made me excited to be in class (even though participation doesn't matter to him at all). I would love to take another one of his classes. A lot of reading, but you can get by until discussion day."
1849,1964988,5.0,3.0,Best teacher I have ever had at W&L. Super knowledgeable on all subjects he teachers. Helps you improve your writing dramatically. We had 4 papers and a short final. 
1850,1964988,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Myers is very interesting and personable. He does assign a lot of reading  (80% of the class grade was essays based on different 300-400 page novels), but he is extremely helpful and a pretty easy grader. The final was very easy... I am pretty sure everyone in the class got an A or B. I would definitely take this class again. "
1851,1776582,3.5,3.0,"One of the most enjoyable classes I have had at W&L. The lectures feel long and she can be a little uncertain of herself at times, but she is very helpful in office hours. She's a very fun professor and genuinely cares about her students.  I highly recommend taking Spectroscopy for any students interested in scientific research."
1852,1776582,5.0,3.0,Definitely one of the best professors at this school. The course is a bit challenging at first and I am a bit retarded so i have to ask her really simple things but she is always there to help you and she is fun about it too. Great teacher.
1853,1776582,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors I've had durring my time at W&L. She is ALWAYS there to help you and the course material is extremely fun.
1854,1776582,4.5,3.0,"She is a fantastic lab instructor. Very clear and specific about what she expects, and she makes every lab interesting and uses the school's resources very effectively"
1855,1776592,5.0,1.0,"I took his weight training class. Best decision I have ever made! He is so funny, helpful and nice. He will make you go to class but will give you cool workouts that you should actually use outside of class. Take his class! It will be worth it!"
1856,1776592,5.0,2.0,He is a great guy for weight training. He knows his stuff and lets you do what you want to as long as you explain your goals and develop legit workouts
1857,1973201,4.5,4.0,"Class was a cool mix of slides, whiteboard, and examples. Helpful answers to questions over email or office hours. Semester project in lab was challenging, but not too bad."
1858,1973201,1.5,4.0,"Really long boring lectures poorly done. Will teach you from 1 slide for 20 minutes sometimes and it feels like being beaten with a stick. Has taught material incorrectly before and when he  goes back to correct himself later-on, he just brushes over it, so you've really only learned it incorrectly. Very unhelpful when you go to ask questions."
1859,1973201,3.0,4.0,"Reading optional, but very useful comments in the notes section when he uploads powerpoints to sakai (disorganized lectures). LOTS of material and a broad class. Expect a lot of time to prepare for tests and have all the specifics DOWN since it's easy to forget what species has what features. 4 tests and no final (last test during finals week)."
1860,1188822,3.0,5.0,"Cell bio was tough: lots of material, labs didn't always work, and she was not organized. I wouldn't take her class again."
1861,1188822,2.0,5.0,Took her for cell bio and she is nice and cares but is unorganized and takes pride in offering unfairly hard multiple choice portions of her exams. If interested in doing science in future would recommend do research with her but not worth taking any of her classes.
1862,1188822,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Watson is very passionate about biology/neuroscience, however, her lectures are scattered and hard to follow. I would not have survived had I not had a background in neuroscience. She is very vanilla and her lectures aren't fun or exciting, but she cares about what she's teaching and wants her students to learn."
1863,1188822,1.5,5.0,"Lectures are confusing and move too quickly. Tests cover too much information and focus on minute details barely discussed in class. When asked questions she struggles to give alternate explanation. Nice woman, just too smart to be teaching an intro class."
1864,1188822,5.0,4.0,"Brilliant professor. She is quite lucid about what she tests on, though she will challenge your fundamental understanding of the material. Not to mention, she is very kind and has a good sense of humor. I hope to take some upper-levels with her in the future."
1865,1188822,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Watson is hard, no joke, but she doesn't expect anything from you that she doesn't expect (or more so) from herself. One of the hardest working, most intelligent, and kindest profs at W&L. Her teaching style is unique, but once you understand it, her tests are straightforward. She's very passionate about what she teaches, and it's infectious!"
1866,1188822,5.0,5.0,she is a great professor and person!
1867,1188822,2.5,4.0,"She is an extremely smart professor but there is a major communication barrier in her teaching style.  She crams too much information into one test.  For me personally, all going to class did was confuse me even more.  The notes she gives you via powerpoint are gibberish. Unless youre stellar in bio, avoid this teacher."
1868,1188822,4.5,5.0,Fantatstic class. Makes tuition for W&L worth it. Very difficult though and requires many out of class hours.
1869,2626522,2.0,4.0,"Difficult, but through the mastery grading system it is possible to do well at the end even if you haven't been. Very nice professor, but makes mistakes and you kind of need to learn on your own."
1870,1993708,4.0,4.0,"Overall good professor. At first she seemed intimidating and strict, but once you know the rules of the class she's great. She really enjoys helping the students and even though class participation is required she makes sure to call on everyone. Work isn't too much. Not many tests. Not a bad path to get rid of the language requirement."
1871,1872879,2.0,4.0,"Really nice guy and tries his best to help explain things so everyone understand, but goes over easy problems and concepts in class and then gives us disproportionately hard homework that not even the TA knows how to answer. Tests and weekly quizzes are very difficult"
1872,1872879,1.0,5.0,"The weird grading system, not helpful during class, and makes the material more difficult than it has to be."
1873,1872879,1.0,4.0,"I took Abrams for 102. He let us choose our own section weights for tests, hw, quizzes, and the final. they all have to be weighed between 10%-40%. The problem is, he never grades anything, and when we do get our grades back it's just plusses and minuses, no numbers. He also never goes to online office hours. go gennies"
1874,1872879,3.0,5.0,"Super nice guy, very hard class. Go to his office hours when you need help for individual feedback. The textbook is hard to understand but you go over it during class. Unique grading system used."
1875,1872879,1.0,4.0,"Aaron is a character. Bridges material is already tough but he somehow makes it even more inaccessible by going off tangents during lectures. He grades on, what he calls, an &quot;improvement system&quot; but to do such improving, you have to put a lot of effort + hours outside of class. Would not recommend him to anyone bc he's just not a good teacher."
1876,1872879,4.0,4.0,"A nice buy. The problem is his train of thoughts do not fit with the textbook sometimes, so you need to spend some times to read the book. The class is difficult compared with other professors, but if you want to learn solid math knowledge for your major, he would be a good choice."
1877,1872879,5.0,4.0,"Very nice guy who cares about students' learning and loves the subject he teaches. Come into class with mathematical curiosity and you'll have a great time. His tests can be quite challenging, so be prepared to study very hard and do lots of practice outside of class."
1878,1872879,4.0,5.0,"Very smart guy, but a very tough course."
1879,1872879,2.0,4.0,Mainly self-taught. Uses the textbook for many examples and explanations. Doesn't give many examples of problems in class. Isn't clear what's going to be on any test or quiz.
1880,1872879,2.0,4.0,"He's a nice guy, but not a great teacher in my opinion. Homework problems are really difficult and usually on topics that we would cover in the next class. This wouldn't be such a big problem if homework wasn't GRADED FOR ACCURACY. Sometimes goes on strange tangents, too. Not great at answering questions either."
1881,1872879,1.0,5.0,Hardest math class I've ever taken. Class is very confusing. The grading scale is also very strange.
1882,1872879,4.0,4.0,"By no means is Abrams discrete class easy, but he does make it interesting. He also lets you choose how your grade is weighted between homework/quizzes and tests which is nice for those who aren't the strongest test-takers."
1883,1872879,2.0,5.0,"Nice man but not a wonderful professor. I did really appreciate his help outside of class, but the actual class was poorly structured and way too difficult for a 100 level math class. Also, he gives a ridiculous amount of homework."
1884,1872879,2.0,4.0,"There were never lesson plans. We often spent an entire class on just one or two problems. Homework was graded by accuracy (by our TA), but we did not learn the material for that section until after the homework was submitted. Prof. Abrams didn't allow our TA to write anything out during office hours, so we had to try to learn everything verbally."
1885,1872879,1.0,5.0,"Professor Abrams is a good human; however, this class was essentially a self-study course. He would introduce the tip of a chapter then expect you to be able to answer all the extremely challenging homework questions. This would be okay if he was very available for office hours where you could ask him the challenging questions. Nope: 9-11 am T,TH."
1886,1872879,2.0,4.0,"Professor Abrams was okay. His lectures made sense in class, however the homework was always much more difficult and you have to self teach from the book. His office hours were very inconvenient to students so it was hard to get help. Probably wouldn't take another class with him."
1887,1872879,1.0,5.0,I absolutely hate his teaching. He gives an absurd amount of homework and never explains it. In class he gives lectures that veer wildly off topic and often makes the lesson even more confusing. Do yourself a favor and find somebody else for calc II.
1888,1872879,3.0,4.0,"Challenging course. Homework had to be turned in almost every class, and usually six questions for each assignment were graded at random for correctness. It was a lot of work, and some test questions were tricky. I found lectures were pretty interesting, but I didn't find the course accessible for people who struggle in math."
1889,1872879,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Abrams seems to get a bad rep on here, but he is pretty great!  The textbook he chose for a Calc First Course was rough, but he tried everyday to help us make sense of it.  He goes out of his way to help his students.  I think I ended up going to his office hours and he practically wouldn't let me leave till I had it down pat."
1890,1872879,5.0,4.0,"Likable man and very intelligent professor.  Teaches a tough course, but tries his best to make sure everyone is understanding the material.  Also makes himself available for help outside of class. "
1891,1872879,1.5,5.0,"Homework due every class, graded on accuracy,and the material on each homework is taught after the assignment is due, so you're essentially graded on how well you can read a math text book.  Made good grades on all tests but bad grade in the class from homework grade."
1892,1872879,3.0,4.0,"Fairly dull in class, we mostly just went over homework every class. He grades homework very tough but once you get that you're fine. I never went to office hours but his tests are pretty easy."
1893,332783,5.0,2.0,Professor Bell is the best! She is the most caring and thoughtful Professor I have ever had. I learned a lot from her lectures and the outside readings were always super interesting. Bell was always available to meet outside of class and eager to have a conversation about anything. Take this class! I wish I could take it again!
1894,332783,5.0,2.0,Professor Bell is a real gem of a professor. I took the class for a requirement but the class taught me so much about diverse perspectives and connections to current social movements and issues. The people in the class may not be the most energetic but Professor Bell always goes out of her way to make class engaging.
1895,332783,5.0,3.0,Great professor and learned something new every class. Homework not really necessary. Amazing class for studying human behavior. Only 3 projects with no tests or quizzes. Really made you think.
1896,332783,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bell is great! The only issue I had in her class was that she tended to be a rather harsh grader in certain aspects. If you meet with her often though, the criteria will become more clear."
1897,332783,5.0,3.0,"Professor Bell is amazing. She assigns interesting projects and paper topics, and always gives students opportunities to improve their grades after the due dates. She cares a lot about everyone doing well, and frequently offers extra credit as a result. I would definitely recommend taking her classes in the future"
1898,332783,4.0,4.0,Mostly discussion based so you have to be up to date with readings. She offers extra credit for going to talks and writing a one page summary. She's always willing to meet to help with 5 papers for the course. Really sweet professor and would recommend.
1899,332783,4.0,2.0,"Professor Bell is an amazing teacher and cares more about the class overall than individual grades. She offers lots of extra credit and the homework is very straight-forward, easy A. Her grading can be confusing, but she's always willing to conference about any papers to clear things up. Would definitely recommend!"
1900,332783,5.0,2.0,Professor Bell is the reason that I am majoring in Anthropology. She is so awesome and knowledgeable about such a vast array of topics. You must take a class with her before you graduate W&L.
1901,332783,5.0,2.0,Great professor! Makes everything she teaches so interesting. 1010 would recommend.
1902,332783,4.0,1.0,Can't think of one bad thing to say about Professor Bell. She is so kind and peaked my interest in a subject I knew nothing about. Work is very manageable and she is more than willing to help. Definitely take if given the chance.
1903,332783,5.0,3.0,Great Professor. Highly recommend her. 
1904,332783,5.0,2.0,Literally the best professor I've ever had at W&L.
1905,332783,1.5,4.0,She's a terrible teacher and not a very nice lady. Way too over protective. Don't take her class. Seriously- don't.
1906,332783,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bell is a lovely woman who is very passionate about her subject. She knows so much about it, and does her best to pique others' interest in it as well. Her class is a pleasure to be in and discussions get very interesting, even to those not majoring in the subject."
1907,332783,5.0,2.0,Best anthro professor ever
1908,332783,5.0,2.0,"Bell is a great professor.  Young, nice, and a W&L alum, who takes a lot of interest in her students.  One of my favorites!"
1909,332783,4.5,4.0,I love Prof. Bell. She's really nice and her class (Econ Anthro) is fascinating. If you have any interest at all in Anthro/Archea make sure you take her!
1910,332783,5.0,3.0,GREAT!
1911,332783,5.0,1.0,she is smoking hot.
1912,332783,4.5,2.0,"Professor Bell seems to be a little bored teaching the intro course, but she's very helpful and you can tell she knows what she's talking about. She's very nice and approachable, so you can always come visit her during office hours. Great teacher!"
1913,332783,4.5,2.0,"very nice and helpful, hot also, her husband is lucky"
1914,332783,4.5,3.0,No Comments
1915,332783,4.5,2.0,great
1916,2352128,5.0,4.0,"Professor Alexander is a great asset to the Politics Department. He's a warm and engaging professor who wants you to learn politics and be able to apply it to today. He's a tough grader, but put in the work and you'll do well. Well worth reaching out to him and making the connection."
1917,2352128,5.0,3.0,"If you have the chance to take a course with Professor Alexander, DO IT! He is so incredibly kind and helpful. I came to class early every day just to pick his brain. Such an amazing and enthusiastic professor who presents his material very well. I took this class just for the FDR but was on the edge of my seat!"
1918,2352128,5.0,3.0,Take Professor Alexander for anything. He's simply great. He cares so much and he's so passionate about all his material and students. If you can 370 then absolutely do it. Don't hesitate. Alexander is so passionate about Jefferson and it was just an awesome class. But seriously take a class with Alexander.
1919,2046978,5.0,3.0,Professor Coddington is the best professor I've had at W&amp;L. He truly cares about his students and is very accommodating. He expects a lot from students but provides helpful feedback quickly. His classes are interesting and he changes up the syllabus to keep things entertaining. I loved taking News Writing with him and would recommend him to all.
1920,2046978,5.0,2.0,"Professor Coddington is smart and caring, and it easily makes him not just a great professor, but a lot like a &quot;dad&quot; as well. His expectations are clear, and he a firm, but not tough grader. He gives very detailed feedback, which is so helpful, not only for the class but career-wise. If you're going on Strat Comm or Jour, he's great for both tracks"
1921,2046978,5.0,2.0,"He's the kind of prof who's so good at communicating material that you almost don't need to go to office hours. He is, however, very accessible and very helpful outside of class. If you're looking to learn something practical and relevant take this class with Professor Coddington."
1922,2046978,4.0,2.0,"Coddington is the man. He's very smart but not overbearing about it. He really knows his stuff, which was good for an intro class. Unnanounced reading quizzes keep you on your toes. If you show that you care about the class, you will do well. Lots of textbook reading but it's easy to skim and keep up. Also Newseum field trip is pretty cool."
1923,2046978,4.0,2.0,"He's a good guy and a good teacher. Pretty straight forward with his assignments. If you're a good writer, you'll do fine in his class. As long as you follow his critiques and put sufficient effort into the blogposts, you'll get an A."
1924,2046978,4.0,2.0,Amazing intro class if you're interested in Journalism and/or Mass Communications. 
1925,171026,1.5,5.0,"just reads the textbook in a really quiet, monotone voice. rushed through every concept in one day no matter how hard or easy the concept is. confusing and doesn't give partial credit"
1926,171026,4.5,5.0,This guy is an absolute genius. Smartest professor I have ever had hands down. Real analysis gets real hard but he is the right guy to teach it. Its really funny that he seems to be easy for calc... hes a walking supercomputer
1927,171026,3.5,2.0,Professor Evans is a decent teacher. Fairly boring but his heart's in the right place. But in the end math is math is math. And math isn't fun.
1928,171026,5.0,2.0,Professor Evans is an amazing Calc professor. Goes over every homework question at the beginning of each class so that everyone understands. Very useful out of class during meetings. Must attend class but easy from there.
1929,171026,5.0,2.0,Professor Evans is an amazing Calc professor. Goes over every homework question at the beginning of each class so that everyone understands. Very useful out of class during meetings. Must attend class but easy from there.
1930,171026,3.0,3.0,"Very Fair. Homework is a large part of the grade, the book is very poor so go to class. Tests are fair. Make sure to go to class the day before the test"
1931,171026,5.0,2.0,"Evans is a good teacher, his tests are fair-easy since they always are very similar to whats on the practice tests. He is helpful during OH and his teaching style is clear, the only bad thing I can say about him are his classes can be alittle dull at times. He is also a very lenient grader who gives lots of partial credit"
1932,171026,5.0,2.0,The best Real Analysis teacher in the world
1933,171026,1.5,3.0,"He's a really nice and friendly prof, but if you ask questions he'd respond with something like &quot;Well, if you don't get that, then I'm an awful teacher!&quot;  and would then proceed to repeat exactly what he said before, clearing up nothing about your question.  Some kids did really well, but I struggled in the class."
1934,171026,1.5,4.0,"Ugh.  Evans is not helpful, boring, and condescending.  I struggled through his class despite doing the many practice problems assigned and going in for help.  He would basically just repeat what he had said in class during office hours which did not help at all.  Also, he wears sweater vests."
1935,171026,5.0,3.0,Probably the best math professor for non-math people at W&L
1936,171026,5.0,2.0,"He makes confusing problems a lot easier to understand. Always very clear, helpful, enthusiastic, great grader. I highly recommend him to anyone who wants to take Cal 102! He's the best, believe me! :-)"
1937,171026,4.5,2.0,Very clear and if you do the homework the tests are pretty easy.  Not always the most excting lecturer. Has a very subtle sense of humor and is very approachable.  Would definitely recommend him.
1938,171026,4.5,3.0,"Actually Ordinary Diff EQ was pretty easy.  He is extremely helpful and kind, however his lectures are so dry and boring that it is almost impossible to stay awake.  I recommend doing the homework to prepare for tests and seeing him in his office."
1939,171026,5.0,2.0,"Such a cool guy, so funny, very helpful outside of class. If you follow his examples in class and study your notes, you will get an A. He gave me the first A I ever got in math since junior high...yah!"
1940,171026,4.5,4.0,Evans is very accessible and explains material well
1941,171026,5.0,2.0,"I had the pleasure of taking Prof. Evans twice. Unfortunately, they were for the same class. The second time around, I did a lot better than the first time, and he was very helpful the entire term. Great teacher, very smart, and a good, old school sense of humor."
1942,171026,3.5,4.0,"Boring, but sometimes has a subtle and clever (albeit corny) sense of humor."
1943,171026,4.5,2.0,cool dude and very smart
1944,171026,3.5,2.0,"very nice, pretty easy too."
1945,171026,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Evans is a hilarious guy with an even greater passion for math. He makes things simple, and provides good reviews. Not very difficult either!"
1946,171026,4.5,2.0,No Comments
1947,171026,5.0,2.0,"Very smart man, excellent teacher (and funny too!)"
1948,171026,4.0,2.0,"Dry sense of humor....very funny! Very straightforward, except sometimes he winks at the class."
1949,171026,2.0,2.0,So RUDE. Manic Depressive.
1950,1117204,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ruiz is extremely kind and makes each class interesting. She is clear regarding her expectations and grading is not too tough. I am definitely not a poetry person, but the way she teaches her class made me really enjoy it."
1951,1117204,5.0,2.0,Professor Ruiz is THE BEST. She is not afraid to let you know if there is something wrong with your paper or your writing but gives you excellent feedback in order to fix it. She cares deeply about her students and wants to see every one of her students succeed. I had her online this semester so I can't imagine how awesome she would be in person.
1952,1117204,4.0,4.0,"I took her writing seminar on Immigration. She knows a lot about it and LOVES to explain it. You will, for sure, increase your knowledge and understanding of it. She will make you work HARD for your grade. Office hours are MAJOR! you must go and talk to her, make sure you know what she expects and then reassess with her."
1953,1117204,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher, just show up to class and participate and you will do fine, the only reason i would take more than the required amount of spanish is if she is teaching the class, she has lots of energy and always seems excited and makes it interesting"
1954,1117204,5.0,4.0,"One of the best, most animated teachers I have ever had. She loves what she does and she'll make you love it too. Her energy is infectious and her classes are never disappointing. She demands alot from you, but her teaching style is casual and she'll make you actually WANT to give it your all. Definitely recomend Ruiz- she made me love Spanish."
1955,1117204,4.0,2.0,"LOVE her.  Ruiz is HILARIOUS.  Her class is always an adventure and she is SUPER energetic.  She is a stickler on pronunciation, but it's because she is the freaking voice of Rosetta Stone...literally.  If you study and participate in class she will love you and you will do well."
1956,1117204,3.5,2.0,"pretty interesting and funny teacher, tests over what she teaches. study your quizes, but she'll let you retake them if you bomb them"
1957,1117204,4.0,5.0,"GREAT, INTELLIGENT, WITTY, FAIR, ENTHUSIASTIC teacher who will finally TEACH you Spanish (164). Amazing CIV of Spain class also! (211) You'll want more too, but her classes require time, effort and dedication.  Some impossible workload expectations... but she's willing to listen... Use her office hours!"
1958,1117204,4.0,3.0,Great professor. She legitimately likes what she teaches and it shows in her lectures. Always in a good mood and wants to get to know her students.
1959,1117204,4.5,2.0,"My favorite class by far. Profesora Ruiz has a strong understanding of the Spanish language and is excited to share her knowledge.  Her tests are not that bad, and she will let you retake quizzes if you bomb them.  She is also hysterical. Love her!"
1960,1117204,3.5,4.0,Never a dull moment in this class. Goes off on tangents (understatement) every class. Participation is rewarded.
1961,1117204,4.5,3.0,"Very quirky, fun, and interesting teacher. Very approachable, and if you demonstrate some interest in the material, she'll like you."
1962,480284,4.0,4.0,"Prof Kosky cares deeply about his students. He is not a very easy grader, so do not expect an easy. Take one of his classes if you are genuinely interesting is learning the course material."
1963,480284,3.0,5.0,"Professor Kosky loves the material he teaches, and you can tell he cares about his students. You must read everything he assigns though, and its a lot of reading. Sometimes it makes absolutely no sense too. The class gets dry and his voice is kinda monotone so staying engaged is tough. Wouldnt recommend for non religion majors."
1964,480284,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kosky's class was the most interesting class I have taken at W&amp;L. If you want a Professor that challenges you to think through the material and more than that think through your outlook on life, take a class with Kosky. Incredibly intelligent and nice person."
1965,480284,5.0,5.0,Really outstanding.
1966,480284,4.0,5.0,Struggled a lot in his class. Kosky is an amazing man and knowledgeable professor- clearly loves working with students. Recommend him for those who truly enjoy reading A LOT. every night. for hours. And quite possibly not understanding a word. If you take notes on everything he says in class and use those to guide your papers you will have success.
1967,480284,1.0,5.0,"Heard he was a great professor, but actually one of the worst I've had in 4 years. He is pretentious to such a degree that it makes the class cringe collectively. He wants to be in the classroom as little as his students and it shows, bringing a negative attitude every day. Takes a month to grade with nearly no feedback w/strict arbitrary grading"
1968,480284,4.5,4.0,"Hands down best prof I ever had. Tough, high expectations--so do your work already! Gives credit where it's due; he'll call you on it if you don't do the readings. Worked my butt off on my paper and he was very complimentary; got an A--I know he doesn't hand those out. Don't take his class if you want to mess around; take one if you want to learn."
1969,480284,4.5,3.0,"He was a fantastic professor. Assigns a lot of reading, but you can skim it. Relies on discussion, but this makes it easier to learn/remember the material. Tests were no big deal if you paid attention in class. Interesting prof, good classes (I've had 3). Very helpful, very accessible for office hours. convinced me to add a REL major."
1970,480284,4.5,3.0,"He was a fantastic professor. Assigns a lot of reading, but you can skim it. Relies on discussion, but this makes it easier to learn/remember the material. Tests were no big deal if you paid attention in class. Interesting prof, good classes (I've had 3). Very helpful if you need help, very accessible for office hours. Made me add a REL major."
1971,480284,4.5,4.0,Kosky is amazing.  He does use discussion a lot and his meaning is not always clear.  Instead of hand feeding you answers he encourages you to explore and find your own.  He guides your learning rather than dictates it.  His class expanded my world views not just my understanding of Religion.
1972,480284,4.0,2.0,his glasses are HOT. and also...if you don't love his class you are probably a tool.
1973,480284,2.5,3.0,"well meaning, but ultimately boring and difficult to understand. relies heavily on class discussions, and often talks to/leads discussions through one student. class can very awkward and painful if no one wants to participate. also, the readings (lots of them!) are very philosophical, vague and all around difficult to force yourself to read."
1974,480284,5.0,4.0,Awesome.  The most interesting teacher I had.
1975,480284,3.5,5.0,"j kosky is the coolest man, ever."
1976,480284,3.5,4.0,"awesome guy, cool as a teacher. readings and class discussion are really tough to get through - not easy for non-philosophical people. easy to talk to though, and his tests aren't too bad."
1977,480284,5.0,4.0,"J. Kosky is the man.  That's all that needs to be said.  He's tough, but is completely fair and willing to help out anyone who needs it.  All you have to do is go ask him and he'll definitely clarify for you."
1978,480284,3.5,4.0,"very confusing readings but the lectures are more clear. the class is all based on one paper and two tests. he doesnt really like to give a's and says that &quot;b's are good.&quot; but he's a nice guy and wants to help you, and he likes to explain things over and over again."
1979,480284,4.5,4.0,"Class is not very exciting, but he really tries to help you out. Especially if you go to his office hours and talk to him about your progress. Not an easy class with only four assignments (two papers and the midterm all worth 20% and a 40% final). If he likes you, he'll help out with a decent grade."
1980,1027109,2.0,2.0,"Intro to Islam is a great class taught by a great professor. He knows the subject well, and no student can complain about the work load."
1981,1027109,5.0,1.0,he is a great professor.
1982,1027109,4.5,1.0,"Professor Hatcher has really interesting lectures and is very clear in presenting material. This is also a really easy class overall, and he grades easily. He is very helpful outside of class and willing to discuss papers, etc. in office hours."
1983,1027109,5.0,2.0,Professor Hatcher's Intro to Islam class is great.  He clearly knows a lot about his subject and his lectures are pretty interesting.  The work load isn't too bad either.  Great teacher to take regardless of major.
1984,1891370,5.0,2.0,I took both tax classes with Dr.A. She is by far my favorite professors at W&L. She makes tax fun and wants you to do well. Its very possible to get an A if you try and she gives extra credit opportunities. I never thought tax would be fun but she made it my favorite class by far! Take her if you can!!!!
1985,1344554,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kuehner is one of my favorite professors in the PHYS/ENGN department. While his classes are tough, he is caring, gives great feedback, and is willing to meet 1-on-1 to figure things out. I definitely learned a lot. If you do practice problems before tests, you will do great. "
1986,1344554,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kuehner is extremely organized in structuring his class and delivers information in a concise way. Tests tend to be challenging, but he is generous with partial credit and relatively forgiving with mathematical mistakes. This particular class was flipped, so it was nice having him walk us through problems in class."
1987,1344554,4.0,4.0,Professor Kuehner explains things very well. He teaches in a flipped classroom style where you take notes on videos for homework and work on problems in class which makes class time fly by. He knows the topics well and does a good job at answering questions. Tests are VERY hard but your grade in the end will be better than you expect
1988,1344554,3.5,4.0,"Definitely a great teacher! Not always the most clear about answering questions, but always gives good suggestions and advice. And he presents the material really well. HIS TESTS ARE HARD!!! DO ALL THE SUGGESTED PROBLEMS IF YOU WANT TO DO WELL!!! Wasn't the most accessible for help, but when you could get in to see him he was very helpful."
1989,1344554,5.0,4.0,Kuehner is an amazing teacher. He is always available for extra help and really cares about whether his students understand the material. He gives a lot of credit for improvement. Extremely tough grader. You must work very very hard. 
1990,1344554,5.0,4.0,"Honestly one of the best professors I've had at W&L. Cares about his student, and willing to work with them to ensure that they learn the material"
1991,1344554,4.0,3.0,"Professor Kuehner is a great professor. Tricky at times, but always willing to help."
1992,1344554,3.5,3.0,"Hmm...Kuehner is sometimes &quot;the man&quot;, and at other times can be the *****. I see people in his office room a lot--I don't know whether it's a good indication or not. To me, he is not that clear, but a really nice guy, a tough grader, but a fair one, nonetheless. Sometimes I wished he had used more elaborate discussions going more into the topic."
1993,375858,3.5,3.0,"I really liked her. You can tell she is always looking for new ways keep the material interesting and hands on, incorporate latest technology/media, etc. we also got to interact with some interesting/important people. she is not as easy of a grader as you think she would be, and her final was pretty hard, but study and you'll be fine"
1994,375858,2.5,5.0,Incoherent lectures and not an easy grader just unpredictable and inconsistent
1995,375858,1.5,2.0,Artwick's class was one of the most frustrating I've ever taken. She teaches a class about digital journalism but has no idea how to use any of the technology. She's so unclear and the class felt like a huge waste of time. I didn't learn a single thing.
1996,375858,4.5,4.0,"Wonderful professor. Definitely one of the best journalism professors. She truly cares about her students and understands their capabilites, much more so than some other J professors. Compassionate and nurturing, but tough, too. Don't expect an easy-A; you get what you work for, which is how professors are supposed to grade."
1997,375858,3.5,2.0,"Such a sweet lady.  Sometimes scatterbrained, but knowledgeable and always there to help."
1998,375858,4.5,2.0,Very nice lady. Pretty easy grader as long as you support your answers
1999,375858,3.5,1.0,"Although Artwick is spaced out and not the most coherent at times during class, she is reasonable in what she expects from you.  Tests are clear and an easy A if you study at all.(aided by a review session where she goes over every single topic on the test). If you take her at face value, youll appreciate the class more."
2000,375858,4.0,4.0,No Comments
2001,375858,2.0,3.0,Very helpful and dedicated.
2002,375858,4.0,2.0,No Comments
2003,375858,1.5,3.0,"Awful. The worst professor in the worst class that I ever took at W&L. She gives no rhyme or reason to her grading system, just completely arbitrary. Her lectures are dominated by feminist rhetoric, and very little journalism."
2004,1641522,2.0,1.0,"Super nice guy and very easy grader, but beware if you are someone that thrives on organized professors and clarity every step of the way  that is not him. He is pretty all over the place, and you have no idea what your grade is until it shows up after the term"
2005,1641522,5.0,3.0,"This class was a bit hard since I had no prior programming experience, but that being said it was very doable. He taught us the basics and then let us work on our group project the rest of the term. He's very accessible, helpful, and nice."
2006,1641522,3.0,2.0,"This class was by far the easiest class I've ever taken at W&amp;L. We did 2 assignments with maybe 5 lectures then spent the rest of the term working on our final project. He was super accessible in class for help, and is willing to also help outside of class. You just have to be willing to put in time with the final project and you're good."
2007,1641522,5.0,2.0,"Not only are his quizzes open note and internet, so is his final. Do take if you love biology because his passion about biology shows when he lectures. He's a very nice guy and is always willing to help on assignments."
2008,1641522,5.0,2.0,"He's an awesome professor to have First term, he is really passionate about biology and provides a great introduction to collegiate and peer-reviewed scientific literature. His tests are open note and open internet but require the synthesis of material. Engage in class and you will truly enjoy the class and the material"
2009,1641522,5.0,4.0,"He is one of the most passionate professors I have had, and he cares about his students.  His lectures are great.  Office hours are also helpful."
2010,1641522,5.0,2.0,Great Professor! A must take for intro classes. Learnt a lot in his class. Makes us do poster session which is extremely fun. You feel like a scientist!
2011,1641522,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Whitworth is the man. He's brilliant, super helpful and engaging in class. No textbook for this class, which is great. He doesn't assign too much work and is very fair with grades. If you're lucky enough to get into his section, you're in for a great course."
2012,1641522,4.0,2.0,"No textbook and not really any curriculum either. All we do is either group presentations or he teaches us. Really passionate and very very smart. Very interesting class, definitely the best intro bio prof. All tests and quizzes are open note and take home."
2013,1641522,3.0,4.0,Enthusiastic professor
2014,1641522,4.5,2.0,Quizzes are easy. He's super helpful.
2015,1641522,5.0,3.0,Extremely helpful and enthusiastic about his subject. Will definitely take him again!
2016,1641522,5.0,3.0,"He is a great professor- always prepared for class and was interested in/ excited about his lectures.  He's very generous with partial credit if you can prove you learned something.  He did assign several group projects/presentations that I did not enjoy, but he did explain that for some reason, learning from peers is more effective in the long run"
2017,1641522,4.5,2.0,"Professor Whitworth's class is great. Unlike many intro-level bio classes, there's no textbook. His assessments are very fair, and if you put effort into them, you'll do well. He's also very helpful outside of class."
2018,1641522,4.5,2.0,"He is always so excited and engaged, it makes you love the subject.  He is also very excited about any questions and will explain until you 100% understand."
2019,711740,2.0,2.0,Care more about format than content
2020,711740,3.0,4.0,"I have taken multiple classes with Professor Harris, and she requires a lot of reading and writing. I still haven't figured out how she grades papers, but as long as you do the readings and take notes during class, you should be fine. Her prompts tend to be broad, and I have been able to incorporate my interests into my assignments, which I like"
2021,711740,2.0,4.0,"The upsides: -Professor Harris knows the topic and you will learn a lot -Professor Harris is really nice -Course readings are well structured The downsides: -Grading system doesn't pick up knowledge, only memorization (Prof. gives the questions beforehand and then expects a near perfect regurgitation of her notes), paper is cookie-cutter"
2022,711740,5.0,4.0,"Pol 232 (env policy &amp; law) If you want to be challenged, learn relevant policy implications, and enhance your understanding of not only politics but also science and economics, this is an excellent course and Harris is an engaging professor. Tests require high degree of memorization and papers take time and dedication. Hard work will pay off."
2023,711740,1.0,4.0,Rebecca Harris is the worst politics professor I have ever had. If you do not regurgitate exactly what she says you will not do well. Doesnt matter whether you genuinely understand what the class is on. All she wants is regurgitation. She should not by employed by this university
2024,711740,3.0,3.0,"Professor Harris is very enjoyable in class. Class shifted online halfway through and was substantially worse than in person. She is very knowledge; however, her grading is somewhat odd. She graded POL 100 assigmnts on a strange rubric that was not disclosed prior to submitting the assignment. She seems better suited to teach higher level classes."
2025,711740,4.0,4.0,"Harris is very organized and clear about what she wants and expects from day one. The daily readings are manageable, informative, and relevant to lectures. Papers were not too hard as long as you read, come to class, and put in the time. The weekly questions were relevant and made political concepts more interesting. Overall, loved this course"
2026,711740,5.0,3.0,"Really straightforward class. Professor Harris was very clear about what she expected from her students, and three papers and a final is a very manageable workload for a politics class. She is a very fair grader, and you basically get what you put into the work for this class."
2027,711740,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed Professor Harris a lot. She expanded my understanding of politics and was a very fair grader. It wasn't easy to make an A, but it can be done through a nice work ethic."
2028,711740,4.0,2.0,"Wonderful class. Lots of in depth class discussions. Teacher rarely feels the need to lecture and is interesting when she does. She's very nice and doesn't grade too hard. As long as you kept up with the work, you were fine. "
2029,711740,2.5,4.0,way too much work for a 101 level class. You have to completely regurgitate her notes to get even a B+. Hard to get an A. weekly papers due that are graded with no consistency. hard to understand what she wants from you. very nice lady who seems like she's helpful. would not recommend taking.
2030,711740,5.0,2.0,"Phenomenal professor.  Very knowledgeable and smart.  Friendly and very willing to help her students. Very well liked on campus, and highly recommended."
2031,711740,2.5,5.0,Harris is a terrible teacher. Incredibly ignorant about current events and politics--the kind of thing she ostensibly makes her living knowing. I love politics and was excited to take her class. The only way she knows how to grade is how accurately you were able to regurgitate her notes. If you miss words or phrases she takes off points. No thanks.
2032,711740,3.0,3.0,"Great lady, super excited about what she teaches. Have had her for 2 courses and enjoyed both. Regurgitate and you will do fine, everything is as straight forward as it seems in her class. Would recommend as long as you can put in the time."
2033,711740,3.5,3.0,"I've had this professor for two classes. In both, your test grades are based on your ability to memorize material and regurgitate it. Grades on papers, similarly, are more about the breadth of your summary than your ability to think critically. If you're willing to play this game, you can get an A. My advice&#63; Avoid."
2034,711740,4.0,2.0,"Very nice lady. Sexy. Very intelligent. Despite these good qualities, I ended the term HATING politics; there is way too much reading and the weekly assignments are way too demanding for an introductory class. Avoid."
2035,711740,4.0,3.0,Professor Harris' lectures are well organized and she is very clear about what you need to know for tests. The reading assignment is nothing in comparison to many of the other classes at W&L. There is a two page paper every week but it is just to show that you grasp the concepts taught in class and to help prepare you for the final and midterm.
2036,711740,2.5,2.0,"The exams are basically recitations of weekly notes.  Friday discussion groups can be boring, especially since she's too busy writing questions on the board."
2037,711740,3.5,4.0,"Really nice teacher. Ridiculous workload for an intro class. 1.5-2.5 page paper single spaced due every Monday, about 100+ pages of reading a week, not an easy grader, expects a lot from you. Somehow i still don't hate the class must be because she is really nice and loves the subject, constantly available for help, loves her students."
2038,711740,5.0,2.0,"The nicest lady. She puts all of the notes up on the board during class. Worst part is that there are 2-3 page papers due every monday morning, and that you have to read about 70 pages before coming to class on Friday. She's such a nice lady though that it didn't bother me..."
2039,711740,5.0,2.0,"It is a mildly interesting class.  Very straightforward.  If you just do the work then you will end up with an A.  The weekly assignments get a little time consuming, but it is a good class overall."
2040,711740,4.5,2.0,She is a great teacher. Weekly assignment s help to clarify material and ensure that you are on the right track. This class provides weekly topics that you can flush out with discussion. Every topic area is covered from foreign policy to the Supreme court. Excellent course.
2041,711740,5.0,3.0,"I hear that her intro courses have a lot of busy work, but for her upper-level Biopolicy course she rocked.  Really passionate and knowledgeable about the subject.  Weekly 2-3 pg. response papers, but no term paper!  Class is heavily based on discussion.  Would definitely recommend."
2042,711740,5.0,3.0,lots of work but an easy grader and a pretty cool professor... some of the above comments are unfounded she is NOT a tough grader unless you are an idiot... prof harris is also smokin hott
2043,711740,4.5,3.0,"Very straightforward class.  Weekly papers are time consuming, but graded very leniently.  She is a very approachable professor and I enjoyed the class.  Sometimes lectures can get a bit boring and she is a stickler for attendance and punctuality."
2044,711740,1.5,5.0,Possibly the worst teacher you could ever get in the United States of America. She can make you hate something you're passionate about. Drop immediately or prepare for a LOT of work and a VERY harsh grader.
2045,711740,5.0,3.0,Great teacher
2046,711740,1.0,5.0,"The worst thing that could happen to you!! unless you are masochist, don't take a class with her. she knows what she is talking about- but is a horrible teacher ad grader."
2047,711740,3.5,5.0,a lot of work. but she is very smart and knows her stuff. maybe save her for a higher level class when you are really interested.
2048,711740,1.5,5.0,"Way too much work for an intro class; ridiculous amount of reading and writing weekly, too picky of a grader, DROP the class if u get put in it...seriously"
2049,711740,1.0,5.0,AWFUL. I've never disliked a class more. Unfair and irrational grading. Teaches more about foreign policy than AMERICAN GOVT. Ridiculous work load. Asking her questions doesn't help at all.
2050,711740,1.0,5.0,200 + pages of reading and a 4 page paper every week for a gen en&#63;&#63; she does not explain stuff properly and is an extremely hard grader. even if you ask her for help- all she can say is &quot; it was not satisfactory&quot;
2051,539712,5.0,3.0,"Boylan's a best case scenario for intro accounting. He's a very cogent lecturer and uses lots examples in class, both real life and otherwise. Simple layout with weekly homework assignments and quarterly tests (relative course length). Not too hard, but you do learn the material and if you put the work in A- or A is very realistic. Would recommend."
2052,539712,5.0,3.0,"Best class that I have taken at W&amp;L. The topic is incredibly interesting and Boylan makes it even better. Highly recommend any class with Boylan, especially this one."
2053,539712,5.0,2.0,"Very interesting and funny lectures. Tests are clear and straightforward. If you pay attention and do the practice tests he gives you, you will do well."
2054,539712,5.0,2.0,Great Professor. Pretty easy to make an A in. I would recommend to anyone. He is very clear in the grading criteria and his tests are very straightforward.
2055,539712,3.0,3.0,"Mediocre teacher. I really don't understand the hype. Pretty nice guy, I guess."
2056,539712,4.0,4.0,Great professor and I learned a lot. He also made lectures interesting and provided lots of examples. Tests were difficult and were a major part of the overall course grade.
2057,539712,5.0,3.0,"Boylan is a great guy.  Barely any homework, tests are straightforward and not graded very harshly.  He creates interesting and funny examples to get his points across.  He's always cracking jokes.  100% would recommend."
2058,539712,5.0,3.0,He was a great professor and definitely one of the best I have had in college.  I would highly recommend his class.  His tests are very fair and he explains the material in a fun way.  The him if you get the chance.
2059,539712,5.0,3.0,"TAKE BOYLAN. I knew nothing about accounting before I took his class and I already feel like I know a lot. He really knows his stuff but he also makes sure you know it well. Very accessible, open office hours, is willing to discuss anything to help you. Only downside is that three tests is your entire grade, so if you do bad on one it hurts a lot"
2060,539712,5.0,2.0,By far my favorite professor so far.  His lectures are very clear and entertaining for the subject matter.  The tests are based on the homework and grading is clear/fair.
2061,539712,5.0,3.0,"Scotty B is no doubt the best ACCT professor at W&L. Cool dude and doesn't care if you show up  although his lectures are helpful. The subject is what it is, so test are somewhat challenging. That being said, if you're going to take an ACCT class, Boylan is the man you want "
2062,539712,5.0,3.0,Very straightforward. Knows the subject like the back of hand. If you pay attention and follow with the book you'll do fine. Has a good sense of humor too
2063,539712,5.0,2.0,Great professor and if you are new to accounting take him. Very helpful in his office hours and rarely need to go because he is very clear during his lectures. Fair grader and does not throw any curve balls at you. Also has a great sense of humor and cares about his students. If you reach out to him he will help you a lot.
2064,539712,4.5,2.0,"Crystal clear, lectures are as interesting as they can be, and he gives plenty of practice problems and homework to prepare for test problems.  I would recommend him to anyone."
2065,539712,5.0,2.0,great teacher...very clear...tests dont have any unexpected material...homework is very very manageable...easy to get a good grade if you have any sense at all
2066,539712,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. His exams are challenging but if you study from your notes and work the problems from the book, you'll be fine. Buckeye takes forever, but if you actually do it and understand it you'll be fine on his exams."
2067,539712,5.0,3.0,Very clear and go over examples in class.  Will learn a lot and he is willing to answer any question or meet with you whenever.  Only bad thing is the Buckeyes take forever and are worth hardly anything.
2068,539712,5.0,3.0,Great teacher! Makes everything really clear in class and is available after class. Tests are easy if you study and know the material and go over the cold test.
2069,539712,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Boylan is the man.  I had him in graduate school at the University of Virginia over the summer.  Best accounting teacher i've ever had, and i've had quite a few. If you are signing up for an into accounting class then you can't do better than Scotty Boylan."
2070,539712,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic teacher, totally approachable and he definitely goes the extra mile to make sure you understand the material. Pay attention in class and do the workbook problems he assigns (there aren't many) and you'll be fine!"
2071,539712,4.5,3.0,"Great prof!  Really helpful, clear lectures, tests were fair.  Challenging but do-able"
2072,539712,4.0,2.0,He is such a great guy - gave a fantastic and clear base knowledge for continuing the study of accounting.  I definately know a lot more (just by virtue of having Boylan) than my friends who took 201 with other professors.  Do the workbook problems before the tests and you will be fine.
2073,539712,5.0,3.0,So helpful and nice
2074,539712,5.0,2.0,"Really straightforward, knows how to explain everything well, and actually made accounting class interesting to go to - something other teachers can't seem to pull off. Not a hard class if you study and pay attention."
2075,539712,5.0,3.0,Boylan is a great teacher and one of the nicest professors in the c-school.
2076,539712,5.0,2.0,"He's one of the nicest, most approachable professors in the CSchool, and he makes accounting less boring than it could be.  Makes classes better with personal stories (ask him about moto racing)"
2077,539712,5.0,2.0,Hands down best professor at the c-school. Very clear and reasonable in expectations.  Always willing to help.  Not an easy class (class avg. about a 82) but if you do your work and pay attention in class there is no reason why you can't get an A.
2078,539718,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Bello is brilliant! He knows a lot about East Asian history and culture and will explain the important points very clearly in class. I'm really bad at history so sometimes I cannot follow his words quickly, but I believe his class would be a fantastic journey for history lover. Very patient and quite humorous, I recommend him very much!"
2079,539718,3.0,4.0,"Now that I am over a month removed from taking Bello's chinese history class, I realize how much stress that class put me through. The short essay every week that you dont know whether will be graded or not is so stressful, and Bello is an incredibly difficult (and vague) grader and will give a low grade with not much feedback."
2080,539718,3.0,4.0,"If you enjoy having a chance of getting an A, do not take this class. As a person, Bello is great, but he does dislike most things that are American. That said, he will put more precision on your paper and give you an 85 with little to no comments. If youre truly taking it solely for the subject and dont care about your grade its a great class"
2081,539718,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bello is a genuinely good person. His class is very lecture heavy and can drag along at times; however, he makes Chinese history interesting enough. This specific class was easy and did not require much work at all (just 1 short paper per week) Overall, he is a great professor to take if you need to take a history class."
2082,539718,4.0,5.0,"First, the good. Professor Bello is awesome - genuinely very funny, and passionate about the Chinese history. He somehow makes it interesting. However, the short paper you have to write every week is the only thing you are graded on, and they are BRUTAL. He is an incredibly tough, and often very vague, grader. Do with that what you will..."
2083,539718,4.0,2.0,"Maybe it was 8:00-9:35, but this class could drag lol. However boring it was at times, Bello is a great guy! 100% clear about expectations, never trying to trick ya. Pretty funny at times. Just pay attention, do the work, and participate. It wasn't demanding work (1 1-page essay per week, midterm (one of those essays), and final (3 1-page essays)."
2084,539718,5.0,4.0,Learning history from Professor Bello is such an engaging and rewarding experience because he does an excellent job of making lectures interesting and emphasizing deeper-level thinking of history. He's clear about what he expects from his students in terms of assignments and grading.
2085,539718,3.0,3.0,"Bello actually makes CH semi-interesting, which is an incredible feat. He is nice and understanding especially during COVID-19. Lot of reading and writing abt incredibly boring subjects. He is a huge simp for Communism/CCP which is just annoying. Makes you a better analytical writer, though. Wish he wasn't on Zoom."
2086,539718,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Bello is awesome. His classes are really rigorous, but he manages to make some really dry subjects interesting. No tests or homework, just a lot of writing, which he grades strictly but fairly."
2087,539718,4.0,3.0,"Hilarious professor who really wants students to learn and analyze. Knows a LOT about China. Only thing I didn't like about him: makes assumptions about students' lives and their backgrounds (not a big thing, but kinda irritating personally). Overall, really enjoyed his class, would definitely recommend."
2088,539718,4.0,4.0,"Great, simple format: no testsfinal, just 1 short essay a week answering a ? he assigns.  There's a ton of reading. It's really hard to get an A, regardless of your effort - you just need to be a good writer, no way around it.  He's very fun to listen to, probably the only prof I've had who lectures the whole time but isn't at all boring."
2089,539718,5.0,2.0,"Bello is the man. If you want to know anything (literally anything) about China then you need to know this guy. He not only is fluent in chinese but can read it in multiple alphabets and dialects, like Manchu and Uighur. He loves to teach and will challenge students to write and analyze to their best ability. Must take for majors and non-majors."
2090,539718,4.5,4.0,"Bello is a great guy who is incredibly smart and funny. Never a dull moment with him teasing everyone in existence. Expects every student to analyze very critically, and will not give an A if you don't. Not about memorization, it's about learning how to think and make connections. My favorite W&L professor by far. 4 classes in with him."
2091,539718,3.5,4.0,"pretty cool, eccentric guy. he has lots of energy and he's very passionate about chinese history which is great, but the lectures can still get boring at times. definitely has high expectations for students; you really have to analyze and think critically to get an a. can be a tough grader and kind of vague on what he wants but he def tries to help"
2092,539718,3.5,3.0,Bello is a good dude. Makes class entertaining and keeps the atmosphere loose.  Really smart guy and respects you if you learn his material and attend class diligently.  Wasn't really interested in Asian history beforehand but enjoyed the course.  Highly recommended.
2093,539718,3.0,2.0,"Lectures are pretty disjointed, but the class is pretty straight forward. Bello is a very cool guy though"
2094,539718,4.5,4.0,"really fantastic professor who is concerned with his students.  encourages the use of office hours and is very accommodating.  also, tells you what he really thinks, which is refreshing."
2095,539718,5.0,5.0,"Fun as Hell! But, Hard as Hell. He is so funny! I love Bello as much as I love my 62 inch plasma TV! He does not care much about memorization. He thinks it's really important to learn to think analytically. Also, he really cares about you. If you want to learn about the history of China, take his class. However, he is a harsh paper grader. If you "
2096,539718,5.0,3.0,"Extremely entertaining professor, you cannot fall asleep in his class. He doesnt care whether you memorize anything.  Tests are all open book open note. You also have weekly page long papers.  Everything in the class is analysis.  So if you aren't good at analyzing, don't take his class."
2097,1041478,3.0,3.0,"Eh.  Participate and you'll do fairly well, but she's not a fantastic teacher.  Very very very  helpful when it comes to papers, though.  Go to office hours."
2098,1969236,2.0,3.0,"Knowledgable but too caught up in his own goddess complex to effectively teach. He refuses to lecture, insisting instead that students ramble about topics they know little about. Student engagement replaces professorial guidance and engagement. He seems afraid to challenge students' ideas. He also didn't seem to listen to what students said."
2099,1969236,4.5,3.0," Really respectful of student opinions and wants you to succeed. Discussions are student led and open, mostly enjoyable. Lot's of reading but not unmanageable. Fair and constructive grader. Great experience overall. "
2100,1969236,4.5,3.0,"Very knowledgeable and approachable. Challenges you. Does not give a straight cut answer which can be frustrating, but helps you think."
2101,1969236,3.5,3.0,"Really friendly and wants to see his students succeed, easy to talk to.  Takes a long time to return papers.  Prompts are general and very open, which was frustrating because I like specific prompts.  "
2102,1969238,5.0,3.0,"Loved professor Michelson. Funny and knowledgeableclass was never really a bore at all. The day to day course load is pretty easy. However, the few large assignments will require solid work as your grade is dependent on them."
2103,1969238,5.0,3.0,"Take him! He tries to help students during office hours and is very clear with what he expects from you. Be ready for INTENSE reading needed to get a good grade in the class, but it's interesting. If you don't read or know how to answer questions in class about the readings, it'll definitely show.."
2104,1969238,3.0,4.0,"SPAN164 was... a lot. You'll get through it just fine with a pretty good grade, but if you haven't had Spanish in awhile, watch out. It's extremely fast-paced, and the professor is VERY inflexible if you need to miss class, even if you're sick and have a doctor's note. Plus, the textbook is outrageously expensive and all of the exams are online."
2105,1969238,5.0,2.0,"Professor Michelson is a great professor who encourages everyone to improve their Spanish without being too critical. I recommend him for Conversational Spanish because the class was super easy but I still improved due to his helpful feedback on oral exams and presentations. As long as you try to participate and improve, you will succeed."
2106,1969238,5.0,3.0,"Whoever gave Prof. Michelson an awful rating, ignore them.  He has reinvigorated my love for foreign languages after 14 years of bad Spanish teachers.  Every class had me feeling a thousand times better than when I entered.  If you see this man on a Spanish class you want/need to take, I have one piece of advice: take his class."
2107,1969238,5.0,3.0,Michelson is a really great and caring professor. He gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit and is very willing to work with you to improve your grade. His philosophy is that it's important to create a fun and relaxed environment in class so that it's easier to speak Spanish without worry. You don't have to be great at speaking to do well.
2108,1969238,1.5,3.0,"Honestly, one of the most pointless classes I took at this school. I thought I would be spending the semester focusing on medical terms and how to effectively communicate procedures to a Spanish-speaking patient (only 3 weeks), but we ended up focusing on bedside manner (in English) for the majority of the semester. It got VERY repetitive."
2109,1969238,4.0,3.0,Sweet professor. Very fair grader. Not hard to do well if you take the time to talk with him and work on improving your written spanish skills. 
2110,1668183,2.0,4.0,"Boring, not clear, hard, and extremely strict class attendance policy."
2111,148585,5.0,2.0,This guy is just plain awesome! He can make the hardest stuff understandable. I have never had a more patient and thorough professor who genuinely cares this much about how well we learn the material without losing our minds. Extremely hard class that would probably be impossible for me with anyone else teaching it
2112,148585,5.0,4.0,best math teacher i have ever had! he is incredibly nice and dedicated to helping his students. we are so lucky to have him here every winter and spring term- take him if you can!
2113,148585,5.0,3.0,"Prof Humke is brilliant, dedicated, and makes higher math survivable. Youre really lucky if you get to have a class with him"
2114,148585,4.5,3.0,"Oh Humke!  He is hysterical.  He is definitely out there, but the man can teach.  He makes statistics fun, as well as every class.  We had class MTWF and I don't think I ever went to class on Tuesday and STILL managed to get an A- in his course.  Do the work, learn the stuff, and it's a breeze.  Plus, he's just one awesome guy."
2115,148585,4.5,2.0,"He is an awesome professor.  So nice.  I had class MTWF, and I never go to Tuesday and still got a decent grade.  He really loves the subject that he teaches, which usually translates over to his students.  Real awesome guy"
2116,148585,5.0,2.0,This guy is the man.
2117,148585,5.0,2.0,Dr. Humke made me love math again! He is hands down one of the best profs at the university. he understands that not everyone is a math genius and is always willing to take time out to help you. He's an incredibly dynamic teacher. TAKE ONE OF HIS CLASSES!
2118,148585,5.0,2.0,The best math teacher I have ever had in my life. He is so nice and all he cares is that you know the concepts and not the stupid details. You have to work hard to do bad in this class because he always wants to help you and give you the best grade he can
2119,148585,4.0,2.0,"Incredibly nice guy, very understanding with scheduling tests, giving re-takes, etc.  If I actually did my homework, I think the class would have been a breeze."
2120,148585,4.5,1.0,"An incredibly easy visiting professor from Minnesota. Basically teaches concept calculus. It doesn't matter if you can do the math, you just have to know how to set it up. Still a very smart guy, with a great sense of humor!"
2121,2716784,5.0,3.0,Climate and Society was a fun class. Glad I took it. Lots of readings but the workload was manageable. She is always willing to meet and give really helpful feedback. 
2122,2716784,5.0,4.0,"I enjoyed this class a lot. While the textbook is dense and there are lots of homework, she gives clear and concise lectures and interesting examples related to current events. If you want to understand how economists see the world, this class is for you. Plus, she is a very caring and kind person that genuinely wants you to succeed. "
2123,2716784,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Zhang is super interested in what she teaches. Though the economic lessons are from the readings, she uses ""today events"" for examples. The lectures are just reviews from the book and can be long and boring, even though she doesn't have a monotone voice. Would I take this class again...? Likely not :("
2124,2716784,4.0,3.0,"She is extremely nice and keeps her class involved. You will especially love her if you enjoy the topic you're learning. However, the lectures can be boring at times."
2125,2716784,5.0,3.0,This is for Econ 100. Great Professor!
2126,2716784,5.0,5.0,tough class but worth the effort
2127,2716784,5.0,4.0,Great professor! This is my second course with Professor Zhang. Considering a double major in economics because of her.
2128,2716784,4.0,4.0,She did a great job of teaching a course that is dry because of the material. Class is pretty well structured. The one suggestion I have is to make this a 4 credit course with a mandatory lab. Evening Stata labs can be a drag.
2129,2716784,5.0,3.0,"Not one of those classes for an easy A. Professor cares about teaching and it shows. Just pay attention in class, go to office hrs and do the practice exams and you'll be fine. I like how she posts slides right after class so i can focus on understanding and not spending the entire time copying."
2130,2716784,5.0,5.0,Stats a hard class but the prof. makes it managable. learnt a lot and enjoyed the group project. Prof. always willing to meet outside of class. Clear expectations on grading. Some other comments below seem from those unwilling to put in the work.
2131,2716784,1.0,3.0,"Sadly, she is a relatively unreasonable and unfair grader. And she does not know that much about the material. Won't recommend her class."
2132,2716784,3.0,3.0,"Stats for Econ. Good teacher, but class is very lecture-heavy and very boring at times. Not super interactive, mainly just reading and copying down slides for the entire class period."
2133,347256,4.0,3.0,"Professor Brodie is very insightful and passionate about literature. We have really good discussions in her class, and she is very understanding in terms of extensions and she cares about her students' health."
2134,347256,4.0,4.0,"Professor Brodie is a great person. She makes clear what is expected from the students in order to get a good grade. The written papers are thoroughly revised, and she gives excellent feedback and lets you know what you've done wrong. The readings could get a little boring sometimes though."
2135,347256,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Brodie is great!! In Creative Writing Non-Fiction, we had to write four essays over the semester and were able to revise one for the final portfolio. It wasn't that challenging, but it was fun experimenting with different writing styles. I would definitely take her again. It's a great class to take with a heavy course load."
2136,347256,4.0,4.0,There are only 4 grades in the class (4 papers). But each of these papers goes through an extensive drafting/revision process. Dr. Brodie is clear with her expectations and great about helping you via email or office hours. You must definitely do the readings because she will call on you if you're quiet in discussion. A great intro writing class.
2137,347256,4.0,4.0,"Professor Brodie's Wicked Women course is great. Most of the readings are extremely interesting, and you end up reading more than is assigned. My writing improved immensely after taking her course. Moving your paper grades up a letter is extremely hard so knock it out of the park the first paper."
2138,347256,2.5,3.0,"How much you'll like Brodie depends on what you put into her class. She's a trove of knowledge and loves interacting with people with interesting ideas; however, if you want to sit and not read, she will get frustrated and likely grade your (30% each) papers more harshly. You don't need to be an English major- try a little and she gives a lot."
2139,347256,4.0,2.0,"Brodie is pretty nice, but not the most exciting. There is a lot of reading, but most if it is interesting. In order to do well on her papers, you have to cater to her preferences because she is very nitpicky, but for the most part she is clear in letting you know exactly what she wants. Overall, I would recommend her."
2140,347256,4.5,3.0,"Professor Brodie is a fantastic class to take if you want to prepare yourself for college writing. She's very persnickety, but she makes it clear what she wants in the drafts that you submit and she gives you pointers on how to improve your writing. Do exactly what the assignment says and don't forget any aspect or you can expect a big grade drop."
2141,347256,5.0,2.0,"She is great, kind of intimidating, but super knowledgeable and definitely improved my writing."
2142,347256,5.0,3.0,took wicked women with her. very smart and consistent prof. the class was fairly easy and had interesting discussion
2143,347256,4.5,2.0,Mellow class atmosphere& a relatively lenient grader; easy B or low A if you do all the reading and turn in thoughtful papers. Professor's very nice and definitely helps improve your writing.
2144,347256,3.0,1.0,"Took Brit Lit. If you're an AP English student coming in, it'll be impossible to get a C. You'll have to do the reading, and in general know what you are talking about. 2 papers 4 & 8 pages. Good pledgeship class to be honest. She's nice, but kinda off in her own world."
2145,347256,4.5,2.0,"Interesting class, she's always obsessed with her material. She asks for a lot of articles, and has a lot of pet peeves. You can't miss class for pretty much any reason, and she hates when people leave class to go to the bathroom or whatever. You need to do the reading because she'll call on you in class, and she demands a lot, but gives good tips."
2146,347256,5.0,2.0,"Pretty awesome writing class to start out school, definitely take wicked women if you are deciding on a wrt 100 class."
2147,347256,5.0,2.0,"Wicked Women. The class material is interesting but sometimes strange. Compared to other composition classes, her requirements (4 papers each 22%) with no tests and the other 8 % being class participation are not bad at all. She really cares about her students and will make you a better writer. I recommend her class"
2148,347256,5.0,2.0,"brilliant professor, also took her intro class, very generous grader, cares more about improvement than anything else, light reading compared to the other sections, she is the reason i am an english major"
2149,347256,4.5,2.0,"Took Wicked Women with her. Good class, wrote very nice things on my papers. Cares a lot. Made me want to be an english major. It is a lot of feminist lit, but she'll allow you to shoot it down without a problem. This is THE 105 class to take. Made an A. I will absolutely take her again."
2150,347256,4.0,2.0,"She's REALLY nice-- and definitely tried to get you engaged in discussion, and actually analyze what you're reading.  Papers are relatively easy to do, and she gives really helpful comments on the hand-back so you can improve.  If you really despise anything feminist, I wouldn't recommend the Wicked Women class though. :]"
2151,347256,5.0,2.0,VERY helpful.  Great thought provoking discussions on reading material I would not have otherwise explored.  Cares about effort and improvement more than perfect papers.  Would love to have again.
2152,347256,5.0,2.0,"This class was probably the reason I decided to major in English, I loved the laid back atmosphere and the free flowing discussions."
2153,347256,4.0,2.0,"Not an English person, and got an A in the class.  She always helped when I needed it, doesn't really tell you what symbolism, etc. etc., there is but makes you find it yourself."
2154,347256,5.0,2.0,"I took the Wicked Women course, and she was extremely helpful and engaging in class discussions. The great thing was that there were no tests, just five papers so the focus was on writing. The reading was very stimulating, and Brodie is a genuinely kind and fair professor. If you take the time to improve upon your papers, you will be rewarded."
2155,347256,3.5,2.0,"nice lady overall, married to Colonel Brodie at VMI"
2156,347256,3.0,3.0,"I took Wicked Women or as Brodie liked to call it &quot;Witches, ****es and ****s&quot;. Brodie isn't bad but she's not good. Kinda indifferent. No tests, just papers. Some of the books we read were really good others were horrible. Talks a lot about female sexuality."
2157,347256,5.0,2.0,I really enjoyed this class and I am not an English person. She made class interesting and you don't HAVE to do the readings to do well. The class set up is very laid back and allows you to voice your opinions and get to know your classmates. I wish I could have her again later.
2158,347256,3.5,3.0,Class can be kind of slow....not very good at leading class disscussions.  Isn't too bad of a grader but isn't too easy either.  Can't go wrong taking her class but wont be missing out on anything if you don't.
2159,347256,3.0,2.0,"Took Modern Love with her, she really is an easy B and a hard A. It was interesting though and I really enjoyed the readins she assigned. The trick to this class is to participate and make sure you take drafts to her and/or talk to her about papers. She does give you chances to improve your grade."
2160,347256,3.0,3.0,"kind of vague, easy B, hard A.  the class itself sucked--lots of fem lit and lots of her rambling"
2161,347257,2.0,4.0,"He is a really funny guy but a terrible grader. Even if he messes up on a test, you will not get credit for it. There have been multiple instances where he has made typos or messed up the answer key but he does not do anything about it. His lectures are often confusing and he goes off on tangents."
2162,347257,4.0,3.0,Dr. D is brilliant and he's not going to dumb stuff down. Lectures are fun. Pchem tests were impossible without going to office hours. But he's super helpful then. Just a quirky dude who kinda lives in his own little world but he's a good prof.
2163,347257,4.0,3.0,Desjardins was a pretty solid professor. He's a little scatterbrained and tends to talk about irrelevant things during class time which can make it hard to know when to pay attention. Very fair grader and wants you to succeed. Tests were pretty easy and no work outside of class besides studying the material.
2164,347257,5.0,3.0,"Desjardins is honestly great. He's been really accommodating during COVID with class attendance and Zooms. He gets off topic a lot, but you'll be fine if you go through the lectures and do the practice problems in the textbook. He offers a lot of good anecdotes in class and is very clear about what he wants. Tests are fair"
2165,347257,4.0,3.0,"GenChem required a lot of effort for me, but Desjardins is extremely accessible and cares a ton about his students. Great guy and a fair grader. His lectures were solid, gets on tangents though. His tests came straight from the cold tests - DO THEM (and the practice problems he assigns). Definitely the chillest workload out of the 3 GenChem profs."
2166,347257,3.0,4.0,the easiest out of the 3 gen chem profs. be prepared for tangents and he goes through the slides pretty quickly but if you ask questions he'll clarify. DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS AND COLD TESTS and you'll live. he is very straightforward about what will be on the test and sets a class day aside for office hours every week which is really helpful.
2167,347257,3.0,2.0,He's a super smart and funny dude. But he doesn't really know how to teach like you need to ask questions to get him to explain important concepts he won't just spill them out on his own. He jumps around a lot when he lectures. DO the cold test! I never opened the textbook and but had my own way of studying.
2168,347257,3.0,5.0,"Goes off topic every day, ends up teaching physical chem during gen chem and we dont understand what he is saying and then when the test comes around we have no clue what the gen chem topics are. Hes a genius and doesnt dumb things down. Super nice tho, and loves kids that come to office hours. He puts cold tests online which are helpful"
2169,347257,5.0,4.0,"Honestly, I love this teacher. I am taking this class for my major and I DO NOT recommend it for anyone trying to do it as an FDR. Desjardins is the best teacher ever and his sarcasm gets me on a personal level. He really cares about what he teaches and all of his students doing well. DO THE COLD TESTS AND HOMEWORK!!!"
2170,347257,5.0,4.0,Great Prof! Offers practice on material in txtbk but doesnt grade it. Tests are the main grade along with lab grade. STUDDDDDDDDY for tests and work txtbk prblms on own time and you can make A or B. If you need an FDR requirement THIS IS THE MAN! HANDS DOWN!No homework quizzes or lab rpts. Very vibrant in class and open to questions mid-lecture.
2171,347257,5.0,4.0,"His lectures a difficult to follow sometimes but Dr. D cares about his students.  If you pay attention in class and do the problems in the book he recommends, you can do well.  Make sure to do the Cold Tests a few times before each test and go to Office Hours."
2172,347257,3.5,3.0,"Amazing professor. He is very intelligent, and would sometimes go on tangents about material that was not relevant to the class. However, he usually would tell us what is and what is not relevant. He is very helpful during office hours and gives very fair tests. I would definitely take this class again. He is also hilarious and interesting."
2173,347257,3.0,3.0,"So if you're taking Chem 260 or 262, you probably don't have a choice. But in general, Desjardins just sort of rambles along and goes off into his own little happy land, which he warned us about in the first lecture. So be prepared to need to ask him to clarify lots of things. That being said, he's a very generous grader."
2174,347257,4.5,4.0,"He truly is a great person. He is available to people 24/7. The tests are hard, but modeled after the cold tests and book problems. He explains things well while moving at a reasonable pace."
2175,347257,4.0,2.0,"He knows the material well.  The essay questions on his tests were graded very unforgivingly. At the end of the term, he booted everyone's grade up one increment, unless you were at an A- or A, which I thought was unfair.  In other words, I had to work very hard to ace the final in order to get a legitimate A.  Overall 3/5 might take again."
2176,347257,4.5,2.0,"I took the course, thinking it would be a painless way to knock off my lab requirement.  However, Dr. D turned out to be just the type of chem professor everyone wants: funny, very clear in his lectures, and extremely available.  Tests are a bit difficult, but if you study the lecture material, especially Pleva's notes, they're pretty easy."
2177,347257,2.5,5.0,"Very difficult, not helpful"
2178,347257,5.0,3.0,"Like many, I took this because it was an easy way to fill the requirement, but Prof. Desjardins rocked.  I happen to love Chemisty, so maybe that's why it seemed like an easy class, but I think Desjardins just has a great way of explaining everything clearly.  Very funny guy."
2179,347257,4.0,3.0,"Ditto what the guy before me said.  Desjardins is the ONLY reason Chem 112 is tolerable.  Really interesting lectures, particularly when they follow Dr. Pleva's."
2180,347257,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Desjardins is the only reason Chem 112 is remotely tolerable.  He is very intelligent in multiple areas (in undergrad he was a chem/philosophy double major) fun to talk to in his office...don't be intimidated, he is really a nice guy."
2181,347257,5.0,3.0,He's a great professor and extremely interesting
2182,564355,5.0,2.0,"Class is a 5000 word paper, a midterm, and a final. The exams are both open book open note. He's a really easy grader. As long as you're citing stuff in your papers you'll be good. He's a really nice old guy and his lectures are kinda interesting. You don't really have to do the reading but you need the books to cite on the exams."
2183,564355,5.0,2.0,"Come to each lecture, go to office hours and you'll be A okay."
2184,564355,5.0,3.0,"Very knowledgeable about what he teaches, which makes talking to him very interesting. Be prepared to read a lot for his class. Very sweet Professor!"
2185,564355,4.0,2.0,Solid
2186,564355,2.0,2.0,"Ask him a question only if you want a tangential lecture.  Has a bad attitude towards students who don't suck up to him and lacks a sense of humor.  Condescending, unpleasant.  I received these impressions from a study abroad course; he may be different in a classroom setting.  Don't travel with him."
2187,564355,4.5,1.0,"the nicest man EVER! he's very respectful and understanding. his class was really interesting, and he knows about his subject thoroughly. the best part - the class isn't difficult!"
2188,564355,3.5,2.0,"Good professor, really loves and knows the materials he teaches"
2189,564355,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Jasiewicz is a cool guy. Pretty easy and very knowledgeable. His English is a little hard to understand at times, but if you listen carefully, it is well worth it. As a researcher, he is extremely well respected and played a key role in democratizing Poland. Very polite and nice to students."
2190,277641,2.0,3.0,She goes off topic a lot and it is difficult to pay attention for the entire class because she has such a loose class structure. 
2191,277641,5.0,4.0,"She's an amazing professor. I took her global politics class, and it was excellent. She's a really animated lecturer, and gets the class involved in discussion the entire time. Not many big assignments, but she grades fair . Dismiss other reviews complaining about her politics, she won't rub it in your face. 10/10 prof, would recommend."
2192,277641,5.0,4.0,"I was a horrible student in college and Robin Leblanc was one of the few professors able to really coach and mentor me. I managed an A out of her during one of the most dysfunctional times in my life. I had to work to get praise from her but it was worth it. Although I work in a completely different industry, her mentoring made me an activist."
2193,277641,5.0,4.0,"Prof LeBlanc is dope. She is knowledgable, follows a logical progression of coursework for the class and discussion of the individual readings. Has high expectations, but work a little and they are easy to meet. Listen in class. Participate in discussion. READ. She wants students to understand material and encourages questions. highly recommend."
2194,277641,2.0,4.0,Sometime lectures are long-winded and very unclear.
2195,277641,3.5,4.0,"Extremely knowledgeable, definitely knows what she's talking about.  The class is a lot of work but it's worth it.  Encourages independent thinking and questions.  I am definitely taking another one of her classes."
2196,277641,3.0,3.0,Solid professor. Do the reading and participate in discussion and you'll get a B or an A. Don't fall behind or you will fail the midterm/final.
2197,277641,1.5,3.0,Feedback is confusing and unclear. Usually takes a long time to grade papers or respond to questions. Lectures are typically frazzled and all over the place.
2198,277641,3.5,2.0,"Engaging and passionate about the topic, lectures are hard to follow at times"
2199,277641,4.0,4.0,Great teacher. Negative reviewers are projecting their own biases.
2200,277641,2.0,3.0,"Class is hard. She is slightly intimidating. No real structure to the lectures. No structure even to the discussion. Focuses on minor details rather than main points. Nice lady, just a hard teacher."
2201,277641,3.5,2.0,"Went into the class thinking the professor would be a hardcore feminist and a tough person to relate to. Totally the opposite. Great professor, interesting class, really friendly, understanding, and the professor is really engaging. Only downside is that her lectures are a little disjointed and sometimes hard to follow."
2202,277641,2.5,4.0,"Was initially planning to major in politics. Not anymore. She is a very difficult grader, which may be my choice of conservative topics, or just that she refuses to give out A's. Not really sure. Either way, unless you want to do hours of work for a mediocre grade don't take her class."
2203,277641,1.5,3.0,"This professor has a bad reputation, and I went into class with a very open mind. I can learn about feminist interpretations of global politics, but I have a problem when a teacher's bias is focused on the individual students of the class. If you so much as resemble a white, conservative, male - your grade will not reflect your merit in the class."
2204,277641,2.5,3.0,Not as bad as previous reviews entail. Her lectures don't have much organization because she wants to use discussion to run class. Do the reading and be respectful you will do well. You have to get used to her teaching style but once you do her class isn't that bad.
2205,277641,1.0,2.0,"Her class is more about womens rights than global politics. She is unorganized, returned tests a month after we took them, and her lectures were all over the place."
2206,277641,1.0,4.0,Horrible professor. Speaks like she's on amphetamines and her lectures have no structure. This class turned me off from politics.
2207,277641,1.0,5.0,She is a terrible teacher. There is no structure to her lectures and women's rights is too much of a focus. I have learned basically nothing about global politics. If you are white and a male good luck getting through this class.
2208,277641,5.0,4.0,"Very polarizing, probably because she's very outspoken and opinionated.  If that doesn't bother you, her lectures and discussion can be very engaging and she doesn't let people get away with ****ting through class. If you raise your hand and say something, be prepared to back it up or explain your opinion.  Would take her class again."
2209,277641,4.5,4.0,"Wonderful professor. She is passionate about what she teaches, and is extremely helpful so long as you want to learn. Don't take her class if you just want to get an A she won't appreciate it, nor will most of the other people who take her class. Discussion is huge."
2210,277641,3.0,4.0,I hated this class but mostly because I didn't like the reading.  It's more of a philosophy class than a politics class.  Professor LeBlanc was really nice - not as feminist as some people claim her to be.  OK grader on papers.  Difficult to get an A.
2211,277641,5.0,2.0,"Good class. I'd recommend her. Very helpful on your papers. The course consists of reading and discussion. She has a bad reputation that is somewhat exaggerated.  She does lean a bit to the feminist side, but she's not too overzealous. I'd say she favors more independent thought; don't come off as a jerk. Class discussions can be a lot of fun."
2212,277641,2.5,4.0,"No organization to class whatsoever, don't say anything remotely conservative...she hates the world (especially W&L students)...i guess you would like her if you like asian studies&#63;&#63;&#63; but for the most part the class is not worth taking.  she offends me."
2213,277641,4.0,3.0,"rather hard for this class-make sure you participate. she is kind of a picky grader on papers and takes forever to return them. she is nice but very very liberal. she likes to get really into hand motions and dancing around the classroom sometimes, which can be interesting. i like her as a person but im not taking her clases again."
2214,277641,3.0,3.0,I wrote what I feel is the worst research paper I have ever written and still got a pretty good grade.  I can't help but suspect my choice of a topic important to feminism had something to do with it.
2215,277641,2.5,4.0,"It doesn't matter if you're liberal. If you're a white male, watch what you say in her class."
2216,277641,3.0,3.0,"She cares about her subject matter. She cares that students care. She won't accept unexamined opinions. She thinks writing matters, women are the equals of men, and that good arguments are what college is all about."
2217,277641,4.5,3.0,She always seemed very open-minded in comparative politics.  I admire her enthusiasm and obvious love of politics.
2218,277641,1.0,4.0,won't say hi to you if you are a male
2219,277641,5.0,2.0,Great teacher. I can't see the feminist thing. She's very neutral while studying comparative politics; I wouldn't recommend her for political philosophy. Great person who's very understanding.
2220,277641,1.5,2.0,She knows her stuff alright and then keeps reminding you just how much more intelligent she is than you.
2221,277641,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Leblanc knows her stuff! She engages the class and is excited about the topic, which makes class really enjoyable..."
2222,277641,1.5,4.0,Feminist manifesto.  Beware if you disagree.
2223,277641,3.0,4.0,Consider yourself warned if you have a ****.  Seems pissed off at the world or at least the white males in her class.
2224,277641,1.5,3.0,"Pissed off at the world, angry at students, especially males.  If you can fit into her view of the world, you'll be fine.  If not, be perared for humiliation."
2225,277641,2.0,4.0,She seems to hate her job and students.
2226,277641,2.0,2.0,This is supposed to be a political philosophy class.  This professor makes it a feministic literature in translation class.  Avoid this professor like the plague unless you are willing to put up with mountains of mental torment for a grade between B- and
2227,1932426,5.0,1.0,THE EASIEST CLASS!! SHE MADE Philosophy so enjoyable and was super nice always
2228,1932426,4.0,3.0,Thumbs Up!
2229,1932426,4.0,3.0,"Didn't just lecture every class.  Moved class outside whenever weather allowed it.  Always rephrased when a student did not understand.  Was always willing to meet with students to discuss papers, and was pretty flexible about deadlines.  You definitely have to do the reading, though."
2230,277646,5.0,3.0,"First, he is a really good professor. Second, he is hilarious. All tests are open book, but can be challenging. He is a really nice person who cares about students. If you are lucky to get him you will do very well."
2231,277646,5.0,2.0,"I took him for Art of Mathematical Thinking and absolutely loved it. He's hilarious, and didn't give us any tests. If you did the homework and showed up, you were fine. Tons of fun origami projects. You never really knew what you were gonna do when you got there, but that honestly made it so much more fun. TAKE HIM for your FDR."
2232,277646,5.0,2.0,"Had him for multivariable. He was so great. If you did the homework, you basically knew the test. He was so nice and so affirming but he would also know if you didn't go to class so you should still go. He's awesome. One of the best professors in the department."
2233,277646,4.0,2.0,"Easiest math class I've ever taken. Fell asleep in lectures several times because they're disengaging, but he's somewhat funny and always shows a video. Also, homework is worth 40% of your final grade, there's extra credit for neatness on homework and tests (print everything!) and all homework is group homework. If you read the book you'll be fine."
2234,277646,4.0,1.0,"This class only had 5 open book tests and a final worth less than each test. He really wants his students to do well in the class, and most students at this level were already motivated to learn the subject on their own. I really enjoyed his class, despite lectures being a little boring. Attendance was optional, but it helps understanding imo."
2235,277646,5.0,2.0,"Amazing Professor. Really funny and chill. Take his class. Such a nice guy too and he is always available for office hours. Best math teacher I have had so far. Material is hard in the class, but he makes it not that hard with teaching style and help"
2236,277646,5.0,2.0,"Easy grader... Even if you mess up an entire 35 point question, he will probably only take off 2 points. Tests are exactly like homework. Shows videos everyday and has the driest sense of humor but frequently makes jokes. Love the guy"
2237,277646,5.0,1.0,He is the best!!!!!! I love him.
2238,277646,5.0,3.0,"McRae is the best! I would take his class again and again if I could! Homework is hard, but if you do the homework you will be very prepared for the tests. Cracks jokes in class and makes it interesting to learn. Loved the class!"
2239,277646,5.0,2.0,"McRae is the best. He's super casually hilarious so always listen to what he is saying. I'm not a huge math person but he was always very helpful in office hours. The test questions are literally taken right off of the homework, so if you do the homework, you're pretty good to go."
2240,277646,4.5,2.0,"McRae is the man. A god among a fallow land of math professors. He honestly made me consider majoring in math. He is hilarious and goofy. Homework was kinda hard. GO TO OFFICE HOURS: so helpful and you will get so much more out of the class and him if you do. Also, all the test problems come from hmwk. Great professor. McRae is love. McRae is life."
2241,277646,3.5,4.0,"McRae is a good guy. If you go to his office hours he'll a) give you great help for tests and b) talk about his farmpigs for however long you want to do so. There are only FOUR tests worth 25% each (no midterm or final), so make sure you don't bomb the first one and have to play catch up all term. This is what I did, and I just barely got a B. "
2242,277646,5.0,1.0,"McRae is awesome. He is such an easy grader and gives lots of partial and extra credit. He teaches very slowly, so sometimes the class gets boring, but it makes it easy to follow. The test problems come straight from the homework, so it is easy to do well. He is also very laid back and helpful in office hours. I would definitely recommend him. "
2243,277646,4.0,2.0,McRae is the man.
2244,277646,3.5,1.0,"If you haven't taken Calc. in over a year don't take this class because you need to remember the basics. However, it is very straighforward. Your only graded on tests, and all of the problems come straight from the HW so there are no surprises. McCrae is also a great quirky guy and very helpful in office hours."
2245,277646,5.0,1.0,McRae is crystal clear and a genius. He relates the mathematical material with its history and philosophical concepts which helps in the understanding of the subject. His tests are based on homework and he gives lots of partial credit-easy.
2246,277646,4.5,3.0,So sweet and really wants you to do well. great at explaining
2247,277646,3.5,2.0,He is hilarious! Gives lots of extra points on tests for partial credit or neatness. Also gives opportunities to get extra points during class. Could not have asked for a better teacher for calc
2248,277646,2.5,4.0,Class was a mixed bag. He looks for reasons to dock points. Doesn't care if the student understands the concept or gets the answer right if they don't execute the problem just so. Leaves rude comments on tests. I learned more from the text book than from the lectures. But he gives points for neatness. And he's pretty funny. Go to office hours.
2249,277646,5.0,2.0,"A rare sort of professor who can even interest someone who hates calculus! He is really funny and loves the subject, and even though the class is based only on 6 tests, he gives generous partial credit and &quot;neatness points&quot; for neat handwriting. Overall, the subject is rough but the professor is great"
2250,277646,5.0,2.0,"I love McRae!  He is adorable (in the old man sort of way), makes witty comments, and keeps you engaged during class.  He is very clear and willing to explain things that you don't understand.  If you need extra help he is available during office hours.  Although your grade is based completely on six tests, he gives a lot of partial credit."
2251,277646,3.5,4.0,He knows what he is talking about. He has a funny sense of humor which i found hilarious. The subject was hard he did the best he did to explain things. Overall good experience and would take another class with him
2252,277646,3.0,5.0,"Boring, clearly knows what he is doing but isn't great at making sure that you know what you are doing, and quite honestly doesn't really care, which poses a problem if you aren't self motivated.  Nice guy though."
2253,277646,1.5,5.0,"&quot;Go home and think about it.&quot; -McRae. He clearly knows what he's teaching, but becomes so consumed by a combination of math history and his ego that he doesn't get around to teaching the material you need to know. Even when you ask him relevant questions, he brushes them off (he actually said the quote in class). AB sub-5 BC-4=barely passing."
2254,277646,5.0,3.0,Explain things very well and make witty comments.
2255,277646,4.5,4.0,He is a really nice guy and does a good job teaching tough material. He seems to really care about you learning the material if you go to his office hours. I never had AP Calc and just tested in to it- but can keep up. Just do the homework.
2256,277646,2.0,5.0,"Professor McRae becomes so consumed by teaching math history and bragging about his intelligence that he fails to teach the material. Also, his exams are absurdly hard. The class average for the three we've taken so far has been a 70, 77, and 71. I got a 5 on the AP Calc AB score and a 4 on the BC subscore, and I'm barely passing math 102 (BC calc)"
2257,277646,3.0,5.0,"He is an interesting and fun guy - very smart too.  However, he really is not very good at teaching and ends up testing you on a lot of abstract conceptual stuff that you never really learned.  If you don't mind suffering through the tests..."
2258,277646,3.5,2.0,"Very conceptual in his teach style.  Really good for students who are familiar and interested in the &quot;philosophy&quot; of math.  Definately not a plug-and-chug kind of math prof. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!!  If he feels that your trying, he'll grade easier."
2259,277646,5.0,4.0,"He is so awesome!  I seriously loved his silly puns, and he is so easy to talk to."
2260,277646,5.0,2.0,"He makes math entertaining and interesting.  He's very clear with what he expects on homework and tests, and encourages office visits.  I highly recommend this professor."
2261,277646,5.0,2.0,phenomenal teacher
2262,277646,5.0,3.0,"McRae, simply put, is the man. If I could be half as cool as McRae, I'd be that much cooler."
2263,277646,5.0,3.0,"The man knows everything!  Physics, math, literature, philosophy...and he's personable and interesting too.  Not to mention how his corny jokes and love of the Simpsons makes him so likeable.  Take any class with him and you will be a fan too."
2264,277646,5.0,2.0,"McRae is simply amazing. I love this guy. Very few professors let me joke around. He not only allows it, but joins in. He loves wit and has a good one himself. Very helpful outside of class. Tests are very upfront. Take his class, do the homework, get your A. LOVE THIS GUY!"
2265,277646,5.0,3.0,"This guy is unreal he's so cool.  Interesting, informed, and approachable, he's one of the best profs in the school."
2266,277646,4.5,2.0,"Prof. McRae is AWESOME!  He gives tons of extra credit and lots of hints on harder problems!  He's really nice and makes some very corny, yet funny jokes. Definitely take his class because he'll do his best to make sure you pass w/ a good grade..he wants you to succeed! (Only one hard test all sem.)"
2267,277646,5.0,3.0,"McRae is the man, laid back class atmosphere, very personable--tough A, pretty easy B"
2268,277646,5.0,3.0,dude he is the best ever
2269,277646,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2270,277646,5.0,2.0,"McCrae is by far the funniest math professor in the world, assuming you are like me and love random humor a la homestarrunner.com.  He is a great guy and his teaching style is clear and strong.  If McCrae is teaching a course, register immediately."
2271,1555604,5.0,3.0,Great course with an amazing professor. Useful material with lots of real world relevance.  
2272,1555604,5.0,3.0,Great professor!
2273,1555604,5.0,5.0,"Dr Davies is the best Economics professor I have ever had. He is very dedicated to his students and is willing to spend time explaining a concept until it is understood. He does a great job of making the theory relevant to the real world with examples. I plan on taking Davies again. And it doesn't hurt that he's easy on the eyes and charming, too."
2274,1555604,5.0,3.0,Great Professor!!
2275,1555604,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic Professor, incredibly intelligent, my favorite professor at WLU. Also available and is very approachable.  I've taken two classes with him, plan to take more."
2276,1555604,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Davies is really helpful in his office hour. He explains really well in class. Midterm was 30% of the grade. Some people screwed it up because it was redemptive, which means if you do better in final, the final takes 75% of your grade. The only question I have for him: why did you make the final so hard?? Be careful!"
2277,1555604,5.0,3.0,"Davies did a really great job explaining the material and connecting everything together, and he was always on top of what we were supposed to be doing. He managed to keep complex topics and stuff that could be confusing more light and straightforward.  When anyone mentions to me that they have to take macro, I always recommend Davies."
2278,1555604,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Davies is a very intelligent economist, and a very effective teacher. Although the material was not always super interesting, he was very knowledgeable about the subject and made it about as engaging as he could have."
2279,1555604,5.0,3.0,"Very smart and very approachable. Sometimes very smart professors have difficulty teaching simple concepts, but that was not the case here. Very effective teaching using step by step approach and plenty of examples!"
2280,1555604,2.5,3.0,"Somewhat easy teacher. Lectures were confusing, much easier just to read the book. Have to participate a lot for him to even know who you are. "
2281,1555604,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Davies actually managed to make some topics that were clearly dry by nature, interesting. He is a great guy, with a lot of patience, and he truly cares about your ""learning experience"". His tests are straightforward, he has plenty of resources and although some of the material might be messy by nature, he will clarify any doubts you may have."
2282,1555604,3.5,2.0,Though he was sick when I had him (and the powerpoints could get boring) the upside was that you can always relisten to the lectures online- since they were recorded.
2283,1555604,2.5,2.0,"He was sick at the time I had him, so most of the class revolved around his prerecorded powerpoints. As you can expect, this was a tad boring. Probably not great for nonecon lovers."
2284,777377,4.0,4.0,The topics were definitely tough but very manageable by reading the textbook and either attending lecture or watching his Yuja. Tests quite difficult.
2285,777377,1.0,5.0,"Genuinely one of the worst profs Ive had at W&amp;L. His lectures are all over the place, he explains things in a confusing way, then grades the tests harshly. Every word he says is fair game for the test, even though it will feel like hes just going off on a tangent. Pay attention in class if you have him, but I would recommend taking other profs"
2286,777377,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Cabe is an extremely intelligent and interesting professor, but he is also one of the more difficult I've had. You need to pay full attention at every lecture, and the textbook will be one of your best friends by the end of the term. Overall, he is a great professor, but this is set back by his sheer level of difficulty."
2287,777377,4.0,3.0,"Cabe is a great guy--he definitely challenges you, but he wants the best for his students and you learn a lot in his classes. If you're good at science, you're guaranteed an A, but even if you aren't, he'll work with you if you ask for help. Go to all the lectures and take good notes and you'll thrive in this class."
2288,777377,4.0,4.0,"Professor Cabe definitely makes you work for your grade. Tests are very challenging, but not unfair. He does not surprise you with curveballs on the tests, but you must know the material very well. He can be unclear during lectures sometimes because he goes pretty fast, but very helpful during office hours."
2289,777377,2.5,4.0,"His lectures are very long and he's very monotone and didactic. If you ask for help, he will try to help but he's not very clear about stuff. The tests are HARD."
2290,777377,3.5,4.0,Genetics was content based. You need to remember a lot of stuf. I had an 8 am class which made me lose interest very quickly. DO NOT TAKE 8 am class!
2291,777377,2.0,4.0,"The tests are lengthy and detailed, expect all types of questions (MC, fill in the blank, open response) and reading is necessary to have a complete understanding even though he says nothing he doesn't discuss in class will be on the tests. He grades subjectively with no clear rubric (keys are highest score tests). 4 tests and a cumulative final."
2292,777377,2.0,5.0,"For an intro class, this was extremely difficult. Not at all what I was prepared for when all of the other into bio classes were much more general and overall easier. Don't take unless you're planning on taking the non-intro level genetics class!"
2293,777377,2.5,4.0,"Very uninspiring professor. He is brilliant but not very helpful. It takes several days to get a simple email back from him. His tests are incredibly challenging, so you can't enter the class unwilling to study. The lab felt like a waste of time because we spent so much of it sitting around with no idea what we were doing as an overall project."
2294,777377,3.0,5.0,"If you are looking for an intro bio class and see that he is teaching, do not take it. Is the hardest intro bio class and the rest are easy. Test are extremely hard, so there is a big curve but not worth the effort."
2295,777377,4.5,5.0,"Genetics is a very challenging class with Cabe, but he is a very clear, knowledgeable, helpful professor. If you attend class and do the readings as well as use the online resources he provides, you can do well in this class. He's a great, engaging professor!"
2296,777377,3.5,4.0,REALLY GREAT!  He's clear and very intelligent.  Love all of his classes!
2297,777377,5.0,4.0,Very clear in his presentation of the material. No surprises on his tests. His tests are tough but if you study a lot and pay attention in class you can do well.
2298,777377,4.0,5.0,Definitely taking his class next term!
2299,777377,4.5,5.0,Really great teacher and very clear about what is going to be on the tests.
2300,777377,2.5,5.0,he was not very helpful. i had to email him quite a few times to get any response. his tests are extremely hard. i was shocked to see how highly he was rated on this site after talking to others so many other people in my class that had negative experiences. must read the book extremely thoroughly.
2301,777377,1.5,5.0,"he is difficult and pretty much unwilling to be helpful. i went into his office regularly to discuss material from class and he generally seemed irritated and like i was bothering him. i would be friendly towards him and he would give me minimal response back, sometimes completely ignoring me. speaking for me and the rest of my class, dont take him"
2302,777377,4.5,4.0,"Very good teacher, if your willing to put forth the effort to succeed he is willing to help. Took multiple classes from him. he is an encyclopedia of knowledge. And an all around nice guy. Take the Lab it will help with the class"
2303,777377,5.0,3.0,"P. Cabe is an amazingly brilliant, insightful, and thorough teacher. He is NOT easy, but do not confuse a hard teacher for a bad one. He is very helpful during his office hours, and readily available to help. It is difficult to do well if you are not willing to put in a lot of hard work, but you will learn a lot."
2304,777377,5.0,1.0,Friendly
2305,777377,3.5,5.0,"Dr. Cabe is very nice! Sometimes he seems to drone, but class is after lunch :) Tests are hard and information is dense, but he is 100% willing to sit down and help show you what and how to study. There has been no problem asking questions in my class. Its a difficult class. But Dr. Cabe is really cool."
2306,777377,5.0,2.0,"Decent teacher.  Tests are fairly easy as long as the questions are clear, which they sometimes aren't."
2307,777377,5.0,2.0,"Okay teacher.  Paying attention in class is kind of important, but he always gives you a study guide before the test with everything on it.  Tests aren't that bad."
2308,777377,2.0,5.0,"I think that Paul might be a nice guy deep down, but he has always been very rude to me in class when I ask questions.  No one else asks questions even if they are confused like I often am, so he tends to get annoyed and make somewhat snide remarks implying that I'm just stupid.  He also seems to grade my tests harder than others because of this."
2309,777377,3.0,5.0,"I have mixed feelings about Cabe.  On one side, he's a really nice guy who is passionate about what he teaches.  On the other hand, this class has been the most difficult I've taken so far, and has a very large reading load.  Cabe tries to make himself very accessable, but with a class of around 90, it was almost impossible to get office hours"
2310,777377,4.0,4.0,"I'm a big Cabe fan.  The material is complex, but he really tries to help students understand it.  He explains things fairly well and is highly receptive to questions.  Tests are lengthy.  He is, by no means easy, but he's a good teacher and a very considerate guy. Plus - he loves to work with the students and really tries to get to know you."
2311,777377,1.0,5.0,Not a good teacher and tests are rediculously unfair. and with a class average of 75% he doesnt curve at all
2312,777377,4.0,3.0,He's adorable and he is a very good professor
2313,777377,4.5,2.0,"Good teacher who knows a lot about all aspects of genetics. Seems to be happy to teach an intro bio class on his favorite topic. His tests are long, but after the first one you realize how to take them fast. He gives study guides for every test which helps you weed out the info you don't need. I recommend reading and highlighting the book, as well."
2314,535716,5.0,3.0,I love professor Greer with all of my heart. She changed my education for the better.
2315,535716,3.0,5.0,"Many sing her praises... she is brilliant, cool, and encourages critical thinking. The material was great. The lab days out were fun. However, if you don't like group work, or can't stand disorganization to a level where the syllabus was invalid by the first week... I don't know. Everyone struggled, even the smarter students. Proceed with caution."
2316,535716,5.0,3.0,Geology is the best lab credit class here and Professor Greer should be the one you take to get the credit. She is awesome as well as the class as the lab days are like going on field trips where you break rocks and look at mountains.
2317,535716,5.0,4.0,Professor Greer is awesome. The labs days are like field trips as we went into the mountains on hikes to collect fossils and look at rocks. The tests we took were difficult and would require studying but the lab days are worth it.
2318,535716,4.0,3.0,"She is extremely helpful and fair, but she is still tough. If you put the work in and go to her during office hours a lot, you can do well."
2319,535716,4.0,4.0,A lot harder and a lot more material than I thought there would be. Greer is enthusiastic and class usually goes by quickly. Demands a lot of random outside work and assignments. A lot of work and not an easy FDR requirement.
2320,535716,5.0,3.0,I took Lisa's into class just to get my gen ed out of the way and she made me fall in love with the subject.  I am now in her 240 course which is awesome.  You can tell she LOVES what she teaches.  It is because of Lisa that I am going to be a geo major here at W&L and I am going to take any class I can with her (cant wait for 330 next fall)
2321,535716,5.0,4.0,"Lets face it Lisa is the epitome of what a professor should be. She loves the material she teaches and make you love it whether you realize it or not. She is extremely approachable and will answer any question(s) or just shoot the breeze. She is not a robot professor, she is actually a caring person! TAKE HER CLASS IMMEDIATELY."
2322,535716,3.5,4.0,No Comments
2323,535716,5.0,4.0,She's great. Don't be late and don't skip - she's fair and works with you as long as you show interest and talk to her ahead of time with any conflicts. Super nice and funny!
2324,535716,5.0,4.0,"The full package: bright, motivated, cares. Who says being a prof is all about publishing -- this one actually teaches! Wish I had a need for more geology courses."
2325,535716,4.5,3.0,"Lisa really made the class fun! She is easy to approach and really wants all her students to do well. I would really reccommend this class to anyone who enjoys going hiking, caving, and enduring cold weather. We did all of the above in order to look at rocks, but it made the labs a lot more fun. She is a genuinely nice person."
2326,535716,5.0,4.0,"This class isn't as easy as i thought it would be, but Greer is really excited about her subject and tries to make that rub off on you. She knows her stuff really well and if you're not a science person this is a good way to get your GE done, but you'll have to work a bit. She's also a nice person (had us over to her house for lunch after class)."
2327,535716,5.0,4.0,"Lisa rocks!!  She's the best professor I had at W&L!!! I recommend her to everyone!! BTW, the Food lion field trip is done in every geo class because it is the only place in the county that has that geological feature so well exposed..."
2328,535716,4.5,3.0,"Great professor. Goes out of her way to help students...definitely wants to make sure they learn. don't expect it to be a &quot;rock for jocks&quot; class that will be super easy. you will have to do work for it, especially around test time... would recommend her classes."
2329,535716,3.0,3.0,"She's really nice, but I don't like her as a professor.  She's sort of a neo-hippy and realyl into being in the field, but I don't ever feel as if I have a strong sense of what is going on, so overall she's just mediocre to me, but some people may like her laissez faire style of teaching."
2330,535716,1.0,4.0,This is the worst teacher I have ever had.  She ruined geology for me.  I also have her as an advisor and she is terrible.  Aviod her at all costs.
2331,535716,3.5,2.0,"Good prof, sometimes unclear. Wants you to learn by thinking things out yourself; can be frustrating when she won't answer questions.Lectures are organized & clear, though it is very annoying when she tells you what to write down in your notes.  Great class though, we have got to a lot of gorgeous places in the area. Learn a lot about the area."
2332,535716,1.0,5.0,"Like standing outside in the rain while right by the river when its 20 degrees outside&#63; I thought this class was pure torture. We live in a beautiful region with tons of rock formations that would be cool to go too. But no, our field trips went behind the Food Lion. Don't take this class with Greer!"
2333,535716,3.5,3.0,No Comments
2334,185511,2.0,4.0,He grades his papers way too difficult for a 100-level history class 
2335,185511,5.0,3.0,"I am very lucky to have taken a class with Professor Bidlack. He is truly an excellent professor. If you put in serious effort and participate actively you will do well. He is crystal clear on what he expects and very organized. He may be retiring soon, but I hope he stays for a while longer. Really cares about his students. "
2336,185511,5.0,2.0,Professor Bidlack is very knowledgeable and friendly. He is a fair grader and his class is very straightforward. The readings for his class were interesting and there was not a ton of homework. I definitely look forward to taking another one of his classes!
2337,185511,5.0,2.0,Bidlack is a fair grader and very knowledgeable. He assigns a good bit of reading and does not give a lot of concrete homework. Participate in class and regurgitate material and you'll do well.
2338,185511,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Bidlack's great!  You can tell how interested he is in Russian and Soviet history.  Like others here have said he can be repetitive in his lectures.  Real fair grader, though, if you put the effort in to research your topics.  Get him in a smaller class if you can."
2339,185511,4.0,1.0,Loves European History. If you read the assigned chapters and regurgitate you will do fine. Lectures get boring at times
2340,185511,5.0,2.0,"He is my favorite professor.  I didn't think I would be interested in Russian history before I had him, but he makes it fun and is reasonable about workload.  He just seems to know everything and infuses lecture with many fun facts and anecdotes.  Great professor."
2341,185511,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bidlack is a great teacher. He's very enthusiastic about the subject material and his self-deprecating sense of humor is really funny. One of the few teachers to admit they don't know an answer to a question asked in class--and then research the answer for the next class! Great teacher, fair grader, and a good guy."
2342,185511,1.5,5.0,Worst and most ignorant grader i have even encountered.
2343,185511,4.5,3.0,Professor Bidlack is great.  I highly reccomend his Soviet History class.  He's a little repetitive in his lectures but tells great stories that make the history come alive.  He's kind and approachable and loves to teach!  He's very willing to help students who come to him but he may not go out of his way to offer.
2344,185511,4.5,4.0,"Very interesting lectures, interesting books, hard grader on papers. Geography test is absurdly hard"
2345,185511,4.5,4.0,"Great professor to have as a freshman, wants to make the transition into college a good one. Must do the reading, lectures are boring and repeat everything in the reading. Participation heavily graded. Only two big assignments- a mid term in class essay and a final exam (2 timed essays)."
2346,185511,4.5,3.0,"Bidlack's really helpful. If you have a question, he'll go so far out of the way to find the answer for you. Classes were usually very interesting. He knows everything about Russia. Make sure you actually read and understand the text for the text quizzes. If you do everything for the class, it's really not bad."
2347,185511,3.0,2.0,"As a History lover, it pains me to truly hate this man. He's clearly very intelligent, but his paper requirements work against intellectual thinking and independent thought. Do anything but repeat what he says in class and your grade suffers. All this on top of his tendency to play favorites and his dry, overly regimented lecture format."
2348,185511,4.0,4.0,The textbook readings take a while because you have to read it multiple times to understand it as thouroughly as you need to for his quizzes.  Lectures were boring...
2349,185511,5.0,3.0,Enjoyed his lectures...you can tell he loves history.  not to hard to make an A...very fair grader.
2350,185511,4.5,3.0,Really nice prof. Very knowledgeable and has done a lot of research. Helpful to students who approach him outside of class.
2351,185511,2.0,4.0,most boring person ever
2352,185511,5.0,4.0,Loved the Map Quiz! Professor Bidlack is great.

2355,1375400,2.5,4.0,This prof. is easily my least favorite prof. at WnL. Something about him just doesn't sit well with me. He's impossible to please work wise and a hard grader. It's safe to say I will never take a class with him again.
2356,1375400,2.0,3.0,"Nice guy, but does not belong at W&L. Does not understand what teaching is and grading is completely subjective."
2357,1375400,2.0,5.0,"Nice guy, but very unreasonable grader. Only 3 grades (30%) each, and the only grading scale is his opinion. Not very fair at all."
2358,1375400,4.0,2.0,"Nice, fun guy. Prepares you well for his exams, which are based on comparing/contrasting/critiquing authors you read. Only daily hw is reading, but you can get away with skimming. Constantly allows his liberal bias to leak into lectures. Not my favorite class, but a solid one."
2359,1375400,3.0,5.0,"Stickler for details. Not a whole lot of grades, and if you don't keep up with the reading you will be in trouble, as he expects you to pull from these on the two exams. Three grades worth 30%, the two exams and a paper, as well as 10% for participation. You MUST attend this class or he will destroy you."
2360,1375400,2.0,4.0,"Great guy. Young, fun, and energetic. He expects alot out of students performance-wise. Class based on 3 grades (2 exams + term paper). Hard grader. Write thorough well thought out essays and a paper and a highn B is easy. A is hard to get but can be done if you really study and love polital essays"
2361,1375400,3.5,3.0,Funny guy.  Will screw you on participation if you skip the class.  It's pretty easy.
2362,226475,5.0,2.0,"Professor Sessions was fantastic. I didn't have an interest in philosophy before taking his class, but the Concept of Honor seminar was wonderful. Sessions was always approachable, easy to talk to, and taught a fun class. It's a shame he's retiring this semester."
2363,226475,5.0,2.0,"Best professor in the philosophy department, by far.  Definitely one of the top Arts & Humanities professors.  Great guy, understanding, and you will learn a lot."
2364,226475,4.5,2.0,Professor Sessions was unbelievably helpful and really did his best to make the material engaging and clear to the class.He is definitely a fair grader and genuinely wants you to do well and understand the material. I highly recommend him.
2365,226475,5.0,3.0,Great prof.  Well spoken and clear.  Grades fair and talking to him during office hours is helpful.
2366,226475,5.0,2.0,"he is such a nice guy, and is fun to talk to, as well as helpful, if you visit him during office hours, etc. A fair grader, not horribly difficult. He helps clarify confusing material really well, and is pretty funny, if you like drier humor. Really good lecturer, even better in seminar courses."
2367,226475,5.0,3.0,"Such an enthusiastic professor about the material he teaches.  He seems genuinely interested in what his students gain from his classes, and is such a nice person to talk to.  You must work for your grade, but he is more than fair and you won't see hours of work on a paper turn into a disappointing grade."
2368,226475,5.0,2.0,he's such a nice guy!  he really likes it when people participate.  he seems so excited about the class.  pretty easy grader.
2369,226475,5.0,2.0,"I took Chinese Philosophy, and Sessions was extremely helpful and eager to get to know about his students outside of class. I talked to him about a paper and he was more than understanding. Try to participate in class if possible, and take good notes...that way you'll get the concepts he wants to stress. Very friendly, genuinely kind professor."
2370,226475,5.0,2.0,"wonderful man, wonderful professor. not too hard and his class is very interesting."
2371,226475,5.0,1.0,"He is the nicest man ever, and a great professor. Really interesting to talk to and energetic in class. Outside of class he is very friendly as well. I definitely recommend him"
2372,226475,5.0,2.0,What a great guy.  Awesome teacher and so nice.
2373,226475,4.5,3.0,one of the smartest men you will meet. provides an extremely great discussion.

2377,226475,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, and an all-around nice guy!"
2378,226475,4.5,3.0,101 and chinese philosophy are great classes
2379,1692844,5.0,3.0,"If you suck at spanish, you're gonna struggle, but the class will still really help. Bailey is great, and teaches really well. He's super nice, runs a fun interactive lecture, and grades fairly. All of the work is done through an online textbook, including tests."
2380,1692844,4.0,2.0,Professor Bailey really helped my conversational Spanish. He got me to think harder about forming sentences in speech. The entire class is graded based on VHL activities so do them and do them well.
2381,1692844,5.0,3.0,Mr. Bailey is really nice and genuinely loves teaching. Our class got really close and it was a fun semester- always a class I looked forward to and would definitely take another with him. Make sure you do the reading and come to class with questions prepared to ask him and you'll do really well. Whole class is discussion style.
2382,1692844,4.5,3.0,"Super nice guy. Assigned relatively lengthy assignments for every Friday, but was super good about answering questions in class. Relatively unstructured class time, but it was great when you wanted to ask questions about the material."
2383,1692844,4.5,3.0,Businesslike but likable prof who tries with some success to makes 8am classes interesting. He genuinely cares about improving students' spanish abilities
2384,1692844,3.5,3.0,"Took intermediate spanish with him... it was a pretty standard class. He was organized, predictable, and accessible. My spanish got better and I got an A- without too much effort"
2385,1692844,4.0,2.0,"Professor Bailey is one of the few professors that really takes a genuine interest in the progression of students. I learned so much and he is a wise man, I wish he taught every spanish class. I recommend this class to everyone. Participate and you will do well!"
2386,226477,3.0,1.0,"The content is super easy. If you read the textbook you could pass the class without even going to class. My main complaint is the workload. There are problem sets for each chapter, Stata labs, quizzes, a midterm, an empirical project &amp; presentation, and a final exam."
2387,226477,3.0,4.0,"Hardest class I've taken so far, but you'll learn SO much with Anderson. Hard grader but with the curve most people make a B+. King of cold calling in class, so keep up with the lectures. The final project takes all semester so make sure you get an incredible partner and use the peer mentors for help."
2388,226477,3.0,5.0,"Such a hard grader. Although the topic is interesting, the tests and quizzes were nearly impossible. Nice man but an extremely frustrating class."
2389,226477,2.0,4.0,Very harsh grader. Interesting subject but not worth the GPA drop.
2390,226477,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Anderson has incredibly high expectations and expects students to work, which can be offputting for a group of above-avg intelligence students who are used to things coming easy. You will need to consult all resources (book, office hours, notes, and maybe supplemental) but the class is one of the most rewarding I took. "
2391,226477,1.0,5.0,"The tests and quizzes are unnecessarily difficult and his grading is very specific and arbitrary. He does not realize the time required to complete all of the work assigned for the class. Additionally, he is less than helpful in office hours and borders on rude and condescending.  "
2392,226477,2.0,5.0,"He seems like a great teacher and great person but he is too demanding of his class. His two quizzes could be exams in other classes. His midterm, unbelievable. He is a great guy but he is very intimidating and doesn't help when you go to him. If you aren't understanding a topic, he has a hard time explaining it in simpler terms. "
2393,226477,1.5,5.0,"Extremely demanding professor and course. Think stats mixed with complex economic theories and a little calculus on top. He has two brutal exams, quizzes, labs, graded hw, and a massive project that will take over your life. Sadly this class is required for an econ major"
2394,226477,3.0,5.0,Really picky and slow grader. Seems nice but i dont get a feeling that he really cares about students much. Not a good pick
2395,226477,4.0,5.0,Difficult class required for the major. He takes a long time to grade assignments and is generally tough as a grader
2396,226477,2.5,5.0,Serious guy with high expectations. Make sure you're ready for an intense and unpredictable workload. His lectures are straightforward but he refuses to give clear explanations on any questions you have on homeworks. Pretty miserable class overall
2397,226477,4.5,4.0,"Interesting, easygoing style. Moderately tough grader. High workload, though. Get stuff done before the deadline, you're going to need help with it, especially toward the end."
2398,226477,3.5,4.0,"Prof. Anderson seems to be a genuinely nice guy. 203 is a hard class, but is totally manageable if you go to class and do the work assigned."
2399,226477,5.0,3.0,"Gets a bad rep from some people, but he's a brilliant guy and truly cares about the students.  Once you establish a relationship with him and go to office hours you'll find him very kind and helpful."
2400,226477,4.0,4.0,Prof. Anderson is a tough teacher who is really interested in the material he teaches.  The tests are tough and it is required to read everything including the WSJ but I learned a lot in the class and enjoyed it even though it required a lot of time.
2401,226477,5.0,4.0,"Not an easy grader, but fair.  Lectures are clear and well organized.  Available for office hours and very helpful."
2402,226477,4.5,4.0,"Tough but nice. Extremely helpful and approachable when you come to his office to discuss any problem you have. He is no way an arbitrary grader like previous comments said. Class is very challenging, but I learn so much more from it than any other econ class I've ever taken."
2403,226477,1.0,3.0,No Comments
2404,226477,3.0,4.0,"tough grader, not very helpful, but an interesting lecturer and pretty nice guy."
2405,226477,3.5,4.0,If he asks if I'm on the goddamn bus one more time I'll shoot myself.
2406,226477,3.0,4.0,"Seems nice on the first day, but he's a total ****bag.  Doesn't belong at a school like W&L because he doesn't care at all about students.  Really smart guy, pretty hard grader.  Also, never hands anything back, which leads me to believe he just doesn't grade things and gives everyone a B."
2407,226477,2.5,5.0,"Nice guy, loves the material, but is really unhelpful otherwise.  Asked him for a recommendation and he said he'd do it, but never sent it in.  Very slow at getting back to students."
2408,226477,2.5,5.0,"Tough teacher.  For Econ, I feel like he grades your papers based on how well you write, not based on the actual content."
2409,226477,3.0,4.0,"He tries to come across as a nice person, but really cares little for students.  He would never grade anything on time and didn't even put a single comment on our &quot;final project.&quot;  A deceptive professor, stay away if possible."
2410,226477,1.5,3.0,he is the worst
2411,226477,1.5,3.0,Does the bare minimum to be called a teacher. Constantly gives out assignments late but still expects them to be done on time. One of the worst teachers I have had at this school! Avoid him if possible!
2412,226477,2.0,4.0,He is way too into the material. He was once &quot;floored&quot; by the fact that 2 x-variables were serial correlated.
2413,226477,4.0,5.0,No Comments
2414,226477,3.0,3.0,"International trade was fairly easy and interesting, while international finance was another story- I don't recommend 371. Prof seems very preoccupied with research. A pleasant enough guy, though."
2415,226476,5.0,3.0,"One of the kindest professors at this school  he cares SO much for his students, and if youre willing to care back, he will respect you so much. Deadlines are not harsh  he is so understanding. A refreshing professor to take that will make you feel good and really cares about your learning"
2416,226476,5.0,3.0,"This course was test-heavy (3 and final exam), Dr. Goldsmith did a fantastic job covering all the content necessary for an introduction to Economics. There were some class days dominated by lectures, however, he was always willing to stop and re-explain a concept to make sure you understood. One of the most caring, smart, and kind professors."
2417,226476,3.0,4.0,"He did NOT follow the syllabus and was fairly disorganized. Tests were based entirely on lectures. His handwriting on the board was impossible to read, so you had to listen closely to what he said. Also he was so insanely left-leaning, it often times took value away from the lectures. He made everything unnecessarily political. I learned the basics"
2418,226476,1.0,5.0,"Utterly ridiculous. Complete disregard for academic rules, random scheduling of exams. Classroom chalkboard incomprehensible. Avoid at all costs if you value your sanity."
2419,226476,1.0,5.0,"Without a doubt the WORST professor I have ever had at W&amp;L. Each test is worth 30%, and there are two other than the final. BOTH of the non-final exams he moved UP a week so we had to take them a week earlier than planned. He also gave a surprise quiz worth 15% of our grade two weeks before finals. On top of all of that, awful grader. DO NOT take."
2420,226476,5.0,3.0,"Goldsmith is awesome. He's one of the best econ profs, if not the best. Any class you take with him would be great, but 235 was especially great because Goldsmith was so passionate about the material. The class was super interesting and it was awesome to learn about real-world economics outside of the monotonous macro/micro stuff."
2421,226476,5.0,2.0,One of my favorite professors. I would recommend his class to anyone.
2422,226476,5.0,4.0,"Everyone needs to take a class with Professor Goldsmith! He is an outstanding professor: classes are extremely interesting, challenging, and fun. If you need help he will go above and beyond for you, by finding strategies and solutions that work you. One of the best professors I have ever had."
2423,226476,5.0,2.0,"Super enthusiastic, great professor who knows how to keep class exciting. He's a must take for econ majors. Tests are very consistent, and if you go in to talk to him about the tests he will really help you out"
2424,226476,4.0,2.0,"Great professor. Would recommend this class 100%, and I hope to take another class with him again. He is very passionate about the subject, and his enthusiasm passed easily to the students. Very helpful during office hours, and his lectures were captivating."
2425,226476,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors at W&L. His lectures were always interesting, and his calling on students keeps you paying attention without too much pressure. Would love to take another class with him. Very helpful during office hours and a generally understanding professor. Taught the most practical use of macroeconomics, in opinion."
2426,226476,5.0,3.0,"Goldsmith is my favorite professor at W&L. Made me consider majoring in Econ. His handwriting is super messy and he calls people out in class, but his lectures are so interesting he manages to keep everyone in class awake at 8 am. Definitely want to take another one of his classes."
2427,226476,4.5,2.0,My favorite W&L professor. His lectures are so good they're practically addicting. Always willing to help and is incredibly understanding. His tests aren't bad if you just study the notes very carefully. Just an awesome professor
2428,226476,3.5,4.0,Great professor!
2429,226476,3.0,1.0,Pretty standard class with a fantastic teacher. He's a funny witty guy who won't surprise you on tests and rarely assigns work. I could have learned more but it was an overall good experience
2430,226476,5.0,3.0,No homework except for tests. Tests consist of shifting a group of interconnected graphs precisely the same way as he did in lecture (which is very involved). This rewards mechanical thought and note-taking ability--critical thinking is less emphasized. He is snarky and entertaining. Class is fun times.
2431,226476,4.0,2.0,"Macro theory is easy compared to 210. He is a bit confusing as a lecturer but the material is not too hard and he is helpful in office hours. He is extremely liberal but professional and fair about it, and a really nice guy"
2432,226476,4.0,4.0,"Professor Goldsmith is my favorite professor at W&L! I took 101 with him and he convinced me to be an econ major. I LOVED his social issues class and think he makes macrotheory super manageable. He is hard, but you learn so much and really  know the subject material afterwards.  He is super helpful and LOVES talking to students"
2433,226476,2.5,4.0,"professor goldsmith is a genius and super smart! he definitely knows what he's talking about and he's very enegaging with his lectures, which makes them interesting. however, he tends to have favorites so don't get on his bad side! and he can seem condescending to students if you ask dumb questions, so it might be intimating to go to him for help"
2434,226476,2.5,4.0,Interesting guy who may actually raise more questions that his lectures answer. He is extremely smart and insightful but his style is difficult to learn from concretely. If you're good at reading what he wants you to learn and filtering out all of the tangent thoughts then you'll do fine
2435,226476,4.5,4.0,"I agree with whoever said he goes too fast, has sloppy handwriting, and uses confusing abbreviations. However, he's absolutely brilliant, so don't let that stop you from taking his courses. The way he explains econ makes it absolutely fascinating. If he used slides, he'd be in the running for best professor. He has high expectations. You'll adjust."
2436,226476,4.5,4.0,"Best professor I have ever had.  I want to major in Goldsmith!  He expects a lot of his students, but isn't unfair."
2437,226476,2.5,4.0,"Talks and writes way too fast. His writing is really sloppy and he uses abbreviations that'll make you scratch your head. Asks lots of questions in class, so basically you're teaching yourself. The problem is that you never get all of what he says or writes b/c of the breakneck pace. Also a huge liberal, which may or may not be your thing."
2438,226476,4.5,4.0,The best professor I've have thus far. His tests make you apply the material and the wording of questions can be confusing but if you study from you notes (you don't even need to buy the book) and go to him for help you'll be fine.
2439,226476,5.0,2.0,"He is an excellent professor. Lectures are interesting and I was never bored. He teaches in a very effective manner which means that study time in minimized. If you read the book and take notes, the class is relatively easy."
2440,226476,5.0,2.0,"Very good professor overall. He explains economics well and does his best to make it interesting. You can probably get by without doing much reading, but it helps. His tests can be a little difficult. Very funny, very accessible, great professor."
2441,226476,5.0,4.0,"He was absolutely amazing! His class left me wanting to be an economist... very inspirational. I haven't forgotten anything he taught, both theory and his expressions. &quot;Hey you guys up there in the peanut gallery&quot;."
2442,226476,1.5,4.0,"He's very negative and tends to suggest that all the &quot;theories&quot; he's forced to teach are bs... Clearly doesn't want to be teaching... Not helpful in office hours, treats you like you're stupid, and not very approachable."
2443,226476,4.5,2.0,"Best teacher I've had at W&L! Makes things so clear and applicable to life. Engaging class and a really accommodating, nice guy. Made me want to take more econ!"
2444,226476,3.5,4.0,Best Econ professor at W&L.
2445,226476,5.0,3.0,"&quot;how we goin&#63;&quot;  he's incredible.  not easy, but is definitely fair.  makes economics so much simpler after just one class.  i'm not a fan of econ at all, but he was wonderful.  i still love running into him.  he's a lot of fun both in and out of class"
2446,226476,5.0,3.0,My favortie prof at W&L so far. Excellent teacher; he is very enthusiastic about the material which helps me pay attention. Tests are difficult but fair; you can always go in and ask questions and sometimes he throws you some points back if you make your point clearer.
2447,226476,4.5,3.0,My favorite class at W&L.  Looked forward to my 8:00 section...great lectures and learned so much.  Tests are challenging but fair.  If you work hard you will do well.
2448,226476,5.0,3.0,best teacher.. really funny enjoyable class... but you also learn alot... he likes if you meet with him outside class
2449,226476,5.0,3.0,"Enthusiastic, helpful, expects you to learn, and teaches the material well."
2450,226476,4.5,4.0,Amazing professor.  Very accessible.
2451,226476,4.0,4.0,Far and away the best teacher of my economics major.
2452,226476,5.0,2.0,Best Professor Ive had so far at W and L.
2453,226476,5.0,3.0,The best prof that I've had yet at W&L
2454,226476,5.0,3.0,by far the best in the department. very committed to teaching and helping students outside of class.
2455,2059436,4.5,2.0,Best professor I have had so far. Nicest lady who cares about her students and is willing to adapt her teaching methods for you. Gives extra credit and is a very easy grader. Would definitely recommend to anyone 
2456,1991856,5.0,2.0,"Great pick for FDR! No tests! Grades come from group transcriptions, field work, and final group paper/project. He does give open note pop quizzes ,so reading the material is NECESSARY. However, the classes are mostly discussions to answer questions from the book. No note taking really necessary. I enjoyed W&amp;L Arch History even though it was 2hrs."
2457,1991856,4.0,2.0,Class was mostly reading and discussion based and topics were very interesting. Overall great professor and I learned a lot from his class. Would recommend to future students.
2458,1991856,5.0,2.0,"He is a great guy, and honestly one of the smartest people I have ever met, and will never cease to have a load of information to share. His lectures aren't always easy to follow, and he will explain things to death, but that is just a signal for you to make sure you know that particular subject. Take notes, skim the textbook, know your vocab."
2459,1991856,4.5,3.0,Very intelligent professor--knows so much about the material and makes you want to know more as well. Lots of required field trips were interesting too. Generally an easy class--very little out-of-class work (Would highly recommend for your lab science FDR!)
2460,1991856,3.5,4.0,"I quickly learned taking this class that I would never be an archaeologist. Although I felt like sometimes I wasn't graded fairly, I believe it was mostly my disinterest that killed me. There's lots of reading on the history of archaeology, which was much different than I expected. Make sure you know what you're getting into before signing up. "
2461,2229436,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Dobin is great for a first year writing class. He has a solid structure which revolves around pre-essay work before getting into a series of drafts going between him, your peers, and yourself. Classes can be a bit monotonous at times but I think he's a good teacher to take because he really did help my writing."
2462,2229436,5.0,3.0,"I came for Liz and stayed for invaluable writing tips. He knows his stuff (both the queen and writing), his conferences were extremely helpful, he's good-natured and humorous, and I would recommend this section of Writ-100 any day. He even helped me gather books for my final research essay. I hope I can take a film course with him soon!"
2463,2229436,5.0,2.0,Professor Dobin is a very good professor- I would recommend him.
2464,2229436,3.0,4.0,"His freshman writing class is one of the harder, and he cares an unnecessary amount about grammar for an intro class. I honestly feel like going to class is a waste of time."
2465,2229436,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE professor Dobin. He's caring and funny and really knowledgable. I took his class on Elizabeth I for my freshman writing credit and it was AMAZING. He can be a little dry and slightly unclear about grading expectations at times, but if you go to his office hours he is helpful and specific. I would take his class again in a heartbeat!"
2466,2229436,5.0,3.0,"Professor Dobin is a great professor who is enthusiastic, funny and kind. He does likes to hear himself talk but, he gives great feedback on papers and leads interesting class discussions. If you have the opportunity to take his Medieval and Renaissance studies class on the Age of Elizabeth or his writing class, I highly recommend you do!"
2467,2229436,5.0,3.0,I took a Medieval and Renaissance studies class with him called The Age of Elizabeth. It was a class of 9 and we spent most of the time discussing readings about Queen Elizabeth and other works from her time. He likes to talk a lot in class but it is really enjoyable. Would really recommend this course and any other with Professor Dobin!
2468,2229436,4.0,4.0,"The class naturally has many papers, but Prof Dobin guided us through the process with helpful deadlines. He had mandatory office hours conferences that were useful, but not a simple handout of advice. Tough on ""to-be"" verbs. I am a better writer because of his class!"
2469,273600,3.0,4.0,"Professor Connelly is engaging and sweet after class, but if you do not agree with his assigned reading or presented speakers, beware. He wants you to think in a specific way, and if you do not come to the same conclusions as he does, he will berate you in class and your grade on assignments will be at least somewhat affected."
2470,273600,5.0,3.0,"Professor Connelly is one of my favorite professors.  Not only is he a W&L institution in his own right, but he is passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter, cares about his students, and does not assign crazy amounts of reading.  Highly recommend."
2471,273600,3.0,4.0,Professor Connelly is an incredible professor and possibly one of the best professors at this school. He will make you work hard on papers but besides that he doesn't assign that much reading. Don't shy away from taking his class. He is really helpful if you go and see him outside of class and he knows so much about the topic. Strongly recommend.
2472,273600,5.0,4.0,"One of the best teachers I've had. You can get an A no matter your political position, but you must be a very good writer and arguer. I absolutely recommend him. He does have certain phrases he likes to repeat and repeat."
2473,273600,5.0,3.0,"This man made coming to W&L worth every penny. I wish I could have taken more than two classes with him. He is nice, reasonable, and wants students to come talk to him. Professors like him are the reason W&L is such a great place."
2474,273600,3.0,3.0,Really knows his stuff when it comes to American government.  If you want an A just drop James Madison quotes on every test/paper.  Lectures can get dry at times but he's generally a good guy.  Definitely the authority on American government at W&L.
2475,273600,5.0,5.0,Professor Connelly is awesome!
2476,273600,3.5,4.0,"In high school, my favorite class was American Government. I thought I'd love in in college too. Connelly's class really turned me off. It was not actually an American Government class, but a James Madison Rules America class. As a professor, Connelly's decent. His lectures are boring but he'll help with papers if you go to him on your own."
2477,273600,4.5,3.0,"I believe that many of these comments are completely unfair. Dr. Connelly is one of the best professors at W&L, and he will do anything to help an interested student provided that he or she approaches him respectfully and seriously. He is very balanced. If you are really that disgusted to have one conservative professor, maybe you should leave."
2478,273600,4.0,4.0,"All you have to remember is James Madison is like to Jesus to him, the Federalist papers are the bible, and there is on going and ever deepening debate btw the Anti-Federalist and Federalist. Also Democrats bad Newt Gingrich good. Hard A but it can be done."
2479,273600,3.5,2.0,"He is a really smart guy but he is really not that great of a lecturer.  Hard A, B is more than managable.  Despite his talking in circles I learned a lot and would take him again without hesitation."
2480,273600,5.0,4.0,kind of intimidating when you first meet him but if you show interest in the class he is willing to help you however he can.  makes you work really hard but teaches you alot.  great professor.
2481,273600,3.0,4.0,"Prof Connelly is a very intelligent and helpful teacher, although he often takes himself too seriously.  If all he had to manage was the DC Term, then he would be perfect."
2482,273600,5.0,3.0,Greatest professor I had at W&L...reason I was a politics major.  Wrote me a wonderful letter of recommendation that got me into Law School.  I highly recommend that everyone take him.  Don't listen to anyone that tells you otherwise.  I had him for several classes and loved every one.  Extremely helpful and once you get past Pol. 100 very nice.
2483,273600,2.5,4.0,Takes himself and his classes seriously
2484,273600,4.0,4.0,"Pof. Connelly is actually a very good professor. He does Federalist/Anti-Federlist ad nauseum, and you'd better not disagree with him, ever, but he's a good lecturer and he makes you know your stuff.  Granted, he is unapproachable, but he can be helpful once you get past the initial response."
2485,273600,2.5,5.0,"Biased professor, very egotistical.  Must spit back his own opinions on papers and tests or you will get a bad grade."
2486,273600,2.0,3.0,Absolutely loathsome.  Boring. Self important.  Uber-conservative.  Hateful hateful man.
2487,273600,2.0,3.0,"Like Professor Ryan, except the other way around, and not interesting."
2488,273600,2.0,2.0,"What a windbag.  Loves his opinions, and you better be careful if you don't think the Bushies are sent from heaven"
2489,273600,3.0,3.0,"Nice enough guy, but boring prof. Conservative but fairly balanced in class. Tries to act intimidating and pompous, which is annoying. Runs great Washington Term program, but good luck getting in."
2490,273600,2.0,4.0,"i was pretty interested in politics before i took this course, now im pretty sure i will avoid the subject at all costs.  he seems like a nice guy, but he's not a good professor.  avoid his class, for your own sake."
2491,273600,1.0,2.0,"He is called Napoleon for a very good reason -- the most egotistical, narrow-minded and partisan (to the right of Newt Gingrich) teacher at this school."
2492,273600,1.0,4.0,A blowhard and jackass. in love with self.
2493,273600,1.5,4.0,Talks a TON. Very few grades and grades hard. Must agree with him to get a good grade. Lots of reading and pop quizzes. Pretty boring and repetitive.
2494,273600,2.5,4.0,No Comments
2495,273600,2.5,2.0,"Very nice and knowledgable man, but boring professor.  Mostly lecture, redundant, likes to use up all class period and then some.  Pretty good grader."
2496,2118849,4.5,3.0,"Professor Dobin is thorough, knowledgeable, and animated - especially for Elizabethan/Jacobean drama, from Kyd & Shakespeare to Webster & Middleton. He balances lecture and discussion, and gives occasional pop quizzes on readings, so be prepared to demonstrate your knowledge on the readings. High-expectation for papers, but amazing feedback also!"
2497,2329792,5.0,4.0,"Perusing the chapter before lecture&amp; having slides printed helps keep up with the pace of this class. 1st and 2nd exams are analysis-based, 3rd and 4th are memorization-based and there is a small curve, so don't panic! For lab, showing Dr. Friend your drafts and data in office hours is the best way to avoid losing points. He's very helpful."
2498,2329792,4.0,4.0,"Super smart and doesn't always work to the pace of the students, but is willing to slow down and offer extra explanation if you ask."
2499,2329792,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Friend is an amazing professor. Biochemistry is just a really hard course by nature. He is generous with partial credit and SUPER helpful in office hours. Also, the final is open note, open book and open internet."
2500,273604,5.0,2.0,I am obsessed with Prof Wheeler. She is the nicest human being ever and always willing to help her students outside of class. She would often bring our class treats and always had fun activities planned. Take a class with her!!!
2501,273604,5.0,3.0,Professor Wheeler is such a kind and caring professor. She gives such good feedback on essays when you go to her office hours!! Highly recommend for the first year writing seminar.
2502,273604,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed her first year writing seminar. She was fun in class and was good at encouraging participation. She gave helpful feedback and payed attention to past comments looking for ways that I had improved. We had a good bit of reading homework, but most of it was fun and easy to read. I really hope I can take another class from her!"
2503,273604,5.0,3.0,I took Professor Wheelers first year writing seminar and absolutely loved it. If you dont go into office hours then she probably wont give a high grade though. She is very helpful and will be able to meet quite often if need be. I would highly recommend Professor Wheeler to anyone considering taking her.
2504,273604,4.5,3.0,"Professor Wheeler is my adviser and I've taken several of her classes. She's a quiet but powerful human being. Really inspires me to try my best in everything. Her classes have always been interesting to me. I've never had an issue with papers or tests in her classes, although I don't think she's the easiest grader overall. "
2505,273604,5.0,3.0,"Took her American Gothic writing class. Fantastic class, Prof. Wheeler made it engaging and fun. Her paper assignments were straightforward and she made time to meet with each student and go over their paper if needed. She also scheduled peer edits in class. She had a few fun assignments and activities in class to spice things up. Loved her!!!"
2506,273604,4.0,3.0,"Intro Poetry: the class was mostly discussion, so if you like poetry it's enjoyable and if you don't then you'll be bored to death. Grading was fair and overall the class is not hard"
2507,273604,4.5,4.0,"boring material, i took american gods. very helpful but definitely not an easy grader, you must go to her office hours before a paper. need to show up to class, shes very nice and knows her stuff, somehow finds a way to make your stupidest comments sound smart. never felt a personal connection with her, u can tell she has a lot of other obligations"
2508,273604,5.0,3.0,"Wheeler is amazing! The best English teacher I have ever had. Going to talk to her about your papers is the best thing you can do in this class. Your grade and writing will improve immensely from all the help she gives. She makes everything you say in discussions seem relevant and interesting, and she really values people's opinion. Take her class!"
2509,273604,4.5,2.0,"Just took American Gods,the class is incredibly easy if you show up and go to her office hours to have her review your papers.  Great professor and very helpful."
2510,273604,5.0,3.0,Took her &quot;American Gods&quot; course and was really impressed. She makes discussion interesting and WILL improve your expository writing skills. She's not afraid to digress if it's interesting. Take her 105 or poetry courses for GE.
2511,273604,5.0,2.0,Amazing prof.
2512,273604,5.0,2.0,"If I could be one person when I grow up, it would be Professor Wheeler.  She is absolutely amazing, wonderful, dedicated, intelligent, and most importantly willing to read my papers and subtally hint that I might not be making any sense.  Her class discussions are fabulous and always engaging."
2513,273604,5.0,3.0,"She will make your dumbest comments in discussion sound smart, and by the end of the semester, you'll probably even BE a little smarter thanks to what she's taught you.  Every professor should aspire to be more like Professor Wheeler.  Helpful, brillaint, interesting, thoughtful."
2514,273604,4.5,2.0,"Wheeler is a lot fun, clearly interested in what she teaches. The tests are easy, she doesn't grade the papers too strictly, and she's always available. She's a bit too feminist, but still worth taking."
2515,273604,5.0,2.0,"Great class, tests aren't too hard, two main papers and a couple response papers...she's going on sabbatical for a year."

2519,273604,5.0,1.0,"Very dedicated to helping students, esp. in writing essays.  You'll get a good grade if you visit her before turning in each paper.  Easy to participate in class discussions.  Workload reasonable and interesting."
2520,273605,5.0,4.0,"I loved taking her NT class. She really knows and loves what she's teaching. She really wants you to succeed, drops the lowest quiz grade and weighs the better paper higher. I found her really engaging even though it is a fairly lecture and reading heavy class."
2521,273605,5.0,5.0,thoughtful and engaged; cares abut her students
2522,273605,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Brown is great at facilitating discussion in class and is really looking for personal connections to the coursework. However, this discussion comes from all of the reading that she assigns - do the reading. You will be lost without it. She doesn't return grades or explain where they come from so really use her office hours to do well."
2523,273605,3.0,4.0,"The class is very interesting, but be ready to read a lot each night. Participation is important, but you can participate either in class or in the online discussions. Papers are hard, but was sorta helpful during office hours."
2524,273605,4.0,3.0,"Wonderful professor, wonderful class.  Fair grader and you will learn sooo much.  She is a brilliant woman."
2525,273605,5.0,2.0,"Professor Brown is simply awesome! There is a lot of reading for an intro level course, but you can get by without reading all of it. Very helpful in office hours, and she is brilliant! She also brought in lots of interesting  speakers!"
2526,273605,3.5,4.0,"This was my first REL course and I was definitely not prepared. Lots of prior knowledge is needed to understand anything Brown says on the first day. She's very smart. I worked really hard to stop getting Cs and Bs to earn an A on a homework paper. But it became my favorite class and I absolutely loved her, she's so nice"
2527,273605,4.5,1.0,"Fantastic professor, very helpful. Even though lectures are long they're interesting. Put in a little effort and you'll enjoy the class."
2528,273605,4.5,3.0,"If you are an interested, hard-working individual, Professor Brown's course will build a good academic rigor for you in the future. If you are not prepared to discuss topics/read materials/prepare for class in general, seek out some other course to clog."
2529,273605,4.5,4.0,"Professor Brown is the best teacher I have had at W&L. Her classes are pretty hard, but she is brilliant and her lectures are really interesting. She is very willing to help you outside of class. If you go to her office hours, she will readily give you advice about your papers and advice about life. She is amazing--definitely take her class!"
2530,273605,4.5,4.0,ABrown is absolutely brilliant as well as one of the most kind and helpful profs at W&L.  She rewards enthusiasm even if you're not an expert on the Bible.  She truly cares about her students and will talk with you about religion (or pretty much anything else) during office hours.
2531,273605,4.5,4.0,"One of the best professors I've had at W&L. Very clear and interesting lectures, and extremely helpful outside of class/ during office hours for papers, etc. I would highly recommend this class and professor."
2532,273605,4.5,3.0,"Extremely smart woman.  Tangents (she loves 'em) are extremely interesting.  Took religion all through high school and learned more from this class.  Not extremely difficult, but not a pushover.  Do the Biblical readings and Ehrman and you should be fine."
2533,273605,4.0,3.0,I barely read in the class beacuse there was so much reading but I still managed to get a B+ on my exegesis paper just based of the website NTgateway.com don't be afraid of this class just read the main textbook by Enharm and you will be staight.
2534,273605,1.5,5.0,"The worst class I've taken at W&L.  If you're not a bible expert before you take this class, don't even think about showing up the first day.  Completely unhelpful if you're not a god squader.  All I learned was Jesus may or may not have been holy."
2535,273605,4.0,4.0,"I took this class 2 years ago and don't know why I didn't rate her.  Do not take Rel 102 if you aren't a religion major.  She actually said &quot;If you are a religion major I think the intro class should be the hardest&quot;, when there was only 1 rel major in the class.  I had to do xtra cred. to pull a B, & on a paper she basically called me stupid."
2536,273605,3.0,2.0,"I'm not a religion major but it's clear that if you are she is the professor that will change your life.  She knows her material so well that it's hard to tell what to take notes on in her lectures, but the tangents are more than worth listening too.  Very reasonable with her expectations for a 102 class - a lot of reading though"
2537,273605,5.0,4.0,"such a smart professor and truly passionate about the field. overall she's a difficult professor, but if you don't take another religion course, take the new testament."

2540,273605,5.0,3.0,"Brilliant religion professor.  Class can be dull.  Lots of reading assigned, but most not nec. to read.  Interesting subject and assignments."
2541,2417870,5.0,4.0,"Incredible professor! Super smart and gives interesting, complex lectures that challenge you to think. Turned me into a Global Politics double major. Tough grader but not impossible and gives good feedback."
2542,2417870,4.0,4.0,"Extremely intelligent guy, and his lectures about political theory are really cool. His class was my moment of transition from a high school level to the collegiate level, where I can understand complex and heavy political scholarly books and articles and produce essays on such topics. I felt overall smarter after his class. Hard but worth it."
2543,1944784,2.0,3.0,"Nice lady who genuinely wants students to succeed, but I learned very little from relatively easy material. She gives readings and homework that cover a broad range of information and then gives a difficult test focusing on only a couple of topics. Barely any practice problems to prepare for tests, study guides not very helpful. Go to office hours."
2544,1944784,1.5,5.0,Very unclear and super unhelpful. I would advise those thinking about taking her class don't. Horrible lecturer and just not a good professor.
2545,1944784,3.0,1.0,Nice woman
2546,2295018,5.0,2.0,"Expects a lot of time put into the class, but is a fair grader if you put in the time. It can be hard to understand her, but she's super sweet and encouraging. Her class is a nice brain break from solely academic based schoolwork, though it is still challenging-- just in a different facet than you might be used to. Would definitely recommend."
2547,2295018,1.0,5.0,I took this class because I loved sculpture in high school and was very disappointed. She requires (and tracks) that you spend at least 6 to 8 hours outside of class working in the studio. She is a harsh grader and gives very little feedback. Praised by project in class then gave me a C. Made me cry at least twice.
2548,2295022,2.0,5.0,dont take her ever... doesn't accept opinions that aren't her own. Also think she was visiting professor so she might be gone Really easy but also a psycho so like trade-off
2549,2295022,5.0,2.0,Her lectures/discussions are necessary to pass the tests. She assigns in class work all the time and loves discussing ideas with students. Professor Thomson is super nice and caring. Loved taking such an interesting class!
2550,2295022,4.0,2.0,"Polite and caring professor. You will get a good grade if you speak once or twice in class each day (verbal participation is important). 2-3 readings assigned per class but they are rarely dense or boring. Two tests per semester, taken online on the honor system. Very simple end of semester writing project. Enjoyable and undemanding class."
2551,2041079,1.0,5.0,"Whether you are majoring in accounting/ business or not, do not take Cowins! This is literally me begging you all to save your souls and run as far away as you can from her! She has homework and quizzes due before every class. In class, she just goes on and on about the topics and they barely make any sense. You stop listening once and it's over. "
2552,2041079,1.0,5.0,No structure. No PowerPoint. The class never fits with the textbook. You need to study by yourself.
2553,2041079,2.0,3.0,She made her class online about 2 weeks before classes started when everyone already had their schedules planned out. Very discussion-heavy and doesn't really teach you new info. No exams by a project that is 50% of your grade.
2554,2041079,2.0,4.0,"Professor Cowins is very sweet and kind, but her teaching style is challenging. She has the class learn the materials and do the problems on our own then correct them in class instead of vice versa. That made the class harder than it needed to be with the difficult materials.. A lot of people struggled because the problems on exams were very hard."
2555,2041079,5.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed Professor Cowins - she did a great job of explaining the topic and she was especially kind. Online (pandemic) is tough for everyone, but she did a good job with the format. If you do the work, you should be fine, it's not difficult and she's there to help."
2556,2041079,1.0,5.0,Doesnt help u. Seems like she is ambivalent to seeing students suffer. Steer clear.
2557,2041079,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Cowins's zoom class is very boring. She handwrites the notes during class instead of powerpoint which makes it difficult to follow. Nice thing is she then types up those notes and lets us use it for studying. We do go over topics pretty fast and have frequent quizzes and homework, but as long as you do them and ask questions you'll be fine."
2558,2041079,1.0,4.0,Assigns vague and difficult quizzes for significant credit on material that has just been taught. Does not see it as an issue that class averages on these quizzes are consistently in the 50-70% range
2559,2041079,2.0,3.0,"Prof. Cowins is knowledgeable and friendly, but sometimes seems unbothered by the fact that many students feel lost while doing homework or overwhelmed by quizzes and homework. Not unusual to have 2-3 hours of work before a class. Gives graded assignments on topics that students have barely had time to digest."
2560,2041079,4.0,3.0,Professor Cowins is a super kind and approachable professor. She teaches the material fairly well and is willing to help you outside of class. She gave me a good foundation for accounting.
2561,2041079,4.0,4.0,"The class was quite disorganized, however, when she lectures it is quite helpful and productive for the class. The only issue was that most classes did not consist of lecture and instruction, but were rather spent working on the cases."
2562,2041079,1.0,4.0,"All learning is done on your own: you read the textbook and do problem sets outside of class (minimum of 2-4hrs/class). In class, she reads the answers out (commonly with errors) and then stares at you until you say that you understand it. She claims her class is about teaching students to learn, rather than preparing them for the CPA."
2563,2041079,4.0,2.0,"Professor Cowins is one of the sweetest professors at W&amp;L. Her lectures can sometimes be confusing, but if you go sit down with her in office hours she is one of the most caring people and will help you until she is sure you understand the material."
2564,2041079,2.0,4.0,"Avoid, turned intermediate 2 into a qualitative study of GAAP vs IFRS. Her tests are open note open book, making it incrementally harder and extremely long."
2565,2041079,4.0,3.0,"Honestly, she is a good professor. She is very understanding and as long as you understand the concepts and do not just memorize them, you will be in good shape. Her lectures are very straight forward and she literally tells you what you need to understand for the exam (normally 5-6 concepts). If you can explain your reasoning, you should be good."
2566,2041079,1.0,5.0,"Quite possibly the most insane tests I have ever taken in my life. The entire class failed pre curve and it wasn't much better with the curve. I'm not salty, I ended up with a good grade but most didn't."
2567,2041079,4.0,3.0,She is more concerned with the bigger concepts/your ability to analyze than the correctness of your calculations which is nice if math is not really your thing. Tests are generally one main problem and there are many ways to get it right. Group projects are challenging but helpful for exams.
2568,2041079,2.0,4.0,"Tests were long, hard, and did not accurately reflect the material reviewed in class. We were assigned groups for long and complicated case studies that were meant for graduate students. We would regularly go to her for help on the case studies, but she was unclear and graded us poorly on things she told us to do."
2569,2041079,1.5,4.0,"All work in this class is with groups that she assigns, so you better hope you get a good group because you're stuck the whole semester. Lectures are unclear and tests have material she never even covers in class. Avoid if you can."
2570,1785085,4.5,2.0,Care and treatment of athletic injuries was an easy and useful class if you are at all interested in sports. 2 credits and not much work- good deal
2571,279807,3.0,4.0,"Rush is a good prof for this class but the class should definitely be 300-level at least. The amount of reading is crazy and you really just can't do it all but that's fine as long as you can write the papers well. The material is hard but once you learn to think like Rush does, you'll be okay. His grading isn't the best but you get used to it."
2572,279807,4.0,4.0,"Professor Rush is NOT as bad as his rating makes him seem. Yes, his course is challenging, but it's college; what do you expect? He gives tough love, but it made me a better writer and critical thinker. He's a genius who gives very insightful lectures. Take him if you want to turn yourself into a better student!"
2573,279807,1.0,5.0,This spring term course was titled &quot;Minority Rights and Gerrymandering.&quot; Professor Rush was gave nonconstructive criticism of writing and presentations. The course was terribly disorganized; Rush graded and advised unfairly. Rush would assign hundreds of pages of reading along with working on our independent projects all at the same time. DONT TAKE
2574,279807,1.0,5.0,Would not recommend. He decides pretty early-on what your grade will be and if he thinks you're smart or not. He gave an absurd amount of reading per night and was very vague with his lectures. My grades on essays progressively got worse which makes no sense and he roasted me on my writing that was the same style from a B+ paper to a C- paper.
2575,279807,1.0,5.0,"Professor Rush was the worst professor I have ever had. His feedback is not helpful, and he actually made me cry when I went to talk to him about my paper because he gave no feedback, and just made rude comments. He makes you feel stupid and like you know nothing about politics. He is uninspirational and has made me hate politics. Ruined my GPA."
2576,279807,1.0,5.0,"Rush is the worst professor I have had at W&L. Even if you spend countless hours on work, you will not get a good grade. He is a horrible teacher--because he does the opposite of ""teach."" He is uninspiring, and gives people reasons to doubt themselves every time they open their mouth. He makes you feel dumb and like you are unable to succeed"
2577,279807,1.0,4.0,"Professor Rush was easily the worst professor I've had at W&L.  Knows nothing about stats, and is still a know-it-all who clearly plays favorites.  Its too bad this man still has a job at the school, especially teaching stats.  He was very rude to all students, and is a very unlikeable person.  Hoping Ruscio can pull the plug on this freak."
2578,279807,2.5,3.0,"Mixed feelings about Rush. He's kind of full of himself, and he makes baseball references quite regularly. There's a lot of reading.  Also, don't expect to go into current events  POL 105 is all theory. Definitely not what I signed up for. If you're into that stuff, he is not a bad guy."
2579,279807,1.5,3.0,"Terrible teacher, who does not really understand the subject matter. Heard he is a decent politics teacher, but seriously does not understand statistics, can't believe he's teaching this class.  Also randomly cancels class and reschedules mandatory makeups at the most inconvenient times possible. Had class even when school was cancelled."
2580,279807,3.0,4.0,"They said take anyone but Rush for Stats and now I know why. Class was dry, lectures could be hard to follow or would put you to sleep. Practice problems were nothing like test problems. Lied about grades. Very open to students coming to office hours but only teaches things one way. Passable class but a  rough time, not recommended for statistics."
2581,279807,4.0,2.0,"Very smart guy. Class could be a bit dry - lots of lecturing, not much discussion - but subject matter interesting. Not a hard grader."
2582,279807,3.5,5.0,"This was a seminar class Rush allowed me to take as a freshman.  He worked us REALLY hard (I had submitted about 72 pgs of work by the end of the course), and he got some facts wrong sometimes, but he was not overall unfair.  Decent enough guy.  Very East Coast."
2583,279807,4.5,4.0,"Great professor, knows material well. Participation in this class is big. If you haven't done the reading he will know. Class is always engaging."
2584,279807,1.0,5.0,"TAKE RUSH FOR ANY CLASS BUT STATS! This man hates teaching stats 202, he basically showed us every day how bored he was with our class.  He taught things that contradicted the textbook.  He lied to students seeking help about grades, he was the most unhelpful, terrible teacher I have ever encountered in my entire college and high school career."
2585,279807,4.5,4.0,"One of the best teachers I've ever had, but be prepared to do your work.  Reading load is relatively heavy - I remember having to read an entire text over Thanksgiving break! - but class is fantastic."
2586,279807,1.5,5.0,Two Words: Sheer misery    I recommend this class only to math majors or masochists who will love it.. oh wait they got rid of the class b/c it was terrible.. and I suffered through it twice
2587,279807,5.0,5.0,"One of the best professors at this school. He'll hang out with you and make you lasagna, but he isn't going to play favorites. He has no qualms about giving you the grade you deserve and the criticism you need to deflate your massive ego."
2588,279807,5.0,5.0,"Very hard professor, but if you work your butt off for him, he'll work his butt off for you, too."
2589,279807,4.0,5.0,"Extremely difficult and unforgiving, but if you work your ass off he'll make it worth your while."
2590,279807,4.0,4.0,"This course was difficult as hell, but it was fascinating."
2591,279807,4.0,4.0,"I took him for a 100 level course.  Take one of his courses only if you are interested in the class topic.  You will get a lot of reading, but it shouldn't be a problem if you're interested.  I learned a lot in his class."
2592,279807,3.5,5.0,"I happened to take every class Rush offered - not because they were easy, but because they challeged me. I can honestly say that he helped me excel in writing and analyzing complex material. If you take him, get to know him and understand his obsession with politics and WWF wrestling."
2593,279807,5.0,5.0,"I could listen to this man talk for hours and I'm not quite sure why.  I hate math but he made stats easy to understand.  He is hard, but it makes his praise worth so much more.  Go sox!"
2594,279807,5.0,5.0,Rush is so brilliant that he thinks the most difficult subjects are easy as pie Which means he doesn't understand when students don't get complicated statistical topics...if you go visit him you learn that he's just a great guy all around and a great prof
2595,279807,1.5,2.0,"If you demand a lisence to drive, shouldn't you need one to teach&#63;  A menace to educationl"
2596,279807,2.0,4.0,"Ugh, He's a jackass who makes things harder than they need to be.  Makes a horrible class worse."
2597,279807,4.0,3.0,"The previous posts are to the point. He is your 'egghead' professor. Great guy, but he will put the load down on you. Do know that he is very willing to meet, even though he seems a bit snobbish (intellectually)."
2598,279807,3.0,5.0,"A nightmare of a class. Incredibly large amounts of reading - broad essay tests - and many papers due throughout term. As a politics prof, he tears up your papers on both political and english fronts. Dry lectures, he is very brief and to the point."
2599,279807,1.5,4.0,don't take this guy unless you're willing to read til the wee hours and then face vague questions on the exams

2602,1846528,5.0,3.0,"As a rising senior, I can safely say, hands down the best professor at Washington and Lee. His enthusiasm is contagious and you will learn a lot in his class."
2603,1846528,5.0,4.0,"One of the kindest professors on campus. He genuinely cares about his students and wants to help them in any way he can. His class can definitely be challenging, but he will help you with any topic you struggle with. 10/10"
2604,1846528,5.0,4.0,"Best faculty at W&L-- hands down. If you want to learn something, take his classes. "
2605,1846528,5.0,4.0,"Best teacher I've had at W&L! He's hilarious, and makes class really lighthearted! I sent him an email from the lab at 3AM about how I was having trouble with my project, and he just happened to be in his office, and was more than willing to help right then. Definitely makes you work, but you'll learn a lot and he cares a lot about his students. "
2606,1846528,5.0,4.0,My best professor at W&L! He definitely cares about all his students and is 99% available to help.  He makes you really learn the course ideas and apply your knowledge. The circuits built are super fun!!
2607,1846528,5.0,4.0,"Erickson is the man!!! He's just an overall awesome teacher and person. Class was always really fun and lighthearted. However, he definitely makes you work hard. This was not an easy class. But, I've never had a more understanding or caring professor. He will always work with you if you're struggling in any way he can."
2608,1846528,5.0,4.0,Erickson is one of the best teachers at W&L overall. His analogies are extremely helpful and he is the nicest guy. Will go out of his way to help you if you need it.
2609,1846528,5.0,4.0,Erickson is an amazing teacher who really cares about his students. His classes are tough but extremely interesting. If you want an easy A do not take this class. You will have to work for it but he makes it fun. 
2610,1846528,5.0,3.0,"Best Professor in the Phys-Engn department here. Loves what he does, loves teaching it and will go the extra mile to help out his students. Uses great examples that keeps the class engaged and the material practical. Awesome projects: we built a ton of cool audio equipment and even a circuit to turn muscle movement into readable electrical signals"
2611,1301763,5.0,1.0,Great prof.  passionate about subject matter.
2612,1301763,5.0,3.0,Chris may be one of the best professors at W&L. I would suggest getting in his intro class at all costs. He is FUNNY and loves the material he teaches. He also understands that not everyone will get it right away and will explain it as much as you may need. He makes you interested with out you even realizing it.  Take his class you won't regret it.
2613,1301763,4.5,3.0,Fun and generous!
2614,1301763,5.0,3.0,"He's the best professor I've had at W&L. He's funny, helpful, and SO smart."
2615,1301763,5.0,5.0,"Great Professor, Very hard, but great professor."
2616,1301763,4.5,4.0,A teacher that could clinch the &quot;best professor at W&L&quot; category. He will change the way you look at the world and do it without breaking your spirit. He makes you want to become a geology major. Taking a course with him should be a GE of this college.
2617,1785100,4.5,2.0,Good intro physics teacher. Pretty straightforward guy who gives fair tests and he's nice in office hours
2618,1821964,5.0,2.0,"Great class that I enjoyed a lot. Little workload, if any. Professor is a little disorganized but that's okay. She cares about her students and is hilarious. As long as you do your readings (the required reading is incredibly fun, interesting, and easy to understand), you should be all good. Participation is easy and guided by her. Good times! "
2619,1821964,5.0,3.0,"Medieval Literature, taught by Professor Radulescu was one of my favorite courses here at W&L. Professor Radulescu is a fair, funny, and laid-back professor who prioritizes the students' enjoyment of the content rather than the information within. She lacks a concrete schedule for assignments but is always flexible and equitable to her students."
2620,1821964,4.0,2.0,"Fantastic professor who deeply cares abt all her students and always made class very entertaining. Conversation-based classes, but she asks pretty vague questions so it's easy to participate. Workload was completely manageable. Only criticism: practically no structure with disc topics/assignments thought of on the spot"
2621,1821964,4.0,3.0,She is incredibly excited about the content that she teaches. She works with the students on when to assign work and takes stress levels into account. Do your homework and show up to class ready to participate.
2622,1821964,2.0,4.0,"She is very friendly. For a 100 level course however, this is particularly difficult. The day to day is droningly boring and poorly structured (if structured at all). Grading is oddly specific and can be harsh. Students often don't pay attention in her course, which frustrates her."
2623,1821964,2.0,4.0,"She's a great person &amp; wants you to do well, but is very inconsistent in her planning and her lesson plan for that day. Will tell you in class something is due for the next class day but then a couple days later post on Sakai that she wants something completely different/more than what she said in class. High expectations, but helpful office hours."
2624,1821964,4.0,1.0,"Not the most organized but very energetic and engaging. Wonderful person, obvioulsy cares very much about her students and the material."
2625,1821964,3.5,1.0,"Pretty easy teacher. Gets upset if students are not interested in the material be engaged and you will do fine. Not the most organized, but flexible. Loves the theater -- there had been some acting component in every class I've taken with her. Also a great person to talk to outside of class."
2626,234782,1.0,5.0,"DONT TAKE HIS CLASS. He is a cool dude but impossible class, save yourself the failing grade and don't take it."
2627,234782,1.0,4.0,"Mr. Wheeler is a great guy but his class SUCKED. Compared to my peers i did pretty well with a B- but I already took this course in HS so it should have been an A.  We never learned anything in class, so you have to teach yourself everything. Also, his test don't test general knowledge of ACCT. u can study for weeks and still fail them."
2628,234782,1.5,4.0,"Wheeler seems kind of interested in how you do, but is very sarcastic and irritating at times. Doesn't teach much. Have to learn most things out of the book. Failed half the class on the first exam. Take someone else."
2629,234782,1.5,3.0,"Basically a useless class. Lectures are very long and boring and unclear. Spends class making fun of students, sororities, and minorities rather than talking about accounting. Plus side is he usually doesn't notice if you are not in class. Fairly nice guy when you approach him but not at all helpful."
2630,234782,2.0,4.0,"Very boring and confusing lecturer... just an overall sub-par accounting professor and that is saying a lot... If you do homework and learn the material yourself, then you will be fine, but what you learn in class is different than what you are tested on.  Would not recommend!"
2631,234782,2.0,4.0,"Nice guy. If you can read a book and get it great- if you need a professor to teach it to you...well you are SOL. Uninteresting, not helpful, but probably a decent person (as if that counts&#63;)"
2632,234782,4.5,3.0,Do the HW and be concious in class and you'll be fine.
2633,234782,1.0,3.0,"homework isn't graded, attendance is taken but doesn't really matter, and tests can be weighed as you want. the downside is that you learn nothing unless you are very good at teaching yourself/ deciphering what he scribbles on the board."
2634,234782,5.0,4.0,"Had him at William and Mary. Great all the way and have remained friends. Always wenr above and beyond to help students, intresting prof, made dull subject enjoyable."
2635,234782,3.0,3.0,"If you like teaching yourself, only going to class to redo assigned homework and feeling like you know nothing after his exams- be my guest. My advice&#63; Avoid."
2636,234782,1.0,5.0,accouting with wheeler isn't bad if you don't mind teaching yourself everything and never getting a good grade
2637,234782,1.0,4.0,very unclear and unhelpful. his tests were nothing like the homework problems and you had to teach yourself everything.
2638,234782,3.0,2.0,"He's a great guy, but his lectures can be hard to follow sometimes.  His test grading is a little inconsistent, but his class isn't too difficult if you make sure you learn the material."
2639,234782,5.0,1.0,"I love this professor!  I took both tax classes with him, and you feel like he's learning it along with you.  Willing to let you argue your point on test questions, great to talk to outside of class, and I only wish he taught more courses that I could take.  All around wonderful guy."
2640,234782,1.5,2.0,"Very unclear lectures. His tests are very unclear and his grading policy is kind of harsh. Not a hard course, you just have to teach yourself!"
2641,234782,4.0,3.0,"An amazing person. If he were a student, we would be good friends. He really is a great guy... I failed this class and I still like him!"
2642,234782,4.5,3.0,Great prof and very friendly.
2643,234782,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2644,234782,4.5,3.0,"Even though I failed this class, Prof Wheeler was an awesome teacher!"
2645,1352999,4.5,3.0,Tests are sometimes difficult but really interesting class and you can learn the material by listening to her lectures. I recommend!
2646,2131243,4.0,3.0,Very reasonable professor. He does a good job keeping the class interesting especially in an intro class when the material can get boring. He grades on a curve and is very reasonable. Would highly recommend.
2647,2131243,4.0,3.0,"He's definitely a solid Econ Prof. Lectures are well organized and well delivered, and the tests are a good representation of the material. The online homework did deviate from the lectures once we got into macro, which was annoying and made it a bit trickier to study for the last test. Overall though I'd recommend taking him for Econ 100"
2648,2131243,5.0,4.0,"Great at explaining difficult concepts, and is easy to approach if you're having difficulty understanding something. Would definitely recommend!"
2649,2131243,5.0,4.0,Lectures are a bit dry but then again it's econ 100 which just isn't that exciting. The most important thing is that he's easy to understand and if you don't understand something you can go to office hours and he'll definitely help you out! Tough grader but he's fair. Excellent choice for econ majors especially.
2650,2131243,4.0,3.0,Great prof for an intro to Econ class. Isn't the most exciting but certainly communicates the information well. I had a very basic one semester Econ class in high school and felt prepared but also like I've learned. Exams are hard but he's a fair grader.
2651,2131243,5.0,4.0,He's a really good teacher and you will learn the material. Take good notes and you should do well on the test. The tests are pretty hard but if you read the textbook and re-read your notes you can manage. Awesome teacher.
2652,2131243,5.0,4.0,"Professor Handy puts teaching first. No matter what level of class he teaches, he makes ample time for helping students in office hours. I would take anything he taught."
2653,2131243,5.0,4.0,"Professor Handy's Advanced Labor class is a must-take if you're interested in getting an in-depth understanding of economic research through reading and writing empirical papers. Professor Handy is very helpful and extremely brilliant. The material is challenging, but if you put in the effort you'll get a lot out of the class."
2654,2131243,5.0,4.0,"Handy is one of the best W&L has to offer. As an econ major, definitely try to take his Advanced Labor course where you'll learn far more about econometrics than in ECON203 and explore interesting topics in the literature. If you're not a major then consider ECON 102 to fulfill an FDR (esp. if you're in the C-school) or his inequality class."
2655,2131243,4.0,3.0,"Professor Handy is an incredibly clear and insightful professor. He excels at passing along the required material to the students in lectures. The lectures are not that bad, and can actually be quite interesting if you pay attention. He works very hard because he is such a young professor."
2656,2131243,4.5,3.0,"Professor Handy made lectures interesting and clear. Not many tests or assignments, but he doesn't provide much feedback on the problem sets. His class was great, would definitely take again"
2657,1350960,4.5,3.0,"Professor Wedgeworth did a great job teaching a relatively dull topic. Her tests are pretty tricky, but if you go in for office hours and show you are interested, it is a huge help. Participation is pretty important as well."
2658,2403635,5.0,2.0,"I learned alot in this class, but it wasn't easy. The professor was available to help with some of the topics that a non data loving person like found hard to understand."
2659,2403635,5.0,3.0,"Professor Larson's class was very informative and I understood what was expected of me. The workload wasn't too bad, and as a Bus Admin major, I appreciate being able to learn about data science."
2660,2403635,1.0,3.0,She seemed nice enough until I ran into something I didn't understand and went to office hours. She was extremely confrontational about basic clarifying questions and her attitude toward me in class seemed to change after that. It was so awkward I didn't go back to office hours as the material grew more challenging and my grade probably suffered.
2661,2403635,1.0,3.0,Professor Larson is an absolute joke. Our entire class learned nothing over the course of a semester. Was confrontational and awkward in office hours (defensive when wrong doesn't fully understand the material she teaches). Honestly one of the most disappointing professors I've had at W&amp;L.
2662,2403635,2.0,1.0,"really just lacks the maturity to be a college professor. nothing was hard about the class, but watching her have a meltdown when the projector quits working or people are late to class really just gets old after a while. it created a hostile classroom. I was belittled one too many times for the low effort A- to be worth it."
2663,2403635,5.0,2.0,"Not really sure why the previous reviews are negative, but Prof. Larson's class was great and had a light workload. She's organized, flexible and accessible. Her field of interest isn't the most interesting for everybody, but she tries to make it as fun as possible. She holds a lot of review sessions so you'll get ample practice before any test!"
2664,2403635,3.0,3.0,Overall I liked Professor Larson. Her class was relatively interesting. Participation matters so be sure to do the readings before class. I wish she would have graded faster but all things considered she's a solid professor and there for you if you have questions. i would take a class with her again.
2665,2403635,1.0,2.0,"While not a bad &quot;teacher&quot; in the technical sense, it is fairly easy to do well, Professor Larson is so incredibly disrespectful and controlling, avoid at all costs. She treats college students like children and throws an absolute tantrum over any problems that arise in the class. It's completely unprofessional and just not worth an easy A."
2666,443707,4.0,4.0,"An absolutely amazing teacher. She definitely makes you work for the grade at the beginning of the semester, but it is well worth it for the enjoyable the second half. She is one o my favorite teachers I have had at the school. A truly helpful, caring, understanding, and respected professor."
2667,443707,5.0,3.0,"Very nice, an extremely fair grader and gives very constructive feedback on papers."
2668,443707,5.0,4.0,"Professor Gertz is a really caring and nice professor. She is very accessible outside of class and always cares about every single student. She tries her best to make you feel comfortable in her class. She is fair in grading and also a tough grader. Plus, the class's materials and topics were inspirational and worth reading."
2669,443707,5.0,3.0,"She is the best. She gives the best feedback on essays and is very willing to meet with you outside of class. If you put in the work, you can get a good grade. She is the nicest person ever and helps you out on your essays when you go meet with her. Definitely take this class."
2670,443707,5.0,3.0,"she is an angel sent from above. I don't think she's given anyone below a B grade. Will literally write your paper for you if you meet with her outside of class. Gets really emotional about her books its sweet. Also, has the CUTEST chocolate lab youll ever meet"
2671,443707,5.0,3.0,Professor Gertz is perfect. Her Writing seminar is both helpful and fair
2672,443707,5.0,3.0,Great Professor!!
2673,443707,5.0,4.0,"Gertz is passionate about English, and wants her students to be the same. She is very accommodating for office hours and loves to discuss material."
2674,443707,4.0,3.0,"A kind and caring professor. Genuinely cares about her students, and is very helpful. Very passionate about the subject, and passed enthusiasm on to the students."
2675,443707,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gertz is wonderful. Highly recommend any of her classes. She is so passionate about the topics. She gives excellent feedback and is always available for extra help. Topics are very interesting, just don't miss a lot of class and you will be just fine. "
2676,443707,5.0,1.0,My favorite professor and class this term. The class has close to the least amount of hours in class and very little reading compared to other Spring term classes. Papers were graded pretty easily.
2677,443707,4.5,3.0,"Professor Gertz is extremely helpful and approachable if you go to her office hours! She loves to see students trying and will definitely improve your grade if you go to her with your essays every time. There are 4 essays due throughout the semester in her section of WRIT 100, but no tests. Definitely recommend her for your writing requirement!!"
2678,443707,3.5,3.0,"Professor Gertz is very nice and can be helpful when you visit her during office hours.  However, the class is boring."
2679,443707,5.0,3.0,"She is a very nice woman, with genuine interest in teaching & helping students.  I sometimes felt that my grades on my papers were lower than her comments justified, but I did fine in the class and my writing improved a LOT"
2680,443707,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Gertz is WONDERFUL. I knew I had to take one of her classes before I graduated, and I'm so happy I did! An absolute joy; I looked forward to class everyday."
2681,443707,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gertz is an absolutely wonderful teacher. As an English major, I found her lectures and subject matter enthralling, but all she managed to make it interesting for all the business and engineering majors in the class as well. Her outside research is fascinating as well."
2682,443707,3.5,3.0,"Prof Gertz is very VERY understanding. I took her comp. class during pledgeship and when one of my papers was almost a month overdue (I know, I'm not proud of it) she still let it in and I received a decent grade. Grades aren't everything. She teaches fairly well, just be sure to be prepared and talk. Can be boring at times, but I've had worse."
2683,443707,4.0,3.0,"Extremely kind and sweet; definitely does her best to help out with papers and research. Not exactly the best at engendering lively class discussions in small seminars, though."
2684,443707,5.0,2.0,"GGR is so smart and very dedicated to teaching.  She takes a while to get papers back, but the full page of commentary is well worth the wait."
2685,443707,5.0,3.0,"I think she's wonderful, very kind, and very interested in her students, even the not so responsible ones like me.  had us all over for dinner at her house, was very enjoyable and i just love her!  grades very fairly."
2686,443707,4.0,3.0,"GGR is so sweet and she's a really cool teacher. She makes the class very interesting and she's very helpful. Even though her class is a bit difficult, I really love it."
2687,443707,5.0,3.0,"I think that perhaps it's the literature that's dull, not GGR.  She has perfectly good intentions, and I think the negative post is unfair."
2688,443707,4.5,4.0,"She's a tough prof, but fair. She really works hard to make sure that you get an understanding of all kinds of lit and that you participate in discussion. Overall, very good prof!"
2689,443707,5.0,3.0,"A really excellent lady who knows her stuff backwards and forwards. Some people say that she is dull or boring, but if you can get past that, she is a great teacher. She also really cares about getting to know the students, so it is worth taking the class."
2690,443707,4.5,3.0,"While she may come across as dry/unexciting, her class is really helpful. She is very, very knowledgeable and will go to great lengths to explain even the context of a specific word in a passage. It was not easy, and it could be boring at times, but GR is a really good teacher."
2691,443707,5.0,2.0,"she's sooooooo dull! a wonderful lady, knows her stuff and really really nice and helpful, but those 2hrs were the longest 2hrs of my life!!!"
2692,443707,5.0,2.0,"GR doesn't immediately come across as exciting, but she loves what she's teaching and her discussions really help clarify and guide you in the right direction."
2693,443707,2.0,3.0,"Oy vey...if ever there were anyone else of a duller character please find her for me...don't get me wrong, she knows her stuff, but dear DEAR JESUS CHRIST she doesn't know how to deliver and in a 2 hour class seems like a dark, abysmal eternity."
2694,1561917,4.5,3.0,"Wasserman is an amazing professor.  He almost made me want to pick up a minor.  The weekly writing assignments are time consuming, and the amount of reading and movie watching outside of class is daunting.  He is very helpful and encouraging, and you can learn a lot from just being around him (plus he brings his dog to class)."
2695,2438462,5.0,4.0,"The greatest. Great at explaining concepts and helping you visualize geological processes, and you can tell that she's excited about what she's teaching which makes lecture and labs a lot of fun. Lecture videos are thorough enough that you generally don't need to do all of the reading to get what you need to know for reading quizzes."
2696,2438462,5.0,3.0,"Professor Jay is awesome. Even if you're not a very science-orientated person, she's more than willing to help you until you understand. Her rubrics very clearly spell out what she is expecting from you. Her slides are really cool and sometimes have memes on them. You do have to do a couple of group projects, so be aware if that's not your thing."
2697,2438462,5.0,3.0,"Professor Jay is very energetic, passionate, and actually cares for her students. She values learning and improvements and will go out of her way to make sure you understand the subject materials. Rock identification can be a pain, but she makes the experience much more enjoyable."
2698,1334590,1.0,1.0,"This professor came across as arrogant and as the &quot;I know it all&quot; type...The truth is, his class is boring no matter what. Perhaps he needs to go back where he came from, since he thinks he is too good for WL!"
2699,1334590,1.0,1.0,"This professor came across as arrogant and as the &quot;I know it all type&quot;...The truth is, his class is boring no matter what. Perhaps he needs to go back where he came from, since he thinks he is too good for WL!"
2700,1334590,2.0,1.0,"Not what expected; there was a lot of noise about this new professor, but nothing in particular to go crazy about. Just another professor who should just retire...."
2701,1113424,4.0,3.0,"extremely boring, dont take this class at 8am. Loves kids that go to office hours, lots of lecture so just take really good notes, reading isnt super necessary two papers, a midterm, and a final. The midterm and final are graded off of this weird scale he has, but as long as you study the questions he hands out before the test you sho"
2702,1113424,4.0,3.0,Solid
2703,1113424,4.5,2.0,"Great guy, happy to chat after class or in office hours. He'll tell you several times in lecture EXACTLY what he wants you to write in essays or on tests, and he'll look over your essays before you submit them, so there's no reason why you shouldn't get an A. Discussion isn't so much a thing.. he asks questions but just wants to give his own answer"
2704,1113424,4.0,2.0,"i love professor cooper!  he's such a nice, easy-going guy, and he really does care a lot about the students.  he's like a giant teddy bear!  class can be kinda boring, especially since it is all discussion based and relies heavily on the reading (which can be pretty dense and boring at times) but he's generally pretty easy if you keep up"
2705,1113424,4.0,4.0,"cool guy.  some of the stuff was over my head, but it couldve just been the subject matter."
2706,2628984,5.0,2.0,"He posted the lab a month before finals and basically did it with us in office hours, though he warned us hed be gone finals week. He also let us retake EVERY quiz multiple times without penalty, graded HW by complete, and gave us 10 points on the final grade for arresting. Quizzes were hard but honestly it was an easy class if you werent lazy."
2707,2628984,5.0,5.0,Im not sure about the office hours comments. He held them every week (though they were via Zoom) and he met with me at 9PM on Zoom once when I was confused before a quiz. Quizzes are very hard though. The R lab followed a video he had uploaded step by step so I thought it was easy but maybe not everyone saw the video.
2708,2628984,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor/teacher in my fifteen years of schooling. Inaccessible, insanely hard quizzes and homework, and expects students to take a day or two out of finals week to teach themselves R for a lab. Horribly boring lectures too, and on top of it the textbook is useless. NEVER take a Churchill class, my grade wasn't even worth dealing with him."
2709,2628984,1.0,5.0,"If I could give a 0 I would. So unlike the rest of the professors at W&amp;L, refuses to meet with students and lectures are insanely confusing. During COVID, refused to hold office hours because was &quot;busy&quot;"
2710,2628984,4.0,3.0,It was fine. Not as bad as some said. Not amazing. Its a required class.
2711,2628984,4.0,4.0,"I actually didnt think R was that bad. We were hybrid and he basically uploaded video showing us how to do it. I went to office hours a few times. I think there were 5 a week? My complaint is he grades very harsh and I didnt understand he curved at the end, so I went weeks thinking I was going to fail. Also the videos were too long."
2712,2628984,5.0,5.0,I agree that the quizzes were very hard but he gave us 4 chances to redo them and we could use the answer keys from the previous quizzes so it wasnt too bad. I disagree that he wasnt accessible. I met with him almost twice a week individually on Zoom. I think he should probably just grade easier and people would be happier. Also R was hard online
2713,2628984,3.0,5.0,"I got frustrated with Professor Churchill at times, but the other ratings seem to me to be too harsh. While his expectations of us were extremely unrealistic when it came to using R to do the labs, he was incredibly generous to offer ten points of extra credit just for voting and to give us several opportunities to improve our quiz grades."
2714,2628984,1.0,5.0,Professor Churchill is the worst professor I've ever had. He is 28 and has no experience teaching and it really shows. The quizzes are impossible and totally different than what we do in class and almost everyone fails them. He is never available to meet outside of class. You have to figure out the labs on your own and one is during exams. -5/10.
2715,2628984,1.0,5.0,He is by far the worst educator I have ever met. He is never available for office hours and is so unhelpful. He gave us a lab and expected us to use the internet to teach ourselves R. None of the problem set questions are like the ones on the quizzes and expects us to just know. I will never EVER take him again. Worst professor ever.
2716,1420667,5.0,4.0,Kathleen is the best!!! I have learned more from her in a semester than I did taking three years worth of arts classes in high school. Gives the best advice and teaches the most effective technique styles.
2717,2581887,5.0,4.0,"Take her!! The workload consists of case studies, a TedTalk presentation, portfolios, and a final project analyzing an organization. You have to read for a good participation grade. Her grading is fair and she's always willing to help students. Hands down one of the best professors on campus. She makes lectures interesting and is really kind!!"
2718,2581887,5.0,2.0,"One of the best profs at W&amp;L! She cares a lot about her students, keeps her lectures interesting, and is super accessible during office hours. Her lectures are straightforward and her grading is fair. You do have to read in order to participate in class, but it's not too bad. She's super passionate about the class, and most students love her!"
2719,2581887,5.0,2.0,"Professor Gilbert is one of the kindest and most caring professors I've had at W&amp;L. She was always looking to students for feedback about how the class could be made better, she was a clear and fair grader for all assignments, and she kept lectures engaging. If you're looking for a BUS217 professor at W&amp;L, this is the one you want."
2720,1795462,3.0,3.0,"Class is very discussion based and participation matters a lot outside of the papers you will have to write. Wasn't a very straight forward curriculum, and I took the class for the MCAT sociology section and probably isn't super useful."
2721,1795462,5.0,3.0,"Professor Chin is great! The class is organized mainly into three short papers and a longer one. Really try to apply her feedback in your essays and you will do well. There is a lot of reading but it is manageable if you skim for the main points. Class is discussion based around the reading, which is very engaging."
2722,1795462,5.0,4.0,"I've never had a professor who was so immersed in a course. She cares about each student, her lectures are engaging, and theres a lot of group talking. Her energy is through the roof- you cant take your eyes off of her. Yea shes a tough grader but her feedback will be longer than your essay. U have to experience Lynnie. Best person ever."
2723,1795462,4.0,1.0,"Super funny, caring, and smart. Easy class. 3 papers, graded not too hard. Participation is important but easy to do. Very entertaining."
2724,1795462,3.0,3.0,Took Lynny for intro to sociology and thought it was a pretty interesting class. Lynny is definitely a character but knows what she is talking about. A couple of longer papers and don't forget the discussion board but overall a very gettable class especially to knock out a social science FDR.
2725,1795462,2.0,4.0,"I took Soan 102 and found the class nearly impossible to do well in. It is disorganized and the assignment guidelines are unclear. Lynnie is very kind and loves Sociology, but her lectures are disorienting and the class is absurd. I do not recommend"
2726,1795462,4.0,3.0,"Very interesting, very funny and a very approachable professor. Really enjoyed her class last year, and greatly respect her for taking on a huge research project. An awesome person in every way and very very underrated."
2727,1795462,3.5,1.0,She is kind of crazy but super interesting and friendly.  The first year seminar is not too difficult and is great if you are looking to fill an FDR.  I didn't think I would like Sociology but she made it really interesting and engaged this class.  I love Lynnie and miss her already
2728,1795462,4.0,3.0,"Lynnie is wonderful. I think that people confuse her energy for spaciness. She is an extremely intelligent individual who cares about your thinking, not what you can recite back to her. She can be a tough grader, but is always fair. If you don't understand something, she is more than happy to explain. Also, reading isn't always necessary. "
2729,1795462,3.5,4.0,"Lynnie is super sweet and she cares a lot about her students but being in her class is kind of stressful. Not in a ""there's way too much work to do"" kind of way (although there is an unnecessarily large amount of reading) but in a ""she has way too much energy and I left the first day of class with a headache"" kind of way"""
2730,1795462,4.0,3.0,"Lynnie is a really great person, and clearly incredibly intelligent!  While her class is tough and she can be somewhat hard to follow, she is always willing to backtrack to make sure that everyone understands what is being discussed and she's always available outside of class to talk!"
2731,1795462,1.5,5.0,"She is an extremely frustrating teacher. I think she is a nice person and it's clear that she is smart, but she expects graduate level work from students in an intro class and provides little to no help getting there. You MUST go to her office hours for EVERY PAPER in order to succeed."
2732,1795462,1.5,3.0,avoid
2733,1795462,2.5,3.0,"Very poor teacher. She runs around the room talking very quickly, which can be frustrating and hard to follow. There is an absurd amount of reading, and she grades assignments expecting the students to understand material just as well as she does."
2734,1795462,2.0,4.0,"Professor Chin is a very nice person and extremely excited about teaching, but she is so spacey and energetic that she is often times extremely hard to follow. You have to meet with her multiple times outside of class otherwise you won't know what she's asking you to do for assignments. There is also a huge amount of reading"
2735,990599,4.0,4.0,"Difficult class, but the lectures are incredibly interesting. He clearly knows his stuff. Some politics in his lectures could rub people the wrong way but the information is there. Tests are very fair as are the grades on papers"
2736,990599,3.0,5.0,This dude is intense and grades papers that way too.  Not too clear as far as course themes go...end of semester and still don't really know what he's looking for.  I'd steer clear of this dude if you're trying to make a grade.  He'd probably pretty cool to kick it with though.
2737,990599,4.0,4.0,"His Latin American History class was really interesting but there was a lot of reading and the papers were really difficult to write. He could be a really tough grader too, especially on pop quizs"
2738,990599,2.0,5.0,"His Latin American History class was not fulfilling.  I looked forward to thoughtful conversations.  However, the class was boring, the paper grading was convoluted and different each time, and the constant liberalism may have interefered with objectivity."
2739,1623432,4.5,1.0,"A fantastic teacher, on of the nicest I have had. It is easy to succeed here but also easy to mess up."
2740,1623432,4.5,3.0,"I love Professor Chenoweth. She chooses readings that are profoundly interesting, she is helpful and compassionate, and she has great style."
2741,1623432,5.0,2.0,"Professor Chenoweth is great. She makes class fun and does interesting activities to mix it up. There is a lot of book work, but as long as you keep up and don't slack in your studying you'll do well. Will definitely take her again!"
2742,1623432,4.0,1.0,"Professor Chenoweth is super cute and very easy.  There is quite a bit of busy work, but it is some nice padding for your grade.  Really the only negative thing I have to say is that sometimes she isn't clear about what exactly is due for the next class.  Other than that she is great!!!"
2743,1623432,5.0,2.0,"Incredibly kind, caring teacher. Wants everyone to do well. If you keep up with the textbook work which is easy, you'll get an A, great professor, took her at 8am and was worth it."
2744,1623432,4.5,3.0,"Professor Chenoweth is great, her classes were always interesting and fun. I always looked forward to French class with her. She is helpful in and out of class and encourages her students to speak french as much as possible. Definitely take her."
2745,1623432,5.0,2.0,"Professor Chenoweth is really wonderful.  Class is always interesting, and she is wickedly smart; I always enjoyed going to class.  The course work is minimal most of the time and always interesting.  I would highly recommend taking her classes, and am considering taking one of her classes again, even though I am not a French major or minor."
2746,1623432,4.5,3.0,"I was nervous about getting Chenoweth because she is a new professor but so far I am really enjoying her class.  She keeps assignments & lessons entertaining, interactive, and varied.  She is a very nice person and is always willing to help out.  She isn't one of those language teachers who will only speak in that language, overall, very reasonable"
2747,2592140,3.0,5.0,This is definitely the hardest class I have taken at W&amp;L simply because of her poor lecture structure.
2748,2592140,5.0,4.0,"This class was a little hard. I had a hard time with some of the topics, but Prof. Matthews was so available. I'm shocked to hear that she wasn't available outside of class, because my experience was the opposite. She was amazing! Her lectures were a bit hard to understand but she is amazing during office hours! She really takes her time to explain"
2749,2592140,1.0,4.0,Professor Matthews is one of the worst professors I have had at Washington and Lee. She was not available for help outside of class and when you did catch her for help she wasn't helpful at all. Her lectures are just her reading off a PowerPoint made by another professor. Her grading is unfair and her tests are very difficult.
2750,1994127,2.0,4.0,"Go great lengths to avoid this professor. She has wild expectations, as if the only class you are taking is her own. She is an unfairly tough grader.   "
2751,1994127,2.5,4.0,"Avoid. Hard grader, expects a very high standard for a 100 level environmental class."
2752,2655647,5.0,4.0,"Coach Colliton is awesome. He's down-to-earth, challenging, but still finds a way to be very funny. You can tell that he loves every second of teaching bootcamp, and (despite the physical struggle) he will make sure you love it too."
2753,2655647,5.0,5.0,"Coach Colliton definitely cares about his students. As long as you work hard, you will get an A. Bootcamp is super hard, but it is super rewarding once you finish it. Collition is hilarious, full of energy and encouraging. Bring the juice!"
2754,1912227,5.0,2.0,"Prof. King is amazing!!! You will know a lot of interesting stories during his class and he will tell exactly what we need to remember for exams. If you have any questions, just go to the office hour. I went to his office hour before every big exam, which helps me a lot!!!"
2755,1912227,5.0,1.0,King's lectures are fantastic and engaging. His class is additionally very well outlined - he will tell you exactly what you need to do in order to succeed. 
2756,1912227,5.0,1.0,He is very enthusiastic in his lectures which makes the material so much more interesting to learn. He is very straightforward about what is on the tests and tells you exactly what you need to know. If you pay attention in class and study the images then you will get a good grade. 
2757,1912227,5.0,2.0,"Although art history may seem dry, Professor King is very engaging in his lectures. His tests were very straightforward--he tells you what to take notes on and study."
2758,1912227,5.0,3.0,"Professor King is a wonderful professor. He really respects students' ideas and encourages class discussions. He isn't a hard grader either, so overall I enjoyed his class. Totally recommend."
2759,1912227,4.0,3.0,Without a doubt my favorite prof on campus. I've taken multiple classes with him and plan on taking more. Very clear and entertaining in lectures. Doesn't load on too much work and is a fair grader.
2760,1912227,4.0,3.0,Really interesting guy with an eccentric personality. He's a solid professor who knows his stuff. Loves class discussion/digressions and respects well developed student opinion. Not easy but not terribly difficult either. Be sure to speak up in his class.
2761,2620848,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor, would definitely take again!"
2762,2620848,5.0,3.0,The level of quality in lectures is unmatched at W&amp;L!
2763,2620848,1.0,5.0,Complete lack of support in labs. Pray for a helpful TA
2764,2620848,5.0,3.0,"Professor Khan is great! He's fair on grading and is great at teaching. The labs he gives are appropriate for the material, and he and the TA's are always willing to help."
2765,2620848,5.0,3.0,"One of the kindest professors I've had--really cares about your success. His lectures are very well done, and his grading is fair. I will most likely take him again for CSCI 210, as long as the slots don't fill up. Overall, really great teacher-- both his in person and online lectures are clear and helpful!"
2766,2620848,5.0,4.0,"Professor Taha is a real gem! This year was his first year teaching at W&amp;L yet he is the best CS professor I have had so far. You can tell he doesn't just cut and paste from the textbook but instead makes text very understandable. He is available outside of office hours. Being so young, he makes the content more relevant. Also, very accommodating!"
2767,2620848,4.0,2.0,No required participation but he will call on somebody randomly to answer questions. He wants to give you a high grade on the labs. Tests aren't that bad. Available for extra help most days. Very solid choice for 112.
2768,943554,5.0,1.0,"He is not the most energetic person, but his lectures are actually very interesting. His tests are straightforward, and he basically gives you detailed practice exercises to prep for the tests,"
2769,943554,5.0,4.0,Professor Fafatas is a great accounting instructor. His lectures are clear and he responds very quickly to emails if you need help. Make sure you do lots of practice problems and you'll be fine.
2770,943554,4.0,3.0,"He can be awkward at times, but is very helpful. This is a very straightforward class. HWs are typically short maybe twice a week and help boost your grade. Only 3 tests so make sure you study for them. There are never any surprises. If you read the text and go over the practice questions prior to the tests your more than fine. "
2771,943554,3.5,4.0,Lectures were very clear but the tests were much harder than everything else we had seen. Good guy but unexpectedly difficult
2772,943554,4.0,2.0,"Good professor that some people find hard to follow in lecture but overall good in class. Just sometimes unorganized. Tests aren't too hard if you work the textbook problems, homeworks bring up your grade"
2773,943554,4.0,4.0,"I completely agree with the people below me. He is a very clear lecturer and brings up some cool real world applications in class, but his tests are difficult and some questions seemed unfair. also your grade gets slashed if you miss 5 classes"
2774,943554,2.0,5.0,"He is a nice guy, but his tests are really hard. He is not very helpful in office hours."
2775,943554,5.0,3.0,Amazing teacher. Probably the best teacher I have ever had in an accounting or business class. He is the man and so helpful too.
2776,943554,2.0,4.0,The difference between the difficulty of the materiel covered and what he tests you on is just too much. You would attend a lecture and think that the materiel was really easy but would get annihilated on the test. Not helpful when you ask him for clarification in office hours
2777,943554,5.0,5.0,Unlike my other classes I had to work to get a B in this class. The homework is easy but his test are hard. I feel I actually learned something from this class and received a Grade A college education. If you really want to learn accounting take this class.
2778,943554,5.0,3.0,"May have been his first time here, but he knows how to teach. Took what i suspected to be a boring subject and actually maded it intresting. Incredibly clear explanations and examples. His tests were hard, but you were very well prepared for them. Always willing to help you outside of class, and on top of everything else, he is a genuinly nice guy."
2779,943554,4.5,2.0,"First time teaching at W&L, but tried very hard. A very fair grader, but did not demand much of the class. Class average was low because the class was lazy. If you do the (about 7) assigned problems each week and read your class notes it is an easy class. Teacher really tries to make everyone understand the material and will explain it multiple tim"
2780,2053587,5.0,4.0,"Take good notes in class and you'll survive, if you slack off she will know because it will definitely reflect in your grade. She is super cool and her classes are fun 10/10 an awesome professor"
2781,2053587,5.0,3.0,Professor Hess has by far been my favorite professor. Really passionate about accounting and helping out students who show that they care. Tough to get an &quot;A&quot; in her class but an A- is definitely realistic. 100% would recommend.
2782,2053587,4.0,3.0,Reasonably nice person and the class contains plenty of relevant information. My only concern is that it is rather hard to study for tests when half of the material does not come from the textbook.
2783,2053587,4.5,2.0,"Favorite professor I've had thus far, very passionate about a pretty bland subject but finds ways to make it interesting. Participation is HUGE. Tests are pretty standard, if you do the work and genuinely listen in class you should leave with a good grade"
2784,2405858,3.0,4.0,"Insanely smart, but sometimes that causes him to under-explain concepts/techniques or expect that we know certain things. Sometimes gave HW questions that were practically impossible and didn't relate to topics from class. However, his grading system is VERY generous despite the hard (but fair) tests. Helpful in OH/1:1 and an overall amazing guy."
2785,2405858,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. He's the first math teacher I've had that actually captivates my attention. Got me interested in math after being bored with it throughout high school. Some problems are tricky and can take a long time, but are quite rewarding when figured it out. Nothing ever feels trivial, and everything is given with a purpose. Take his classes."
2786,2405858,5.0,3.0,"An excellent professor! 
His tests are hard, but he is happy to explain things in office hours. 
Go to office hours!"
2787,2405858,2.0,5.0,"Tons of homework with little time for comprehension. Impossible true/false questions explained after test was taken, not before. No feedback on exams. No participation-based grading. No in-class review for tests. Frequent admissions of unpreparedness for class. On positive note, widely available for office hours and good person."
2788,2405858,5.0,4.0,Professor Colbert is an amazing math professor! He brings so much enthusiasm for the students and the material to the classroom. He makes mathematics accessible but never at the cost of losing the academic/intellectual content.
2789,2405858,5.0,2.0,"Awesome dude, really smart, and teaches so that students will have at least some idea of why they are using any given formula or process."
2790,2405858,4.0,4.0,Hard but the tests are forgiving enough where with all of the homework points he gives youll be fine. Knows what hes talking about but tends to make things more complicated than probably needed to be. Nice guy though and he is very understanding when you go to talk to him.
2791,2405858,5.0,3.0,"Fine mathematician and great professor. He really cares about you understanding the concepts, and - despite not being an easy A - the several components still balance your grade. He allows a fact sheet during exams, which is a big help. Definitely one of the best math professors at W&amp;L."
2792,2405858,5.0,3.0,"Love dr Colbert. Do the work, go to OH youll succeed."
2793,2405858,5.0,4.0,"Prof Colbert is great. Although calc can be a confusing and challenging subject, especially at w&amp;l where you really have to understand the math in order to do well, he is always happy to explain further in class and in office hours. Its a great mix of lecture and working in groups. Tough grader but if you follow the format he gives you you do well."
2794,2405858,5.0,3.0,Prof. Colbert is the man. I smile when he comes into class. He pushes us to think beyond what my calc teacher in high school did. His shirts every day crack me up and the way he says L'hopital's rule kills me. What a guy. What a teacher.
2795,2405858,5.0,3.0,"Colbert is a good teacher. He is not always clear in lecture but is happy to clarify at any point especially in office hours. Although attendance is not mandatory he does actually TEACH in class. Homework is optional, but he takes problems from it for the weekly quizzes. Grade is completely from quizzes and tests. Cory is a humorous dude."
2796,2405858,2.0,4.0,"Loves theorems and hypotheticals. Is much smarter than his students and makes that clear. Will love you if you're naturally good at math, condescending with students that struggle."
2797,2405858,5.0,3.0,Dr. Colbert is a real gem. Hes super funny and a good lecturer. The homework is optional but will help you on the weekly quizzes.
2798,2405858,4.0,3.0,His lectures are great and he really explains everything well in class. Will go over any questions in office hours.
2799,2577892,3.0,3.0,"Kharputly is a good instructor who gives very good feedback on essays. She relies too heavily on peer review which is generally useless, and then she'll be upset when you don't use your peers' shoddy advice. Additionally, she is COVID-crazy. Got an A on the first essay, grades went straight downhill after she said I wasn't wearing my mask right"
2800,2577892,5.0,2.0,Seriously amazing professor. I felt that my writing improved so much with her. Super interesting readings that opened my worldview. Participating in class in super easy and encouraged. 3 papers with rough drafts for each that are reviewed by her to help you be successful.
2801,2577892,5.0,2.0,"Professor Kharputly is one of the nicest teachers at W&amp;L. Gives amazing feedback on papers, super unique course material, the workload is extremely light. Essays are super easy to do well on with her revising process. Fair warning: she's still afraid of COVID - if your mask falls below the nose she threatens to move class on Zoom or outside."
2802,2577892,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kharputly is probably one of the kindest professors I have ever taken a course with. She took extra measures during COVID to ensure the success of her students, and was readily available to help outside of class. She takes the time to leave very detailed and helpful feedback on all essays, and you will become a better writer in her class."
2803,2577892,5.0,2.0,Professor Kharputly cares deeply about what she teaches and the students she teaches. I took her class during COVID and she made sure to reach out and make the necessary accommodations that made the class more manageable. She teaches the class in a way that allows students to come away with a much richer understanding of the readings assigned.
2804,2577892,5.0,2.0,"Super accesible- available for scheduled office hours and happy to reschedule if inconvenient. All assignments were given extensive feedback, both in drafts and final copies, and expectations are clear. Lets students guide discussion but makes key points clear. Take a class with her!!"
2805,2577892,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Kharputly is the nicest, most caring human-being, that makes you truly want to read and do well in her class. You have to work for getting good grades, but you feel encourages to do so and you do so with ease. 10/10 would take a class with her again!"
2806,1486313,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Irani is a true gem. However, like a diamond, he is a tough one! If you reach out to him, he does truly care. However, do not sass him!"
2807,1486313,5.0,4.0,100
2808,1486313,3.0,4.0,"Accounting was just hard in general. He moves very fast through lectures, so if you don't keep up outside of class, you will be lost. He treats every student fairly, meaning he gives no special treatment or accommodations. I didn't like that all of the homework and quizzes were done online, because it makes it pretty easy to forget to do them."
2809,1486313,5.0,4.0,Very helpful. Professor Irani makes hard topics understandable and is available to meet with whoever needs his help.
2810,1486313,5.0,3.0,Well written and interesting lectures that go above and beyond in explaining the book chapters. Tests are difficult but he really helps with preparation so they are manageable. Limited homework and it's all online so you get up to 3 submissions per assignment.
2811,1486313,4.0,4.0,really enjoyed this class. It is very textbook oriented and Irani presents everything in a very logical and calm way  Tests are on the harder side but if you really do the reading you will be fine.
2812,1486313,2.0,5.0,"As far as Accounting teachers go, Professor Irani is fine. Having said that, get ready to be heavily confused, heavily overworked and heavily bored in class. Nice guy, teaching just isn't really his thing."
2813,1486313,5.0,3.0,His tests are straightforward-no surprises. Minimal amount of homework. He makes class interesting and is very invested in his students. Would definitely reccomend.
2814,1486313,5.0,3.0,Awesome teacher. Dude is a legend.
2815,1486313,5.0,2.0,He is a fair teacher and extremely helpful when you visit him. Easily my favorite accounting teacher so far. Intermediate I is a ton of material but he gives you all the resources to do well
2816,1486313,5.0,4.0,"His classes and tests are harder than average, and he is less understanding than other professors. That being said, his lectures are very easy to understand, and make it very easy to do the work problems. As long as you do the work problems, you can do well on the test. He is not just a professor, but an excellent teacher."
2817,1486313,4.5,2.0,Irani is a good professor. Lectures are straight-forward and he tries really hard to make sure everyone get its. Intermediate accounting is hard anyway but he does a good job covering everything. Tests arent too difficult.
2818,980471,4.0,4.0,"Ghandi is a great professor and always has interesting thoughts about current events-very easy to go off on tangents. Decent professor but he's not the best. However, he makes it extremely hard to get below a B in the class cause he has some ridiculous curves. And he makes it pretty difficult for you to get an A being less generous on that side."
2819,980471,2.5,1.0,"Ghandi is the man.  It's tempting to not show up to his class, but if you attend it pretty regularly you'll be pretty much set for an A. Besides the fact he's almost impossible to understand half the time, he cares about actually making sure you learn the material. His class is a must have and a good one to take as a freshman"
2820,980471,4.5,3.0,Made me want to major in econ. He's awesome. Period.
2821,980471,5.0,4.0,"Ghandi is really interesting, and loves to teach and make sure his students do well.  My favorite teacher"
2822,980471,5.0,2.0,No freaking idea what macro was until I got his macro class. Talked a lot about the mess that we are in right now that I loved it.
2823,980471,3.0,2.0,The best! Kept me interested in econ which is hard to do. And he's funny.
2824,980471,5.0,2.0,Hes the man
2825,980471,5.0,3.0,"I never purchased the 200 dollar econ book from the school store,barely took notes, showed up to every other class, did ok on the first two test, but I still managed to get a B in the class. Hojat is the man."
2826,980471,4.5,1.0,"Class starts out very easy and gets a little harder after the midterm, but overall it's still a really easy class. Prof Ghandi is super nice and accessible, willing to explain anything you're in doubt of and even tells you all the answers if you ask."
2827,980471,3.0,1.0,Ghandi is really cool and easy. He gives you answers on quizes (the two he gave) and exams when you ask. He's really laid back and chill and not too bad on the eyes. A great class.
2828,980471,3.0,1.0,HOJAT!!! He's the man. Very easy...basically tells you the answers to everything. No reading and almost no homework.
2829,2649591,5.0,2.0,"If you put in the time and effort for this class, you will definitely get a good grade. The professor really cares about the progress you make in class and is always willing to help outside of class. This class really made me fall in love with studio art."
2830,2649591,5.0,3.0,"I have not had very much experience in art and added this class during add-drop to get my art credit. Even though it's an intro to sculpture, I would say it's very fast-paced. The professor is very helpful and wants to help you as much as he can in the class. It is ungraded so the amount of time and effort you put into the class is your grade."
2831,484860,5.0,2.0,"If you're looking to meet your science lab FDR: TAKE THIS CLASS! Most of the class grade consists of 5-6 quizzes (quizzes that are not too hard); ask her what will be on the quiz before you take it, and she will tell you what to study. The labs involve everything from cave exploring to mountain climbing. I love Professor Knapp and 100% recommend."
2832,484860,5.0,2.0,Take. Her.
2833,484860,4.5,1.0,"I had Professor Knapp for the intro to Geology class and I really liked it. TAKE IT SPRING TERM.  Her class is fairly easy.  Go for extra help - she likes that.  Also, try  to be a little extra enthusiastic (she really likes when students seem interested). But yeah definitely take in the spring"
2834,484860,4.5,2.0,"Great professor. If you take good notes in class and pay attention on the field trips, you'll do really well. Extremely accesible, reasonable, and comprehensive.  She likes when students go for extra help and it boots your grade a little bit. Even if you don't like science, take one of her courses."
2835,484860,4.0,2.0,"awesome professor...the first thing she said in class was &quot;call me Elizabeth&quot;.  obviously loves her subject and her job, and is extremely knowledgeable in the field...tests are rather hard, but not HORRIBLE, and it's worth it.  hiking almost every day!!"
2836,2123267,5.0,2.0,"With Prof Smith, you should attend office hours once a week as a habit. But make sure you do your Pavia readings first or she will know! She only takes off a few points, sometimes even a fraction of a point, while grading. Easily avoided by showing up to office hours with it mostly done so she can tell you specifically what she wants in the answers"
2837,2123267,5.0,3.0,Super helpful in office hours especially if you read the textbook and PowerPoints and show you tried working out the assignments on your own!! You're better off going to office hours when not a lot of people are there so that she can spare more time to help you. Can lose a lot of points on low yield and bad product but you can still get an ok grade
2838,2123267,4.0,4.0,"IF YOU ARE IN ORGO LAB, GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! she is very generous with helping you on quizzes and labs, but is a ruthless grader. If you want to succeed in lab, office hours have to be a weekly thing"
2839,2123267,5.0,3.0,"Professor Smith is hilarious, helpful and knowledgeable. She makes sure you learn what you need to, but doesn't purposefully try to trick you on tests."
2840,2123267,5.0,4.0,Professor Smith is a very fair and accessible professor! She made organic chemistry as enjoyable as this class could be. She was very willing to help outside of class and her tests were very fair. Would recommend any class with her.
2841,2123267,5.0,3.0,"She's absolutely amazing! She is very accessible outside of class, and is willing to help you with anything. She is one of the most inspirational professors that I have ever taken here, and would recommend any class with her."
2842,2123267,4.0,2.0,She's great
2843,486921,4.0,4.0,"Tests are HARD but he gives a lot of extra credit. If you generally make an effort in class he will work with you. Not as bad as everyone says, just be willing to advocate for yourself!"
2844,486921,5.0,1.0,Best class I've ever taken! Don't let what people say fool you; He's truly a mathematical god
2845,486921,3.0,5.0,"Dymacek seems to get a bad rap around W&amp;L. Yes, his tests are difficult, sometimes he glosses over material that needs to be explained, but he really is a likable person. He's made his tests easier as the years have gone by. If you dress well for class, sit front row, and show up on time, I guarantee he will respect you and boost your grade."
2846,486921,2.0,4.0,take advantage of office hours
2847,486921,2.0,5.0,Do not take Wayne's class. He knows that students are going to fail going into the tests because they are incredibly hard. He is very intelligent but rambles in class and makes you learn a ton of useless calculus theories and does not apply them at all to the material. Awful experience. AVOID
2848,486921,2.0,5.0,"I have no idea how I made it... Discrete Math is just weird. He is a very nice man, loves teaching Discrete but that doesn't make it easier. I really didn't understand what was going on in the class. If you have to take it my advice would be: EXTRA CREDIT, like always, as much as you can, office hours, and work very very hard on the final."
2849,486921,3.0,3.0,"Dymacek is a very smart man, the problem with his classes is that he does not know how to simplify some of the material so that people who are taking intro-level classes can understand.  While his tests can be rough, he's not the worst grader in the world.  Try to know the concepts and you'll be ok.  "
2850,486921,1.5,5.0,"Worst experience ever. Arbitrary Grader. Not approachable. Doesn't know what he is talking about. Talk about random stuff, and that's your extra credit on your test. Avoid. "
2851,486921,1.5,5.0,"Nice guy, but not a very good math professor. He has good intentions in teaching, but he often thinks that his students can understand material without explaining it well. Really makes you work, and the tests are ""designed to challenge you."" Lectures and tests end up extremely difficult and drift away from learned material. Would not recommend."
2852,486921,3.0,3.0,"If you hate calculus, this is your best bet! It counts as a Math FDR"
2853,486921,1.5,5.0,"The meanest, rudest, most discouraging human being I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. If you want to cry yourself to sleep every night for a semester, then go for it. He is patronizing and unclear and downright sinister. Gets pleasure from his students' struggle. Doesn't believe in what he teaches and often misses class. BEWARE STAY AWAY"
2854,486921,3.5,3.0,"Although Dymacek is sometimes scatterbrained, he knows the material. For his tests he wants very specific procedures to be done. If you do not learn by a quick definition and a few examples you are SOL. Likes to move quickly through material."
2855,486921,3.0,2.0,It is best that you ignore most of what you learned in high school because he will teach you simpler notation and re-explain everything.  He is not always the most clear which sometimes affects your test grades but he gives a ridiculous amount of extra-credit to offset it.
2856,486921,3.0,5.0,"This class was extremely difficult, even having taken Honors Calculus in high school. I barely scraped by with a B-, which is a miracle, considering I hardly answered any questions on the final. He is inclined to bump up the grades of students who honestly try at the end of term, though. Very helpful outside class, not so much in class."
2857,486921,2.0,5.0,"very difficult teacher. it's his way or the highway when it comes down to how to solve the problems. His tests are very difficult too, but he tries to be helpful outside of the classroom"
2858,486921,1.5,5.0,Literally the worst teacher I've ever had.  You really have to know calc if you want to do well. He thinks he's really funny and has a dumb laugh. He prides himself on his ties. He talks more than he teaches and what he teaches is really hard to understand. He's in his own little world.
2859,486921,2.5,3.0,"Very hard to understand unless you know calculus to begin with.  However, he will help you no matter what and answer any question and since everyone in the class was doing awful he made some tests group tests and basically inflated the grades.  Overall he is a nice guy just not a great communicator and makes simple stuff real complicated."
2860,486921,2.5,5.0,"he has a great sense of humor but he is really difficult. He doesn't want you to fail but he will not make passing easy. He hates california, girls, hats in class and calculators."
2861,486921,5.0,1.0,Easy -A! Dymacek!
2862,486921,2.5,3.0,He will help you if you go and asks him but his teaching style is a little confising. Test are hard
2863,486921,3.0,4.0,If you are good in calculus you will do good in this class if not you are screwed like me and like seventy five percent of my class. Even though he gives us both 2004 and 2005 test he makes the 2006 a step harder. However somtimes he does become lazy and barely change the problems. Overall if you can get a C in this class you should be proud .
2864,486921,2.5,4.0,"He seemed to really hate teaching calculus and really hated being awake at 8am more than the students...unlike previous comments, he would give us years passed cold tests and our test would be nothing like it and amazingly difficult.  Even having taken calculus in high school this class was impossible."
2865,486921,5.0,5.0,"awesome class and professor, I would advise any non-major to take Algebra from Prof D, as the topics are simple and non-cyclic and he will give you all classifications of hints to help you solve the homework problems.  You will be abel to use absolutely nothing you learn in algebra in any other class.  Remember, &quot;Easy D-Dymacek&quot;"
2866,486921,3.5,4.0,"Basically, if you're good in math, you'll be fine.  If not, this class is pretty difficult and you'll have to study to make a good grade.  Dymacek is a cool guy and wants you to do well.  Plus, he gives bonus points when the football team wins."
2867,486921,3.0,2.0,"This guy is frickin awesome! I honestly hate calculus, but I love prof D and he makes math fun...seriously. He gives you some extra credit, and explains everything, almost gives you the test too! This guy is hilarious."
2868,486921,3.0,1.0,"This guy is the man. /his class is the best ever: very funny, very easy, gives extra test points for athletic achievements, gives you &quot;practice tests&quot; which are almost the exact same as the real one, and he curves final averages. He had the highest GPA of all the calc teachers last year. Realy funny"
2869,1877514,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Toomey is a great guy; very passionate about economics.  Extremely helpful and accommodating in office hours.  Be sure to do the practice problems before exams, and to take the problem sets easy.  Show up to class, pay attention, do the work, and you will learn a lot about economics"
2870,1877514,4.0,4.0,Great professor. Your grades on exams will reflect how much time you've put in to learn the material. Take problem sets seriously (don't do them the day of). Office hours are extremely helpful. Very accommodating if you email him ahead of time. Class is not mandatory but those who did not come tended to have lower grades. Would recommend. Great guy
2871,1877514,5.0,3.0,Straightforward and approachable. Use his practice materials and go to office hours.
2872,1877514,5.0,3.0,Go to his office hour! His practice tests were really helpful. He is a really energetic person. He's the man.
2873,1877514,4.0,3.0,Incredibly helpful when you ask for it. Cheerful and a delight when he enters the classroom.
2874,1877514,5.0,2.0,"Class is straight forward. Go to class, take notes, and pay attention and you can easily get an A-. Office hours make things a lot easier- definitely use them. Take the homework sets and test practice problems seriously as actually exams will be similar. "
2875,1877514,4.5,3.0,"Toomey is a very approachable, energetic professor.  He tries to liven up the dry material by applying economics to our lives.  He is very good about being available during his office hours.  Microeconomics wasn't my favorite class, but he was one of my favorite professors."
2876,1877514,5.0,2.0,"Professor Toomey is a great teacher and a great guy. He explains every concept very in depth until you understand WHY things work the way they do. Also, he went out of his way to explain to his students that the goal of his discipline is not to turn us into cold, calculating robots, but to get us to think creatively. He is a class-A dude."
2877,1877514,5.0,2.0,"Professor Toomey is a great professor! Very quirky, he practically jumps around the classroom and plays rave music before class. But he's super helpful in office hours and his note packets make class easy to follow. Also, his practice exams are very good to review! Definitely recommend!"
2878,1877514,4.0,2.0,"This was my first time taking microeconomics and Professor Toomey used helpful packets for class which made the material easy to understand. Everything you needed to know for tests could be found in the packets, plus if you missed class it was easy to get the notes from a friend. His office hours were very helpful! Definitely recommend"
2879,153104,3.0,5.0,"Going from GERM111 to GERM112 was like going from pre-algebra to Calculus. Crockett expects way too much out of his students for an introductory German class, and I felt overwhelmed every week. I never got to truly learn the material because I was too busy trying to get comfortable with past material. Also, expect a test and a quiz every week. "
2880,153104,5.0,3.0,"Crockett is awesome. He cares so much about his students and is so passionate about teaching. He really made sure each and every person in the class understood the material, and his tests are very fair. "
2881,153104,5.0,2.0,"Crockett is THE MAN. His play writing class is everything. It's so easy, but so much fun. He is so in love with acting and it really shows through. 100% would take this class again. Cannot say enough about Crockett."
2882,153104,3.5,1.0,"Solid teacher, very few grades but usually makes up for it with surprisingly high grades.  Not always clear on his expectations, but always very interesting."
2883,153104,5.0,3.0,"Incredible teacher to say the least.  Teaching is truly this man's forte.  Really taught from the ground up, making sure that everyone was on the same page and knew what they were doing before he moved on.  Even his tangents about German history were fun and insightful."
2884,153104,5.0,2.0,"great Professor. Im a native German Speaker and he's taught me a bunch in his theatre course. Lots of work involved, but very rewarding. He cares a lot about what he teaches and knows everything about Dürrenmatt & Frisch"
2885,153104,5.0,4.0,"Performing German-- this is Prof. Crockett's forte! Such a worthwhile experience, he is so into it and it is so fun and rewarding to learn how to act, put a set together, and actually put on the play. He is so encouraging and optimistic despite the difficulty of getting non-actors to act... he really loves doing this. Definitely take it!!"
2886,153104,4.5,3.0,"Professor Crockett is amazing-- he is extremely passionate about what he teaches, and he definitely made me passionate about it as well. He is always willing to chat after class even if it's just for the sake of your curiosity. He is very insightful and helpful in his grading, and he's a good friend. this class changed my LIFE. TAKE IT."
2887,153104,4.0,2.0,"Professor Crockett is very involved and excited about what he's teaching and loves to answer your questions. Unfortunately the textbook is really boring, but the fairy tales are always fun!"
2888,153104,5.0,4.0,"Professor Crockett is by all means an incredible professor.  He is extremely knowledgeable, very kind and understanding, and knows how hard to push his students.  You will work hard but the rewards will be more than worth it.  He goes out of his way to make a point on anything grammatical and can be very comical at times.  My highest recommendation"
2889,153104,5.0,2.0,He's funny and lively. Great teacher; very clear and helpful.
2890,153104,4.5,4.0,I've been out of school for several years now and I still remember the things prof. crockett taught me! thanks

2892,153104,4.5,3.0,"Had him for 4 years, he is by far one of the best teachers of German grammar out there. I didn't really understand adjective endings/ passive voice usw...until I studied under him. Don't let his high strung personality scare you off."
2893,153104,5.0,2.0,awesome teacher

2895,1152532,5.0,1.0,"Mish is great! Grades were based on a few tests and the final was a reflection - very easy. Takes points off if you miss class without good reason. Super cool guy, very into what he teaches. If you passively listen during class you'll be fine, assessments are mostly based on examples from class, which he'll make sure you hear. Don't need to read."
2896,1152532,4.0,2.0,"Very engaging and high energy, but talks a lot. An easy A for the art credit. I also kind of enjoyed acting for the first time."
2897,1152532,4.5,2.0,Mish is great! He really pushes you to go outside of your comfort zone when acting. I absolutely loved his class and would take it again in a heartbeat!
2898,1152532,5.0,1.0,"I took Acting I with Mish and it was a dream. Great way to fulfill art credit, any class with him will be easy, fun, and rewarding, you'll love it. Definitely must take him"
2899,1152532,4.5,1.0,"Rob Mish is one of the most interesting people on the W&L campus. PLEASE take one of his classes and get to know him. You actually can't call any of his classes a class from what I have heard and experienced. I mean you learn and work hard, but it's all so much fun that it feels like recess and not an academic credit. LOVE him. You will too."
2900,1152532,5.0,4.0,"Great high energy prof! Really loves to help students improve and recognizes potential talent. Very intuitive; some students find him a little over-the-top, but I think he's perfect!"
2901,1664534,2.0,5.0,"Very unclear in expectations on exams/projects. Tests on SPECIFIC details barely covered in class. 25% of FE was on a subj covered in less than a week. Had 2 presentations, 2000 word paper, 1 test, and studying for final in last 3 weeks of semester. Is helpful in OH and did learn a lot but prob bc you had to study everything in order to pass tests"
2902,1664534,4.0,4.0,"She's very funny and personable. A good professor, but the course material is difficult. Tests are hard, but if you study, you should be okay. I enjoyed her teaching style and learned a lot in this class even though I only took it for a prereq. Just make sure you do your hw and study. Plus, she gives extra credit. That's more than most profs. "
2903,1664534,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Blythe is very funny and engaging, and passionate about what she teaches, which made class enjoyable. She explains concepts very clearly and gives good analogies. A&amp;P is hard no matter what, but her grading is harder. She was very detail-oriented and wanted very specific answers on tests. You really gotta work for it, but it's rewarding."
2904,1664534,5.0,4.0,"The old reviews are really bad, but Dr. Blythe was amazing in intro bio this semester. There was a LOT of work with the group project on top of her super hard tests, but she was a great teacher and I learned so much. She made me work for it and I am definitely taking her classes again!"
2905,1664534,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Blythe makes you work for it, but her classes are rewarding"
2906,1664534,2.0,4.0,"I thought I would like this teacher because she has a great sense of humor. But her tests are always so broad and for the final, there was stuff we never even talked about. She doesn't really care that much about her students and she doesn't know what to tell you when you don't do well on a test. One of the hardest classes I have ever taken."
2907,1664534,3.0,4.0,"When it comes to academic knowledge she is a 10/10. Very knowledgeable and knows how to present the information in a clear manner. She is however one of the rudest professors I have ever had. She treats others disrespectfully and doesn't acknowledge that she is teaching adults and not children, often giving destructive feedback, especially in labs."
2908,1664534,3.5,4.0,"I love her as a person. I have taken several classes with her and you have to work in all of them. You have to attend class or she'll take off participation points, but she is transitioning to teaching in medical school format in order to prepare her students."
2909,1664534,4.5,5.0,"very hard professor. she knows what shes talking about, but thinks she's better than everyone, so can be very rude answering questions at times. tests are impossible. she's a tough grader. you have to work extremely hard in this class for maybe an A- or a B+. i recommend not taking her class as a freshman student. "
2910,1664534,3.5,5.0,"Nice enough teacher, but very hard class. At the end of the day, she's a fair grader and helpful at office hours. Be prepared to work very hard if you want the A"
2911,1664534,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Blythe is a great teacher! She's very energetic and makes an effort to include lots of group work so the class is fun (even a 2hr class). Her grading is medium to hard (the avg.'s on our tests were normally ~85%), so you will have to put some time if you want to do well in the class. She's very fair, so if you do the work you will be fine."
2912,1664534,4.5,2.0,I had a great time in her intro Bio course. Very cool stuff and just the right amount of difficulty.
2913,1664534,4.5,4.0,Dr. Blythe is a great teacher. She is very passionate about what she does and is extremely willing to help both inside and outside of class. She prepares great power points for lecture and always knows what she is talking about. She is a very interactive teacher and incorporates many different teaching/learning styles into the lectures! Great!
2914,331287,4.0,2.0,Took Lambert for survey with no prior computer science experience and he was solid. Almost all classes are in lecture format and can be a bit boring as he just reads from powerpoints. Weekly quizzes and labs but no homework. Very fair grader and gives partial credit on quizzes. Labs are tough but if you ask for help he'll walk you through the code
2915,331287,4.0,2.0,"Lambert's class was good. You didn't need to actually be at lectures to understand things. Labs were alright; the TAs help a lot. I also took his 210 class which is a different story. It was more challenging. Honestly speaking, it is an easy A even if you don't show up but read the ppts."
2916,331287,3.0,3.0,"I was considering a Comp. Sci. minor until I took this class. Not anymore, though, but not sure if its because of what was being taught or how it was being taught. Its safe to say that his lectures were very dry. You wont do well without a lot of studying and reading the textbook. The comments below sum it up pretty well."
2917,331287,4.0,3.0,"This man means really well and knows his stuff, but I'm not sure he'd ever really notice if you didn't attend lecture. He was always super helpful in person or via email in class and labs. I recommend taking him for a CS class if you can!"
2918,331287,2.0,5.0,"Take CS111 with Levy or Sprenkle. After hearing about CS111 from my friends, I wanted to take it, but Lambert focuses his quizzes on vocabulary rather than applications. Labs were great, thanks to the TAs. I learned everything from them. Lectures were pointless to attend.  On the other hand, he does take time to answer any questions."
2919,331287,3.0,3.0,"Really did not enjoy his teaching style. Had 1000% more interaction with TAs. Not very helpful, but alright. Fair grader."
2920,331287,4.0,2.0,Great professor and a great human being! Cares a lot about students. He is an easy grader so you can just focus on learning instead of stressing on grades.
2921,331287,4.0,3.0,"Lambert is very humble and affectionate. He really cares about progress in computer science, and he is very knowledgable about information (He has written a few textbooks). His tests are very do-able if you pay attention to class lectures and readings."
2922,331287,5.0,4.0,"By far, among one of the best professors I have ever had at W&L!  He's really enthusiastic about his subject which keeps lectures from being dull, regardless of one's interest level.  He is always willing to help if you ask for it and will go the extra mile to make sure you understand the concepts.  Tests are fair.  Reading does help a lot."
2923,331287,4.5,3.0,happy to end my undergrad with his class. make sure to ask him a lot of questions when something in his lectures confuses you and he will stay with you til you get it. my favorite of the compsci department
2924,331287,4.5,3.0,"super patient whenever you ask him any questions, even if you have a ton. his tests are something you better study for though, they can ask detailed questions. friendly and helpful professor"
2925,331287,5.0,1.0,"He really wants everyone in the class to succeed.  Super helpful during labs, and exams are easy.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone interested in comp sci"
2926,331287,4.0,1.0,"Yeah, some people say he can be condescending, but when he does that, it's always him trying to help the student out no matter what, so even when he makes a mistake (which occasionally happens) he accepts that he messed up. Labs have peer and teacher assistance as much as desired; extremely easy to get an A in this class."
2927,331287,5.0,1.0,"In short, I get a way higher term GPA when I'm taking his class..."
2928,331287,2.0,3.0,Boring and condescending. Made me want to never take another computer science class again.
2929,331287,4.5,1.0,"Once upon a time affectionately referred to as &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog.&quot; Energetic, sincere, friendly, has a sense of humor, and great at teaching. Didn't need much help myself, but at times when students would be confused about a concept, it's amazing how he could track down the source of the confusion and clear it up. Awesome prof."
2930,331287,4.0,1.0,Very nice person. Easy grader.  Interested in students development.
2931,331287,1.0,4.0,Extremely rude & condescending. VERY unhelpful.  Instead of listening when you have a question he interrupts and leaves your station before you can even get the help you really needed.  Class is BORING.  tests are impossible; its ridiculous to be taking a computer science exam on paper.  by far the worst professor i have had at this school
2932,331287,4.0,2.0,"Why someone thinks he's condescending&#63; When I was programming and met problems, he came over and kneeled to instruct me, and so as to everyone when he was called upon, and he's always been nice and kind.   I like him."
2933,331287,1.5,3.0,The class was haphazard and basically tried to cover all topics possible. Very condescending when talking to students. His solutions are worthless and he once told me to look up a website on how to change the color in html code. The TA was far more helpful that he was.
2934,331287,4.5,2.0,Funny and great guy that loves computer science. Not many people attend his classes and it doesn't matter because all of the notes are on powerpoints.  If not goof at computer science labs and tests can be challenging sometimes.
2935,331287,5.0,1.0,excellent professor!
2936,331287,2.5,1.0,Hmm...  what do I think of Lambert&#63;  He's a nice enough guy but I don't think he teaches programming from a practical perspective at all...
2937,331287,4.0,1.0,"Really really easy class. Optional attendance. Material was a little below me, so it seemed boring, but he was enthusiastic and helpful. A really good guy..."
2938,331287,5.0,1.0,"Great guy, great cook, great teacher.  The class will be easy and fun, and you will learn the material.  If you got this teacher you will be happy."
2939,331287,4.5,1.0,"i dont like computer science, but he made the class enjoyable and fun, i enjoyed his lectures and little tricks to make the otherwise dull and lifeless material entertaining, definately reccomend him"
2940,331287,5.0,2.0,"Made everything crystal clear for me, an excellent teacher."
2941,331287,4.0,2.0,"really easy course, no matter how computer illiterate you are- You will learn a lot..."
2942,955942,5.0,5.0,"Patch is fantastic: interesting and memorable lectures, detailed feedback on papers, and super easy to contact outside of class with questions. Lots of reading and multiple short papers combined with either a longer term paper or a timed essay exam for the final. I've taken two classes with him and would be happy to take more - strongly recommend."
2943,955942,4.0,4.0,"Patch is great but I thought the class was very geared towards people who already knew a lot about German history, so I was at a disadvantage. Papers are difficult, and utilize a less common skill, so definitely go to office hours for feedback. The lectures moved fast and there was less room for discussion than other history classes."
2944,955942,4.0,4.0,Super passionate about German history! Assigns a lot of reading but it's relevant to the course material. Make sure to annotate for class discussions/exam prep. One of those profs who will mark up your essays then give you a higher grade than you'd expect. Gives hints as to what topics will be on the essay part of the exam
2945,955942,4.0,3.0,"He is a very good person who clearly cares about the material. I love history so I loved the material which helped me like the class, but I also enjoyed Patch as a teacher. He gives good clear feed back and is a very fair grader. You will get  what you put in through and through."
2946,955942,2.0,3.0,"An insane amount of reading for a level 100 class. Tough grader on essays and already has a preconceived idea of what the essay should focus on, if you don't write what he wants the lower the grade."
2947,955942,2.0,2.0,"Teaches like a high school class with a powerpoint. This is not what college level history classes are supposed to be like, and you do not learn the argument building skills you're supposed to. You learn a slideshow. Boring and not approachable. No."
2948,955942,2.0,5.0,Class lectures were not definitive in the sense that you were never really sure what topic or idea he was reflecting back to.  His grading standards were skewed based on his original predispositions of thought.  If you didn't write exactly what he wanted or had envisioned then you would essentially be penalized for thinking for yourself.
2949,955942,2.5,5.0,"an absolutely egregious amount of work for a *SPRING TERM* 200 level history course - two 5 page papers, a 15 page research paper, a final presentation, and a final exam. Read SEVEN books. Lab for the course consisted of watching 2+hour black and white (often silent) films. STAY AWAY "
2950,955942,5.0,4.0,"Professor Patch is an extremely engaging teacher with a clear passion for his work.  Even if you aren't particularly interested in history, you will find it almost impossible not to get swept up in the class.  He is an admittedly tough grader but allows you to submit a draft for detailed feedback before turning in the final paper."
2951,955942,3.0,4.0,He's alright.  Gets indignant a lot.  This is not an easy A class.  But if you pay attention and do a little bit in each reading you should be alright
2952,955942,3.5,4.0,"To get a good grade in one of his classes, you're going to have to work your tail off (work load averaged maybe 100 pages of reading a night at times). My advice&#63; Take the easier history professors and steer clear of Patch. He's good, but so are the vast majority of teachers at W&L."
2953,955942,4.5,3.0,"Early Modern Europen history is lots of reading, but Patch does a great job of tying everything together in his lectures. If you can get through the material, the class is very rewarding."
2954,955942,5.0,3.0,Learned more from the two clases I had with this teacher than all of my other classes combined. Incredibly intelligent and makes class very interesting...decent amount of work but not too hard of a grader
2955,955942,4.5,3.0,Great Guy and great teacher.
2956,2002485,5.0,3.0,No idea where all the hate of Prof. Fox is coming from. One of my favorite professors so far. Makes class super interesting and has a huge focus on practical use of course concepts. He teaches by showing you the concepts in the real world. You can tell he knows his stuff and that makes it much easier to learn. Hope I take another class with him.
2957,2002485,5.0,2.0,Professor Fox does not deserve the bad reviews. He was a great professor that made class interesting and easy.
2958,2002485,1.0,1.0,"He is likely to be a future dean since he is incapable of communicating with students and is otherwise useless. The class is a complete waste of time, and the material is completely made up. It is not even worth trying to get an A, because whether you get an A or a D you still learn nothing and lose."
2959,2002485,1.0,4.0,"His class provided students with no real-world, relevant material that would help them in any way. It also didn't prepare us for our ONE graded assignment. For that assignment, few comments were given on the grading rationale, although it was clearly not graded in the manner he said it would be. Unfair class with an awful professor."
2960,2002485,1.0,1.0,Class time consists of 2 main activities: the professor pontificates about irrelevant material or the students &quot;present&quot; the nonsense that they were told to make up. Calling this course a &quot;class&quot; is far too generous. As a Phi Beta Kappa student I can attest to the fact that absolutely no learning occurs in this course.
2961,2002485,1.0,3.0,This is one of the few classes at W&amp;L where I truly believe that I learned absolutely nothing. The course is based entirely on buzzwords and lacks any real substantive material or structure.
2962,2002485,1.0,5.0,This was one of the worst classes that I have ever taken in my life. The entire semester is devoted to a fake group project that most of the class would scrap together at the beginning of each class session. You will learn absolutely nothing and waste your time. This class is about buzz words and being able to incorrectly cite texts.
2963,2002485,1.0,1.0,"Nightmarishly unclear. The criteria he grades everything on is horribly contrived and unnatural. His feedback is superficial and downright unhelpful, so students don't know how to improve; it's like he himself doesn't know what an A-level paper or presentation is. Attendance isn't mandatory but you risk him potentially not liking/knowing you. Avoid"
2964,2002485,1.0,1.0,Final exam was 100% of the grade. We received no grades and little feedback throughout the semester so was very hard to know how to approach the final. The class exclusively focused on marketing for start-ups with a digital focus. Final asked us to do marketing plans for mature companies. He said it would take 3-5 hours but it took 20+ for many stu
2965,2002485,1.0,1.0,"When I was giving a 5-10 min presentation in class, he announced in front of the class right afterwards that he had &quot;zoned out&quot; and missed most of the presentation. Not surprisingly, he gave us no feedback, nor a grade on the presentation. This was typical behavior of his throughout the semester. When he did give feedback it was inconsistent."
2966,2002485,1.0,1.0,"Objectively, many students consider him to be incompetent at his job. He doesn't teach from a textbook and to be honest I'm not sure what he teaches at all. He asks students to invent companies and create marketing plans for them, but gives no guidance whatsoever and no feedback. Says keywords and is very inconsistent in everything he says. Awful."
2967,2002485,4.0,3.0,An interesting professor - some good laugh out loud moments. He switches up the structure of the class every semester. The class was more entrepreneurial focussed rather than marketing focussed.
2968,2002485,1.0,4.0,Gavin Fox is one of the worst teachers I have ever had in my entire life. The only redeeming quality he had was the fact that he brought his dog to class twice and that's it. He never told us what he wanted and when it was due. He would forget and then get mad at us. He absolutely had no idea what he was doing himself and winged the entire course.
2969,2002485,1.0,5.0,He was simply not a good professor.  He is very unclear in what he wants from assignments.  Takes off lots of points for very small mistakes in assignments.  He focuses on key words and not substantive material.  He did not know the material he lectured on very well and assumed the class to be less intelligent than they were.
2970,2002485,2.0,3.0,This is not a marketing class; this is an entrepreneurship class. Very unspecific in what he wants from his students. Course has little to no structure and hardly makes sense what he does. Students throw out statements and he writes the keywords on the board and circles them a bunch.
2971,2002485,3.0,3.0,"All over the place and loves talking about himself. However, material isn't very hard and not very much work. Sometimes I felt like he'd give you a grade on whatever he was feeling that day as his criteria was very unspecific."
2972,2002485,4.0,3.0,"Fox is very into his own app development, which heavily ways into how the course is constructed. This is also an entrepreneurial-based class, so we come up with our own idea and create a marketing plan accordingly. IT IS 95% GROUPWORK. He's a strict grader, but not very clear with what he wants."
2973,2002485,4.0,4.0,Awesome professor! Always available for help and extra office hours if you need it! Taking his class made me decide to pursue a career in marketing. There are times when he is unclear about the assignments but if you ask him he will clear it up! 
2974,2002485,3.0,5.0,"I took Fox's app building class. He is very intelligent and helpful, but the class was terribly organized.  He grades writing assignments to an oddly specific rubric, is an extremely tough grader but isn't specific on what he wants. Don't take this class if you want to actually launch an app, you'd be better off on your own. "
2975,1617461,1.5,4.0,"Likes to tease kids who answer a question incorrectly.  Tests, especially the final exam, included problems we had never worked before and he was shocked when we couldn't ""think outside the box"" during a timed test."
2976,1617461,4.0,4.0,"I took  this class last semester.  It wasn't easy, but I learned a lot.  Making use of office hours helped a lot."
2977,1617461,1.0,4.0,"Run away!! His lectures make no sense and he's not really helpful in office hours either. He does maybe 2 examples in class (on a good day) and assigns homework problems that are 100 times more difficult than the ones he did in class. He also wastes a ton of class time writing out full sentences on the board. Seriously though, avoid him at all cost"
2978,1617461,1.5,3.0,"He's more interested in word choice than math it seems. He's pretty unclear- probably from his seemingly lacking organizational ability. He's enthusiastic and means well, but his teaching needs some work."
2979,1617461,2.0,2.0,"He's a nice guy but he is all over the place and incredibly unclear.  I'd try to steer clear of him, especially if math is not your subject."
2980,1617461,3.0,3.0,Likes to ramble and isn't always clear with what he's talking about.
2981,331329,1.0,2.0,"She takes on too much and ends up not able to dedicate herself to anything properly, so feedback is next to nonexistent. When stressed she makes passive-aggressive comments. Her intro class is okay, but anything beyond that which requires papers, I would advise to pick another prof because she takes your attitude into account when grading."
2982,331329,1.0,5.0,Would not recommend. Prof. Goluboff is I believe well meaning but incredibly unreasonable as a grader. Stay away from this class.
2983,331329,1.0,4.0,This is actually the worst class I have taken at W&L. Professor Goluboff is extremely unhelpful if you have any questions. Seriously do not even bother asking for help. The readings are ridiculously long and the way she tests you is completely unfair and does not reflect your understanding of the material. It's more memorization than anything
2984,331329,2.0,4.0,"Professor Goluboff is passionate about Anthropology and I respect that, but she is not the greatest professor. Even for a 100 level class at W&L, her readings can sometimes be excessive (BTW, if you do not read, you will not pass). Also, her lectures are not the best because they tend to be confusing. Furthermore, her office hours are not the best."
2985,331329,4.0,4.0,"3/4 poor ratings were from ANTH 101...welcome to W&L y'all...we're prestigious for a reason. Wanna go to grad school/do consulting? Get used to reading! Honestly, she is hard to decipher, but for engaged students that attend office hours, she is surprisingly awesome. She does not compliment lightly and holds high expectations! Live up to them :)"
2986,331329,3.0,4.0,she is okay... not too bad at all. she's kinda passive-aggressive and plays favorites but i learned a lot and didnt really hate the class. if she flat ironed her hair and tweezed her eye-brows she could even be kinda hot
2987,331329,2.5,5.0,she's absolutely terrible. this class is awful and i hate having to go three days a week. NO ONE GO!! there's an incredible amount of reading...more than any class i've ever taken. stay away!
2988,331329,2.5,5.0,"The class material was mostly good, but I did not like this prof's teaching style very well. It often seemed as if she didn't know what she was talking about, and some material was very unclear. Also, if the book ever disagrees with the lecture, go with the lecture as she will expect you to. Also, take notes on class discussion, not just lecture."
2989,331329,4.0,5.0,"The best Prof. @ W&L. This professor knows her stuff ... and expects her students too as well, so you're expected to study, read and participate-and be on time for class. Don't take her class if you think you're going to get an A - I don't know anyone who has, but you're bound to learn a lot from a prof who is evidently passionate about her topic."
2990,331329,1.0,3.0,"I loathe this professor. She is inappropriately passive-aggressive.  She also counts tardies the same as absences, so be careful.  Her intro courses are okay, but she is not capable of teaching upper level classes.    She manages to make interesting subject matter tortuously boring."
2991,331329,4.0,3.0,Very nice prof. Loves her subject and is also one of the few younger professors who respects the Greek system. Tough grader but will make you learn to write better. Attendance policies are a little draconian but not always set in stone. Can be tough to tell if she likes you or not.
2992,331329,5.0,2.0,It was a fun class and pretty interesting.  It is a good gen ed if you want to avoid the C-school.  Essays on tests are rather detailed and tough.  Other than that it wasn't too bad.
2993,331329,5.0,1.0,She's really nice and really excited about what she's teaching. she's readily available for questions and her tests aren't that difficult if you study.
2994,331329,3.5,3.0,"Nice, interesting, and extremely intelligent. However she likes to lecture to the floor and the lack of eye contact is somewhat disconcerting."
2995,2563663,5.0,2.0,"Professor Fisher was a fun, energetic, engaging professor. ENV 110 was mostly discussion-based, with Policy Briefs and Stakeholder Roleplays being the biggest assignments. They do take some work, but roleplays are engaging and enjoyable. Policy Briefs are research-heavy, but not too bad and only a few. I highly recommend ENV-100 with Fisher.  "
2996,2563663,5.0,2.0,"Professor Fisher is so calming. Her class requires a lot of participation, but it is so fun, and you come out of it a better communicator. Her topics were engaging, and her assessments were not bad at all. Take this class and have fun. "
2997,2563663,5.0,3.0,"She is so inspiring (I'm actually an ENV major now) and is arguably, the best professor I've ever had. You can tell she truly cares about the subject that she's teaching. Grading wise, she's very fair as long as you put in the work and you incorporate some of the topics that come up during discussions. I HIGHLY recommend her classes."
2998,2563663,5.0,3.0,"After taking just one class, Prof Fisher is easily one of my fav professors at W&amp;L. She is so nice and makes class very interesting and engaging. Seriously recommend any of her classes"
2999,2563663,5.0,3.0,Great environmental studies professor who is both knowledgable and passionate about the environment. Papers are tough but she gives helpful feedback. I would recommend everyone to take at least 1 environmental studies class in their time at school.
3000,1973840,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Lanier is an excellent intro-level bio professor. The class is lecture-heavy, but she does her best to make the lectures interesting, and there are some in class activities. In lectures, Dr. Lanier is excellent at distilling down complex concepts into understandable bits. I learned a lot and loved the class. There is no busy work."
3001,1973840,5.0,3.0,Professor Lanier is so so sweet. TAKE HER FOR LAB IF U CAN. Much easier than Winder. Let us out of class early every week so it never took the full time. Very smart and kind
3002,1973840,4.0,4.0,"Definitely a tough grader-always finds something to take points off for. However, she gives good feedback about your responses. Lectures almost every day"
3003,1973840,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lanier is so sweet! I feel really lucky I got to take her for my bio section this semester. She really helped with understanding in her lectures, and I felt her tests were very fair to the material learned in class. She is also so ready to help students with anything outside of class, and she encourages questions within class."
3004,1973840,3.0,4.0,"Cool lady who is very chill and knowledgeable. The catch is that she is unexpectedly  a really tough grader. I got an A in Bio class but only a B+ in the lab and I'm really sure what I did wrong. People say she is better than Winder though, so Bio 111 people should pref her over him."
3005,1973840,4.0,3.0,"I really liked Professor Lanier, she is very funny and her explanations throughout lab really walk you through procedures. She is a tough grader but she gives very constructive feedback! Go to her office hours before lab reports if you can and take good notes during class so you can write a solid paper!"
3006,1973840,3.5,4.0,"Shes an awesome person and good teacher. Very chill a lot of fun. However, an extremely tough grader, which comes out of the blue. If you go to office hours it helps but she'll still be tough. If you follow the examples and put effort in you should do pretty well though. "
3007,2422352,5.0,4.0,Favorite professor I've had in the C school. Only professor I've had who ties the theories learned in class to current events and topics creating really good discussion.
3008,220768,1.0,5.0,"She's not helpful at all. For the sake of your mental health, don't take. She's the worst!!!"
3009,220768,1.0,3.0,"Abahs lectures are neither insightful nor informative. However, you must attend class because she penalizes you by a half-grade If you don't. Abah doesn't grade timely, dumping grades the weekend after finals. Her feedback is rude even when she gives you an A. I came to W&amp;L for its well-respected journalism department but have yet to find it."
3010,220768,2.0,5.0,Professor Abah is the worst professor I've ever had. She lacks empathy for students and grades unfairly. She chooses students she likes and gives them As while everyone else fails. Her grading and expectations are extremely unclear. She gives impossible pop quizzes with random questions. She is not accessible outside of class. Avoid.
3011,220768,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Abah isn't very accessible out of class, but assignment outlines are clear at beginning of year. Course is heavy in papers, quizzes, presentations, group projects. Pretty high expectations and a tough grader. Lots of guest lecturers and lots of textbook reading and quizzes, but if you put in the work you'll be fine."
3012,220768,1.0,5.0,"Abah is the worst. she puts random obscure law questions on tests that she didn't even come near covering in the class. she gives Ds on tests and then refuses to negotiate or even explain. the comments on the test are merely ""-35"" with no explanation. i think she decides course grades at the beg. of the semester and then grades to fit them"
3013,220768,3.0,3.0,"Professor Abah was very knowledgeable about this topic.  She did a good job of making the class interesting and getting the students involved.  I thought I was going to hate this class, but it ended up being one of my favorites! She's great!"
3014,220768,4.0,3.0,"She is one of my favorite professors! Very helpful, knows her stuff, and she's very approachable outside of class. The reason I'm majoring in Journalism!! Oh and I got a good grade in this class too."
3015,220768,2.0,4.0,"Extremely unaccomidating, no flexibility in regard to required presentations outside of class. Unclearand assignments. The textbook, lecture material and tests are all inconsistant. Guest speakers every day. Overall not a worthwhile class."
3016,220768,4.0,3.0,"This class is the reason I got interested in law and am now going to law school. Although she is a bit difficult to follow sometimes, she is helpful in office hours and very amusing."
3017,220768,1.0,4.0,"Got a good grade in this class, but still feel strongly enough to comment on how unhelpful she is. Very unaccommadating for any mishaps that dont fit in with her schedule. Oh and also, she doesnt even teach her own class. She brings in guest speakers every day. Class time completely unhelpful. I WAS interested in journalism...not now after her."
3018,220768,2.0,5.0,"Class is mandatory, but little material covered is on tests. Very demanding memorization of terms. Tests are completely ridiculous, studying only does so much. Made me question my commitment to majoring in journalism"
3019,220768,2.0,4.0,enthusiastic. hard to understand. knows her stuff
3020,220768,1.0,5.0,100% useless--&gt; this course and prof was the reason i will not major in journalism
3021,220768,2.0,5.0,"Lectures are informative and somewhat interesting, then BAM--her tests and quizzes ask for the most obscure and unrelated facts imaginable. Your time would be better spent praying for a miracle rather than studying for one of her tests."
3022,220768,1.5,3.0,No Comments
3023,220768,2.0,4.0,"She started out teaching at W and L and was very easy.  You could get an A by re-reading the cold test.  After hearing that she was easy, she turned crazy, literally.  She has the hardest questions on her test that have absolutely nothing to do with the reading or class lectures.  Sometimes I think that she wants her students to fail."
3024,220768,4.0,4.0,"Had Prof for 101 as well.  Seems like a different person -- prof actually cares and is passionate about the subject of JLaw, whereas she does not put much time or effort into 101."
3025,220768,4.0,2.0,"very nice, and really not so bad.  she's a little hard to understand but she has a lot to offer, she knows a lot."
3026,220768,2.0,5.0,"One of the nicest people at W&L, but if I wanted nice people teaching me, I'd go back to preschool. She's just incoherent. Oh, and hard. She actually curved DOWN my final grade a full three points. You need to perform a miracle and she has to like you to get an A. I wish I was kidding."
3027,220768,1.5,3.0,"She has no idea what she's doing, she told me that there were only 3 rights in the first ammendment.  Her tests have nothing to do with anything and are more like History of Journalism tests.  I didn't learn anything and never wanted to go to class."
3028,220768,1.5,3.0,incompetent
3029,220768,4.0,3.0,Very helpful with all class assignments.  Cares about student learning.
3030,220768,1.5,4.0,"Her tests are ridiculous, consisting of random facts from the textbook along with multiple lists. She's an ok teacher but has unrealistic expectations for memorization. The class makes people scared of the Journalism school."
3031,220768,3.0,3.0,Professor is very energetic and ambitious in her approach to teaching.  She loves the subject matter.  Basic culture/language barriers can create misunderstandings between prof. and class.  Tests are very fair.
3032,220768,1.0,3.0,A really terrible teacher. If you pay this much to go to college the least you can expect is that your teacher can speak English well. Not the case here. She teaches such a useless course.
3033,220768,2.5,2.0,"you wont learn anything about journalism. the tests and quizzes are nitpicky. if you have a cold test those are good to study. dont bother with the reading, except the bold words. not too hard of a class but very boring and she takes attendance"
3034,220768,1.0,3.0,"Blazingly hot... worth every minute of mind-numbing, poorly-spoken-english blather."
3035,220768,1.5,3.0,Power points constantly. Goes quickly and gets irritated if you can't write fast. Hard to understand sometimes and talks a lot. Very specific tests and quizzes.
3036,220768,2.5,3.0,not the most competant professor you'll have
3037,220768,2.0,2.0,"She doesn't really have the best grammar, which makes me not trust her as a journalism prof."
3038,220768,2.5,3.0,"She's really nice, but the class is boring as **** and half the time you don't know what she's talking about."
3039,1582688,5.0,3.0,"Professor Angie lets her students lead the class discussion, and her insights are super helpful for an intro to philosophy. Her notes and lectures are detailed and very helpful to interpret the difficult readings. She is very attentive and caring, I would definitely take her again for future classes!"
3040,1582688,5.0,2.0,"One of the most caring teachers I have had. Professor Smith wants her student to succeed and is always available for those seeking extra help. She keeps her classes very entertaining, and I genuinely enjoyed going to class each time."
3041,1582688,5.0,3.0,Professor Smith is everything you want in a professor. One of the kindest people I have ever met- take her if you get the chance.
3042,1582688,5.0,4.0,"I took her PHIL-104 class, and it made me want to major in the subject. She's a great professor- super nice, grades fairly and gives good feedback, and has really interesting lectures. The papers can be long and the topic complicated, but if you understand the arguments you should be fine. The lectures help a lot. The final is really tough though."
3043,1582688,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Smith is super nice and very knowledgable about philosophy. She's great at explaining the topics in lectures and she really tries to engage the class so try to participate whenever you can. However, I found the readings to be quite difficult and if you've never taken a philosophy class before, writing a philosophy paper can be tough."
3044,1582688,5.0,3.0,Great Professor!!
3045,1582688,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Smith is one of my favorite professors so far. Participation is key, but you have to meaningly contribute to the class discussion when you do. Sometimes the class can get boring as students ramble, but overall a very fair and straightforward course. What ever difficulties you have Prof. Smith will always help. "
3046,1582688,4.5,4.0,Do not take this class unless you are a philosophy major.
3047,1582688,5.0,3.0,"She teaches some difficult subjects, and that's where all the difficulty comes in.  I've had several courses with Professor Smith and she is hands down one of the best professors on campus.  She is very open-minded, incredibly nice, excellent in her explanations, and very fair in grading.  Take a class with her before you graduate!"
3048,1582688,4.5,5.0,"deceptively hard class but very interesting, and she is one of the nicest people I have ever met"
3049,1582688,4.5,3.0,"Modern ethics. Lots of complicated and wordy readings but class discussions are solid and you can get by fairly wel using her note sheets. She's a stickler about attendance, but a fair and predictable grader and an incredibly kind and intelligent professor"
3050,1582688,5.0,3.0,I never rate professors but Prof. Smith is hands down the best teacher at the school. She can answer any question. Is so fair with grades and her study guides help you through the class. I don't really like Philosophy but I take her classes just because I know they will be interesting and she is so ready to help students.
3051,1582688,5.0,3.0,I love Professor Smith!  She is so nice and gives out the lecture notes from the day every day before class. So helpful when you talk to her outside class and definitely one of the most fair graders at W&L. Highly knowledgable and intelligent. I'd recommend any of her ethics classes!
3052,1582688,5.0,2.0,This is the only review I have ever written. Angela Smith is the best teacher at W&L. Why&#63; She is a fair grader. You are capable of getting an A if you earn it. She is smart enough to answer any question. She always comes prepared. She is always enthusiastic about class. She respects a range of views and does not simply push one on you.
3053,1582688,5.0,3.0,Conveyed the material and class expectations very clearly. I found the work load (in a non-spring term class) to be about average.  The class had a nice balance of lecture and discussion. Very nice as well
3054,1582688,3.0,2.0,Discussion based. Movie ever week. Too much reading for spring term class. Interesting material just at the wrong time for me!
3055,220770,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE Dr. Casey. I know some people feel really negative about him because of his political views, but don't let that put you off. He's really passionate and makes the material really accessible. He can seem snarky at times, but he's just very sarcastic and blunt. I'd highly recommend taking a class with him if possible!"
3056,220770,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Casey was fantastic in this course. The class was test-heavy with 3 exams plus a final. But, all seminar discussions covered the content necessary to do well on the evaluations. The content of the class was fascinating through its examination of technology and the effect it has on our world. Enlightening insight from a fantastic professor."
3057,220770,2.0,4.0,"We were graded on 3 tests plus the final exam. The final exam was not cumulative and was just based off the information that was crammed into the final two weeks of the course. While he is passionate about teaching, he his a horrible grader. Marks a 20 pt. question 100% wrong for a slight error. Also inflicts his political opinions on the class."
3058,220770,1.0,4.0,"Do not take for intro econ. Alongside his radical views (such as suggesting on Twitter that white people shouldn't be allowed to vote), class discussions have less to do with econ and more to do with spouting his political opinions. Fell so far behind that he made us come in for extra evening classes to learn 6 weeks of macro in the last 2 weeks."
3059,220770,4.0,3.0,"Professor Casey is the man. Great class for an intro econ course. Almost no homework. Relates everything to current/real world events. NO TESTS. Few quizzes which were super easy. Makes lectures super interesting. Drawback is that final exam is majority of final grade. Highly recommended professor, would take again."
3060,220770,4.5,1.0,"Great lectures and really gets students interested in the topics. The grading system is a bit unclear, but you will generally end up with a higher grade than you thought. Super helpful if you have any out of class questions and overall just a really chill guy."
3061,220770,3.5,2.0,"Professor Casey is one of my favorite professors. He is very straight-forward and knowledgeable. He graduated from W&L, so relates well to students. He does not care much about grades so as long as you give good effort you will get a decent grade in the class. Highly recommend taking a class with Casey."
3062,220770,4.5,3.0,"Casey is an amazing professor. He's so passionate about development economics, and definitely shares his compassion with the class. He's always willing to help if you need it. And he's one of those professors that really doesn't care so much about grades as long as you make an effort in the class."
3063,220770,3.0,1.0,He taught my Environmental Studies 110 class. It was his only non econ class and he was great. He is very straight-forward and easy to understand. He's very young and was a graduate of W&L so he knows how we actually are.
3064,220770,4.5,4.0,"Extremely interesting professor.  Very interested in the environment and human capital in third world countries and demands participation in class on these topics.  There is a lot of required reading for the classes, however, but most of it is intriguing."
3065,220770,3.0,4.0,never knew which guy would walk into class. one day would be really nice and helpful.  then he'd be the meanest man alive.  not a fan.
3066,220770,5.0,3.0,"Casey and Goldsmith are the only two econ. professors worth taking. He's a really good professor, makes it easy to understand some hard concepts and helps you get the most out of a research paper which if you haven't done a lot of stats seems kinda scary. Overall excellent Prof."

3068,220770,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3069,220770,5.0,3.0,Might be the best professor in the Econ dept. (w/ Goldsmith as the other really good one). Makes a dry subject really interesting and relevant.
3070,421479,4.0,4.0,"If you're pretty good at Spanish and take good notes, you'll be fine. She wants very specific things in papers, and if you don't include what she wants, tough to get an A. Memorize notes for the tests. Lot of reading but definitely doable. I didn't mind the class - she makes you work hard for it, but if you participate, A's aren't impossible."
3071,421479,1.0,5.0,"Legitimately never worked harder to barely get better than a C. Unnecessarily harsh grading and not near enough assignments, so if you bomb one, you bomb the class. I spend 20+ hours on the final paper and got a B- following her instructions carefully. Save yourself, DON'T TAKE PROF CAMPBELL"
3072,421479,4.5,3.0,"I think Prof Campbell is great!  I have had two classes with her and thought both classes were good.  She was always super nice and baked us goodies on the last day of class!  She expects quality papers, but if you participate in class and do the readings, you should be fine."
3073,421479,5.0,3.0,"Campbell was my favorite professor I had last semester. She was really excited about the material, wanted her students to learn and have fun, and encouraged participation. Her grading was fair and she came into class with a great attitude AND candy every day. She does like majors a lot, but she is an AWESOME professor and I recommend her!"
3074,421479,3.5,4.0,"Really nice lady but not the best prof. Her subjects (spanish literature and theater) are boring enough as it is. tough class, very heavy reading and writing. Only recommended for surefire spanish majors. Not a good choice for taking care of a literature requirement."
3075,421479,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. She is incredibly knowledgeable and very organized. She lays out in detail exactly what she wants from you on the syllabus and on guidelines for each assignment. If you do the work and show an interest in the class, you will be fine. If you are lazy or disrespectful, don't expect much from her or from any other W&L professor."
3076,421479,3.0,4.0,"Professor Campbell has a bad rap with a lot of students, but it's not all deserved. She's very nice and knows her stuff, but she can be moody. She is also very feminist, so if you are writing about a gender subject tread carefully."
3077,421479,5.0,3.0,"Professor Campbell comes off as strict and serious in class, but you will get a VERY different impression from visiting office hours. She is VERY helpful, especially when it comes to papers. Class is monotonous (same every day), but will certainly prepare you for tests. Do the readings, visit hours, and you'll be fine."
3078,421479,2.5,3.0,"I did study abroad with her. To be fair, Campbell can be very nice. BUT she changes moods so quickly, acting nice one minute and like she hates you the next. She has no patience with students and has no business leading trips abroad with her bad attitude. She will make you feel stupid and will blame you for stuff that's not your fault. Avoid her."
3079,421479,1.0,5.0,"Most infuriating prof. I've had. Grading is extremely harsh yet arbitrary. Very judgmental, plays favorites. Loves embarrassing students in class, especially males. Instructions are unclear on assignments. Tests extremely hard. Honestly, there are no redeeming factors to her or her class. She has no business teaching here, avoid at all costs."
3080,421479,1.0,5.0,"I regret not dropping her class when I had the chance. Incredibly hard, and acts as if students have no other obligations other than her class. Our final day of class consisted of MEMORIZED 30 minute group representations of medieval Spanish theater. Plays favorites, and is incredibly hard to please once you're on her bad side. Very 2faced; awful!"
3081,421479,4.0,4.0,"VERY intelligent, but gets off to embarrassing struggling students. Likes to expose the lack of knowledge in easy targets. Some may argue that this teaching style is very successful. It worked for me. However, at the same time, she ruins her relationship with students by treating them so harshly. She will only ever have her cat."
3082,421479,2.0,5.0,"Professor Campbell is infact the devil. I don't see how someone who claims to be spiritual, as she does, could be such an evil woman. Her tests are infinitely more dificult than Ruiz's. When she does lose your work, which she will, she will accuse you of not handing it in or misplacing it. Drop her after the 1st class and do yourself a favor."
3083,421479,4.0,3.0,"Professor Campbell is a great teacher that doesn't get the credit she deserves. Her class is simple - read the 4 pages or so of homework assigned, learn what is there, and you will be ready for her pop quizes. Her strictness makes students study and thus, learn alot. She understands the difficulty that students have with learning spanish;GREAT PROF"
3084,421479,5.0,2.0,Prof. Campbell is really helpful and fun if you participate in class.  The class is tough if you just sit there but as long as you try (even if you are wrong) she is helpful.  She is also easy to understand and the homework isn't too unreasonable.
3085,421479,1.5,4.0,Doesn't teach at all and is extremely impatient and impossible to approach.  I had an interest in majoring in Spanish but Campbell makes me weary of doing so.  I had a great teacher in high school and feel like my spoken and written spanish has not improved the least bit thanks to Campbell. Grading was also extremely frustrating and arbitrary.
3086,421479,1.0,5.0,"In one word TERRIBLE! If you are registered for her drop it IMMEDIATELY! It's like dropping Smidka for Econ depratment, there is no question. She isn't interested in teaching at all! Tests are insane and she's impossible to approach. If you tried EXTREMELY hard you could teach yourself, but lets face it we have 3 other classes. She doesn't teach!"
3087,421479,2.5,1.0,"I don't know why everyone thinks this class is hard.  If you are naturally good at Spanish, her class will be an easy A.  If you struggle with Spanish, I guess I wouldn't recommend her because her explanations oftentimes are not very clear.  Quizzes and tests are easy."
3088,421479,1.5,4.0,"no interest in teaching elementary spanish! refuses to speak english in class and does not respond to e-mails in a timely manner. snappy attitude - if you don't answer a question in under two seconds, she assumes you're dumb. i would have taken a different language had i known that i would have to go through her to get to upper-level spanish."
3089,421479,2.0,4.0,She is mean and you have to do the homework to go to class. She never accepts late homework or assignments
3090,421479,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Campbell plays favorites a lot, she'll really like you if you participate in class, but if you don't speak in spanish or like to make up words you're screwed.  Pretty tough grader, but she will make you MUCH better at speaking the language."
3091,421479,3.0,1.0,"I thought it was really easy, but a lot of my classmates didn't do so well. When she corrects papers she might grade against you for doing something she told you to do. Also makes mistakes on tests. She's kind of hard to approach, so usually we'd just ignore it and be happy with what she gave us. People who weren't as good at Spanish really hated i"

3094,421479,4.5,5.0,"Professor Campbell is extremely hard, but as a result you learn so much. She is very clear with her expectations of the class. It is hard work but I definitely came away feeling like I knew my material well. It is obvious that she is a fountain of knowledge; utilizer her as much as possible."
3095,421479,1.0,5.0,She was incredibly hard. I didnt even understand the questions on the test. I mean I could not translate them! Its too much work and too harsh of grading. She is a horrible person and teacher. AVOID HER LIKE THE PLAGUE!
3096,421479,2.0,5.0,"Professor Campbell made my first semester at W & L a living hell.  She gave me my first F, she made me feel stupid and inadequate by calling me out in class, along with everyone else, she did not teach the material especially well, and her  tests are insane. No one should ever take her class. Ever."
3097,421479,2.5,5.0,"If she's not the devil, then she's probably Beezelbub. Her expectations are insanely high, especially considering that she is NEVER available outside of class. Her class is terrible, and hard. Don't take it if you can avoid it, or unless you REALLY love literature, really old literature."
3098,421479,4.0,4.0,Pretty hard class. Pretty good professor. If you like Span. Lit. take the class. I really like the subject. If you're not interested don;t take it.
3099,421479,3.5,4.0,i love this class... granted it's hard but she really does walk us through the material and try to give us as much background as possible. she's NOT the devil.
3100,421479,1.0,5.0,"NEVER TAKE HER, she is the most horrible professor and person ive ever known, she failed me outright and told me to stop coming to class, doesnt teach and expects perfection...avoid her if at all possible"
3101,421479,1.0,5.0,"The devil&#63; Probably not--she'd be proud to let you know if she was. NEVER TAKE A CLASS WITH HER. She expects perfection and refuses to teach her subject, giving only bad lectures, when she occasionally lectures. Also, she never teaches spoken Spanish."
3102,1857127,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed Professor Finch, he is funny and incredibly knowledgeable on the subject of local and state government."
3103,1857127,1.0,5.0,"I knew Professor Finch in an extracurricular context. He was on a committee with me and was not only incredibly rude but also unwilling to compromise, see anyone else's point of view, or work within the group itself. He was consistently condescending and belittling, especially to women. He would not address me, only to the male student on the comm"
3104,1857127,3.0,3.0,"The class was extremely boring, feels more like a history class than a journalism class. Professor was ok."
3105,1857127,3.0,4.0,"Professor Finch is nice to talk to outside of class, but his classes are tricky. His documentary class is very detailed and history heavy, and he expects you to be able to recall specific details on exams. Fair grader on papers, but the tests/quizes/pop quizzes are a real killer. Provided little guidance on a project until the day before it was due"
3106,1857127,2.0,3.0,I am not sure how he is as a journalism professor but I would not recommend taking him for a politics class. I have taken many politics classes here and this class is unlike any I have ever taken- and not in a good way. His lectures do not make sense and his tests are bizarre.
3107,1857127,5.0,3.0,"He made me want to be a journalism major. I would take every class he teaches if I could. If you have the opportunity to take a class with him, do it."
3108,1857127,5.0,2.0,Finch is the man! Highly recommend taking Jour 101 with him and his Spring Term Class.
3109,1857127,4.5,2.0,Had him for the Spring term class. Definitely take! Easy and fun class.
3110,1857127,4.0,4.0,"Awesome professor.  Uses short videos to supplement PowerPoints and make lectures more interesting.  Really enthusiastic about what he's teaching.  Definitely keep up with reading the textbook, because quizzes are hard."
3111,1857127,4.5,4.0,"One of the best professors in the journalism school-- he sincerely cares about his students and wants them to learn material that will actually benefit them after graduation. He is always available (office hours aren't at all necessary) and genuinely tries to give applicable, honest advice. He might be a tough grader, but the feedback is worth it. "
3112,220777,5.0,3.0,"Professor Crotty has such a wide scope of intelligence that he can seem intimidating, but he is always extremely receptive to the ideas of his students and enriches your understanding. As he famously says, his middle name is  Reasonable, He can be a tough grader, but do the numerous readings, do the work, and you will do well. "
3113,220777,2.5,4.0,"Beware of courses called some variation of ""Farce & Friends."" I took this freshman writing seminar thinking we would be talking about modern comedy... boy was I wrong. All we readtalked aboutwrote aboutbreathed was greek comedic tragedies. In regard to the class, it was definitely more tragic than comedic..."
3114,220777,4.5,3.0,"Professor Crotty is one of the kindest and most caring professors at W&L. He has patiently helped me with Greek from the time I barely knew the alphabet up to reading the Iliad in the original language. He takes a personal interest in students and their goals, which is important to me. He is very fair, and if you work hard, your grade will show it."
3115,220777,4.0,4.0,"Absolutely brilliant man; the workload can be a bit excessive at times, but it's worth it. Classics is his life; you will learn Latin."
3116,220777,2.5,5.0,really evil grader!!!
3117,220777,2.0,3.0,No Comments
3118,220777,4.0,5.0,"Don't take advanced latin unless you are REALLY good at translating.  I took it freshman year and was overwhelmed.  He is, however, an unbelievably intelligent man and if you can take one of his classes I highly recommend.  Makes ancient ideas seem relevant to today's world."
3119,220777,5.0,3.0,"I'm probably just rating him hot because I have a thing for intelligence, and he IS smart, but he's also very friendly, respectful (and professional)."
3120,220777,4.5,3.0,"Very enthusiastic.  *Very fair* in tests and quizzes.  Your grade depends on how much you study; no luck involved.  Lots of work, but you will do fine as long as you do what he asks."
3121,220777,5.0,4.0,Really cares about you learning Latin. Extrememly interested in the subject matter and knows more than you could possible try to learn. Funny in a strange kinda way. Makes you work for the grade.
3122,220777,4.5,2.0,"Already having a strong background in latin would make the class very easy, but he does pay attention to detail and &quot;non-clunky&quot; english so you have to be on point."
3123,220777,4.5,3.0,"Was placed into class as a freshman, and having a limited Latin background found that I was in over my head. If you're good at it, though, I really reccommend him. He's brilliant, no doubt about it, and knows everything there is to know about classics."
3124,220777,5.0,3.0,"Really dynamic and energetic. The guy is hands-down the smartest and most over-qualified professor at the school. (Seriously, who teaches undergrads Latin when you've got a Harvard J.D.&#63;)"
3125,220775,3.0,3.0,"Not much of a class at all. Class is essentially optional and you never really do anything in class anyways. The more that you read the textbook, the worse you will do."
3126,220775,5.0,3.0,Really nice professor. Very helpful and thoughtful.
3127,220775,3.0,3.0,"It was all online so it is important to manage your time to turn in the quizzes and labs on time. Easy to get a good grade in, just need to stay on top of your work."
3128,220775,3.0,3.0,"Would recommend for INTR 202 if you've had some previous experience in statistics. Reminds me of a dorky but chill dad. Just make sure you pay attention to the due dates of the various homework assignments, since they're due in the middle of the week. That was the only tricky part for me, personally, having assignments due at 10pm on a Wednesday."
3129,220775,3.5,1.0,"Very, very easy... classes on Tuesday are optional and for a 4 credit class has very little work... The courseware is much harder than anything you'd see on a test and it shows when you get your grades back... Doesn't teach much in class, but the courseware is easy to follow"
3130,220775,3.5,1.0,"It's almost like he doesn't want you to go to class. Skipped over half the classes, because he sent out all the materials over sakai and email. Even though I never went to class, he was always willing to help in office hours. This class is an easy A if you go to class, and an easy B if you don't."
3131,220775,5.0,2.0,"Bad news: Lectures are boring. Especially at 8am. Good news: Professor is most helpful ever. Sends out supplemental resources so you can learn the material anyway. Very approachable. Great guy in person. Class gets waay harder as it goes on, I recommend attending the last weeks, especially. Study hard for the final."
3132,220775,5.0,2.0,"You don't really need to use a textbook in his statistics course, but you do a lot better if you do. The classes aren't very interesting, but statistics isn't really an interesting subject. As long as you pay attention you'll understand what's going on because he is very clear."
3133,220775,4.0,3.0,"I took INTR 202 with him. Very boring. You don't ever want to go to class, and in class you will spend 2 hours learning what could be easily learned in 30 minutes. No homework and his tests are relatively easy nonetheless."
3134,220775,4.0,2.0,"Had him for OB. Very strait-forward. If you do the work and put in the effort, it is an easy A. Just make sure you study his slides and also use the book additionally."
3135,220775,4.5,2.0,Great professor. He makes the class seem not very hard class even for non-math people
3136,220775,3.5,5.0,"Whatever you do, don't take him for Stats unless you're very good at Business/Econ/Management.  If you're a Politics major, transfer sections while you still can.  He reads from Powerpoints taken directly from the textbook, and isn't helpful at all on questions.  I'm sure he's great for other stuff, just not Stats."
3137,220775,4.0,3.0,"Boring as Hell!, but he's very helpful."
3138,220775,5.0,3.0,great teacher
3139,220775,4.5,3.0,No Comments
3140,220775,4.0,3.0,"He's a little bit of a nerdy guy and doesn't have an overly dynamic classroom presence, but he's still a great prof."
3141,1113721,5.0,2.0,"Easy A. She's very flexible professor and will help you if you have questions/ need any accomodations. Class is based around the textbook, which has online homework. No final or midterm. 5 orals quizzes (can take 6 and drop the lowest one). had about 5 mini grammatical quizzes throughout the term."
3142,1113721,3.0,3.0,My class was incredibly laid back and participation-based. Some out of class homework but extremely manageable. Funny and kind woman. Would definitely take Conversation 204 if you like Spanish and need a low work load course.
3143,1113721,4.0,3.0,Very caring and wants her students to succeed. Lots of homework and group work during class but the practice definitely pays off!
3144,1113721,5.0,3.0,Good professor. Willing to help students. Participation really matters in her class so raise your hand.
3145,1113721,5.0,1.0,Dr. Faundez-Reitsma is a wonderful professor. She makes class lots of fun and the work isn't too hard (though there is nightly homework online). Easy to work with and engaging in class. Definitely recommend her.
3146,1113721,3.5,2.0,"Professor Faundez-Reitsma reminds me of my grandmother...caring, focused, and humorous. Beware disregarding her jolliness as excuse to screw off in class-you'll wish you hadn't. The course is straightforward and she teaches a fine line between the textbook and realistic spanish."
3147,1113721,4.5,1.0,"Bring your laptop to class to use the online V-text and can do the homework in class. You can stay after class and she will do the homework with you. Very good and lenient on grading like no other. Best spanish 161 and 162 teacher, just dont take pinto-bailey"
3148,1113721,3.5,2.0,She is a great teacher. Very flexible and willing to work with students. I would take her again.
3149,1113721,4.0,4.0,"Faundez-Reitsma rocks! She is the best prof I had at W&L this year. You'll laugh a lot while learning lots of Spanish. Watch it! She won't put up with crap. She is demanding, but you'll wanna come to class every day."
3150,792197,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely adored Professor Zhu!!! I kind of hated the reading material for this course, but Professor Zhu more than made up for it. She's always happy to discuss and hear different opinions. Plus, she draws really neat connections between literature, history, and language. I'd highly recommend her!"
3151,792197,5.0,2.0,"Zhu Laoshi is the best! Always full of enthusiasm, and willing to go out of her way to help you understand the concepts, vocab, and grammar. Took both 261 and 262 last year, and loved it! I was a freshman, so I was nervous that I wouldn't know anyone, but she is very good at creating a classroom community. Last few classes were online."
3152,792197,5.0,3.0,Prof Zhu is really kind and very good at teaching and explaining Chinese. I look forward to every class because it is so lively and fun! She has lots of funny stories and insight into whatever we are talking about so it's never boring. Tests and quizzes are not difficult if you pay attention in class and do some studying.
3153,792197,3.5,4.0,"She is a really awesome person. I just don't understand why she refuses to finish class early when we were done discussing the text. Her grades were a little arbitrary. It's like if she wants, you can get infinite points off. Maybe it's just the literature class, cause I heard she is not like that in Chinese language class."
3154,792197,5.0,2.0,"Awesome! Very enthusiastic, helpful and approachable! I always have fun in her class (I will miss it a lot). I love her!"
3155,792197,5.0,4.0,"Excellent substitute for Prof. Fu during his sabbatical.  She might even have a better command than he of the English language and does a very good job with explanations.  Extremely nice, sincere person."
3156,2219657,5.0,3.0,"Probably the best language teacher I've ever had! The class is a perfect mix of speaking, listening, and writing, and his energy and passion for the language/culture in infectious. The language itself can be confusing, but the class is more than manageable if you keep up with homework and participate in class. Highly recommend."
3157,2219657,5.0,4.0,"My favorite teacher I have ever taken at W&amp;L, by far. If you show up to class and come to his office when you need help rather than faking your way through it, you will shine no matter how difficult you find languages. He cares about his students more than anyone I have ever met and you can come to him with anything you need. #rushArabic"
3158,2219657,5.0,3.0,"Arabic with Edwards is challenging but worth it. You'll get out of his class what you put in to it. If you do the homework and devote time to it, it'll be easy; if you place Arabic on the backburner and don't focus too much time on it, it's gonna be challenging. Estaaz Antoine is a great teacher and always helps us find ways to apply our knowledge."
3159,2219657,5.0,4.0,He's an awesome person. Arabic is a hard language but he'll lead your way to get there. He's very approachable and inspiration because he had been in the same process of learning Arabic and he has a lot of fun experiences in the Middle East. The class is very organized and your work every day counts towards your grade.
3160,2219657,5.0,4.0,"He will push you harder than you want at times, but you'll find without a doubt that he will make you progress in the language faster than you ever expected. Your final after first semester is a 10 min, casual convo with him in Arabic, which sounds crazy, but you'll be able to do it because he's truly an awesome professor. #rushArabic"
3161,2219657,5.0,4.0,"Professor Edwards is a great language teacher. The course goes at a somewhat fast pace, but he does a good job of ensuring that his students are able to keep up with it. He's easily accessible outside of class and generally a friendly person to talk to. Very much enjoyed this class and will continue taking Arabic."
3162,2758281,5.0,3.0,"By far the greatest Professor at Washington and Lee university that I have ever had. Teaches students how to think for themselves and become autonomous adults. A real lesson in how to live ""The good life"". Anyone who dislikes Zapata is too stupid to understand what he is saying. This professor encouraged me to do valuable things with my life. "
3163,2758281,2.0,1.0,"Professor Zapata thinks the world of himself and will make sure you know it. Classes are very lecture heavy, he will cut you off if you try to speak. He is excited about philosophy, but not so much about teaching (i think). The assignments are vague and the grading criteria is arbitrary. Only take this class if you don't care about your GPA."
3164,2758281,4.0,3.0,"Professor Zapata expects students prepared for class and essays that are well researched and organized. Apart from the weekly readings, the workload is far from difficult, and he makes the time that you spend on essays worth it. Always available to ask for help and is very clearly excited about Philosophy"
3165,1130123,5.0,3.0,Best professor!
3166,1130123,4.0,2.0,"Blunch is a good guy and he really cares about his students. 203 was asynchronous because of COVID and he made the class very easy to navigate. Blunch made sure that there was not a huge amount of stress. There was a lot of group work which was kinda difficult to manage but other than that, asynchronous metrics was great."
3167,1130123,3.5,3.0,"Blunch is a great guy - tells ""dad jokes"" all through class. I'll admit the accent is a little rough to get through, but he knows & tries to clarify often. Econometrics is overall a boring class but his group project and case studies made the class much more interesting. The powerpoints are posted before class & are good to take notes on directly"
3168,1130123,3.5,2.0,"Although his accent is tough to understand at times lectures are helpful. All power points are now provided before class so more time is spent on questions and problems. Is slow at getting back assignments, but they are fair and follow the content of the lectures. Always willing to help out, especially on the project. "
3169,1130123,4.0,1.0,Blunch is an absolute boss. He makes a boring subject bearable and is a great dude on top of it.
3170,1130123,4.0,4.0,"The workload definitely picked up as the semester went. Though some complain about a lack of structure (Ill admit there was a little less than Id like), the econometric knowledge you pick up on the way is invaluable if you want to go onto 399. The class builds nicely off of 203 by going into 2SLS"
3171,1130123,2.0,3.0,Class lectures are the book outline projected onto the screen. Tests come entirely from a testbank so who knows what it will be. Everyone deserved an A because nobody put forth any effort including the professor. Great guy but awful class.
3172,1130123,5.0,2.0,"Blunch is a great professor- he is always available to help outside of class, he has a great sense of humor, and he is a fair grader. . I am not an econ major and managed an A- in econometrics. I genuinely enjoyed attending class each day."
3173,1130123,3.5,1.0,he is the man!
3174,1130123,3.0,3.0,"Stats isn't really my thing, and I still pulled off a B without really having a firm grasp of what I was doing.  However, I fell asleep in class nearly everyday because all you do is copy notes from the projector.  I can't complain too much, but I feel like I could have learned a lot more."
3175,1130123,1.0,4.0,"Boring, incomprehensive, scattered lectures. I learned plenty interesting stuff in the readings and he has you copy notes from a projector that are decent but class is pointless except to copy the notes. His tests are half about how much you can think like the professor and half about what you actually learned"
3176,1130123,2.0,4.0,I'm currently in his class. I dread going everyday bc it's sooo boring! Material for tests fall out of the sky and He's terrible! He is a Nice Person just  a TERRIBLE professor!!!!
3177,1130123,1.0,4.0,hard to understand. boring. lots of work due right at the end of the semester.
3178,1130123,1.0,5.0,No Comments
3179,108183,4.0,4.0,"Very knowledgeable, engaging, and funny. Lots of hard reading, but he explains it in class. Graded by few things and slow grader."
3180,108183,1.0,4.0,Quick reminder to not take this man for people registering soon
3181,108183,1.0,5.0,Professor Morel is so pompous that it gets in the way of learning. This guy needs an attitude tune up.
3182,108183,4.0,4.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Morel's class. Not a politics major, but I would take another class with him if given the chance. He knows his stuff inside and out, sometimes comes off a bit pompous but he's really funny and cares about his students. He's a tough grader but it's because he knows we can be better. Workload was average. PARTICIPATE."
3183,108183,1.0,5.0,"Professor Morel is overconfident and snarky in his lectures. He does know his stuff, but his attitude during lectures makes it extremely hard to learn. On top of all that hes a very tough grader. If your looking for a painful class that drops your GPA you found the guy."
3184,108183,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Morel is fun, knowledgable and engaging. Although he sometimes spent too much time on one thing, he did hit the focus and wouldn't test you on materials he didn't touch in class. I started off struggling in class, but I went to Prof. Morel's office hour frequently (actually went over time most times) and improved. He was patient and helpful."
3185,108183,5.0,4.0,Prof. Morel is probably my favorite professor on campus. He's very knowledgeable so his lectures were always engaging. Oftentimes he went off on tangents so we were behind the syllabus for most of the semester. He's a tough grader and there were a ton of pop quizzes so make sure to keep up with the reading.
3186,108183,4.0,5.0,"Morel is super smart, but he's not afraid to show that off and sometimes it comes across as picking on students. This class was lot of work, and it was pretty difficult for an intro class. There's a lot of reading and you definitely have to read closely because he gives really arbitrary reading quizzes and you have to participate in lectures."
3187,108183,4.0,5.0,"He is very engaged in class. You will have a lot of work to do. He is the expert on Lincoln. He is the worst grader ever. He took months to turn back assignments. He even returned my final grade for class a week after grades were due. No one got an A in my class. Do not expect to get an A. If you want to learn about Lincoln, take class."
3188,108183,4.0,3.0,Professor Morel is the best professor I have had for politics so far! I plan to take his classes as often as possible before I graduate.
3189,108183,3.0,3.0,"An intelligent man, but acts like he needs to prove this all the time. Very full of himself, but if you don't mind that, it's okay. Good sense of humor, but generally uncaring about students. Lectures were interesting at first, but got pretty boring pretty quickly."
3190,108183,4.5,3.0,"A truly insightful class taught by an engaging and interesting professor.  At times there seemed to be a lot of reading, but it was all quite relevant. Prof. Morel was great at explaining several concepts and theories of African American history and culture."
3191,108183,4.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I have ever had. He is the best. Tough, no doubt, but SO worth it."
3192,108183,5.0,5.0,"Morel is hands down one of the best professors I've ever had. You'll work like a dog to get a B+/A in his class, but it's worth it. He's a little cocky, but for good reason. Incredibly well-learned and a great speaker. I highly recommend any Morel class, it's sure to be great."
3193,108183,5.0,4.0,"He will make you work, but you will learn a lot in the process. The more you put into the class the more you will get out of it. If you participate in class it will help his opinion of you, and your grade, immensely."
3194,108183,2.5,4.0,"He picked very interesting works of political philosophy, but he did a poor job asserting key points. The class was discussion-based, so he, in essence, taught whatever the class wanted him to. The drawbacks of his pedagogy were immense: no one knew what was important. I did well in the class, but his grading and quiz questions were arbitrary."
3195,108183,4.5,4.0,"The best professor I've ever had. Difficult, but he relates the material to you and is too the point."
3196,108183,3.5,4.0,Extremely knowledgable.  Likes your work to be concise and to-the-point.  Will put you on the spot and have you explain yourself which can be a tad intimidating.  Good natured and friendly.
3197,108183,5.0,4.0,"I was wary at first because people have called him &quot;condescending&quot; and full of himself, but I don't get that vibe. He's just extremely smart and very good at asserting key points. I love the use of primary sources--something the other 100 professor doesn't do. We read what the founding fathers wrote, and Morel helps us interpret-he IS the textbook!"
3198,108183,5.0,3.0,Great Professor. Excellent Lectures. Unique Sense of Humor.
3199,108183,4.0,4.0,"Demanding work load but interesting teacher.  If you're willing to go to every class and work hard on your papers, you'll be fine."
3200,108183,4.5,4.0,"I thought he was challenging, but that he was an extremely fair grader.  He was also really interesting in class and made the federalist papaers relevant to modern day."
3201,108183,1.0,5.0,Jerk. Hated the class. Changing my major.
3202,108183,1.5,5.0,"Morel is a jerk.  He doesn't care about anyone but himself.  He belongs at some big research university where he could stride into the lecture hall, spout off for an hour, and then leave.  You cannot receive a good mark from him without regurgitating his philosophy verbatim."
3203,108183,5.0,4.0,Took Black American Politics with him.  I was not interested in the subject at all and expected to dislike the subject matter.  Ended up being the best class I took at W&L.  He is a tough grader but such a fantastic teacher that it is worth a little lower grade.  A must to take for every W&L student before graduation.
3204,108183,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. His classes are interesting and you can actually stay awake the whole time, which was a new experience for me in a politics course. Do the reading, and you should be fine. Tests are all essays but not so bad. Participation is a must."
3205,108183,5.0,4.0,"I don't see any favoritism towards girls that everyone talks about. Just do the reading and participate in class and you'll succeed. More focused on class participation and tests than on actual essay writing, which is nice in a politics course."
3206,108183,4.0,2.0,"Very cool guy.  If you talk in class, you're good to go.  If you don't, you might have issues.  Make sure you pay attention and act interested.  Totally makes the difference...he helped me out on some tests because of my participation I think."
3207,108183,4.5,5.0,"His class is interesting and engaging.  I didn't see him favoring girls, but he does grade pretty harshly, and is intent on details.  It is true that if you miss a single detail you get a B, but oh well, it's W&L."
3208,108183,1.0,5.0,I am not sure if he loves Lincoln more than he loves himself.  I am guessing NOT.  Pompous ass.
3209,108183,1.0,2.0,"For a guy who is so intent to show why his is a Christian, he is the most arrogant guy you will meet.  At this school, that is saying a lot."
3210,108183,3.0,5.0,"His class is entertaining and discussion-based (10% of final grade is participation!). He is dynamic to make material interesting, but is the harshest grader I have ever had.  Forget one detail on one of four essay exams and you're at a B.  Felt he was uninterested when I went to office hours."
3211,108183,4.5,4.0,"Tough grader, but makes the Federalist Papers fun.  Class is easier if you're female; he takes mercy."
3212,108183,4.5,3.0,"Good teacher. The class is more discussion than lecture which I really liked. Class participation is a must. Tough grader though, the tests are pretty hard."
3213,108183,3.0,3.0,It helps if you are blonde.
3214,108183,3.0,5.0,Destroyed me during pledgeship too... if you do the reading you'll do ok i guess.  I just couldn't get better than a C+ on tests.  Loves girls.

3218,532124,4.0,5.0,"Professor Fu was generally an excellent Chinese teacher. My biggest complaints are that he struggled to explain grammatical concepts, did not emphasize the importance of tones, and that he moved extremely fast even when it was clear that the entire class was confused. However, he'll give you an extremely strong foundation for the Chinese language."
3219,532124,5.0,4.0,"Fu Laoshi is a great professor, he really cares about his students and are always available inside and outside of the classroom to help you with your Chinese. Definitely make use of his office hours and pay attention in class, Chinese is a very difficult language for beginners. Be prepared to work an average of 2 hours every day for the class."
3220,532124,4.0,3.0,"I really like him as a professor, but the school's curriculum is awful. the first year of Chinese is focused on reading and writing, with little speaking. every week we had to write 10-20 characters, each 20 times (and some chars. have 15 calligraphy strokes). the writing hwk was very very time consuming, and at the end I still couldn't converse"
3221,532124,5.0,3.0,"Professor Fu is incredibly invested in your education. If you put forth the effort and take the time necessary to complete the homework, then it's an easy A. If you don't, then you will not do as well. Fu saw my interest in the subject and got me 5,000 from the university to study in China, so hard works pays off. He is a very traditional teacher."
3222,532124,4.5,1.0,Very Smart man. Knows chinese and english very well. Sometimes doesn't know how to explain the chinese grammar in the easiest to understand way. Good teacher. If you work hard shouldn't be too difficult. Although the grammar is hard.3773
3223,532124,1.5,2.0,he's an easy teacher but a total ****bag. he likes to laugh at you if you get a question wrong and will often only call on people who aren't paying attention. i dislike him strongly
3224,532124,4.0,1.0,he's super easy and gives lots of bonus points but you have to study a lot and come to class. hes also a total ****.
3225,532124,5.0,2.0,"very thorough with his teaching.  makes concepts easy to understand.  genuinely nice guy.  likes to make jokes, not necessarily funny ones, but makes the class relatively enjoyable.  there is a fair amount of homework, it's good to work together with your classmates."
3226,532124,5.0,4.0,"Professor Fu is just an amazing professor. The class itself is a lot of work, but if you put in the effort you will be rewarded. Plus, you really end up learning so much from his class, I'm amazed at how much Chinese we've covered in such a short period. He is kind and helpful outside of class. I really like him and highly recommend him!!!!"
3227,532124,4.5,4.0,"Awesome teacher - so nice and always willing to help.  If you put in the work (a lot of it), he will make sure you get the grade you deserve."
3228,532124,4.5,4.0,"Smart as hell, class is very hard, but he'll get you through it if you're willing to work."
3229,532124,4.5,3.0,"Great professor, did some great reading and he did a great job bringing it alive.  Only critique is that he's fluent with English, but hasn't quite yet mastered it.  The man's damn smart, this will probably change quickly."
3230,532124,4.0,4.0,"He really tries to help you out with the language. It's a ton of work and definitely not easy, but as long as you put in the effort he'll try his best to make sure you do well."
3231,532124,4.0,4.0,"He really tries his best to help out students, although sometimes he becomes a little confused by English.  His class is a ton of work -- be prepared.  Definitely NOT an easy A."
3232,532124,4.0,5.0,No Comments
3233,108193,3.0,4.0,"The class and his lectures are very interesting. The work involves short story readings for every class with a possible writing quiz after every one as well as a couple essays; however, he gives you what you need to survive the course and do well."
3234,108193,3.0,4.0,"Professor Oliver as a person is very kind and fun to interact with. However, I would be careful taking his class if you do not feel confident in your writing. Definitely take every paper to the writing center. The syllabus for my class was not very thorough, meaning we had to wait for when he decided he wanted to assign something."
3235,108193,1.0,5.0,"Bill was the hardest grader I've ever had in my life. Would bring papers in to get help, he would give suggestions but then mark me down on the very suggestions he made. Never helped me become a better writer in my &quot;writ&quot; class."
3236,108193,4.0,4.0,Professor Oliver is very nice. I thought he was super helpful and learned a lot from his creative writing class.
3237,108193,4.0,3.0,This class was relatively low outside work for a spring term lit class. Dr. Oliver was extremely helpful during office hours and was very passionate about the material. Fair grader and fun class!
3238,108193,5.0,4.0,"Professor Oliver is by far the best writing instructor I've had. The discussions are fantastic, and he grades fairly. His short essay quizzes may be hard at first, but go to office hours and he'll make sure you understand what to do"
3239,108193,4.0,4.0,GO TO OFFICE HOURS FOR EVERY TAKE HOME PAPER! fun class awesome material but you wont do well if you dont go to office hours.
3240,108193,4.0,4.0,"This class was titled ""rebels, misfits, and outcasts."" The reading were very good- he loves short stories.  Writing quizzes about once a week in class and 4 papers per term.  He is a tough grader on papers.  Most people in the class come out with a B.  Although it was hard work, this was one of my favorite classes.  Worth taking"
3241,108193,3.0,4.0,"Oliver is great. Although he is somewhat dull and very odd you'll like him. Work hard, and you'll make an A. Invites students to his house. Considered making him my honors thesis advisor. "
3242,108193,2.5,3.0,"This class was a mixed bag, I was expecting more freshmen for a 200 level but it ended up being a lot of senior english majors killing time, so my essays were read next to those (not helpful for a science major). Office hours were very helpful though. Discussion-based classes are tolerable but lecture-based classes are unbearably boring."
3243,108193,5.0,3.0,LOVE this guy. Take him for sure. Office hours are incredibly helpful.
3244,108193,2.5,3.0,"He's a nice guy and means well. Class can drag and at times he is unclear with directions. When you see him in his office he really tries to help you, but otherwise pretty dull. Nice guy though"
3245,108193,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher.  Makes class discussions enjoyable and definitely provides a wealth of knowledge.  Attendance is mandatory and in-class writings are frequent, but he does not grade them too hard.  Overall a great teacher with superior knowledge and a desire to help."
3246,108193,5.0,2.0,Easily my favorite professor.  Great guy and a great teacher.  He is very helpful especially if you go in to talk to him about a paper.  If you speak up in class and talk to him about your papers an A is easy.
3247,108193,5.0,2.0,"I've taken Oliver twice and he is the man without a doubt. He's incredibly kind and loves you if you speak up in class. Take notes and use them in your essays and go see him for office hours and you shouldn't have trouble getting an A- if you write pretty well. One of the genuinely nicest people at W & L, cool ass dude"
3248,108193,4.5,3.0,"Amazing teacher, very interesting, if you pay attention in class you will do well. make sure to do well on the first paper cause the grades seem to reflect the very first grade all semester long."
3249,108193,4.0,2.0,"Some people think he's boring or monotonous, but I thought his class was really interesting, and he seemed to genuinely enjoy teaching the material. The essays were pretty easy if writing is your thing, but if you're more of a science or math person, it could be difficult. He likes the people who speak up in class and have something relevant to say"
3250,108193,5.0,4.0,Great teacher
3251,108193,4.0,2.0,"the reading load is extremely light for an English class. he's nice. The only right answer is his answer, so take notes of what he says in class and its not too bad. He is a harsh grader otherwise, so make sure you agree with him. I liked the class"
3252,108193,2.0,5.0,Don't under any circumstances take this class.  The professor is terrible.  He grades incredibly harshly.  There is a quiz almost every day and it is literally impossible to get any thing higher than an A- on them.  You basically can't answer his questions in any way other than the one that he thinks is right.
3253,108193,2.5,3.0,"Not a ton of reading, but the few books we did read we talked about for 15 minutes and then moved on. Very little analysis, essays were not graded too harshly, but class was dry. If you want to sleep through class, do it in class, and not out of class, he marks down for absences and tardiness like it was his job...."
3254,108193,2.0,4.0,"I took his class fall semester freshman year. he is boring, unapproachable to the point of making you feel as though you're wasting his time, harsh grader. definitely will NOT be taking another of his courses. what a ****."
3255,108193,5.0,2.0,He is so nice. There was not a ridiculous amount of reading. He really helped us understand the material and was very helpful with papers. Great professor.
3256,108193,5.0,3.0,"I came into this class as a student who likes to read but hates to write.  He graded the papers kind of harshly.  Other than that, not too bad.  I suspect that he bumped up my grade a little at the end.  Not a bad class."
3257,108193,5.0,1.0,Light workload.  Easy grader.  Interesting readings.  Extremely fair and open-minded.  Overall: very good class.
3258,108193,5.0,2.0,"Class is mostly discussion, so it's not that hard.  I'm not a very good writer and I made decent grades on papers.  He's very helpful if you go talk to him about papers beforehand, and he's a pretty nice guy."
3259,108193,4.0,2.0,"Great prof. He is really funny...in his own way...as in he laughs at a lot of his own jokes and things he says. His facial expressions are hillarious too. His quizzes are easy. His papers are tough to get an A on, though. Light work load, interesting (and short) classes, good readings. A good prof."
3260,108193,4.5,2.0,"This guy is the nuts. He will laugh at anything, especially himself. He makes the class pretty fun and the work load is very light. He may be hard to figure out grade-wise but he will give you opportunities to bring it up. This guy rules. And he's hot."
3261,108193,4.0,1.0,"This guy is awesome. Very limited reading. He is a little monotone. But the work load is very light. I think he is a fair and really ppretty easy grader. Good man, good class"
3262,108193,1.0,5.0,not good
3263,108193,3.0,4.0,He teaches the material very well and the class is enjoyable.  His grading is very random and struggles to give a clear example on what a good paper in his mind is.  Don't expect a good grade unless you can read his mind!
3264,108193,1.5,4.0,He rarely holds office hours and never checks his email for questions.  He is a tough grader.  My class was the only 105 with a final paper and exam.
3265,108193,1.0,4.0,"Unfair grader. Extremely monotone. Gets pretty pissed when you fall asleep in his class, but can he really blame me! Isn't clear as to what constitutes a good grade."
3266,108193,2.5,5.0,Students only do well when they have his same opinions.
3267,108193,1.5,2.0,He's not fair with the way he grades. He has favorites :( !!!
3268,108193,3.0,5.0,No Comments
3269,1633954,5.0,3.0,"SPE is great, one of the best professors on campus. He is very kind, caring, and approachable. He is not a difficult grader at all, but you must put effort and time into each assignment."
3270,1633954,5.0,3.0,"SPE is by far one of my favorite professors here. He has no trouble relating to the workload of his students. His grading criteria is super clear and fair, but if you do not put in a bunch of effort both in and out of class, he won't go easy on you."
3271,1633954,5.0,1.0,"Swedish theater was amazing. SPE is a great guy who really cares about students, and the course was not very work-demanding"
3272,1633954,4.5,3.0,"He is awesome! I was in his Swedish Theater class, and he was very knowledgeable and cool."
3273,1633954,2.5,4.0,He tried to make Intro to Theater difficult and made attendance mandatory at 9. Have to see 3 plays and act in your own plus a paper or two. Also gives quizzes over the readings.
3274,108196,3.0,3.0,"Novack is very nice, a smart guy, and cares about his students. However, he strays off topic so often you might take one note the entire 90 minute class. If you have the patience to listen to him drawl on about insignificant stuff that doesnt relate to class, he's a good professor. If you can't suffer that, don't take him."
3275,108196,4.0,4.0,"Professor Novack was a very nice guy who was very clear about what he wanted to be done in the papers he assigned. His grading is tough, but improvements can definitely be made"
3276,108196,4.0,4.0,The most amazing and helpful professor I've had at W&L. He genuinely cares about all his students and their success. Do not hesitate to ask him questions!!!!  
3277,108196,4.0,2.0,"He is a really interesting professor and I have learned many interesting things from him. His class is just fascinating and he always talks about something interesting (even though sometimes he is disorganized and he easily starts talking about stuff that is not immediately related to the subject). Sometimes he is hard to follow, and grades harsh."
3278,108196,4.5,4.0,Great professor with excellent interest in the subject and compassion for his students.  Is flexible with due dates for legitimate student need.  Everyone should take at least one class with him.
3279,108196,3.0,3.0,"A very, very kind teacher, willing to spend time to help students go over the material. However, his lectures are INCREDIBLY disorganized and gave the class nothing resembling a survey of sociology.  Plus, in all seriousness, he is a female chauvinist in his understanding of the relationship of men and women at W&L.  A frustrating waste of time."
3280,108196,4.5,4.0,"Professor Novack is absolutely wonderful, one of the best teachers I have had.  He is very compassionate and understanding.  You will learn more from his class than you ever dreamed--and things that are useful in the real world not just in school.  If you enjoy writing and analyzing, it is a great course to take.  I would highly recommend it."
3281,108196,4.5,3.0,Professor Novack is so nice and helpful. He really does care about his students. Not too hard to make a B but have to work hard for an A. I would definitely recommend him.
3282,108196,5.0,4.0,wonderful professor. very helpful and willing to work with you to improve.
3283,108196,4.5,3.0,"novack is the absolute nicest teacher at the school,  he makes intro to sociology really interesting.  while it's really not a piece-of-cake kind of class (his lectures can get a little complicated and fuzzy), he's extremely helpful if you just go talk to him-- he clears everything up for you pretty easily"
3284,108196,4.5,3.0,wonderful professor. very helpful
3285,108196,4.0,4.0,"This guy will make you challenge the way you view everything about the world. Do not graduate from W&L without taking one of his courses. Sure, the Boston accent is a little difficult to grasp, but the content of his courses is amazing."
3286,108196,4.0,2.0,so charming- but very difficult to understand his accent. good gen ed.
3287,108196,5.0,3.0,"This guy is just plain awesome.  Very cool dude.  Loved his class, and really liked the material."
3288,108196,3.5,3.0,interesting classes
3289,108196,1.0,3.0,"Unless you'd love spending an entire class disucussing why a &quot;stereo&quot; is a stereo, stay away from his classes. It's basically a waste of time."
3290,108196,4.5,3.0,Professor Novack is the absolute best professor at W&L.
3291,108196,4.0,2.0,A great guy who is really passionate and tries to get students to think. Lectures aren't terribly interesting. Loads work in the second half of term in essays.
3292,108196,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3293,108196,4.5,1.0,I learned so much is this course and love love love Prof. Novack...he is the dearest person and really knows his material! Take this class (or anything that he teaches!)
3294,108196,4.5,3.0,he never forgets his specialty-gender issues..can relate anything to that..=P
3295,108196,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor at W&L! I had Dr. Novak from '91 through '93 and he was patient, enthusiastic, and taught us to think beyond the confines of a conservative campus."
3296,108196,5.0,4.0,No Comments
3297,108200,5.0,4.0,she's the best!! intro to social isnt really a breeze but its super interesting. her tests out of a low amount of points so its pretty tough to get an a. but she offers a lot of other essay/journal report opportunities that if you put work into and meet with her you'll get like a 97
3298,108200,5.0,3.0,"She makes the class interesting and applicable; this class changed a lot of my perception of myself and others. Tests are based on lectures and readings, but Dr. Woodzicka's energy and openness makes the course enjoyable. Just pay attention, read, and study"
3299,108200,3.5,4.0,"Didn't have to try to hard in the class, but she sure made us laugh. Quizzes were difficult but she was an easy grader when it came to papers and projects. "
3300,108200,4.5,2.0,"Professor Woodzicka is hilarious. She wants everyone to love social psychology as much as she does, and tries to make class as fun as possible. Her tests are fairly straight forward if you do the textbook reading and come to class. Pay attention to the classic studies!"
3301,108200,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Woodzicka is a really good professor, and one of my favorites at W&L. She is hilarious and makes going to class fun. The tests are manageable if you read the book and take detailed notes on it to help you study. It can be a little hard to tell if she likes you or not, but overall, she's an excellent teacher."
3302,108200,4.0,3.0,Good professor.  Fun class.  Tests are a little bit ridiculous and detailed.  Have to read the book.  Only goes over half the material and you're on your own for the rest.  Comprehensive final.
3303,108200,5.0,5.0,"Great class, great professor. Even though I didn't agree with her ultra-feministic liberalistic views, I felt as though I gained a lot from the course. Take this class if you can, just be prepared to read the book VERY carefully, as her tests come straight from the book. Not a bad class if you actually do the reading."
3304,108200,5.0,5.0,I love her! She is hilarious and entertaining! I would def take a class from her again. She is very hard though and nit-picky. Make sure you read the text book and know the notes by heart. She doesn't really throw curve balls
3305,108200,4.5,4.0,"Social Psychology was a very interesting course, kept interesting by Prof. Woodzicka. She offers funny anecdotes and the group presentation is an easy A. If you want to do well on tests, read the book and take notes. There's no other way."
3306,108200,5.0,3.0,best professor at this school!!!
3307,108200,3.5,4.0,"Really funny, & makes class interesting.  Thought tests could be a little unfair. Overall I'd definitely recommend the class, but don't expect an easy A"
3308,108200,3.0,4.0,"Very interesting, very fun to go to. Very hard tests."
3309,108200,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3310,108200,4.5,3.0,She is a great lecturer and easy to understand. The tests are difficult but not impossible. Very interesting!
3311,108200,4.0,3.0,"To be fair, even though she only does an average job in terms of teaching, at least she wouldn't bore the hell out of you."
3312,108200,3.0,4.0,"Really don't understand why everyone thinks this woman is so great.  Yes, she is entertaining in class, but if you came to college with the idea of actually say...mmm...learning something, then don't bother with her.  The Psychology department is a frickin joke, and she is the ringleader."
3313,108200,5.0,5.0,"Woodzicka totally kicks ass.  The BEST professor at Washington and Lee, without a doubt."
3314,108200,4.5,3.0,very entertaining teacher and you'll learn a lot. Tests are pretty tough
3315,108200,5.0,3.0,So much fun! I heart the Woodzicka! She is an awsome and great professor and makes you interested in the material and keeps the class fun.
3316,108200,5.0,4.0,No Comments
3317,108200,5.0,4.0,She is really kick ass.  Very awesome professor to have.
3318,108200,5.0,3.0,Very interesting class and enthusiastic professor.  Tests are very detail-oriented from book.
3319,1633963,4.0,1.0,"He is the man. I had him for Planetary Geology and as long as you study for the tests, you'll be fine. Its all on sakai so attendance isn't really mandatory as long as you don't miss the quizzes. He played basketball for Luxembourg in the Olympics"
3320,487096,5.0,2.0,"Kuettner's schedule is extremely easy to follow and if you keep up with the homework and participate in class, you will have an A."
3321,487096,2.0,3.0,"I did decently in the class, but he doesn't really teach a lot on grammar which is what he tests on. Overall a nice guy, just not the best teacher"
3322,487096,2.0,4.0,"This spring term course was titled &quot;Minority Rights and Gerrymandering.&quot; Dr. Kuettner was the lesser of two evils for this course. Professor Rush, also teaching this course, was by far the aggressor in terms of nonconstructive criticism of writing and presentations. The course was terribly disorganized; the professors graded and advised unfairly."
3323,487096,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Kuettner is a great teacher and really likes you if you are good at Spanish. He is very nice and caring. There is a lot of homework on VHL, an online language practicing site, but it usually doesn't take too long. This class is straightforward and if you do the work and participate, you can do well."
3324,487096,5.0,3.0,"He was my Spanish teacher my first semester at W&amp;L and I lucked out. Super caring and notices if something isn't quite right. Always available outside of the classroom and very understanding. Would take him again in a heartbeat. Loves when you go to office hours just to catch up, very personable."
3325,487096,5.0,3.0,Awesome Guy. Great class. work hard and you will do just fine. Just make sure you complete all online assignments.
3326,487096,5.0,2.0,Excellent Professor and Great Class!!!
3327,487096,5.0,2.0,Great Professor!!
3328,487096,5.0,2.0,"Professor Kuettner epitomizes what a liberal arts professor should be. A previous reviewer said he is a friend first and a professor second, which is spot on. An indispensable asset for Washington & Lee and its foreign language department."
3329,487096,5.0,2.0,"This is the best professor I've had at W&L. Take any class he has, he will help you."
3330,487096,5.0,2.0,"All bow down to King Kuettner, the man, the legend. Best Professor this side of the Mason Dixon."
3331,487096,5.0,3.0,"Kuettner is honestly the greatest teacher I have ever had. No point do I ever regret taking French, just because of him. He demands your best but will help you get there. He is a friend 1st and a professor 2nd. Take him no matter what language he is teaching (he speaks 5 languages btw). Professors like him are the reasons this school is what it is"
3332,487096,4.5,2.0,"He is a good professor, and very helpful if you go to office hours.  He is great for beginner French students as he finds creative ways to make you speak and class isn't too difficult. You just have to study before class and before tests to be able to participate and do well."
3333,487096,4.5,3.0,Pretty darn good.
3334,487096,4.0,3.0,"Kuettner, for French 162, was tough.  His little pop quizzes...NO FUN.  He does find interesting ways to make you speak the language, though.  I do have to admit, he's a funny guy and he's really smart.  Kuettner, enough with the crazy vocab quizzes already!"
3335,487096,3.0,2.0,Talks very fast and very quietly.  Always wants to help.  Does not take grades for homework often.  Funny.  Great guy.
3336,487096,5.0,2.0,"May not be as easy as the Spanish Students say he is, but he the work is still very doable. Great guy!! Very good professor!!"
3337,487096,4.5,2.0,"Hes so nice, try to get him!"
3338,487096,5.0,1.0,"Professor Keuttner is awesome. He's really interesting and helpful and his class is easy, as long as you study."
3339,487096,5.0,1.0,Very easy and understanding. Always willing to help any way he can. No pop quizzes and you'll do well on tests if you study.
3340,487096,5.0,1.0,"Amazing guy.  Yes, he's quiet, but if you want to do well in a class without much effort and survive fall term freshman year or pledgeship, he is the man to take.  Best language professor.  Oh and the guy is a computer wiz and remembers you years after you've take his class."
3341,487096,5.0,1.0,great prof. covers what needs to be covered and is not picky at all. his tests and quizzes are very easy. best prof. in span. dept. in my opinion. he makes spanish EASY.

3343,487096,5.0,2.0,an awesome teacher! i loved him and he made spanish so much easier for me than it was in high school.
3344,487096,4.5,2.0,"He's a good guy who isn't hard. Soft spoken. 8 am spanish on tuesdays and thursdays was rough, but he knows whats up."
3345,530109,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Mazilu is one of my favorite professors; she is so nice and friendly. Not only does she care about your knowledge and understanding of the material but she cares about your grade as well. She is brilliant and will help as much as she can to find research projects if you want to. I could not recommend her enough, she is wonderful! "
3346,530109,5.0,3.0,"One of the kindest and most helpful professors at W&amp;L. She really wants everyone to succeed and is willing to help individuals outside of class. Grading is relatively lenient and she gives plenty of practice material. Even if you're not a physics person, I would highly recommend taking her class."
3347,530109,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors in the entire university. SO caring and helpful. Super accessible outside class and wants you to succeed. She prepares you very well for her tests and really works with the class to understand some of the harder material. I can't recommend her enough. If you are looking at intro physics classes this is a must take.
3348,530109,5.0,4.0,Truly wants you to succeed! I really can't say enough about Prof. Mazilu. She often goes fast in class but is more than willing to go over anything with you in office hours. She is a wonderful teacher and perfect for anyone looking to take physics for the first time.
3349,530109,4.0,3.0,"Wants to help you in any way she can, lots of office hours, and very helpful when you go. Pretty lenient grader too. The one catch is she tends to go a bit too fast during lectures, but the abundance of office hours makes it easy to check on anything you missed. Overall though I'd absolutely recommend taking her, especially at the 100 level."
3350,530109,5.0,4.0,"Nuclear physics is not for the fainthearted... Difficult class but I have yet to get a computational problem right on a test but she only takes a point or two off, she wants you to do well whether it's intro or senior level!!! Would recommend."
3351,530109,5.0,2.0,"Ideal professor, very motherly. Willing to make time whenever you need it and will do anything to make sure you do well."
3352,530109,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mazilu is probably one of the kindest, merriest people I have every met. Truly enjoyed going in to office hours to get help from her. She really cares about you and wants you to succeed! Great for intro to physics. Would be helpful if you have some (even if very limited) physics background before taking this class."
3353,530109,5.0,3.0,"She is one of the best professor I've ever had. I hated physics before taking her class and she made me rethink about being a physics major. I wish I can have more classes with her. She is really caring, super nice and super passionate about physics."
3354,530109,3.0,3.0,Really willing to help just don't understand what she is saying 
3355,530109,4.5,2.0,Always has a smile on her face and really wants you to succeed in the class. Knows what she's talking about and is willing to explain things multiple times. Very approachable outside of class if you need her. Looks to give you partial credit. Overall great teacher. 
3356,530109,4.5,2.0,"Awesome class.  I've taken physics before, but she still managed to make it engaging and interesting.  Always has a smile on her face, always is willing to answer questions, and gives a lot of extra credit.  Definitely take her.  Only complaint is that I bought the textbook and then rarely used it. "
3357,530109,4.5,2.0,"Awesome teacher!!! Take this class. She's extremely helpful both in and out of class, and is a pretty easy grader."
3358,530109,5.0,2.0,"Overall an awesome professor.  She knows the material and she teaches it well.  The lectures are well-structured, and the tests are pretty standard.  Overall: 4/5 would take again."
3359,530109,4.5,3.0,"I really loved Professor Mazilu. Physics is definitely not my forte, but she really spent a lot of time with me out of class and with any other professor I probably would have failed. She's a pretty easy grader and will let you turn things in late if you're having trouble. Definitely try to get her if you can. And she has a cute accent."
3360,530109,4.0,2.0,She is a easy teacher and will always look to give you points and extra credit but she sometimes doesnt really explain thing well during class.
3361,530109,5.0,1.0,Best professor I've ever had.  Really nice and sincerely enjoys teaching.
3362,530109,5.0,1.0,Best science teacher ever!
3363,530109,4.0,2.0,"Irina Mazilu is a great, fun-loving teacher. She covers a lot of material at a quick pace, but nobody grades easier than she does. Received an A without much effort."
3364,530109,4.5,3.0,"She is by far the most awesome teacher I have come across at W&L. She is the professor who made me realize that there are those professors who just teach for the sake of teach, and then there are a few like Irina who teach because they love it and love their students. Not only does she have a smile always on her face, she also cares if you smile.."
3365,530109,5.0,1.0,Very nice and gives useful life advice
3366,530109,4.5,2.0,Great Professor
3367,530109,4.0,1.0,i love her!
3368,530109,5.0,2.0,"Apples and Anti-Apples was amazing. She basically only taught us what she thought was cool. Irina Mazilu is amazing. She is young, energetic, always happy to be in class, and a great professor. You will learn a ton no matter how interested you are in physics. There is very little math involved, it's all theory. It's a perfect spring class. Take it!"
3369,530109,5.0,3.0,"It is a difficult course in terms of volume and speed, but she is the most amazing teacher. She always has a smile on her face. Loves her students, gives extra credit just so you get a good grade, is willing to listen. I spent fall term in her office, she even made me coffee. I love her! Take any of her courses!"
3370,530109,5.0,2.0,"I was in her class when she was at another college.  Her ability to cultivate interest and skill in any area of physics astounded me.  She continued to be very helpful, even as she and her husband moved to VA.  Even for her one year with us, she is sorely missed by all who had the pleasure of working with her.  You will not regret a class with her."
3371,530109,5.0,1.0,awesome
3372,530109,5.0,3.0,"Few professors have such a deep seated commitment to the academic and personal well-being of students.  She must have the highest volume of student traffic in the science center, not because she's unclear, but because she's so helpful - both wicked smart and understanding."
3373,530109,5.0,1.0,I can't even begin to describe how cool this woman is.  I owe her everything.  Taking her class and getting an A allowed me to get into grad school.  And she's always available...will drop anything she is doing to help her students.  Passes out her phone number.  amazing.
3374,530109,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher whether just taking physics for GE credit or for a major she is the best.  Better than any HS teacher in helpfullness and obviously smart as hell.
3375,530109,5.0,4.0,"Absolutly Phomominal Teacher... ladies and gentlemen, this is why we come to W&L... she is simply orgasmic.  Will dedicate any waking moment to helping incompotent students understand and love the material.  She CARES!  She is GREAT! Take HER!"
3376,530109,5.0,1.0,"If you are taking physics take her, she is awesome"
3377,530109,4.0,5.0,"I got a B in this class and probably should have gotten a C-.  Physics is really hard, but she did all she could to help me.  She really wants the students to do well (maybe even more than to actually learn), but overall, she's great."
3378,530109,5.0,3.0,great teacher. always there to help and you can always do something to pull up your grade. she does a great job of breaking things down.
3379,530109,4.0,2.0,"Very nice teacher. She'll do anything to help you. Though I didn't leanr too much in her lecture classes, she's more than willing to help you whenever you want to."
3380,530109,5.0,2.0,She is the best teacher I think I have ever had. I would be lost in physics without her. She really cares about her students and wants them to do well
3381,530109,4.5,2.0,Great teacher! She is very nice and really wants you to do well. Take the class
3382,1392340,3.0,4.0,Not easy at all
3383,1392340,5.0,1.0,"I think professor Ramirez is a very lenient professor. No book needed, exams are easy, many extra credit opportunities, what else can stop you from not procuring an A? There is one museum assignment and she grades it very easily."
3384,1392340,5.0,1.0,She's the best professor in this entire universe. Take her if you want to learn and earn better grades. Very easy and organized.
3385,1392340,5.0,1.0,"Simply amazing! pretty easy class, and she tells us exactly what you should do to succeed in the course. I took this as an online course and I reap the benefits. Do take her!"
3386,1392340,5.0,1.0,"Professor Ramirez is one of the best professors and is very well-organized with her instructions. Ample opportunities to earn extra credits, so  getting an A is inevitable. I'd highly recommend to take her class."
3387,1392340,5.0,1.0,"If you want an A, take her."
3388,1392340,4.0,1.0,"I took her course as an online class and its the easiest course ever. Her quizzes questions are the same exact questions on each of the exams. As long as you know what you did right and wrong on your quizzes and fix the error. She also lets you do the quiz twice online and you see your mistakes the first time, which means you can get 100 everytime."
3389,1392340,4.0,1.0,"Very straightforward class. She tells you exactly what you need to know. Pretty interesting but only if you are interested in art history. I never used the textbook, it is not necessary for a good grade but definitely helps to supplement that material that is gone over in class."
3390,2531033,5.0,2.0,She is so nice!!! I like her!
3391,2531033,5.0,2.0,"If you need a philosophy course, take Prof. Kang. She is really understanding, wants to connect to the students, and sometimes includes memes in her lecture slides. The class didn't have a lot of papers, and no quizzes, so make sure you participate!"
3392,2531033,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher. Very easy going. Easy to get an A. Not too many papers. Wants to help you, just ask questions. A lot of interesting class discussion, just make some effort to participate."
3393,1396452,4.0,1.0,"If your not going to continue spanish after 164, she is the greatest prof ever. If you are interested in actually learning something and challenging yourself youd be better off w. another. Our class was super easy and fun, not very stressful. She is a great person. However, we didn't really learn anything but thats cool with me, im done w. spanish!"
3394,1396452,4.5,3.0,"Fenomenal!!! She graduated from Berkeley and is fantastic. She is brilliant, uses informative slides (though with too much info sometimes), has high standards for upper-lv writing, and loves to engage class discussion. There is a reason her 300-lv lit class had to change rooms cuz there were SO many flippin students. Also...an amazing person."
3395,1396452,5.0,1.0,She is so so nice! Her 164 class was super easy. Minimal grammar on the tests. Some short stories to read. Very little homework.
3396,1396452,3.0,1.0,"Gonzalez is a very warm woman who is passionate about what she teaches. Even though her class is very easy (tests were open-note/book), you should put some effort and thought into the class and you will really get a lot out of it. She is a very sweet person, but even though she is lax, you can tell she gets disappointed when people slack."
3397,1396452,4.0,2.0,"Good teacher, also had her for an easy class but she is really cool and easy to follow and understand and didnt find anything to be too hard just do the work and be friends with her"
3398,1396452,4.0,2.0,"Don't listen to these other ratings, Prof. Gonzalez is GREAT. Yes, she's not too hard, but you learn as much as you want to. If you READ your assignments and listen to what she has to say, she is an extremely eloquent, intellectual woman. I learned a lot & loved her class. Her English is a work in progress, but for God's sake it's a Spanish class."
3399,1396452,2.0,4.0,"Hardly speaks english, IMPOSSIBLE test for what she teaches in class. can't really understand you when you have questions"
3400,1396452,2.0,1.0,"You really won't learn anything if you are in her section of Spanish. It's pretty easy to do minimal work and get a good grade, but if you continue with Spanish and get a different teacher you'll realize how little she accomplished in the class."
3401,108263,5.0,3.0,"Professor Reese makes physics easy to understand even fun. He is very passionate about what he teaches and seems very interested in helping the students learn. He is also very helpful during office hours. If you take good notes,read the book (he wrote it!) and do the problems, you should do well in his course."
3402,108263,5.0,2.0,"An amazing, warm, caring professor, Reese really wants to help his students do well.  He's got a fantastic sense of humor and makes phyics clear and easy to understand.  Moreover, he wrote the text book, and, to tell you the truth, it's one of the best written textbooks I've ever read!  Great class, great prof.  Two thumbs way way up!!!"
3403,108263,4.5,4.0,"GREAT professor.  The class material takes a lot of work and time to understand, but Reese is VERY approachable and will help you as much as you need.  Lectures aren't mandatory, but very helpful in understanding concepts."
3404,108263,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, knows his stuff"
3405,108263,5.0,3.0,Dr. Resse is one of the best Physics professors I have ever had (I have had a lot!). He really puts things in perspective and is excellent at explaining stuff. If you take this class-take it with him!
3406,108263,5.0,4.0,Great Prof! he's like a grandpa...but he sure knows his physics! (He wrote the textbook!) This is a tough class but he makes it tolerable (and even fun).
3407,108263,4.5,4.0,"likes to go off on wild tangents, fun stuff"
3408,108263,5.0,4.0,"Great, Nerdy, Fun Prof"
3409,1795824,5.0,2.0,"Favorite accounting teacher to this point. Very straight forward. Broke down class into 3 exams covering 4 chapters each. If you do the examples and exercises you will do well. Also, homework is 25% of the grade and the homework is pretty easy. She teaches you would you need to know and nothing else. "
3410,1795824,4.0,3.0,Ge Bai rocks! She is very straightforward and willing to help her students. Definitely utilize her office hours. I highly recommend taking a class with Bai!
3411,1795824,5.0,3.0,Ge Bai is bomb. Only she could keep me awake during managerial.
3412,1795824,4.0,4.0,"Great, accomplished professor! Relatively new to the campus. Only drawback is that the tests are not given partial credit. It's either right or wrong. She is extremely helpful when it comes to understanding concepts, homework, and other aspects of the course. I recommend this course!"
3413,1795824,4.5,2.0,Very straightforward class. She's brilliant and an excellent lecturer despite her thick accent. Weekly homeworks often due at weird times and the tests are pretty much right from those and her powerpoints
3414,1795824,5.0,2.0,Incredibly clear and straight forward classes. Very interested in helping her student and is always available for help. Class is easy if you pay attention and do the work. Highly recommend her.
3415,1795824,5.0,3.0,"Best teacher ever, extremely interested in helping her students and truly wants all of her students to do well.  You will learn a lot and not only is a great teacher, she is a great person.  Definitely recommend taking a class of hers.  Always available for office hours"
3416,108273,5.0,3.0,Kamara is definitely one of the better professors at WLU. He genuinely cares about his students and their progress and is extremely helpful if you just ask.
3417,108273,4.0,3.0,"There's a fair amount of homework in the textbook each night and journals each week, but nothing too challenging. A fair number of presentations, but they're 5% of your grade. He's a great guy and helpful during office hours. Keep in mind you're required to go to a lot of French TA events and conversation sessions (most professors require it)"
3418,108273,3.0,3.0,"Downsides: There are a bunch of small papers and presentations that are all worth 5-10% of your grade (hard to keep track of). Also, He expects max effort on all of them even though you can't really triage a presentation worth 5% over a test/paper in another class worth 20+ %. Upsides: He's a nice guy, and it's pretty easy to understand his French."
3419,108273,5.0,3.0,Amazing. I took his spring term class and this man is a real gem. He cares so much about his students and really wants them to succeed. I really recommend taking him at some point at Washington and Lee.
3420,108273,5.0,3.0,"Awesome guy!! Super genuine, cares about his students, and actually wants them to learn French. Lectures are helpful and he's a relatively easy grader. Tests can be challenging but are always fair. He often gives a lot of busy work, but overall he's an awesome."
3421,108273,4.0,1.0,"Great guy, very nice"
3422,108273,5.0,3.0,"You have to work for your grade. However, he is a reasonable grader. If you work hard, you will not get below a B-. Very reasonable assignments, very helpful office hours. Genuinely good professor. One of the best at remembering names and interacting with outside of class even years after you take class."
3423,108273,5.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed Professor Kamara this semester in French 164. He was a captivating teacher of material, a fair grader, and was very prepared for every class. He was more than just a great professor academically. He maintained relationships with each student throughout the semester and really treated us like friends. I was glad to have him as my pr"
3424,108273,5.0,2.0,great professor
3425,108273,4.0,3.0,"A lot of daily work, but Kamara is always very accessible and cares about the success of his students!"
3426,108273,3.0,4.0,"Professor Kamara is one of the nicest professors, but it should be noted that he is more than nice. Kamara is a tough professor. The workload is consistently heavy. I had gone into the class hearing he was on the easier side grading, but he is not. You will have to work hard to get the grade you want in his classes. He loves the material!"
3427,108273,3.0,1.0,Grading is pretty consistent. Not particularly helpful most learning is done from the book. Not always clear
3428,108273,3.5,2.0,"Great professor. Very interested in what he teaches and is always entertaining. Looked forward to his class each week. Assignments/tests are difficult, but he grades easily."
3429,108273,3.5,2.0,"Gets off on tangents and is a little hard to understand, also does not outline deadlines clearly. If you go to talk to him he will try to help you, but isn't always very clear. Extremely interested in the topics he teaches and energetic."
3430,108273,3.5,5.0,Good professor but highly demanding. In the past few years he has become ridiculously difficult
3431,108273,2.0,3.0,1.Keep your journal separate from your notes because he tends to keep it for a while and you may need those for a test  2.Be sure you know when stuff is due and what exactly he expects because he is very vague about that
3432,108273,3.0,3.0,"So much energy!  Could always count on him for a big smile on Monday morning.  Lots of quizzes which keeps you accountable.  Not terribly hard.  Do your work otherwise he gets very angry.  Fun accent, great person."
3433,108273,4.0,2.0,"kamara's such a nice guy... but just a so-so professor.  i didn't come out of the class having an infinitely greater knowledge of the subject.  but then again, it's not a hard class-- pretty by the book once you know how he grades"
3434,108273,3.0,2.0,"Great teacher.  Knows how to make a classroom come alive.  The only thing is that he tends to &quot;hide&quot; assignments from you.  Meaning, you may not know when or if something is due the next day; it can be a pleasant surprise to find out that you have to hand in your notebook.  Basically, memorize the syllabus and you'll be fine."
3435,108273,2.0,2.0,"Professor is very knowledgable in the subject-area, but terribly unorganized. He acts rather distant outside of class."
3436,108273,2.5,1.0,"If you need an easy friendly class: take his! he is a good professor as long as you do not know much french. If you do speak french or have some experience with the language, you realize very quickly that prof. makes major blunders grammar wise. However, take his class if you need a easy way A+"
3437,108273,4.0,3.0,He's good at explaining stuff and finds creative ways to make you speak French.

3445,108273,4.0,1.0,An interesting professor
3446,239346,5.0,4.0,"Jefferson Davis Futch lll was the best college professor of my W&L career. I learned more from him than any other professor and he inspired me do work harder to achieve.  He is funny, whimsical, quite the gentleman and very kind and courteous, and beyond all of that, brilliant."
3447,239346,4.0,4.0,The smartest person I have ever met in my life. This guy is incredible. Legendary.
3448,239346,5.0,3.0,"Took this class on American Civil War in 1969 -- a long time ago.  Dr. Futch was a living legend then.  Not sure how his class would get past the PC police today.  Back then, you could seriously study a difficult topic free of all the ""noise"" and distractions you have today."
3449,239346,5.0,4.0,The best of the best.
3450,239346,3.5,3.0,"40 years after his lecture series on the Spanish Monarchy, I still remember them."
3451,239346,4.5,3.0,"Taking a class with Dr. Futch is like opening your first bottle of champagne! He is fascinating, fun, and knows absolutely everything about the history of western civilization. He's an institution. Take his class."
3452,239346,5.0,1.0,Futch is the man. By far the most interesting and old school professor at W&L. Don't expect to make a good grade in his class without putting in some effort and seeming interested. Every student at W&L should be required to take a Futch class
3453,239346,5.0,3.0,"Futch rocked my world at W&L. I still remember his lectures, even as an alum. Funniest prof I ever had, smartest prof ever, very articulate, and taught me to write so much better. And oh-so-Southern. He defined Washington and Lee for me, and for so many before me. He has been there since 1962 - take his classes for both European and W&L history!"
3454,239346,4.5,3.0,"I could be rated elsewhere at this site and am long out of college, but I have to put in a word for this incredible man. He is a treasure - phenomenally smart and gifted and a gentleman of the old school that one never sees anymore. Don't pass up a chance to experience this man. He remains a treasured friend after 30 years."
3455,239346,3.5,2.0,"Interesting teacher who is definitely worth taking, although a bit long winded at times. A really nice guy, interested in helping students."
3456,239346,5.0,3.0,This man is one of the giants of teaching and W&amp;L.  Fun classes that can teach someone more in an hour than others do in a semester. He was as heplful and respectful outside the classroom as any professor I ever saw.
3457,239346,5.0,5.0,I am the parent of a W&L alum and cannot say enought good things about Dr. Futch. He is a superb teacher: the depth & breadth of his knowledge of history is almost unfathomable to the modern mind. He is a gentleman of the old school and has devoted his life to his students. What a treasure! If you have a child there be sure they take his class!
3458,239346,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Futch was my favorite professor at W&L. He treated me with uncommon kindness, courtesy, and respect. His lectures, although a little long at times, were always informative, humorous, and very well narrated. His memory for detail is something which I will always aspire to mimic. I hope to continue my friendship with this man for years to come."
3459,239346,1.5,4.0,"He refuses to update his opinion on anything.  He is a monarchist.  He told a fellow prof. that the only reason he didn't leave when the school turned co-ed was b/c they would replace him with a woman.  Don't expect above a B unless your name is followed by Jr, III, IV, etc."
3460,239346,4.0,4.0,"Futch is like the Monolith from 2001- Ancient, mysterious, and yet an unparalled endower of knowledge."
3461,239346,5.0,3.0,"Professor Futch is the best teacher at W&L, period. He is brilliant, with a memory for detail that amazes me on a daily basis. Not just for history, but also the personal lives of students. Very polite, considerate, and humorous to boot. A true gentleman of the old school. 43 years and still going!"
3462,239346,5.0,3.0,If you don't enjoy this man's classes it's grounds for me never to speak with you again
3463,239346,5.0,1.0,Greatest professor ever
3464,239346,4.0,3.0,"A real character.  A great, very amusing prof of the old school.  Not enough like him left anymore."
3465,239346,3.5,5.0,"JDF has been knocking them dead for over 40 years ... wear a tie ... He interviewed Fancisco Franco and can remember stuff about student's fathers ... &quot;Just remember ... if you look common, people will think you're from Vanderbuilt&quot;"

3467,239346,4.0,3.0,cool old guy
3468,239346,3.5,3.0,The quizzes and final were hard.  Futch knows everything but is a poor lecturer.  Learning has to be done on your own from the books.  No papers which is a plus.
3469,239346,5.0,2.0,awesome
3470,108275,5.0,3.0,Best math teacher I ever had.
3471,108275,4.5,3.0,Very passionate and helpful. He makes everything seem easy in class but doesn't actually explain much; if you go into his office hours he explains things perfectly. Not an easy class but he is eager to help.
3472,108275,3.5,5.0,"A very, very nice guy but rather loopy.  Says he doesn't assume that students have had prior calculus experience but most certainly does.  A great guy if you've had some calc background but difficult if you haven't."
3473,108275,4.5,2.0,Bourdon is one of the better teachers in the math department. He is incredibly clear and makes the class very easy to follow. His tests are fair and not too difficult. Definitely worth taking!
3474,108275,4.5,3.0,I took Calc 2 with Professor Bourdon and I'm really glad I did.  I had to work pretty hard for an A- but I thought I learned a lot. He is really nice and always willing to help.  Do the homework because he gives you quizzes that are made up entirely of homework problems. Tests are difficult - you will actually need to study.
3475,108275,4.5,3.0,No Comments
3476,108275,4.5,3.0,He is really helpful if you go in and ask for help and will explain things until you understand
3477,108275,5.0,3.0,"Great guy.  I took calc for a gen ed and was very eager to get it over with, but Prof Bourdon made it completely manageable.  There is a fair amount of work, but expectations are very clear and the notes are very organized and easy to follow.  Great prof if you are taking a gen ed."
3478,108275,5.0,4.0,"Amazingly nice, and his Math-jokes made it a little less painful to wake up for an 8 a.m. math class. Was willing to use office hours to explain anything that was hard to understand during class, no apt. necessary."
3479,108275,5.0,4.0,Professor Bourdon is a wonderful man and a great teaching. He always has time for his students. A great alum!
3480,108275,4.0,5.0,good at explaning material but expects too much from students and makes tests extremely hard.  also gives quizzes on the day before tests.
3481,108275,5.0,4.0,Super nice
3482,108275,4.0,3.0,"Great guy, tries to help you as much as possible, but the classes are unbelievable boring. It was so hard to stay awake the whole term."
3483,108275,4.0,3.0,"Good professor.  I would recommend him, although there are a lot of other good professors in the math dept."
3484,108275,4.5,3.0,Great prof - took tons of time to get me through the class!
3485,108275,5.0,2.0,"Exceptionally accessible. I came into Calc. 101 having performed poorly in almost every math class to date, however remedial. So, everyday I went to Prof. Bourdon. Everyday. He was always there and more than understanding, even though he's a bit loopy."
3486,108275,4.0,3.0,Prof.Bourdon is SO nice and really wants to help you.(especially if you are horrible at math like me.)
3487,108275,5.0,4.0,very good teacher
3488,108275,4.5,3.0,"bourdon is VERY excited about math.  he's a great teacher, and has amusing jokes"
3489,108275,4.0,4.0,No Comments
3490,108275,4.5,3.0,VERY helpful and nice.
3491,401139,1.5,5.0,Terrible man
3492,401139,2.5,2.0,"Very funny man who keeps class interesting.  I had him for intermediate spanish, so it wasn't too difficult.  Open-book take home tests were so so, but took very long to complete.  His mid-term and final were fair.  The class did seem loopy though.  It was sometimes hard to follow what was going on.  He does call on you in class though, be prepared"
3493,401139,4.5,1.0,"Fralin is a great professor, without a doubt. He's funny and sometimes get caught laughing at his own jokes, which makes the class light-hearted. Definitely recommend him for French, great guy."
3494,401139,5.0,3.0,"Really fun professor.  Not as difficult a grader as most say.  If you show him that you are interested in learning the material, he will be interested in helping you.  One of my favorite professors."
3495,401139,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Fralin taught me back in the early 80s, and I found him to be a warm, engaging, and delightful man.  I also thoroughly enjoyed his classes and found his teaching style fun and effective. He certainly encourages or even requires class participation, but that's a good thing, especially in a language class."
3496,401139,5.0,3.0,My observations are drawn only from a university scholars class - not a language class - but I have to say that Prof. Fralin is one of the best profs at WnL and that his class honestly changed my life.  I highly recommend applying for Univ Scholars and signing up for his existentialism class if he offers it again - you will not be disappointed!
3497,401139,4.5,3.0,"Prof Fralin is very understanding of student needs, willing to move tests if your work load is too strenous.  Also very flexible with material covered on tests, he is responsive to whether class has difficulty grasping subjects.  Fralin is wonderfully open and engaging professor."
3498,401139,4.0,3.0,"always seems to be hopped up on on speed or maybe just caffeine. makes class interesting. tests are difficult, but predictable; he makes it clear exactly what will be on them. just make sure you pay attention cuz he loves accosting sleepy students with crazy questions."
3499,401139,4.5,3.0,"very interesting, I hated the class and missed it alot but it wasn't his fault.  nice guy.  sings really well."
3500,401139,1.5,5.0,"Had him years ago for spanish and he was very unhelpful, very negative, and defintely deserves his nickname."
3501,401139,4.0,2.0,"I like him. I don't know where &quot;failin fralin&quot; comes from. I'm not even that good at French and I got an A. Several other people did too, and lots of others got Bs. Do the busy work, talk to him, and you're fine."
3502,401139,3.5,4.0,"Gives a lot of busy work.  His lectures are really disorganized and he isn't a great teacher, but he's a really nice guy and if you go see him outside of class he's a lot better at explaining stuff one-on-one."
3503,401139,2.0,5.0,The Guy is a ****.
3504,401139,1.5,4.0,"Professor is very discouraging. Only seems to focus on faults and failings rather than using encouragement as a means to induce improvement. A notoriously subjective grader who clearly has his favorites. Lecutres are often unorganized and disjointed. Very good speaker, but can't teach grammar."
3505,401139,1.5,5.0,"He terrifies me. Cant explain a single thing, very tense, cant stop talking about his wife in class. he expects you to know it all before he even attemtps teaching the material. Very strict, very scary. Best advice: nice guy aweful professor. Stay miles away from him!"
3506,401139,4.5,5.0,One of my favorite professors of all time.  Will always remember him and be grateful for all of his support.
3507,401139,4.0,5.0,No Comments
3508,401139,1.0,5.0,Very unhelpful
3509,401139,1.0,5.0,A very demanding and very difficult professor to handle.All of his classes are to be avoided as much as possible for your own sake
3510,108274,5.0,2.0,There is no debate. You MUST take Marsh for biostats. Everything is open book and you can collaborate with others. This actually helped me learn the material. Super accessible and makes an effort to make sure students are learning. He's also hilarious in class and a super quirky guy. The easiest stats class ever. 
3511,108274,5.0,2.0,Great professor and a cool guy. The class is lecture heavy but he is very enthusiastic about the material and the lectures are very interesting. The tests are all short answer questions so as long as you demonstrate a good understanding of the material in the answers then you'll get a good grade.
3512,108274,4.0,3.0,"I'm glad I took another class with him. He's a bit of a tough grader, but gives good feedback and doesn't assign a ton of work. The lab was interesting but very long, but we got to see a lot of cool hikes. He's super understanding if things come up, and chill about class. Would recommend him over most bio professors."
3513,108274,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor wants his students to learn and the content was really interesting. Will definitely take him again if I have the chance.
3514,108274,2.0,5.0,"The workload is a lot and the professor helps you a decent amount, but not really. Personally did not like the class but to each their own (just be prepared to be confused a lot and have to struggle primarily on your own if you do)."
3515,108274,1.0,5.0,Terrible Professor. He sucks. Unnecessarily difficult for an intro level biology class. Does not care about his students and their mental well-being. Do not take any class Professor Marsh teaches.
3516,108274,2.0,4.0,Hard professor who doesn't help students
3517,108274,5.0,3.0,"Best prof Ive had. If you can take this class, by all means, take it."
3518,108274,5.0,2.0,"He's super chill and understanding. If you take good class/lecture notes and just put in the expected work, you'll get an A or B. When there was textbook reading, it was a bit dry and not much of it translated into class or the tests. I learned a lot of interesting things and enjoyed the easy class."
3519,108274,5.0,2.0,"When you're in his class, you understand why his classes are so high in demand. Lectures are so chill and the class is just such a nice reprieve from other stressful courses you're taking for the bio/neuro/biochem major. class notes will be your lifeblood; take good notes and the homework and tests will be a breeze (tho they'll just take some time)"
3520,108274,5.0,2.0,"Professor Marsh is the best professor I've taken so far! His lectures are so intriguing that he can get you interested into anything he talks about. Also just a great person in general, super helpful during office hours. Tests are straightforward and easy."
3521,108274,5.0,3.0,Professor Marsh is awesome. I would definitely recommend taking one of his classes if you haven't already
3522,108274,5.0,3.0,Readings were dry but not terrible. Lectures were detailed and interesting. Tests were very straightforward and the study questions helped
3523,108274,4.0,3.0,"Professor Marsh was awesome and his lectures about class material were incredibly interesting. The tests were very straightforward and clearly stemmed from class material as well. He gave us study guides before tests that really helped with test preparation, and gave us extra credit opportunities when possible. I would definitely recommend him."
3524,108274,4.5,3.0,Dr. Marsh is so passionate about his research which makes it really easy to respect him.  He can be a little scattered but it is not to a degree that is a disadvantage to students.  He is very willing to give feedback on drafts for research papers or to help out with studying.  It is obvious that he is very knowledgeable about what he teaches.
3525,108274,5.0,2.0,"Professor Marsh is awesome. He makes actually funny jokes in class that make time pass much more enjoyably. This year was based almost entirely on frog ecology with a little over a week on genetics, so I'm not sure how helpful it'll be for the MCAT but this is the prof for lab science FDR. 2 tests, both had study guides and the exam was fair/easy."
3526,108274,5.0,2.0,Absolutely FANTASTIC teacher!  He completely solidified my choice to be a bio major.  He's my advisor and is an absolutely awesome guy - in and out of class.  His disease ecology class was one of my favorite classes yet!  He's clear and consistent in what he wants on his exams and very understanding when things go wrong.  Take his classes!
3527,108274,5.0,2.0,"Great professor who will make you want to take more biology. He teaches the material very clearly and condenses it so that all you have to study for the tests are your notes. Disease ecology is a course that even if you are not interested in biology, you will enjoy."
3528,108274,4.5,3.0,"Disease Ecology = awesome intro bio course, especially from pre-meds.  Gives a really holistic view of science surrounding diseases, microbe biology, and epidemic dynamics while sprinkling in a lot of public health/CDC perspectives.  Really cool professor that just seems like he's having fun up there teaching this stuff.  Definitely recommended."
3529,108274,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Marsh does an amazing job of making a rather dull and difficult topic fun and interesting.  It wasn't an easy class, but that's the nature of biostats.  Dr. Marsh himself is amazing, incredibly helpful, and he has a great sense of humor!  He's an awesome teacher and a great person!"
3530,108274,5.0,2.0,"Basically the best lab science with the best professor you could ever take. He's very clear in his lectures, fair on assignments/tests (which are few), and helpful if you need him. The Labs for 105 were going to the zoo, catching crickets, etc."
3531,108274,5.0,1.0,Awsome class.  Pretty much an animal behavior and darwinism class.  Marsh is all you could ask for out of a professor.  Wont offer this class again till Fall 2007.
3532,108274,5.0,3.0,"Awesome field class, lots of fun, interesting stuff. Be sure to take Field Herp if you're a Bio major, and you probably should take it even if you aren't."
3533,108274,4.0,3.0,SO NICE! SO FUNNY! I feel like I could chill with this guy after class. HILARIOUS! He easily understands the rigors of college life. Great guy!
3534,108274,5.0,3.0,"You have to completely understand the material, but if you take notes on the book and study in the in-class notes...you will succeed!"
3535,108274,5.0,1.0,No Comments
3536,108274,5.0,3.0,awesome
3537,108274,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3538,108274,4.0,2.0,He really helps cut down on notes and study time.
3539,2684659,4.0,4.0,"Incredible professor who deeply cares abt her students and their success. After going to her OH for first time, we had a friendly convo for 30 min abt ourselves. Always accessible, very approachable, and teaches to her students' needs. I wasn't the strongest in speaking French coming into her class but, with her support, feel much more confident"
3540,2684659,2.0,5.0,Don't take her if you're able to - extremely hard to get a good grade because she has ridiculous expectations and doesn't adjust to student feedback.
3541,2780928,4.0,4.0,"Reading quizzes were often on little details that didn't always have much to do with an understanding of the reading. The class was discussion heavy with lots of reading, but discussions weren't always engaging. Essay grading is tough, but feedback is helpful and clear and did improve my writing. "
3542,2780928,2.0,4.0,Takes attendance daily. Gives pop quizzes on a random detail from every reading. Not the fastest grader. Usually pretty good at responding to emails and willing to meet outside of class time. 
3543,2780928,3.0,3.0,"Womer is a tough grader, and you have to do the readings every night because there are reading quizzes at the beginning of every class."
3544,2057988,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Gray is easily the best professor at W&L and one of the best people I have ever met. I have had the pleasure of taking 5 classes with Prof. Gray, and each class was better than the last. He is engaging, charismatic, poignant, and inspirational. His classes will help shape your world view, and he truly encapsulates what college is about. "
3545,2057988,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gray will change your life! Amazing teacher, even better person. 100% the best professor I have had at W&amp;L. I came away from every class with so much knowledge and enthusiasm and hope. Taught me so much about my own thoughts on political philosophy/life and also made extremely complex texts so engaging. Take him, no matter what!!!"
3546,2057988,5.0,3.0,"Prof Gray is the most enthusiastic professor I have had. His syllabus lays out very clear expectations. There is reading for every class, and that is the only real homework. The reading is very very manageable. Graded on 5 separate components each of which were 20%: participation, analytical essay, midterm, personal philosophy paper, final exam."
3547,2057988,5.0,3.0,"Best professor at W&amp;L, hands down. Everything said below applies; he is really an inspirational professor who helps his students in any way possible. I would take a Gray class at 3am an hour away if necessary. A very fair grader who places a premium on participation; that shouldn't be a problem since his classes should make you want to participate."
3548,2057988,5.0,3.0,An excellent professor who is infectiously passionate about the material and is available to help his students 25 hours a day.
3549,2057988,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Gray is great! He's super enthusiastic about the material and genuinely cares about each and every one of his students. Can be a tougher grader, but he has office hours almost every day of the week and is very helpful. Assigns a lot of reading, but class discussions are super engaging. He's very genuine, understanding, and funny. A must take!"
3550,2057988,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gray is by far my favorite prof on campus. I took a spring term class and his political philosophy class and I can not say one bad thing about him. There is a good bit of reading, but totally manageable. Fair grader, cares very deeply about students, holds a lot of office hours. Participation matters! Great, great Professor"
3551,2057988,5.0,3.0,"An excellent professor who not only teaches you a lot of material, but also pushes students to think critically and make connections to contemporary events or historical political examples. Each of his courses are ingeniously organized with the materials in each class being tied together in the most subtle and thought-provoking ways."
3552,2057988,5.0,3.0,Gray is easily the best professor I've had at W&amp;L. His lectures are amazing and you will leave every class learning something. He runs around the classroom and jumps up and down and gets super excited about the subject. Everyone should take 1 class with Gray
3553,2057988,5.0,3.0,"Genuine and kind. Always made me excited about learning. Incredibly interesting, and a fair grader (yes, I deserved the B). Lots of reading, but an interesting selection of work from various cultures. Not the typical intro to political philosophy, more of a global approach. If you can get into a class with Professor Gray, consider yourself lucky."
3554,2057988,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gray genuinely cares about his students. His classes are incredibly interesting. He gets so excited when students participate, which makes class participation fun and accessible. He seems to love the material he's teaching. I have learned so much from his classes. He makes you feel smart and brings the best out of his students."
3555,2057988,5.0,3.0,Excellent!
3556,2057988,5.0,3.0,100%
3557,2057988,5.0,3.0,Professor Gray is amazing! A pure gem. His office hours cannot be overrated. I would recommend going as often as possible.
3558,2057988,5.0,2.0,"Best professor at W&amp;L. he is a genuine sweetheart. If you participate in class, come to office hours you will get a great grade. He is the most passionate professor i have had at W&amp;L. i would highly recommend to any student."
3559,2057988,5.0,3.0,He should be teaching a class to other professors on how to teach a class. Took Intro to Political Philosophy with him a few years ago and still remember what I learned in it even though the class itself wasn't too hard/demanding. Took another intro philosophy class after thinking they all were as fun as Gray's... was very disappointed.
3560,2057988,5.0,3.0,"I took POL 111 - Intro to Political Philosophy with Professor Gray and I absolutely loved it! His classes are enjoyable, and he does a great job of keeping discussion going and interesting. He's a very caring and open professor, and you can tell he genuinely loves teaching. Would 100% recommend."
3561,2057988,5.0,3.0,"The best professor I have ever had. I cannot recommend anyone more than I can recommend this man. The guy is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and can portray that both in and out of class. He is passionate, energetic, and knowledgeable. I cannot wait to take more classes with him."
3562,2057988,5.0,3.0,"A Dead Poet's Society level of professor. Truly an amazing guy who wants to engage his students in any way possible. He is very excited to help and always eager to answer questions, one of my favorite professors to date."
3563,2057988,5.0,3.0,"Honestly the best professor I've ever had. Amazing lectures, truly passionate about what he teaches. Incredibly accessible out of class, cares about his student. Class participation is important but you don't have to say much, just enough to show you're actually reading the texts"
3564,2057988,4.5,3.0,"Amazing guy and a great professor. Loves the subject and is very energetic. Discussions were lively and interesting in what I thought would be a snooze-fest. Able to relate a philosophy class to reality. As long as you participate and are involved in note-taking, you'll do alright in the class. Excellent experience and would definitely recommend."
3565,1844998,3.5,4.0,He gets a bad reputation from people that feel he gives too much work or that the tests are too hard. If you're looking for an easy math credit this isn't for you. He's very helpful if you attend class and go to office hours for help.
3566,1844998,4.0,4.0,"Professor Keller gets an unfair reputation mostly from 101 students who assume just because they took calc in high school that they should in college.  Those kids should take discrete, though.  Keller is helpful in office hours and a nice guy overall.  Brings baked goods sometimes too!  You will have to earn your grade but he is not unfair"
3567,1844998,1.0,5.0,I never take the time to rate my professors but W&L students beware: worst professor I've ever had. DO NOT take this class. Avoid Keller at all costs or watch your GPA and interest in math plummet
3568,1844998,1.5,5.0,"Means well, but the worst class I've taken at W&L."
3569,1844998,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher i have ever had in my entire life, and i am not exaggerating. My advice to freshman: if you have to choose between taking Mr. Dictator Keller or transferring... Transfer "
3570,1844998,2.5,5.0,Assigns a ridiculously amount of busy work which he grades extremely harsh.  I currently have a B+ and have yet to get a question wrong. Think about that. He takes points away left and right if you don't put it in his special format or don't explain your answer to the level a 5 year old could understand what you were doing.
3571,1844998,2.0,4.0,"Professor Keller is one of a kind. At first I absolutely hated every second of his class and his insanely tough group homework assignments, but after a midterm review, he seemed to notice that people were not enjoying his class and his attitude changed greatly. He explained his method of teaching to the class and praised the efforts of the students"
3572,1844998,1.0,5.0,"Probably one of the worst teachers i have ever had, just a heads up.. avoid at all cost"
3573,1844998,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher at the school probably, and i am not just saying that... you can almost guarantee that if you walk through the library on a tuesday, thursday or sunday night you will overhear someone talking poorly about him. "
3574,1844998,1.0,5.0,"keller is literally the worst. i expected to find professors here that cared about the students, and he couldn't care less. he is insincere and unhelpful. there is unnecessary work and your life will be consumed by pointless busy work. get read to teach yourself, and have to write and explain every problem. good luck if you take his class"
3575,1844998,1.0,4.0,"One of the worst teachers I have ever had. He is rude, stuck up and pretentious. HE DOES NOT TEACH AT ALL. Do not take him, whatever you do, do not take him. Its not just me, literally everyone who takes him complains about him on a daily basis. Essentially the hitler of W&L. Go genies"
3576,1844998,1.5,4.0,"Pretty terrible. I'm very interested in math and he's honestly ruining it for me. He doesn't understand how to teach the concepts, and often ignores teaching the mathematical formulas required to do the work. I find that teaching myself out of the book is more effective than listening to his lectures."
3577,1844998,1.5,5.0,"Keller makes calculus unreasonably and unnecessarily difficult. He only wants to teach by the textbook, and doesn't care to alter his teaching methods for the students' better understanding of the topic. He can be helpful if you go to his office hours religiously, but his office is always packed with confused students. Group hw is impossible."
3578,1844998,3.0,2.0,"His grading scale is weird, but tailored to give good grades so his grading and tests are hard.  But if you show you at least understand what is going on a B is possible to get.  If you are a math person an A is not too difficult either"
3579,1844998,1.5,4.0,"Bad Communicator, Tough Grader; terrible combination. Plus his group homework is impossible"
3580,1844998,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!  I actually enjoyed calculus before having him as a teacher. He does not teach at all. The whole class is based on group work and graded homework, but he never even explains how to do the work. Also, he has so many pet peeves that anything you do runs the risk of making him hate you. I would never recommend him to anyone."
3581,1844998,3.5,4.0,"Makes Calculus unreasonably hard, almost half your grade comes from group assignments, which you don't pick your group. Tests are hard."
3582,1844998,1.5,4.0,"THE WORST PROFESSOR EVER. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Calc 101, which I took in high school, should NOT be this hard. Teaches in the most unhelpful way possible. Reading questions from the textbook are due for every class and you also have group homeworks due every week that he makes IMPOSSIBLE to complete unless you meet with him multiple times."
3583,1844999,5.0,3.0,"Professor Laughy is absolutely brilliant and genuinely invested in the success of his students. For his Greek classes, there are lots of quizzes but he always announces them ahead of time and makes it very clear what you have to know. "
3584,1844999,4.0,5.0,"Professor Laughy is a great guy, super funny and really knowledgable. The class I took on greek art and archaeology is just a tough class. Not an easy A by any means but if you are willing to put in the work you can do well. Don't take this unless you are really interested in greek art and archaeology but if you are interested he's the best."
3585,1844999,5.0,3.0,Best teacher in the world. Taken 2 full years with him and plan on more.
3586,1844999,5.0,2.0,"Great Professor. Took him during Spring Term and although there was quite a bit of reading, the class was not overwhelming. Easy grader on tests, papers, and projects. Lectures were engaging and he has a great sense of humor. Would definitely recommend Laughy!"
3587,1844999,5.0,3.0,Professor Laughy is amazing. Definitely take one of his classes if you can
3588,1844999,5.0,4.0,I am currently in another one of his classes and will take at least two more. You learn a lot in this class and it's not just about the language. He loves to tell stories of his archaeological dig in Greece that he supervises ever summer. He is very nice and is willing to help you during office hours and in class.
3589,1844999,5.0,3.0,Professor Laughy is the absolute coolest guy and greatest person and professor you will ever meet!! He's so incredibly helpful outside of class and his lectures are the best I've ever had. I would honestly take any class from him no matter what subject. I can't rave about him enough! Just take his class and you'll be hooked!
3590,1844999,4.5,4.0,"Best professor I've ever had, ever. Took Greek and one of his Classics seminars on a whim and a term and a half later, I'm a Classics major. So helpful, so hilarious, and ridiculously intelligent. If you have any interest at all in Classics or Greek, TAKE HIS CLASS. Just do it."
3591,1844999,5.0,2.0,"Laughy is the BEST professor I have ever had. Although I am incredibly interested in the subject, I think that taking his courses single-handedly turns people into Classics majors. He will go way out of his way to help his students, is lenient but also firm (how does one accomplish this combo?), and is hilarious in class. Highly, highly recommend."
3592,1844999,5.0,2.0,"My favorite professor. Knows the info SO well and is SO passionate that the class is fun and the lectures are not boring. Had no interest in the topic at all but it's now my favorite class. No homework, only readings which aren't always necessary for the class. Really nice grader and just an awesome guy"
3593,2057993,5.0,3.0,A really nice guy who genuinely cares about his students. It's very important to participate in class to do well but he encourages his students. Textbook is pricy. My only gripe with him is that he makes you think you're doing well but is a deceptively hard grader. It's a shame he's not coming back next year.
3594,2057993,5.0,3.0,Fantastic Spanish teacher. Very patient and enthusiastic. Willing to work with struggling students and really cares. Textbook for Span-161 and 162 is pricy.
3595,2057993,5.0,2.0,Javier is the dude. He is very funny and understanding as well as patient with students who struggle with Spanish. Very accessible outside of class and lenient with grading. I wish all my professors were like him.
3596,2057993,5.0,2.0,He's a really nice guy and responds to all help requests in time. And he really puts a lot of efforts in his classes to make them as interesting as possible. He's definitely one of my favorite professors. I wish I could take more classes with him.
3597,2057993,5.0,3.0,"Usually accessible outside of class, very nice, if you have a problem with an assignment he usually helps out. All in all, one of my favorite professors here."
3598,2057993,4.5,3.0,"Professor Buenadicha is extremely helpful. I struggled a lot in the beginning, but after asking, Professor Buenadicha helped send me supplementary material to catch up and helped me a lot in office hours. He managed to always make class enjoyable. There is a lot of homework, but there has to be. It comes with learning a new language. He is great!"
3599,2057993,4.0,2.0,"Great professor and a great guy. Managed to make Spanish interesting and engaging. Hilarious and invested in each student individually. Lots of homework, but tests and material isn't too difficult if you keep up with your work. If you have to take a Spanish class, he's is your man. I would highly recommend him."
3600,1290001,1.0,2.0,"This professor now teaches at Lenoir-Rhyne University. He is incredibly vague in almost every aspect of the course, picks favorites and you will not know your grade until the class is over. You will receive and incomplete at midterm. You will not get any papers back. Ridiculous policies are upheld as well. Beware his classes!"
3601,1290001,4.5,3.0,No Comments
3602,1871633,4.5,2.0,"One of the nicest men I've met. Fantastic format for the class: 1 assignmentweek, with 1 huge paper due at end of the term. No final, no tests.  The students here who complain about him are definitely texting, surfing internet, etc in class. He teaches tough, concepts classes, and you gotta pay close attention to him and take good notes to do well"
3603,1871633,3.5,4.0,"I got a solid introduction to data structures and object oriented programming from Salan, and it prepared me very well for industry internships. His tests were difficult but were a good mix of code and theoretical situations, and I struggled with the midterm. Once I got used to his test format I did well and ended up with an A on the final."
3604,1871633,2.0,3.0,"Not an interesting lecturer. I had trouble because assignment handouts were eiter nonexistent, or missing crucial information given only in lecture. I had no reference to verify that I had done it right. It's my own fault waiting until the last minute so I couldn't just ask him--so if you take him don't make that mistake yourself."
3605,1871633,2.0,4.0,Wasn't particularly clear or detailed while explaining concepts. Occasionally wasn't able to figure something out himself. He would try to explain things until you got them if you asked questions though. Tests were harder than expected and not easy to prepare for.
3606,1845020,5.0,3.0,"Best teacher I have ever taken, no question about it. "
3607,1845020,5.0,4.0,"I don't have much to say, I have never written one of these before. Her modern political philosophy class was absolutely outstanding. She took boring material and a dozen constantly hungover students and created an class full of discussion and meaningful debate. Everyone in the class contributed. Definitely will be taking her next year, no doubt."
3608,1845020,5.0,3.0,Without a doubt the best teacher I have ever had. She made the class so interesting and engaging. Would take her again... and again.... and again... but the politics department is making a HUGE mistake letting her go. You hear that Morel.... I have taken 2 of your classes and would take hers over yours any day of the week. 
3609,1845020,4.0,3.0,"The class was very interesting.  Professor Hale really knew the material well.  You have to do the reading and participate in class to pass, though.  Most of the reading is interesting, although some is rather difficult to get through."
3610,1845020,3.5,3.0,"Professor Hale is very knowledgable and passionate about her work. The class is mostly discussion based so participation is a major factor of your grade, but it isn't too difficult of a class. She is there for any questions you might have and does not assign too much work, although some readings can be a bit monotonous."
3611,1845020,4.0,4.0,"Dr Hale's class was excellent. You must come to class and read the assignments. If you have questions she's always willing to help during office hous or through email. Why you would take a math class from a politics professor is beyond me, she was excellent."
3612,1845020,1.0,3.0,"Fortunately for her, she's actually a politics PhD, so perhaps she has some utility to this school. However, her teaching and grading skills were horrendous, as on both tests I got back there were simple arithmetic errors and she would have been totally unprepared to teach the class w/o the slides that came with the book."
3613,1845020,2.0,3.0,"If you want to waste 4 hours of your week, this is how.  You're better off sitting home reading the book than coming to class.  It's a dull lecture class of a book-prepared powerpoint--useless and not how you learn for a math/analytic class.  Teacher refers to the book for answers to most questions. Webassign homework is tedious and useless."
3614,2445096,5.0,4.0,Professor Vise was one of my favorite professors I had last semester. Does a good job keeping lectures interesting and explaining content. She can be intimidating at first but I highly suggest going to office hours before turning in her papers. 
3615,2445096,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Vise is cool. Really really like her as a person. As a prof, she expects that her class takes priority. So. Much. Reading. And you can't just skim and expect to be fine in class. She knows when people haven't read, and it's not a huge deal, but you def can't slack all semester and expect to pass. She's an awesome person who runs a tough class."
3616,2445096,4.0,4.0,"Really cares about her students and expects you to work hard, but if you are willing to she will help you as much as possible. Expect a lot of text book reading and essay writing."
3617,2445096,2.0,4.0,"Lots and lots of tedious reading. Really tough about participation, if you don't say at least one meaningful comment per class your grade will suffer. Assigns so much work that she expects you to only pay attention to her class. She doesn't do the best job of keeping students engaged either. Overall an underwhelming professor and class."
3618,2445096,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Vise is very nice, open, and a fair grader. There was a lot of reading, but it was to be expected in a 200-lvl history course. Read, participate and go to office hours and you'll do well."
3619,2445096,5.0,4.0,Professor Vise is a history student's professor. She is really into the topics and you can have a conversation with her whenever just to talk about the material. If you are not a history kid is a reading heavy course that is a good 1-2 hours of homework per class.
3620,2445096,4.0,4.0,"Professor Vise is a very sweet and caring professor. She makes time to meet with each student outside of class and gives great feedback on essays. There is quite a lot of reading but it is manageable. Participation makes up 25% of the grade, however she makes it very easy for all students (even the quiet ones) to speak up."
3621,2445096,4.0,3.0,"Professor Vise is a very nice teacher who is easily available outside of class. Her midterm this year was far too comprehension for the amount of time allotted which upset many students. However, her classes are very interesting and engaging. It is a lot of reading, but if you are interested in the subject matter it is not so bad."
3622,2445096,5.0,3.0,"She is such a good professor. She makes the class super interesting and relatable, and she is always available to help. She won't just give As out for no reason. But if you listen in class, and don't fall asleep, an A- is completely do-able without that much effort at all. She made even the most boring primary sources pretty interesting."
3623,2445096,2.0,3.0,"Information in the class was interesting, but the amount of reading she expected you to do was borderline unbearable with your other classes. Not the harshest of graders but certainly not an easy A. Participation is necessary if you want to do well. Found myself falling asleep in class a lot. No tests, just essays and a midterm and final."
3624,2006827,2.0,2.0,"Online school during 2021 with professor colon could not have been worse. He doesnt teach and is lazy. If you want an easy A then go for it, but be prepared for him to ask you pointless questions about life that dont relate at all to communications. He never has a lesson plan."
3625,2006827,3.0,4.0,"Professor Colon has a lot of knowledge but that also means he will talk for a really long time. His grading criteria is not clear and his feedback on writing assignments is not very detailed. However, there are alot of group assignments and short writings to help boost your grade. Overall, he's generally a really good guy and a pretty ok professor."
3626,2006827,4.0,3.0,"Professor Colon gives engaging lectures that foster student participation and critical thinking. He will force you to consider alternate perspectives, and he'll crack a joke every once in a while. Speak up, do your assignments, and you will succeed and enjoy his class. He's a great guy!"
3627,2006827,4.0,4.0,"Took his poverty in the media class. Pretty good if youre interested in POV, and not hard if you arent. Papers due every Friday and a good amount of reading,  but hes super approachable about everything, and funny and nice. Great dude"
3628,2006827,4.0,3.0,Professor Colon is a good professor
3629,2006827,2.5,3.0,Good professor. Confusing assignments but not an impossible grader. Responds to questionsfeedback from students very well. If you are lost --- ask! 
3630,2713389,2.0,4.0,"First off, she's probably the most conservative professor in the school, so beware if that's an issue. She's also super heavy on lectures, with no powerpoints, so you need to take notes to do well. And she grades hard, even in a pol100 class - not unreasonably hard, but it was unexpected. Overall, not the best. I'd take someone else instead."
3631,2713389,1.0,4.0,Prof. Uzzell is horrible. She is not nice and thinks she is smarter than everyone else. Not kind outside of class either when I went to her for help. DO NOT TAKE.
3632,2713389,4.0,4.0,"I learned more in Professor Uzzell's constitutional simulation class than any class ever, but her grading was very hard and she is not a good professor for you if you are not willing to put in the work. Her lectures can be very boring, but the second half of the term (simulation) was completely worth it and a must for anyone majoring in US Pol/His."
3633,2713389,4.0,4.0,"The main thing about Professor Uzzell is that she is a tough grader. This is manageable if you are willing to work hard and take her feedback into account. She is also more than happy to meet with you if you need help with an assignment or have any questions. Her classes are by no means easy; however, there is a clear path to success."
3634,2713389,1.0,5.0,I disliked this class more than any other class I have taken at W&amp;L. Professor Uzzell is an unnecessarily difficult grader for a 100 level politics class. Her lectures are boring and are not structured. I felt it difficult to develop any valuable student/professor relationship. Avoid her classes if you can.
3635,2713389,1.0,5.0,"Utterly unreasonable standards for assignments and grading. Unique scheduling of assignments for each student; forced me to write three papers on the same day. Grading has little to no feedback, and the little feedback offer lacks anything relevant to the course material. Avoid if you want to retain your love of politics and associated topics."
3636,2713389,1.0,5.0,She doesn't care about her student's success. She terrible lecturer. Steer clear.
3637,2713389,3.0,4.0,"This was the most fun I have ever had in a class. It was a constitutional simulation game. My only real complaint was that I did not find her grading metric to be clear at all. For the midterm she just gave everyone a grade back with zero explanation. She also grades papers with very little explanation, and it seems like she grades hard."
3638,2713389,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely do not take an Uzzell class. She has unreasonable standards for students, with low grades often returned with no substantive feedback. She is also rude and only responded to a couple of my seven emails to her. She lectured nonstop for the first half of the semester as well. If you get her, be prepared for an all-around awful experience."
3639,2713389,5.0,3.0,"Professor Uzzell is the best professor in W&amp;L's political science department by far. She is incredibly smart and while her class is lecture heavy, her lecturing abilities are fantastic. If you want a grade inflated easy grade, don't take her. If you actually want to learn I would highly recommend her."
3640,2713389,2.0,4.0,Uzzell lectures all class without much opportunity for class participation. Be prepared to listen and take notes because she doesn't use PowerPoint and hardly rights anything on the board. Make sure you do the readings and discussion posts or else you will sink. Be prepared for two in-class debates and write a long term paper which she grades tough
3641,2713389,3.0,5.0,"Professor Uzzell is very smart, and somewhat personable. She'll crack a few jokes, but the novelty will wear off when you see your grades. Not one person received higher than an 87 on our class's midterm. Too harsh a grader. Incredibly lecture heavy, no PowerPoint, just her ramblings. Do not take if you care about your GPA."
3642,2713389,2.0,5.0,"Professor Uzzell is incredibly knowledgeable about her field and is very sharp. However, the coursework for the class was vastly different for each student (some were arbitrarily saddled with significantly more coursework). She requires a quality of work that is more suitable for graduate school than undergraduate students."
3643,1767219,5.0,4.0,"such a good prof. made me want to take more math?????
very good at explanations and obviously cares a lot. the work may seem like a lot but it's really kinda necessary to make sure you understand the material -- read her feedback! a lot of the time she'll tell you exactly what she wants to see on assignments/test"
3644,1767219,5.0,3.0,Professor Denne is literally the best Professor Ive had at W&amp;L. She explains thing very clearly and tests are rather straight forward. The class is homework heavy but go to office hours and you will be set. Great sense of humor
3645,1767219,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE her class. Definitely should take her class if you are considering Math major. She explains things really clear and her office hour is SUPER helpful. The workload is okish and exams are pretty straightforward. I will not hesitate to take her class again if I have the chance, even if it is an 8:30 class."
3646,1767219,5.0,4.0,"You will have to work hard, but She really cares about your success in the class. If you put in the work and show up to class and office hours you will find success in the class."
3647,1767219,5.0,3.0,"I cannot stress how much I love Professor Denne. She truly cares about her students so much, is so knowledgable, and genuinely wants her students to do well. Go to her office hours (she has a ton so it isn't hard) and she will definitely take note of that in your grade. She converted me and about 4 other people into a math major."
3648,1767219,5.0,5.0,"Denne is an angel on Earth. I really struggled through analysis, and she was right there with me for every step of the way of the struggle. She was available for group office hours and one on one time, and made being in the class easier. I absolutely recommend her as a professor and a mentor on campus"
3649,1767219,4.0,3.0,"Made course accessible to ppl who aren't naturally good at math. she's savage when critiquing &amp; helping though. You have to code everything in latex &amp; do things her way if you want full credit, but if she sees you're working hard and coming to office hours, you'll be rewarded and make it through the assignments. hw &amp; cw get most weight in grading."
3650,1767219,5.0,2.0,"Professor Denne is the best math professor I've ever had. She explains everything very clearly and is extremely helpful during office hours. Weekly problem sets are hard, but she basically gives the answers to you if you go to her office hours."
3651,1767219,5.0,3.0,"She is AMAZING! I love her lectures and class examples--those are extremely helpful for exams and finals. She grades homework and gives good feedback. Tests are a little difficult but very similar to homework. As long as you follow her instructions and do your work, you'll get a satisfying result."
3652,1767219,5.0,4.0,Awesome teacher! Very funny and accessible outside class. Tests are hard and usually graded over 30-something so every point matters a lot. Her class examples are very helpful so be sure not to fall asleep.
3653,1767219,5.0,4.0,"Professor Denne is great. She cares about her students. She had the goal of learning everyone's name within the first couple classes. Go to office hours. Homework is graded &amp; counts for 20% of the ur grade, so make sure u go to office hours to boost ur homework grade. She's always willing/wants to help. Tests are usually easier than the tougher hw."
3654,1767219,5.0,5.0,"Denne personally is a character. At first I thought she was blunt, but soon realized she is kind and hilarious. Her office hours are SO helpful- GO TO THESE!! Dennes class has a reliable amount of homework, and youll have to study if you want an A. Overall great teacher- love her."
3655,1767219,5.0,4.0,Best professor ever.
3656,1767219,4.0,3.0,"A good, funny professor who is helpful and encouraging."
3657,1767219,5.0,4.0,"She is really organized and approachable. Sometimes bake cookies for the class. She has accent, but it's cute. Love her."
3658,1767219,5.0,4.0,Professor Denne has been my favorite professor at W&L so far. She is so sweet (she makes you brownies!!) and really cares that her students do well; she is always there for office hours or after class if you just have a quick homework question. She also allows plenty of time during class for questions. 
3659,1767219,4.5,3.0,Professor Denne is the reason I declared math. Her lectures were very engaging and often funny. Some people seam to think she is tough but I think her grading is clear.
3660,1767219,2.5,4.0,"Denne is so excited about the material that she teaches that she sometimes assumes that everyone else is as enthusiastic as she is. She tends to be spacey in her explanations and is only slightly clearer when you ask specific questions. She has a dry, snarky sense of humor that is sometimes taken as rude, but it's just her way of poking fun."
3661,1767219,4.5,4.0,"Very helpful in office hours. Material was tough, but she teaches it well and is willing to give extra help to help you understand and succeed."
3662,1767219,5.0,3.0,Professor Denne inspired me both with her aptitude in Mathematics and her personality. She is an acquired taste for sure but once you communicate with her your problem with her homework and tests ( at first may seem a little tough) she will try to make them easier for you. Definitely not there to slash your GPA.
3663,1767219,4.0,5.0,"Very passionate about her subject and is very helpful during office hours, willing to help you if you seek her help regardless of how much help is needed. Very reasonable with tests and quizzes, moves fast with textbook so easy to fall behind but if work is put in very likely to be successful."
3664,1767219,4.5,3.0,"Engaging in class lecture and good with answering questions. Extremely helpful during office hours. Has a sometimes sarcastic tone which I think is why some feel she is condescending. Overall a great math prof, especially for higher level classes."
3665,1767219,4.5,4.0,She definitely grew on me! I came into Calc 3 scared out of my mind and she eased me through it. Was incredibly helpful in office hours and instilled a love of math in me; ended up getting a B+ but ended up declaring a math major as well.
3666,1767219,1.5,5.0,"Does not explain concepts well at all. Will not bother to explain a question on a problem if she has done one previously (even if it was a week ago). Really an independent study I felt with the online Homework, and few tests."
3667,1767219,1.5,5.0,Tried very hard but was a teacher who knew a whole but could not convey her messages well at all. Really had to learn material myself through the book throughout the semester.
3668,1767219,1.5,4.0,"Not many people in our 102 class seemed to like her; she didn't do a lot of explaining of concepts and expected us to learn via diffusion or something. Her 221's seemed to like her though. She occasionally comes off as condescending, and didn't always answer your questions. She was a lot better in office hours than class. Overly smart."
3669,1767219,2.5,3.0,"She flat out doesn't explain concepts. She will give one example and then assume you understand it. She is also slightly condescending at times. She consistently messes up basic addition on the board so notes are rarely correct. Not a bad woman, just a typical mathematician who assumes everyone loves math and is shocked when others dont get things."
3670,2189113,4.0,3.0,Great professor and the class was orientated to teach about presenting via Zoom and how to improve presentation skills. All grades were based on your presentations.
3671,2189113,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lind was a really great professor and this class was actually pretty useful teaching us how to present in a business scenario over Zoom and create business orientated videos. There were reading assignments every night, but nothing too overwhelming. We only had 3 graded presentations and one video so you gotta do well on those."
3672,2189113,5.0,2.0,"Simply put, Professor Lind is both a great Professor and one of many great people on W&amp;L's campus. He's very knowledgable about the topics he teaches, and his assignment/grading expectations are fair and communicated well. Students who don't do well put in little/no effort or don't carefully read assignment expectations. One of my favorites at W&amp;L"
3673,2189113,1.0,4.0,"I've never imagined being in a well-reputed college and having to grow an utter disgust towards a professor. Professor Lind is petty and immature. His communications skills ironically are absolutely that of a 5-year-old vengeful child who is out there to criticize, discourage and condemn students merely out of sadistic pleasure. Please avoid him."
3674,2189113,4.0,5.0,He is definitely a tough grader but very worth it. I have learned more from his classes than any other classes at W&amp;L. His lectures are interesting and valuable. Very smart and genuinely invested in his students. It was a bit frustrating that my work didn't seem to increase my grade at all throughout the term but the learning is so worth it.
3675,2189113,1.0,5.0,"I would never, ever take this class again. Professor Lind likes to hear himself talk and will take fifteen minutes to answer one question that needed a three minute answer. His lectures often don't make sense, and he grades very harshly. No mercy. 50% off if you're even a minute late. Doesn't matter if it's a tech issue out of your hands."
3676,2189113,5.0,2.0,"I couldnt imagine myself taking any other First-Year Writing Seminar! Professor Lind did a great job of teaching us the basics of business writing, and he did so while keeping our classes engaging. Hes passionate about communications and technology (we had tech tips in most of our classes), and hes just a fun person to talk to."
3677,2189113,1.0,5.0,"Avoid at all costs, unless you enjoy listening to someone brag about their personal accomplishments for 90 minutes."
3678,2189113,1.0,5.0,"Worst class I have ever taken at W&L. Class time is useless, he spends the entire class rambling about his personal successes and assigns busywork projects that are arbitrarily graded without a rubric. Assignment instructions are remarkably unclear, which is painfully ironic given the subject matter. I have gained no new knowledge from prof. Lind."
3679,548666,1.0,1.0,"Bizarre class. The lecture notes did not seem to match the material presented in the textbook, and the material on the tests did not match either!"
3680,548666,2.0,2.0,"He claims that his tests are hard and that he likes to make the course difficult, but in reality, it is hard in the wrong way. You are tested on material that is never covered, and hardly anything on the so-called tests matches what was taught in the textbook or discussed in class."
3681,548666,1.0,3.0,"According to him, there is never a situation when a tax is appropriate. Class time was typically spent making ridiculous generalizations and discussing political issues that had little to do with the course material. Terrible class!"
3682,548666,1.0,2.0,"Lectures consisted of poorly-scribbled notes of random graphs, the majority of which were not presented in the textbook that we were told to be reading. It is almost impossible to study for his ridiculous tests which are supposedly &quot;hard&quot; but in reality consist mostly of material that has not been taught or covered in the course. Ineffective class."
3683,548666,1.0,3.0,"Loves to tell irrelevant stories, and talks broadly about himself and &quot;life.&quot; He is almost never available to meet, and he is constantly talking about how busy he is as a dean. He did manage to tell us that he was &quot;always getting dumped&quot; when he was in college, and he explained how tube socks are made. You will not learn any economics in the course"
3684,548666,1.0,4.0,"Tons of assignments that were worth next to nothing but took excessive time. Poorly designed weight on assignments, i.e. the exams were worth far too much and the homework worth barely anything. Ridiculously ineffective lectures."
3685,548666,1.0,5.0,N/A
3686,548666,2.5,4.0,"This class was a huge disappointment. It was supposed to be interdisciplinary (POV), but it clearly wasn't. You realize how little you actually covered (but how much you're expected to know) when you start to study. You have to pry answers out of him, and you leave office hours feeling worse than when you came in. Would not recommend."
3687,548666,2.5,4.0,"Health Economics. The most disappointed I've been with a class at W&L. Supposed to be interdisciplinary (POV), but barely even distinguished Medicare from Medicaid. You have to pry help out of him, you leave office hours feeling worse than when you came. Expectations were unclear, and the debates, although interesting, detracted from the class."
3688,548666,5.0,4.0,"If you attend class, put in the work outside of class, and go to office hours when you need it, you will do well. He is nice, funny, and eager to teach students who want to learn! He's a great teacher! I recommend you take his classes."
3689,548666,4.0,3.0,"Professor Diette is an incredible professor. His lectures are always incredibly entertaining. My only reservation is that he tends to hang onto assignments for extended periods of time, which makes it difficult to know 1) Where you stand 2) How you can improve before it is too late =P"
3690,548666,5.0,2.0,"Incredibly helpful and enthusiastic professor. I had no interest in economics before taking this class, but I really enjoyed it. If you understand graphs and algebra, you'll do well. He genuinely cares about all his students both in and outside the classroom, and he continues to support students after they finish his class."
3691,548666,5.0,3.0,"Hard class, easy to do well if you try hard and see him for extra help."
3692,548666,5.0,5.0,"Interesting professor. Friendly and smart and helpful and fair. Really cares about students. Tough to figure out how to do well in his class though. If he ever draws a graph on the board, write it down carefully, label it well, and study it hard. You'll do better in the class if you've already got a few other econ classes under your belt."
3693,548666,5.0,3.0,He really knows how to teach the material of the course. Just a lot of busy work that impacts your grade. If you meet with him he is very helpful
3694,548666,5.0,4.0,"He expects mastery of the material from his students, but he's an incredibly knowledgeable professor who explains things very well. He's really willing to help and makes the class extremely interesting to be in. His tests are really hard and long though (and at like 7 pm) so study hard!"
3695,548666,5.0,5.0,"Diette is extremely knowledgeable and helpful, but expects a lot from his students. The class can be incredibly difficult at times, but he is always available for help, and considers participation in class as a crucial part of your grade."
3696,548666,4.5,5.0,"I absolutely loved Professor Diette's class. He convinced me to switch my major from politics to economics, and he worked with me the entire term on a very attentive and personal level. He makes the subject so applicable and interesting."
3697,548666,4.5,4.0,"Really nice guy. Interested in students doing well in class. Tests are really hard but fair. Keep up with reading and take good notes. Overall I recommend him because he really teaches you and you learn a lot, despite the challenging nature of the class."
3698,548666,2.0,5.0,sucks.
3699,548666,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely did not want to take this class, and now I am so thankful I did. I actually learned in this class, so while tests were no doubt challenging, they were completely fair. I go out of my way to recommend this prof to my friends."
3700,548666,5.0,5.0,"Diette is a great guy. He's gives tough tests, but if you want to really learn econ, he's a great prof to have as well. Also, he loves talking UNC bball, and went to W&L so he knows what we're up to. Very nice guy, great teacher, and I plan on taking another of his classes in the future..."
3701,548666,5.0,5.0,I don't know how I managed to do well in this class. He is a great teacher but expects you to know econ because he actually teaches econ unlike the other econ professors like smitka. Test are long and he expects you to know everything and I mean every damm thing these is to know about 20 different subjects.
3702,548666,2.0,3.0,"Unfortunately he does not know basic English grammar, which makes his test questions often difficult to understand or even illogical."
3703,548666,5.0,4.0,"fantastic professor.  knows tons about health economics, but also is really concerned with his students and our understanding of the material.  really a great guy.  take a class with him!  while he's a bit difficult, it's manageable and absolutely worth it!!"
3704,548666,5.0,3.0,GREAT professor.  So wonderful I made him my advisor.  His lectures are actually very interesting and his notes are very clear and direct.  Know your stuff because tests can be tough.
3705,548666,5.0,3.0,"GREAT professor.  Very fair in grading, very clear lecture, precise straightforward notes.  EXTREMELY helpful and available outside of class.  He's pretty funny too."
3706,548666,4.5,4.0,"a little harder than most intro econ classes, but you will learn a lot.  if you are looking for easy credits, take someone else.  if you want to learn econ, diette is your man"
3707,548666,5.0,5.0,"Very nice guy, makes himself available and is very willing to help.  Unfortunately, makes Econ 101 much tougher than it should be.  He gives you lots of practice assignments which feel like they help, then the test questions are MUCH harder than the practice ones.  Nice guy, but take someone else if you want a good grade."
3708,548666,5.0,3.0,Diette is the man.  I had him for 101 and he was an outstanding professor. He's readily available and genuinlely want you to learn the material. His cold tests prepare extremely well for the tests and you learn a lot. Overall great prof
3709,548666,5.0,3.0,"Outstanding professor - makes himself available, truly cares about his students, and is straightforward with tests and assignments.  Take him."
3710,548666,5.0,3.0,"Great guy, fun lecture - really makes you understand the material. Always ready to help and you can always, really always, reach him via email. I never thought i would enjoy econ that much! Very sad that he's not gonna teach 102 next term!"
3711,548666,5.0,3.0,"I took Econ 101, 102, and 297 with him cause I like him so much. Watch out for his upper level courses because they are very hard wtih lots of work and time, but definately take 101 or 102 with him because he is one of the best profs I have ever had."
3712,548666,4.5,2.0,"He's a good prof who really works hard to make himself accessible. He's good about letting you know what to expect on quizes/exams. Even if econ really isn't your thing, you'll still be able to do well in his class"
3713,548666,4.5,1.0,"i like this guy. he isnt hard, and he is just happy all the time. very easy going. homeworks are all graded on effort. midterms and exams are long, and you should definitely study and practice, but he isnt too hard. he gives lots of points if you show work and make an effort to get an answer."
3714,548666,4.0,1.0,"Not a great public speaker, sometimes gets lost during lectures, but you'll learn the material one way or another, and the quizzes and tests are not hard."
3715,548666,4.0,2.0,"Gets a bit flustered while lecturing, but obviously he's somewhat new to this.  Damn fine professor, challenges students progressively, starting easy, then ratcheting it up as appropriate."
3716,548666,5.0,2.0,Great Prof.. very helpful and cooperative. Take his class if u can. he's fun and interesting.
3717,347964,5.0,4.0,"Professor Mayock is one of the most caring, dedicated, and amazing professors that I have ever had. Her class structure is well thought out and she is always available outside of class if needed. I would recommend Profesora Mayock to anyone and everyone who attends Washington and Lee University!"
3718,347964,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely LOVED Professor Mayock, she is unbelievably knowledgable in the language and the Spanish culture. Class participation is important, but her lectures are very engaging so that's not very difficult to do."
3719,347964,5.0,2.0,"Queen! She keeps class interesting by using a variety of classes/activities. It was the perfect mix of challenging without being stressful or time consuming, and she gives really clear feedback about what to improve so you can fix your grades."
3720,347964,5.0,3.0,"I loved Professor Mayock's class! She gave a super reasonable amount of reading and let us do creative projects in class. She's wonderful about helping outside of class and will totally meet with you to talk about any Spanish-related questions you have. She does require blog work and group projects, but they're not too bad."
3721,347964,3.5,2.0,"Incredibly helpful. A great professor, very passionate and knowledgeable. Always a fun class, and a great sort of break during the day."
3722,347964,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely love this professor. She is a phenomenal person, fantastic teacher, and her Spanish is impeccable. She has further increased my love of the language and I will be actively looking to take any of her classes I can. I cannot stress enough how amazing she is. Always accessible, cares deeply for each student, and wants you to succeed."
3723,347964,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mayock is by far the best professor I have had at W&L. She is so nice, so helpful, and such a fair grader. If you participate and want to do well, you most likely will."
3724,347964,4.5,3.0,LOVE Mayock. Had her for Intro to Lit Espanola. A fair amount of reading but definitely manageable. The midterm was really fair and she really cares about you learning and understanding everything.
3725,347964,4.5,2.0,"Fantastic. Her LACS class is broad, but incredibly interesting. Exactly what college should be. Lots of class discussion, and Mayock really values student experience. Lots of reading, but very manageable. Mid-term and final are broad, but reasonable. Research paper on topic of your choice."
3726,347964,5.0,3.0,"This is the second Mayock class I have taken thus far, and I can fairly say she is one of W&L's most genuine and adept professors. She is always available for help and knows so much about her subject that you will take away a lot from any of her classes."
3727,347964,4.0,3.0,"2nd class with Mayock, continues to be the best professor I have had at W&L. Enthusiastic, informative, intellectual and truly cares about each student. Makes it fun, keeps it interesting, easy syllabus to follow and plan for, the right amount of work so its actually beneficial without being overwhelming. TAKE A CLASS WITH HER!"
3728,347964,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors at W&L. She loves Spanish and is incredibly effective at teaching it and ensuring that everyone understands the literature.
3729,347964,4.5,3.0,"Helpful, nice, overall great teacher. Straight forward and reasonable. Definitely recomend"
3730,347964,4.5,2.0,Very few assignments.  Read the stories/poems and participate in class and you will do fine. Mayock is great- she is very interested in the topic and loves questions and comments.
3731,347964,5.0,2.0,One of the best classes I had at W&L; she was fantastic.
3732,347964,5.0,5.0,"Great teacher, hard as hell but very engaging and knew a ton, taught us fun tidbits but expected us to work!"
3733,347964,5.0,4.0,"Very good but a little difficult, an interesting class but a lot of reading."
3734,347964,5.0,5.0,one word: hot-o-licious!
3735,347964,5.0,4.0,Class is difficult but you learn tons.  Best professor I've had here.
3736,347964,5.0,2.0,No Comments
3737,347964,5.0,3.0,"she is the epitomy of fluency in spanish, highly recommended"
3738,1220414,5.0,2.0,Intro physics.  Amazing teacher and easy to grasp material because his lectures are engaging and direct.
3739,1220414,5.0,3.0,"One of the best, most knowledgable professors at W&amp;L. He is able to explain concepts with clarity and is willing to help individuals outside of class. He is also enthusiastic about what he teaches and is relatively lenient when it comes to grading. The class structure/progression is logical and clear. He provides lots of practice material as well."
3740,1220414,5.0,3.0,I thought I despised physics until I took it with Dr. Mazilu
3741,1220414,4.0,3.0,"I'm not a physics person, but DMaz makes physics clear and interesting. He's super funny in class and doesn't assign a ton of outside work. Would recommend!!"
3742,1220414,4.0,3.0,"Professor Mazilu cares a lot about his students, and will make time to help outside of class. Tests are fair but not super easy. Funny in class and his lecture notes are clear and useful."
3743,1220414,5.0,2.0,Spring term physics class. Pretty easy for non-physics people. Good lectures that were very interesting. 
3744,1220414,4.0,3.0,He is a great professor and likes it when people participate in class. Many of his assignments are impossible to do but he will always help you if you to his office hours. 
3745,1220414,4.0,2.0,"Great professor.  His accent takes a little getting used to, but he's not unintelligible.  Lectures are well-structured and tests aren't anything out of the ordinary.  Overall: 4/5 would take again."
3746,1220414,5.0,4.0,"Professor Dan Mazilu is one of the best teachers at our school. His lectures are clear, thorough and interesting.  Dan spends a lot of time helping students with HMW. He is  always polite and encouraging."
3747,1220414,2.0,3.0,Took him because of the reviews I read on here. Completely misleading and about time someone is honest. 1) you can't understand a word he says in class. 2) Condescending in his office hours when are trying to get help. 3)Better off getting a tutor then going to his class 4)His wife is significantly a better teacher 5)doesn't curve
3748,1220414,5.0,3.0,"Dan is such a great teacher. He is funny and interesting, and definitely the best teacher available for intro physics on this campus. He genuinely cares that you do well, and he tests and homework are reasonable and fairly easily graded. As long as you try in his class, you will do fine. His accent is also awesome!"
3749,1220414,5.0,4.0,"Amazing prof.  He is one of the best I've had at W&L!  I came in hating physics b/c of HS, but Dr. Mazilu totally changed that.  I only wish I had him for 112 as well..."
3750,1220414,3.5,2.0,"Dr. Dan is great! Class is predictable because of his consistent teaching style. Every day you come to class having printed out the &quot;worksheet&quot; (a mostly blank packet of papers with headings and illustrations) for that chapter. Listen up, write down the important points, and you're golden. If you read the book in addition, you'll leave with an A."
3751,1994564,3.0,4.0,He has an easier grading scale so you can get the grade. But I didn't learn a lot in this class.
3752,1994564,4.0,3.0,"Professor Richards is an extremely nice professor that truly cares about his students as individuals. He is there to help if you make the effort to go to office hours. His lectures can be confusing at times, but that is the reality of Calculus- confusing and hard to follow. All in all, he makes jokes to lighten the heavy material and grades fairly."
3753,1994564,3.5,2.0,"Trevor Richards gives excellent class notes, which he prints out for you. However, his in class lecture can be a little confusing. If you stick to the examples and do all of your home work, you'll do fine."
3754,1994564,1.0,5.0,"Teaches the class assuming you know things that are taught in MATH 301. Very disorganized lectures. Thankfully, his grading scale is really shifted. Otherwise I would have gotten a C in the class."
3755,1994564,2.5,3.0,"Richards is a new professor and it shows. He isn't clear and is nervous. I learned almost nothing from lectures, but going to office hours saved my life. He'll sit down with you and do 20 problems if that's what you need. His grading scale is ridiculous (80+ is A, 60-80 is B, 40-60 is C, etc) which makes it hard to fail. DO THE SUGGESTED PROBLEMS!!"
3756,1994564,1.5,3.0,He has no idea what he's talking about ever. Seems like the kids who have never taken the class know more than him. The only good thing about the class is that his grading scales is majorly curved. If you get less than a 50 on an exam it's still a C+
3757,528197,1.5,2.0,Absolutely not interested in helping you learn the material at all. All he does is read off of a word document and get exasperated when you ask questions. He is a very easy grader and that is the only thing that saved me from failing....
3758,528197,1.0,3.0,Going to class was a waste of time.  Review sessions and reading the book were way more helpful.  Professor Boller is a nice guy but teaches by reading straight off of a word document.  He is great about posting problems and solutions on Sakai and is a pretty easy grader.
3759,528197,2.0,3.0,He's a nice guy but he is a terrible teacher. His lectures are absolutely worthless. To do well in the class you have to memorize the book. Only take him if you need a lab credit and you can learn on your own.
3760,528197,2.5,1.0,"Boller is an awesome dude. He makes the material easy to understand for non-majors, and he is an awesome professor to take if you just want the lab credit."
3761,528197,3.0,1.0,"I had Boller for astronomy and the class is awesome. Lectures were boring, but weren't mandatory anyway. He clearly is interested in the subject, but most people are taking it to get a gen ed out of the way, and he knows that. He dumbs everything down, and he pretty much gives you the test in the form of the cold test. Good guy, definitely take him"
3762,528197,4.0,1.0,"very funny and nice guy, he dimmed the lights during his lectures so i fell asleep a lot.  labs were easy, take astronomy if u need a science gen ed"
3763,528197,4.0,3.0,"I think he is great. He tries his best to explain what is a difficult subject anyway, and if you go see him in his office, he is very willing to help. Plus he looks like the pringles man...almost makes up for the fact that we have 8am lectures 4 times a week!"
3764,528197,2.5,1.0,"The class was the same as a high-school's, but Boller doesn't really understand the concept of teaching.  Plus, who wants a 8am four days a week&#63;"
3765,528197,2.0,4.0,a terrible class. there is almost no reason to ever attend lectures. I never missed a class but still his lectures are completely useless. I left them more confused than coming in. Intro physics classes are just not that well put together here but I guess if you have to take physics he is as good as any other. he is an easy grader bad at explaining
3766,528197,4.0,3.0,"The quirkiest, coolest professor ever.  You pretty much have to accept that you're not going to get a lot of practical knowledge from the lecture, but the lab makes up for it (nobody has gotten below a 90 on any lab this semester).  Really, really nice guy who really loves physics.  He gives you a cold test that's really similar to the real deal."
3767,528197,3.0,3.0,"Boller is nice, but definitely not the best of professors.  Try to get Reese if you can."
3768,528197,4.5,2.0,No Comments
3769,528197,2.0,2.0,"For a class that's just meant to satisfy a GE, this isn't a bad one at all. Boller basically gives you the test before you take it in a review sheet... He's not always good at explaining stuff, but if you can read the book and get his diagrams, then you should do well. The labs totally beat bio labs"
3770,1808202,3.5,1.0,Really excited about teaching. Enthusiastic. Doesn't really know how to lead a coherent discussion. Gets off topic frequently. Should be able to do fine in class if one reads.
3771,2123603,5.0,4.0,"Professor Reid is the man. Ideal professor for intro accounting. The class grade is really based on just 3 tests but almost all accounting 100's are. He never puts any questions on the tests that he doesn't go over in class, great professor all around."
3772,2123603,5.0,2.0,Professor Reid is a gem. Dude is super chill and laid back and gives great interesting and clear lectures on the basics of accounting. Tests are incredibly straightforward and clearly stem from the online homework assignments. Highly recommend his class for a fun easy introduction to accounting!
3773,2123603,5.0,3.0,"Professor Reid is the man. He makes intermediate very easy to understand and the tests are always similar to problems that have been done in class. There's a decent amount of homework, but it really helps you stay up to date on the material. Would definitely recommend!"
3774,2123603,5.0,3.0,Great guy and loves to talk about sports. Really approachable and laid back.
3775,2123603,4.0,4.0,"Wish I'd had more time to dedicate towards this class. Online homework helps to understand concept, but you'll need to pay careful attention in class to make sure you make all of the connections. Studying only the homework will not get you an A on an exam. Would recommend going to office hours. Only hard work will get an A, but that's accounting."
3776,2123603,5.0,3.0,Pretty great professor. Super helpful. Every piece of homework he assigns is useful and he doesn't give any busy work. Good mixture of both notes and examples. I 100% recommend.
3777,2123603,4.0,2.0,"Solid professor. Go to class, pay attention, and ask questions if you don't understand something. Material is dull because it's accounting but he tries to do what he can to make it interesting"
3778,1343322,2.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed the topic and she is very interested in her subject - but it was difficult to insert your opinion without being shot down. She prepares you for high-standard-professors, but you might lose your confidence if not careful. Tough love."
3779,1343322,1.5,5.0,Its tough. Patience is needed.
3780,1343322,1.0,2.0,Absolutely horrible. Incredibly passive aggressive towards students. Unable to give helpful feedback on papers. She is unclear with deadlines and cannot retain the interest of even her most interested students. DO NOT TAKE.
3781,1343322,1.0,4.0,"Ugh, SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND THIS WOMAN! She goes off on rabbit trails like no other professors I've ever experienced.  Do not take unless you have lots of time and patience."
3782,1343322,2.0,5.0,"I sure do wish we had an actual textbook, instead of about 500 pages of loose leaf paper."
3783,1404771,4.5,3.0,"Best professor I've had. Took intro for my sci credit and because of him I'm now a major. You never stop learning in his class, or even chatting with him in the hall. Super friendly and I'm in tears every class because he's hilarious. Expects you to be involved, but isn't too hard. Take his classes!"
3784,1404771,4.5,4.0,"Really knows his stuff, and even more than his stuff.  Always in his office and willing to explain things.  The course is pretty hard, and a lot of work, but if you put in the effort it's entirely possible to get that A."
3785,1404771,4.5,5.0,"Very helpful and really helps you to understand the material. He's difficult, but you will definitely learn a lot from him"
3786,1404771,4.5,4.0,"One of my toughest classes last semester with a really high workload, but Low is the man.  Seriously loves geology and is a great professor.  Prepare towork hard and take ridiculous notes on labs.  I didnt care abt geo at all before coming and i left with a ton of knowledge and new respect for the subject.  Interesting/awesome dude as well"
3787,1404771,1.0,5.0,"Of all the professors I have ever had at W&L, Dr. Low is by far the worst.  He does not return quizzes or labs so it is difficult to study for his tests.  His tests are extremely detail oriented and do not focus on big picture concepts enough.  I enjoy geology less than before I took his class."
3788,1404771,4.0,5.0,"If you want to major in geology I guess he's the guy for you. If you're trying to bang out an FDR, bend over. Tests and quizzes are a nightmare. Prior to tests print off the presentations on sakai and memorize every single slide, or prepare to get a 50 pre-curve. A pretty funny all around good dude though."
3789,1404771,3.0,4.0,"You have to study really hard for Low's tests. Yes, he loves geology but sometimes he's not the best at describing things. I wish I had taken Rahl because those students seemed to have had an easier time and less busy work."
3790,1404771,4.5,4.0,"Low's really good. He was definitely available when ever you needed help. He's also very into what he does. Like the other reviewer said, if you're taking a geo class, take low"
3791,1404771,5.0,3.0,Professor Low is an amazing professor.  He has a passion for geology that he translates well to his students.  He is very willing to help his students and makes sure that they understand that.  If you want to take a geo class I strongly suggest Dr. Low.
3792,614250,3.0,3.0,"She was a very good professor who opened my mind to new biological phenomena every day. She really loves what she teaches. However, she was very rude to me often in class so much so that some of my peers even asked me about it. I don't understand why this is given I was one of 2 students that participated in the class. Very interesting!"
3793,614250,2.0,5.0,Professor I'Anson knows a lot about biology without a doubt. However she also expects her students to know as much as she does. Her tests are really hard and she does get mad when no one answers her questions in class. She should not be teaching a introductory course. Maybe a 200/300 level biology class will be better for her.
3794,614250,2.0,5.0,"I'Anson's Bio 111 is the worst class I have had at Washington and Lee.  She's nice but thats about it.  Ineffective teaching method, gets super annoyed when students don't answer her questions in class, and does nothing to make the material more interesting or easier to understand. She needs to stick to teaching upper level classes to Bio majors"
3795,614250,5.0,4.0,"While her tests are on the harder side, she is quite approachable and easy to talk to. As long as you don't ask stupid questions and read and try to seem interested you should be ok."
3796,614250,1.0,5.0,Terrible
3797,614250,4.0,4.0,"She's a very clear teacher and gets very excited over everything in biology.  I do think she would rather not be teaching intro classes and gets very angry if people do not respond to her questions in class.  Other than that, she's great."
3798,614250,2.5,3.0,"I'Anson clearly resented having to teach intro bio and was often frustrated and short on patience with us. Treats intro classes like they're mildly retarded. Sucks for intro, but don't write her off for upper level courses."
3799,139115,3.0,4.0,"This class was a good amount of work. Hooks was a good professor but not great, and I probably wouldn't take a class with her again. She structured the class to make it nearly impossible to get an A no matter how much work you put in. Class isn't super hard. Tests were surprisingly difficult. Good class, just overly challenging."
3800,139115,4.0,3.0,"I am not an econ major, but I found this class to be very helpful. The lectures were well laid out and it made it very easy to take notes. Test were fair and easy if you paid attention in class. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand the material."
3801,139115,3.5,4.0,"Tough class, but fair grading if you work for it. Lectures can be boring but Professor Hooks makes the material straightforward and it is easy to take notes during class and from the textbook. Good class for non-econ majors who are interested in the banking world."
3802,139115,3.5,3.0,"If you aren't a morning person, avoid her macroecon section at 830. Her lectures are dull but she knows her stuff. She is probably too smart for her own good (used to work for the Fed). If you ask questions in class it will help everything. You and your class will get more out of the class and she will really like you."
3803,139115,3.0,4.0,"Super boring lecturer, although admittedly this was an 8.30 AM. Not a fan of her lecturing style, or her tests; every once in a while you would come across a multiple choice question that had either no correct answers or two. Overall, still better than the professor my roommate had..."
3804,139115,1.0,5.0,"I wouldn't recommend professor hooks to my worst enemy. NEVER is in her office when she says she is, and is so slow at responding to emails that the question is usually irrelevant by the time she gets around to it. Assumes you know what's going on without her having to explain it. Just awful."
3805,139115,3.5,2.0,Very predictable but boring. Decent lecturer but not very interesting. She's clearly brilliant and I've heard her higher level classes are more engaging
3806,139115,4.5,4.0,very straightforward class. tests were not totally fair but the grading is structured so that it's very hard to get above an A- or below a C+. very useful class for finance and business/accounting as well as econ
3807,139115,5.0,5.0,"She's a good prof. during class.  Puts the important notes on the board and makes it relatively simple and easy.  The tests however, are pretty difficult.  Expect to get fair tests, but to be graded as difficultly as anyone has graded you before.  You may walk in with full knowledge of the study guide and still manage a C.  Hooks IS awesome though"
3808,139115,5.0,3.0,"One of the nicest professors at W&L. Loves the school and its students, works very hard to make sure that you come away from the class having learned interesting materiel. Tests can be a little difficult and it's not the easiest class to earn a good grade in but she's very fair. Highly reccommended"
3809,139115,5.0,4.0,"Phenomenal teacher. If you're interested in finance then you definitely need to take Money and Banking with her. The couse is sort of hard but everything you need to know for tests will be covered in class - no surprises. Holds lots of office hours. Very nice, personable, and eager to help. Also, I've heard from others that she's a great advisor."
3810,139115,4.0,4.0,I took Money and Banking with her. Her tests are somewhat difficult but fair. Class is fairly interesting but she is a bit dull. Lots of really long awkward silences whenever she asks a question.
3811,139115,4.5,5.0,"Organized, helpful, and clear.  An amazing professor.  Tests, however, are quite difficult."
3812,139115,5.0,4.0,"Professor Hooks is great!  She goes out of her way to be helpful, although she is not an easy professor.  She definitely challenges you, but I learned more in that class than in any other class I can remember..."
3813,139115,4.5,5.0,"Excellent professor, very helpful.  Extremely good during office hours."
3814,139115,5.0,3.0,good prof
3815,2459498,5.0,2.0,I loved professor Millan's class on nineteenth-century American literature. He is a very understanding professor who made himself very accessible with his office hours to help with questions on papers.
3816,2459498,5.0,3.0,Professor Millan is a wonderful teacher and inspires students to enjoy learning. He always works with his students and is extremely flexible. His office hours are invaluable and often will allow re-writes for papers so students can improve. He does offer an occasional extra credit project. I cannot recommend this professor highly enough!
3817,2459498,5.0,3.0,Professor Millan is fantastic. The class is discussion-based so reading before each class is necessary. He is understanding and assigns an appropriate amount of homework.
3818,2459498,5.0,2.0,"Prof Millan's class was the best class I've taken at this school. He has enough assignments that one poor grade won't kill you, but he also is a fair grader and won't deflate grades. I looked forward to class every day and still go talk to him occasionally- he is one of the most genuinely caring people I have ever met."
3819,2459498,5.0,3.0,english isn't my forte so took his class for an FDR and OMG so glad I did! Prof. Millan is SO nice and encouraging of everyone's ideas. changed his office hours so that more of us could make them bc thats how much he wants us to succeed. don't be put off by the readings; he makes them interesting! show you're putting in an effort and you'll do fine
3820,2459498,5.0,2.0,"Professor Millan was my Writ 100 teacher and he was the most caring professor ever! I once forgot to turn in an essay on time, but he didn't care at all! He grades easily and gives good feedback. Don't be afraid about the books on the syllabus because he only makes us read a few chapters of each book! No pop quizzes, just light reading and essays."
3821,2459498,5.0,3.0,"take. his. class. Professor Millan is an awesome teacher. He's very new to W&amp;L but an awesome professor who really cares about what he's teaching. Even if you are not into English, he makes lectures interesting and interactive. Assignments are straightforward and make you think. I only have good things to say about Professor Millan."
3822,2594670,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Watson is a great guy who really cares about making computer science accessible to beginners, and almost always has time outside of class for questions. He also likes memes which is always a plus."
3823,2594670,4.0,4.0,Professor Watson is a great guy. He's always willing to make sure that every student understands the concepts and is always open to questions. The slides can sometimes be confusing but he's always willing to clear things up. Overall he's a good choice for 112.
3824,2594670,4.0,4.0,Nice guy lectures can be confusing but he clears up a lot during office hours. Tests and quizzes have a lot of open-ended questions so make sure you can show you understand the material and its applications. The workload wasn't small but I'd recommend him
3825,2594670,5.0,3.0,The best professor at W&amp;L
3826,2594670,4.0,3.0,"Watson is a good prof. for 111. All he asks is for you to put your best foot forward, so basically just show up to lecture and labs and try your hardest. He values students that make an effort to ask questions and utilize office hours. If you get on his good side, his 111 class is an easy A."
3827,2420592,5.0,3.0,She was so good ): Sad she is leaving
3828,321401,4.0,3.0,He's good about taking suggestions from students on what to play.
3829,321401,3.0,3.0,"I enjoyed the history in jazz course. The homework was easy to complete and was graded fairly. The papers were also graded easily and usually your grade reflected what you put into the work. The only problem was when Vosbein almost fell asleep during the final presentations, and some of his written comments were incredibly inaccurate about our work"
3830,321401,4.0,4.0,"After taking three semesters of theory with Vosbein, I wanted to add a little to the review before mine.  Theory I is easy, if you're knowledgeable--can get boring, and I totally coasted.  But Theory II and III are very, very difficult.  I would not have gotten through II without Vosbein's help.  He will go out of his way to help you succeed."
3831,321401,1.5,3.0,If you can play a scale and know how to derive chords from that and know that I-IV-V-I is a common progression then you do not need the first YEAR of music theory. Cool guy but this is remedial theory for choir students. Disappointing class. No feedback on your projects. There is almost no music in this class. Literally all on paper. Ridiculous.
3832,321401,4.5,2.0,Dr. Vosbein is really cool. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and the course was fascinating. I definitely recommend it but it's a spring term class offered only every other year.
3833,321401,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Vosbein is very fun, easygoing and fair. He's an enthusiastic professor who brings music theory to life. The course itself is challenging, but he's fair with grading and is always available to answer questions. Highly recommend his class."
3834,321401,5.0,3.0,"A genius and one of the best professors in all of the school.  He will challenge you, but you will be writing beautiful music by the end of his classes!"
3835,321401,4.5,2.0,Awesome dude. I loved going to his class just to talk with him about music. He's certainly got a passion and interest in what he teaches. Favorite prof here so far.
3836,321401,4.5,4.0,great experience
3837,321401,5.0,3.0,Not an easy class to go through but he definitely teaches the material well and is quite fun to be in a class with.  He often starts off the class with 20 minutes of side tracked converstaion.  Just work hard on the homework and the tests will be a breeze.
3838,321401,4.0,1.0,I love jazz and knew a lot but learned even more.  He talks a lot about his personal experiences with musicians which are colorful and interesting and often involve drugs.  Sure beats taking a history class if you need the GE
3839,321401,4.0,2.0,"Good guy, great class.  Keep up on the listening and reading and you'll have no problems"
3840,321401,5.0,3.0,"knows his stuff... don't make him mad thought, he'll bury you"
3841,321401,5.0,2.0,No Comments
3842,526202,5.0,3.0,The sweetest prof ever! Gives great feedback but isn't a harsh grader. Generally understanding of varied backgrounds- important for the topics she chooses to teach.
3843,526202,5.0,4.0,"I had an amazing experience with this teacher. She dedicates a lot of time to making sure students are challenging themselves and reaching their abilities. Her feedback is always helpful and honest. She also facilitates very interesting discussions. She is very fair, understanding, and intelligent and is always a pleasure to be around ."
3844,526202,5.0,4.0,Clear about what is expected. Fair grader. Answers all questions. Structures the class to focus on the areas where our writing needs help.
3845,526202,5.0,2.0,She's amazing. Cares about each student and takes time to meet with each individually multiple times throughout the semester. Grading is easy as long as you show you put in effort and can demonstrate good writing skills. Easy A for great writers but she still helps you improve. Less work than other Writing 100s. Does quiz on readings.
3846,526202,5.0,4.0,"Professor Miranda instructed the first class that I took at W&L. I cannot help but to praise her instruction, her accessibility, and her courage as a professor here. She was truly inspirational and I loved going to class everyday."
3847,526202,4.5,4.0,"Helped my writing so much. You have to read and you have to edit your papers, she'll help you as much as you need as long as youre willing. Your grade will be good as long as you put in the work and read the books. It will challenge you more than other writing seminars but the books are better and will without a doubt teach you how to write"
3848,526202,4.5,2.0,"I have taken six or more classes with Professor Miranda at this point and she is easily my favorite professor. She truly cares about her students and has such a huge heart. Also, I've never found her to be a difficult grader. She's very helpful and open to discussion about papers and other projects. I cannot stress my love for her enough. "
3849,526202,2.5,4.0,The syllabus changes constantly and on Friday you can learn you have 1500 words due on Sunday at noon. I learned a lot only from reading one guy's books. My writing did not improve at all and actually got worse since you have so little time to do so much work. Had this been my first English class like 299 is supposed to be I would not have majored.
3850,526202,5.0,3.0,"Hands down my favorite Professor on campus. I've taken five or six of her classes at this point and I have never been disappointed. She's a kind soul and really cares about her students, as well as the subject matter she teaches. She's not a hard grader by any means. Sometimes she's disorganized, but it doesn't detract from the class in any way. "
3851,526202,5.0,2.0,"I took a creative writing workshop with Miranda (memoir), and I have to say, it was the most productive workshop I've ever done. It's a lot of work, and a lot of reading because you're workshopping fifteen papers every two weeks, but you'll learn a lot and get a lot of feedback. Definitely upped my game in a genre I didn't really care about."
3852,526202,5.0,1.0,"american story telling- so easy and so interesting, take this class. she's an extremely fair grader."
3853,526202,5.0,2.0,"I can't remember the section so ignore that. I've taken many classes with her. She is an excellent teacher, and exposed me to so many different types of poetry and literature. Her explanations opened up a subtext I never thought about in everything we read. I wish I was an engl major so I could've taken more. I never don't want to do the homework."
3854,526202,4.0,3.0,"She is a stickler for conventions and grammar, and if students don't speak up enough in class she'll give a pop quiz. That said, she's a great professor who's really knowledgeable about the subject, and if you pick theses that are really argumentative or off-hand she'll grade easier and like you even better. She likes students who take risks"
3855,526202,4.5,4.0,"If you have to take a Spring Term class, take Miranda's &quot;Fresh/Local/Wild: Poetry Workshop.&quot;  Focuses on sensory aspects of food: field trips (bee hives, an old mill that still grinds corn (baking bread afterwards),Campus Kitchens.  Only regret: weather cancelled Polyface Farms trip. Great assignments.  I wrote like an crazy man! & we had FUN."
3856,526202,4.5,4.0,"Encouraging, neat lady. Cares and teaches well. The textbooks are entirely unnecessary. Don't waste your money. Class is tedious--&quot;freewrites&quot; and workshops--but the assignments are good. She likes more ethnic-type modern poetry (Cisneros, etc.) than traditional white man poetry. Don't expect more than an A- in the class."
3857,526202,3.0,3.0,"Professor Miranda is a nice woman who cares about the well-being of her students. Sometimes she can be a bit inflexible which makes it hard to work with her, but overall she is a wonderful professor who likes to have meaningful discussions. I would recommend her."
3858,526202,4.5,3.0,"Had this class first year; later took her 299 and then 309 - literature and creative writing.  Guess that means I liked her!  Especially for Native lit, or poetry workshop - two of my favorites.  Don't underestimate her expertise or work ethic - and she expects hard work out of you - but is always available for conferences, loves to see rough draft"
3859,526202,4.0,4.0,MANDATORY CLASS. BUT AFTER THIS I WILL TAKE MORE ENGLISH LIT. CLASSES.
3860,526202,5.0,3.0,"I am white, conservative, and male, but can truly say that I love Professor Miranda and her class, and would take another one in a heartbeat. She's interesting, reasonable with the workload, and is EXTREMELY helpful with writing. I think she gets a bad rap from all the emerging frat lords in her freshmen classes. Just don't antagonize her."
3861,526202,5.0,2.0,"Great prof, fair expectations, really rewards improvement"
3862,526202,5.0,4.0,"I was a student of Deborah's when she taught at Pacific Lutheran University in Washington state.  She is everything that an excellent professor should be: compassionate, fair, and an exceptional scholar and teacher.  PLU lost an amazing professor and Washington and Lee should be honored to have her.  Deborah, keep on keeping on!  --Chelsee"
3863,526202,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. Miranda. She was very encouraging and helpful. The class was very interesting, to me as a girl, then again the title was: Bad Girls Guide to the Open Road."
3864,526202,3.5,3.0,"Really not all that bad. Sure the books suck, and sure she only gives you a few days for each paper, and yes it helps to be a female/minority, but in all honesty shes a good teacher. If you can learn to write clearly and concisely, you can easily get an A/B. Gives good writing advice; my writing improved tremendously by working with her."

3867,526202,3.5,3.0,I wrote the first long comment here. I'd like to revise what I said... she's not too tough a grader so long as you mention all the struggles of the minorities in every book. She's not a terrible person; I just really can't stand the class.
3868,526202,3.0,3.0,"If I could control the smiley face status of this class i would make sure to give it an angry face. Road in North Am. Lit. is a thinly veiled facade, hiding the true content of this class: &quot;Books that glorify women and minorites: Tales of hating the white man.&quot; And plus, only getting 2 days to come up with an 8 page paper just sucks."
3869,526202,2.5,5.0,"Feminist Native American who turned English 105B: &quot;The Road in North American Literature&quot; into &quot;You're a Terrible Person Because You're a White Male.&quot; The material is extremely boring PC bullcrap. Also an EXTREMELY hard grader; never got below A in English but got a C+ on my first paper in this class. MAY be OK for other classes, but not 105B!"

3874,575370,5.0,1.0,"Extremely easy Professor, If you're looking for an extremely easy A if you put in a decent amount of effort (go to class, do the 1 hour of HW for each class) you will easily get a B, most likely an A"
3875,575370,3.0,3.0,"Had his class been a half hour shorter it would have been much better. By the end of our hour and a half class, I don't think anyone was still paying attention. He does try to call on everyone, but his class was fairly boring. His tests were online and fairly easy. His one page essays were graded a bit harder, but were not too difficult."
3876,575370,3.5,2.0,"A very nice professor who is always available outside of class to help you with essays, understanding upcoming tests, etc. However, he isn't the most engaging professor. His class is mostly lecture style, and my French speaking skills have worsened after two semesters with him (261 and 283)  (although my reading and writing improved!)."
3877,575370,1.0,4.0,"Absolute worst teacher I have ever taken. He is impossible to pay attention to, and is no help when you seek him outside class for help. He talks nonstop and there is no opportunity for student participation in the class. My ability to speak French has decreased significantly in his class. Also, he lets you out at least 6 minutes late every day."
3878,575370,2.0,2.0,"Miserable class. Well intentioned and nice guy, truly enthusiastic, however one of the most boring courses capable of being created, and I am a French student not in it for a requirement. Definitely easy, just a miserable experience."
3879,575370,2.5,2.0,VERY BORING. Hated going to class and often skipped it. You basically teach yourself the material and then you re-do the exercises that you did for homework in class. He loves to break up the class in groups of 2 or 3 to have small discussion which are totally pointless and not helpful. I didn't learn anything from the professor.

3884,1959822,4.0,2.0,"Professor Silwal is a good, caring professor. We used a free online textbook, which was awesome for not having  to worry about cost. All tests are open-note, so no studying was needed for tests. The class is lecture heavy, but if you don't go to class you can survive on the book, and if you don't read the book you can do fine going to class. "
3885,1959822,3.0,4.0,"She is a brilliant, nice person, but her class is no joke. In class quizzes mattered more than problem sets which I, personally, found strange. Answers to questions can sometimes be very, very vague. It is very possible to get b+ or A-, but you will have to work for an A. Far grader but challenging course. Textbook we used was rather confusing."
3886,1959822,5.0,3.0,Professor Silwal is a knowledgeable and accomplished woman in economics. She informs her class of all of the basics of economic theory while also connecting it to real-life examples. Her assessments contained 4 problem sets and a final. Students had the week to complete it and on the last few could work in groups. Great class. Learned a lot. 
3887,1959822,5.0,3.0,"An absolute gem! She is very clear on what she wants you to know. If you do the homework, the exams should come easy. Her lectures are very straightforward; she is somewhat hard to meet with outside of class, but when you do, she is very helpful. Do the work and you will be fine. Readings recommended, but not necessary to pass the class"
3888,1959822,4.0,4.0,"Prepare to study, do lots of homework (and practice problems), and go to office hours. This course moves fast, and it is easy to fall behind. She is helpful and patient during office hours, and during class, there usually isn't much time for questions. Sit in the front also. Her notes are usually small and hard to read, and she is on the quiet side"
3889,1959822,5.0,5.0,Silwal is pretty great. Her exams are tough and her criteria isnt necessarily clear until you take one. Grade is pretty much based on the three tests. Her lecturing is engaging and she is able to get excited about the material. Would definitely take her again but dont expect an easy A.
3890,1959822,5.0,3.0,Very interesting professor! unique and talented.
3891,1959822,5.0,3.0,Great professor!
3892,1959822,5.0,4.0,Taking her elective this semester. She kicks butt! The class is very flexible and she adapts to our level of understanding. She is incredibly helpful in her office hours and I finally feel like I understand econometrics and STATA.
3893,1959822,5.0,4.0,"She is really clear and thorough. She gives lots of handouts and exam guides. In return, she expects you to know her materials inside and out. You will learn something in this class."
3894,1959822,5.0,4.0,"the class was fast-paced, but I learned a lot from her. She is very clear and makes materials relatable. Her passion for economics and for teaching economics is visible. enjoyed her class."
3895,1959822,5.0,4.0,"I am taking an upper-level class with her and this is one of the best classes I have ever taken at W&amp;L. The readings are just as unique and inspirational as she is. Not only is she extremely knowledgable, but she is also very helpful. She actually sits down with us and works with us. Wish I had taken more classes from her."
3896,1959822,5.0,3.0,"She is a very effective professor. I struggled with the course initially and it is a fast-paced one, but she really broke it down to digestible format and I got a lot out of her class. She is so serious and yet hilarious at times. what a great balance! I plan on taking every class she offers."
3897,1959822,4.0,2.0,"The class lectures may be boring, but she is such a sweet professor who really cares about her students. Especially if you plan to major in Economics, she is a great resource. Also, she's really helpful in office hours. Definitely recommend out of the other Econ 100 teachers."
3898,1959822,5.0,4.0,"enjoyed this class very much. took this class as a requirement, and never seriously considered being an econ major until i took this class."
3899,1959822,5.0,3.0,"I took economics of war and peace with her. I had never thought about the course material in this way. She really opened my eyes to see how economics can be applied to seemingly irrelevant things. Lectures can sometimes be difficult, but you will discover a whole new world in this class."
3900,1959822,5.0,3.0,She is incredible! I had her for ECON 100 and absolutely loved her. I just took the course for FDR but her teaching is making me consider Economics major. I will definitely take more classes with her and it is because of her that I plan on taking more Econ courses in future. MUST TAKE HER CLASS!
3901,1959822,2.0,4.0,"She barely speaks english, is an extremely difficult teacher, and is very unclear in both her assignments and lectures.  Statistics is a very important class to understand everything you're learning and when the words of her lectures are mixed up, etc. you basically have to teach yourself."
3902,1959822,5.0,3.0,"Prof Silwal truly cares about her students. She is an incredibly nice woman! Although Econ 102 is not by design an amazing class, she managed to make it interesting. Also, her class notes are very clear, her tests are straightforward and and her homework is pretty helpful for the test, although she can be a little rough grading homework."
3903,2557845,4.0,1.0,"Professor Lee is a super nice guy, but his class was obscenely easy. As in you don't need to do the reading or any really outside of class work-- if you show up and have half a brain you'll do well. This is nice if you're overloading or don't care about the subject, but I did sometimes wish there had been an opportunity to learn a bit more. "
3904,2557845,5.0,2.0,One of the best profs I had! Learned so much and really enjoyed going to class. All readings are discussed in-depth in class in case you didn't understand them. His office hours are super fun too! Just make sure to participate and you'll be good.
3905,2557845,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lee is a great teacher. He is very kind and is always willing to help. His lectures are very clear and interesting. Class had 4 quizzes, a midterm, and final. All very manageable! Amazing class!!"
3906,2557845,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Lee is the best. It's not hard to get a good grade in the class, but I still learned a ton from his lectures and the reading. Class is very attendance/participation heavy. Dr. Lee is an expert of IR studies, for sure. Lastly, he's the nicest guy ever. Understanding, caring, funny, you name it. A gem"
3907,2557845,5.0,1.0,"Prof Lee has a very well organized class. He explains his expectations well, and it is easy to succeed with a manageable workload if you meet his expectations."
3908,2557845,5.0,1.0,"Assigns a fair amount of reading, but he discusses a lot of it in class. There are a few papers, but he grades them easy. Both midterm and final were open notes. He was very big on participation in class, but there weren't too many opportunities. All in all, definitely take a class with him. You won't regret it!"
3909,2314140,5.0,3.0,"Ricardo is the man, one of the best professors I've had."
3910,1796005,3.0,5.0,"Professor Bush definitely knows what he's talking about, so much so he spends way too much time on the proofs of everything. You do NOT need to write them down. He doesn't pause during his lectures and they're very fast-paced, so just take pictures of the board and take notes later &amp; listen. Office hours aren't super helpful either."
3911,1796005,2.0,5.0,"Bush is a run of the mill math professor. Goes through material very quickly (even in a class that was meant to be slower paced). While I am not good at calculus, he undoubtedly made it more difficult to pass because of his convoluted way of explaining concepts. Does have a reasonably good curve though."
3912,1796005,4.0,3.0,"nice grader, mostly gives points for attempting problems."
3913,1796005,4.0,4.0,"Professor Bush is a nice guy! Lectures are fast and can be difficult to follow/focus on, though he is easily available outside of class and very helpful during office hours. You're probably going to have to go into office hours regularly if, like me, you're taking this for an FDR and not because math is your thing."
3914,1796005,1.0,4.0,He is very lecture heavy and moves WAY too fast during his lectures. You're better off learning the material on your own because he explains stuff in the worst ways.
3915,1796005,3.0,4.0,"Very average math class. Not very exciting during class (you basically just go through long example problems), lots of textbook homework problems, quizzes on the homework and then a couple big tests. If you are good at math you'll be fine. If not expect a B. He takes a lot of points off for strange reasons."
3916,1796005,2.5,3.0,"He goes very fast and it is hard to follow along. The practice problems will help you keep up, so do them. He ends up curving the entire class at the end, so if you are not happy with your grade don't worry because it will go up."
3917,1796005,5.0,2.0,"Effective professor, so the material is easy to understand--seems boring, even. Don't let that fool you into not doing the practice problems, though--for an A, though, it is not enough to understand the material, you must also develop your ability to solve problems quickly and without error."
3918,1796005,5.0,3.0,"Lectures are very straightforward and clear but they often cover things you will never need to know. A lot of this class is just being good at math, but it is a light work load and the tests are reasonable"
3919,1796005,3.5,2.0,"Prof. Bush definitely knows math, and if you're already good at the subject then you'll be fine. However, he doesn't provide examples in class that can help on the homework. He only uses a ton of variables - no numbers. Go to office hours if you're struggling: he's much better in 1-on-1 meetings. The hw isn't mandatory, but still do it. It helps."
3920,2351028,1.0,3.0,"Scharadin is really condescending to his students. Acts like a &quot;nice guy,&quot; but treats his students like they are dumb."
3921,2351028,5.0,3.0,Super nice dude. Absolutely loved him.
3922,2351028,1.0,4.0,"The lectures don't relate at all to online homework assignments, tests are not on the conceptual things he teaches in class, and is really condescending whenever a student asks a question and is genuinely trying to learn."
3923,2351028,2.0,3.0,"Scharadin really means well, but is not the greatest teacher. You will get a decent grade, but its tough to have any clue what's going on without background knowledge. Its very clear he's a first year professor, but he does care about his students."
3924,2351028,1.0,3.0,"Doesn't really teach, if you plan on taking this and know nothing about stats prior then you are gonna have a confusing and frustrating semester."
3925,2633655,5.0,4.0,"Professor Reino is wonderful! She isn't super harsh with grammar and puts a lot of weight of participating. She will push you to speak at least once every class, so just go ahead and say something, she won't judge. She is also very accepting of late work and will definitely work things out with you."
3926,2633655,5.0,3.0,"Professor Reino is an amazing Spanish professor who is so kind and actually helpful if you want to improve your Spanish skills. For people just in it for the credit, you should not worry if you have her for 161 or 162."
3927,2633655,5.0,5.0,"Fantastic teacher. Wasn't good at Spanish going in to this, got my butt kicked, but Prof Reino really helped me through it. Her class is probably the most fun I've had so far, everyone just has a great time. Teaches out of the online textbook, but it's solid; lots of small tests, lots of time to improve. Take to get better or just to have fun."
3928,2633655,4.0,3.0,Professor Reino is great. She focuses on your speaking ability and does help improve those skills. The homework and tests are very important to your final grade so make sure you do those on time.
3929,2633655,4.0,4.0,"Professora Reino is a great Spanish professor for me. I struggled because I didn't really have the base I needed for 161, but she has helped me immensely. Don't expect an &quot;A&quot; if you do poorly, but she is more than helpful if you're willing to put in the effort to help yourself."
3930,2684866,4.0,3.0,"I took Intro to Moral &amp; Political Philosophy. Prof. Taylor is very nice and willing to help students and give feedback. The class is very lecture heavy and can be a little dense at times, but she always keep the mood light. The grades included a group project/presentation, a paper, a test, and homeworks. Would take Prof. Taylor again"
3931,2684866,5.0,2.0,"Prof Taylor is awesome. There's a balance of lectures and group work in any of her classes and she's so helpful in office hours. Medical ethics is one of her specialty areas so if you get a chance to take that class with her, you will learn a lot."
3932,1937348,5.0,3.0,"This man is the greatest. He's really hilarious, and his lectures are never boring. Always finds a way to keep the class interesting and engaged. Papers aren't too long, and he lets you come to him before turning in the paper for constructive criticism. Real cool and down to earth."
3933,1937348,4.0,3.0,"He was by far the favorite professor I had this semester. Very engaged, hilarious and obviously passionate about what he teaches. I often left class mind blown, and loved to participate and debate with him. Tests are easy and he is very available to provide ample help on papers, and is open to let you write about whatever you want. Highly reccomend"
3934,1937348,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, very engaged. You will never be bored in class. Very fair grader, not a huge stickler. Favorite professor so far."
3935,1937348,4.5,2.0,"My favorite professor so far. Lectures are very interesting, as he moves around and gets very into what he's talking about. He has brought up many points that I find interesting and enlightening, and he provides ample opportunity to discuss papers. Awesome guy!"
3936,1937348,4.5,2.0,Read the book and get ready to discuss it in class.
3937,622540,4.0,4.0,He will help you in the labs if you really need it. Nice guy. The powerpoints are extremely boring and arent very clear.
3938,622540,4.5,4.0,"It can be hard to focus on his class in the morning, but it is better than calculus. Just ask him for help, he's great."
3939,622540,4.5,2.0,"such a good idea to take this class if you just want to get out of calculus.  whaley's so so nice, but as monotone as the humming of the AC system... kind of hard to stay awake in a morning class.  he's eager to help if you go to him outside of class."
3940,622540,4.0,2.0,Great class to fulfill the math gened if you're bad at math...really sweet guy- rambles a lot and tells stories but not too hard of a class and very willing to help you out. I'd definitly recommend it!
3941,622540,5.0,2.0,"definitely take this class if you're bad at math like i am. fufills the GE and is pretty easy... he's so willing to help, especially outside of class and during labs, practically gives you the answers to homeworks if you don't understand. gives out at least two cold tests before each test, makes the real tests easy. really nice guy."
3942,622540,4.0,1.0,"easy class, great professor but somewhat boring... he loves it if you meet with him outside class and he practically gives you the answers to the homework.. great alternative to calculus"
3943,622540,5.0,3.0,"He is a very helpful teacher, but his lectures are so BORING.  All of the notes are on the website, so missing class is not that big of a deal.  He doesnt take attendance.  His homework and test are hard, but if you study they are not that bad.  He is one of the kindest teachers you will ever have, just VERY VERY BORING!!"
3944,622540,4.0,3.0,No Comments
3945,622540,3.0,2.0,"It's a decent class for a nap. He goes v.e.r.y. slowly for the folks who just can't freaking get it... which is good for them, and doodle time for me! Not bad though."
3946,622540,4.5,3.0,I really liked him personally.  But o man do his lectures put you to sleep.  And I was a comp sci major!!!
3947,622540,4.0,2.0,"Pretty boring to listen to in class, but his homework is easy to do, and can be done with a classmate.  Tests aren't easy but aren't hard if you study.  You can go to him at any time and get help and he will give/tell you anything you need to know."
3948,573392,5.0,2.0,Prof Mathews is an extremely awesome prof. He is very helpful and has interesting opinions. I would recommend you to take his class.
3949,573392,5.0,1.0,"I LOVE PROFESSOR MATTHEWS! he's absolutely amazing. one of the sweetest, nicest, most supportive and genuinely helpful teachers out there. he's so encouraging in class and always supportive of every single comment. definitely read and participate a lot, and you'll do absolutely fine! he's a pretty easy grader and is generous on essays and tests."
3950,573392,4.0,3.0,very approachable and an all-round nice guy
3951,573392,2.5,2.0,"Had him freshman year for Insiders and Outsiders. Books we read weren't great, he had a hard time getting people to participate, felt like I didn't improve as a writer or learn anything. Not too hard a greater."
3952,573392,1.5,3.0,"Had the worst experience with this professor.  Does not give credit for advanced ideas-if you want to do well keep it bland, and at a fifth grade intelligence level."
3953,573392,4.5,2.0,No Comments
3954,573392,4.0,4.0,boring
3955,573392,4.0,3.0,"So he's a nice guy and everything...but he was incredibly boring.  He didn't vary teaching methods at all and the class was tedious.  But he was very helpful and easy to approach, if a little awkward."
3956,573392,5.0,2.0,No Comments
3957,573392,4.0,3.0,"funny guy who likes to interact with students. easygoing and very understanding. not an easy A class, though."
3958,573392,3.5,4.0,"Fine scholar, decent teacher.  Not easy, in my opinion.  Great sense of humor.  Puts a lot of emphasis on small groups (which is good for some people, but not my favorite teaching method).  Dresses well."
3959,573392,2.5,2.0,"Victorian and Romantic lit are so boring, and he is so boring.  but he's nice and pretty easy"
3960,235475,4.0,2.0,Professor Hamilton is very passionate and informed about when he teaches. Took him for Yellowstone Ecology. If you want an easy A take this class but if you actually want to learn actual bio take another Professor. Learned a lot about Yellowstone which is what the class entails. 3 quizzes and a final paper. Very nice prof
3961,235475,4.0,2.0,"The lectures can get a tad boring, but you'll do fine on the tests if you go and take detailed notes. Dont waste your time or money buying the textbook, I didn't even open it."
3962,235475,4.0,3.0,"Lecture based class, so be sure to write everything down in your notes. He usually outlines what will be on the test, so if you know your notes you will do well. Hamilton is a super personable, energetic, and nice guy."
3963,235475,3.0,2.0,"Go to class, write everything down, and memorize it. Do what he tells you to do. The final is weird but I did A LOT better than I expected on it. Don't bother buying the textbook. If you get confused about a concept just google it. I failed the first test and ended up with an A-. Really the only thing you have to do is study before the tests."
3964,235475,4.5,2.0,"He is very direct about what will be on the test, making studying easier.  Gives about a lot of extra credit on tests.  The only downside is that sometimes the lectures get long and in order to take good notes you have to really be paying attention"
3965,235475,5.0,2.0,Great professor who is very passionate. Tests are fair and exactly what he goes over in class. Take good notes and know them pretty well to get an A. Definitely one of my favorite professors at W&L.
3966,235475,4.0,1.0,EVERY freshman not good at the sciences should take this class as a Seminar!!!! I hate science and this was such an EASY way to fulfill the requirement. Practically no work at all and you can distract him for an hour talking about his daughter
3967,235475,4.0,1.0,"I took General Bio (Heart Attacks) and Medicinal Plant Bio with Prof Hamilton and loved both of them! He does go on tangents a lot in his lecture and doesn't really use textbooks (more as a suggested reference; so go to class!) which can be confusing, but he's very helpful and passionate about his classes, which shows to students! Easy grader too."
3968,235475,3.5,1.0,"Hamilton is great! I spent a lot of time with him in my intro bio class and through research. He is an easy grader and really interesting to talk to. His lectures can be a little confusing b/c he likes to go on tangents, but it's always clear what he expects us to know and a quick look at the book clears any questions up. Take Hamilton if you can!"
3969,235475,4.0,3.0,"Really good teacher. It was a nonmajor Bio class, so he understood we didnt really have an interest in going in depth. Talked alot about booze and his brewery which was awesome. Take his class if you need to get out of a lab science credit."
3970,235475,3.5,3.0,"A very good professor and intelligent man.  However, his lectures are somewhat unhelpful because the notes he writes on the board is confusing.  Suggestion: Don't copy down word for word from what the board says and ask for him to clarify notes on the board.  Alas, he is a tremendous teacher.  You can even call him Bill!"
3971,235475,4.0,2.0,"Humston is the man. Nice guy, good class, very helpful. Makes the class fun, too."
3972,235475,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed Prof. Hamilton. I am a pre-med student who wanted to avoid taking another genetics course. His plant biology class was interesting, enlightening, somewhat challenging, and much more enjoyable than my previous bio class. He is rather young, so the students' relationship with him was more personal."
3973,235475,3.0,2.0,"Lectures are somewhat disorganized and difficult to follow, but he grades pretty easily so it's not hard to do well in the class. Very nice guy, enthusiastic, especially about plants. :)"
3974,235475,4.0,2.0,Took his spring term Atmospheric Science class.  Overall a nice guy but could be a bit condescending at times.
3975,235475,4.0,2.0,He is not good with large groups and giving directions in lab but great for small groups.  Very laid back and pretty easy.  Also he cares about the students and makes a connection (definitely a cool guy).
3976,235475,5.0,1.0,He is one Cool ass professor
3977,235475,5.0,2.0,"Hamilton is pretty good, and he's nice, which helps"
3978,235475,3.0,5.0,"Very confusing lectures, but also willing to help and very nice."
3979,235475,4.0,4.0,"Great guy, very accessible, but don't take Bio 111 unless you have to!"
3980,235475,2.0,3.0,"He's a nice guy, and very enthusiastic, but his lectures are really confusing!"

3983,235480,5.0,3.0,One of the best teachers I have had at W&amp;L. Very reasonable. Explains exactly what he wants from his students. He is incredibly receptive and available for students. I recommend this class more than any other. It may include a small learning curve at the beginning but is very enjoyable.
3984,235480,5.0,3.0,I would take every class he offers.
3985,235480,2.0,4.0,eh kind of a rough grader. Super boring. Avoid
3986,235480,3.0,4.0,"hes a real cool guy. He loves to help his students but his lectures are all over the place. Hard grader, you just never know sometimes what to expect grade wise."
3987,235480,4.0,3.0,"One of the coolest professors ive had here. Maybe the coolest. Really funny and extremely intelligent.  Weird,scattered lectures, but really fun to participate in. Meet with him for papers and youll be in the money.  I honestly went to class to hangout and talk about cool philosophy stuff.  cool dude, really smart, cant stress it enough."
3988,235480,1.5,4.0,"He has little interest in helping his students.  He asks for students to visit office hours, but does not make very constructive comments.  Although he is really witty, his lectures are scattered and hard to follow."
3989,235480,3.5,2.0,He's cool. He's a grown up goofball nerd. the class is easy and he is really chill. if u get him u dont need to drop him
3990,235480,5.0,3.0,"He is a wonderful professor-- very clear and helpful. He's also hilarious and friendly. Readings for some classes can be demanding, papers are sometimes easy, depending on how high a grade you want. Great at discussions, even if he goes off on random tangents every now and then... Everyone should take at least one of his classes!"
3991,235480,4.0,3.0,"Very few grades in the class... if you do the reading and stay active in class discussions you will do fine.  It's a good idea to meet with him before you write a paper and he is generally very helpful.  However, be careful if you are religious because he is not a fan.  And he always plays devil's advocate."
3992,235480,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, really enthusiastic about the material.  Discussions are interesting and he doesn't really lecture for the entire class period.  High recommended."
3993,235480,4.0,3.0,"Good professor and an overall great guy.  Lectures can be a bit overwhelming at times, but he's great during office hours.  Not a terribly difficult grader but not an easy A either.  Highly recommended."
3994,235480,4.0,1.0,"tends to read out of the book, so class gets pretty snooze-inducing. one-on-one (especially when talking about papers) he's fabulous, though."
3995,235480,5.0,3.0,Great Professor! Really got me thinking and interested in writing philosophy papers. Take any class you can from him!
3996,235480,5.0,3.0,"really smart, really helpful, yet cannot admit that he is ever wrong.  too bad."
3997,235480,4.0,2.0,he's cool
3998,235480,5.0,2.0,"Great class discussions, he can think up and answer some great questions...just make sure you're up for some (fun) discussion every day, and you'll do great in his classes."

4003,229342,5.0,2.0,"I can honestly say that I feel honored to play in the USSO. Dr. Kolman appears at first tough (a NY attitude?), but is a big teddy bear when we need encouragement and support. He is not the smiling type, though, but an amazing musician. The Best!!"
4004,229342,5.0,2.0,One of the most gifted conductor and musician I've ever met.Last concert (few days ago)was amazing and we all received standing ovation under his baton. I'm so looking forward the next season with the orchestra!!!
4005,229342,4.5,1.0,"Dr. Kolman is not the smiling type, but has a dry sense of humor and can even be quite entertaining to be in his class. He is very intense and committed music. He is inspirational for his enthusiasm and made me think about becoming a music major."
4006,229342,5.0,2.0,The best conductor ever! He is truly passionate about music! Great fun!
4007,229342,5.0,2.0,"Excellent faculty, the only one in the music department who really shows passion for music!"
4008,229342,1.5,2.0,"Dr. Kolman doesn't teach the appropriate information for the tests. I did all of the readings and when I showed up to class, he basically read the text book to us. He didn't teach the information that would help us do well on the tests, which would be improving our listening skills, he taught the straight facts. I was frustrated."
4009,229342,2.5,2.0,"Im not sure if Kolman is a bad teacher or if it's the structure of the class. The course is taught from a textbook and the tests and quizzes are made by the textbook, which limits the professors teaching. He admitted seconds before our test that he had never read the questions, so sometimes the questions are irrelevant. Easy grader, though."
4010,229342,3.0,2.0,"Wind Ensemble.  I have mixed feelings about Dr. Kolman.  He is without a doubt an excellent player and conductor. But not always the best teacher. I noticed over the past year that he made an effort to change his ways for the better. I considered quiting but will now play another year. You can give him a chance. You might like him, you might not."
4011,229342,3.0,2.0,"While Kolman is undoubtedly a good musician with a lot of impressive accomplishments, he is not a very understanding string conductor.  He also has rather unrealistic views on attendance. Throws public temper tantrums when students are late"
4012,229342,1.5,3.0,"Wind Ensemble.  He may be a good conductor, but he is THE WORST Teacher I have ever had as a director.  My high school band director was much better than him.  His &quot;teaching&quot; is lets play it again and again without slowing it down or working it out. Horrible. You can try it for a year but I think you will consider quitting at least once a semester."
4013,229342,2.5,1.0,I promised myself that when playing wasn't fun anymore I'd stop... sadly after 16 years Dr. Kolman's rehearsal techniques drove me to stop.
4014,229342,1.0,1.0,"This man is horrible. He sucked the love of music right out of me. A total jerk about grading, attendance policy, etc. The personality of a porcupine."
4015,229342,2.0,2.0,"He is somewhat unstable.. but as long as you don't get on his bad side then you get an A.  Attendance is strict, although he can be very absentminded"
4016,229342,4.5,3.0,"Do not take music theory unless you want to be a music major.  It is not an easy class, but Kolman makes it interesting.  He is a very funny go and tries to get students involved in class."
4017,229342,4.0,2.0,"Fun to play under.  Has occasional temper tantrums, but what band directer doesn't&#63;"
4018,229342,3.0,4.0,He's very much the New Yorker...doesn't take no crap from nobody. He likes to be sarcastic and riducule students in a humorous (I guess) way. Know your stuff and you'll do fine.
4019,229342,4.0,2.0,"Kind of crazy to be sure, but he is good to the students. If you show up, you get a good grade."
4020,229342,3.0,1.0,He is a tough conductor who does not consider the side of the students.
4021,229342,5.0,3.0,awesome musician...just the best I have ever worked with
4022,1040351,5.0,1.0,"Best professor ever! He is very caring and posts lots of office hours every week. He is really funny, which makes his lectures interesting. Reasonable grader. Take him!!"
4023,1040351,5.0,3.0,"If you are taking biochemistry with Dr. LaRiviere, you will not regret it. I would absolutely recommend taking a course with him"
4024,1040351,5.0,3.0,A vey sweet professor! He will work at it to help you understand the content! He is very dedicated to his students and you can tell that he really cares.
4025,1040351,4.5,3.0,"Dr. L is the man. His personality is great. He's of the most enthusiastic teachers I've ever had, and he's very personable and knowledgeable. I also love his honesty: he admits when he makes errors, doesn't know the answer, etc. Cold tests are great representations of his tests. I'm looking forward to summer research with him!"
4026,1040351,4.0,4.0,Dr. LaRiviere is a really great professor.  He's still new and getting his bearings but you can tell he genuinely knows the subject and cares about his students.  Not the most riveting professor but definitely knows his stuff and is a really fun guy.
4027,1263590,5.0,4.0,"Professor Locy is by far one of my favorite professors on campus. Yes, she is intense. Yes, she can tend to go on small tangents during class. Yes, she is strict and can seem unreasonable. But it's all &quot;tough love&quot; - she cares about what she does and she cares about you, and it makes you a better writer/journalist at the end of the day."
4028,1263590,4.0,4.0,"Great professor! She hated using the textbook, but it was still required reading. She had pptw for students to follow during lectures and normally the things she said during class ended up on her tests. super helpful in office hours. Would probably take someone else if you are interested in strat comm though because she def prefers jour majors"
4029,1263590,4.5,4.0,"Professor Locy is very passionate about writing and has extensive experience in the field of journalism.  For each essay, she let us turn in 1 draft for her to edit then we change it with her feedback and turn in for a better grade. Helped me learn how write for college while boosting my grade."
4030,1263590,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Locy is well-versed in the field of journalism, which can be good and bad as a student in WRIT 100. Class discussions are usually interesting and her essay help is decent. She tends to make more corrections when she grades then when she helps during office hours, so triple check your work. Overall would recommend her to FYs"
4031,1263590,3.5,5.0,Unnecessarily difficult. Helpful when you ask but you never know if you're doing anything correctly until you get your one grade of the semester back...
4032,1263590,4.0,5.0,"Locy is very intense to say the least. If you don't let her intimidate you and prepare yourself to work hard, you'll be fine. She's very enthusiastic and really loves what she does."
4033,1263590,1.5,5.0,She is a very difficult teacher and many times can be unreasonable. If you plan on taking her class please prepare your self.
4034,1263590,4.5,3.0,Toni Locy has EXPERIENCE--something critical when a professor is introducing students to a career. Her stories enhance subject material. She looks for clarity in writing and in speaking in front of the class. Class presentations were frequent.
4035,1263590,1.0,5.0,"She was useless.  Attendance was mandatory but a waste of time.  She just talks about how amazing she is, but in reality she got fired and had to pick up teaching to make money"
4036,786414,4.5,3.0,"I really enjoyed this class with Peppers, very clear and as long as you pay attention and keep up with reading you will do fine. Most test questions are very strait-forward."
4037,786414,5.0,4.0,Having a class with Peppers made me an economics major. Good professor and a great guy.
4038,786414,5.0,5.0,"For the last 26 years, Dean Peppers has helped build one of the country's best undergraduate business schools. As the head of the ""C School,"" he has balanced his administrative duties with teaching - thus staying in touch with the student body and the needs of a new generation of students.  He is, in short, a W&L legend. Take his classes."
4039,786414,2.5,4.0,"Pepper's classes are painfully boring, and attendance is a must. Class lectures follow very closely from the textbook; however, tests and quizzes test tend to be hard and are often confusing."
4040,786414,4.0,2.0,"Pretty painfully boring.  But then, it's intro econ...not exactly rivetting material.  He does his best to make things interesting by relating to current events.  Do the work, learn the formulas, maybe check out his office hours a few times, and you'll be fine."
4041,786414,1.0,4.0,"i agree with the first commenter. peppers loves to hear himself talk, is extremely unhelpful during office hours, is a stickler for attendance, and is boring boring boring. after taking his class i'm not even taking econ 102."
4042,786414,3.5,3.0,"Very intelligent man. Good teacher. Nice guy. Doesn't really spend a lot of class time on the material, though. Very available outside of class. Sometimes difficult to follow exactly what work is assigned. Quizzes/tests are moderate to easy if you did the reading in the textbook. I would take him again."
4043,786414,4.5,3.0,"Contrary to the commenter below, I liked his use of WSJ (how can C school majors not read it&#63; and I'm not even a C school major). I think he's a very well qualified and experienced teacher."
4044,786414,1.5,4.0,"Dean of the Williams School = bad professor. Class time was wasted talking about Wall Street Journal, nothing helped prepare for quizzes and tests, unhelpful during office hours, dry and sarcastic in class, very boring"
4045,108526,2.0,4.0,"Class periods with him are basically useless if you don't know calc really well beforehand.  You can hardly hear him when he's talking, and when he addresses the class he looks at the floor. He keeps attendance for awhile and then stops. Test grades are your grade. He needs to stop teaching or learn how to teach."
4046,108526,1.0,4.0,"real nice dude...but other than that im just smhing pretty much an impossible class unless ur real good at calc.  dont bother going to class for any reason other than figuring out what topics you are gonna need to teach yourself.  I feel like when he was younger he was a good teacher, but now he's so old he jsut doesn't care anymore"
4047,108526,1.0,4.0,"Constantly messed up in-class problems. Extremely confusing, never went over homework so no one knew if they were doing the problems correctly. Could barely hear him speak, class is boring."
4048,108526,3.0,2.0,"His teaching is good. His presentation, however, is not. Speaks softly and is hard to pay attention to. But if you can pay attention the explanation are very very good. Homework is all optional, your tests are your grade. Better to do the homework though, otherwise the tests will pwn you."
4049,108526,2.0,3.0,very brilliant man but getting up there in age and found it hard to follow him as he almost seemed too smart to try to teach us. kinda hard to understand but nice funny guy
4050,108526,4.0,2.0,Class is a bit boring. But he teaches the material well. Explains every concept to the fullest.
4051,108526,4.5,2.0,"Professor Vinson is the man. He has tons of personality which helps time go by for a class of kids that suck at math at 8 in the morning. Vinson is extremely helpful if you go visit him, and you'll probably end up on a conversation about something else in his office. Great guy, great class, never taking math again. Oh yeah, and take notes in pencil"
4052,108526,4.0,3.0,"He is an awesome guy and a good teacher, unfortunatly I found it tough to pay attention sometimes but probably because it was my first class of the day.  Tests are tough, but if everyone does bad he will curve or offer retake.  Overall a good teacher."
4053,108526,5.0,2.0,"Professor Vinson is THE BEST. This was the best math class I've ever taken. Not only is he funny and quirky enough to keep you awake even at 8 in the morning, he also explains calculus in a way that it seems perfectly natural, logical, and even interesting. DEFINITELY take his class. I was not a math person at all before his class."
4054,108526,2.5,2.0,"Easier than &quot;Easy D&quot;(ie, easy to get a D) Dymacek for Calculus. Loved the Elvis lamp in his office.  Somewhat incoherent in  class -- went off on random tangents about movies (Raising Arizona) and unrelated topics (goldfish, with illustrations)."
4055,108526,5.0,1.0,THE BEST PROF IN THE WORLD. HE'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE JOHN NASH.!!
4056,108526,4.0,2.0,"Very off topic, and the class can drag a bit, but he keeps it interesting. Full of jokes, tangents, and weird drawings, he miraculously makes math kind of fun, is great with extra help, and is very approachable. Tests are doable is you have studied and prepared. Do the homework, and you'll be fine"
4057,108526,4.5,2.0,"I entered not very excited about Calc, and I leave much the same. However, I feel pretty confident like I can actually do the work (surprise!) Vinson explains ways in a very narrative way--plenty of analogies and drawings.  We didn't use the textbook, but the homeworks he makes are very reasonable. Overall, a funny prof who takes it slow."
4058,108526,5.0,1.0,great guy! loved his illustrations and infatuation with colored chalk.  I want him for my adopted grandfather!  if you want to learn Calculus like you've never learned it before I highly recommend this class!!!! VINSON FOR PRESIDENT!!!
4059,108526,4.0,2.0,"Really nice guy - reminds me of a grandpa type.  Could be a little hard to follow during lecture, but was more than willing to help during office hours.  Very easy for a calc class - I made an A with very little effort.  Just study for the tests and do the homework problems and you'll be fine."
4060,108526,2.0,3.0,HE is the cutest man ever but he is defintely not the best teacher ever.  He rambles and tells weird jokes but he reminds me of a grandfather.  Great as a general friend
4061,108526,1.5,3.0,"A very nice man, who I think is Elvis hiding out in rural Va... Not a good teacher. He is very confusing and will not teach you anything."
4062,108526,2.5,3.0,"For a math professor, he has a difficult time doing simple addition/multiplication on the blackboard.  He's very sweet, but tends to mutter to himself in class and can be hard to follow.  Unless you really love (and already know) stats, I wouldn't take it with him, you'll have to teach yourself."
4063,108526,3.0,3.0,"A little senile, but still holds up well if you want to get the basics of calc."
4064,108526,3.0,4.0,"The best I could have hoped for from a Calc class, I guess.  Rambles a bit sometimes, and often drifts off-topic (once set a word problem in Amsterdam, then drew windmills and prostitutes on the board)"
4065,108526,2.5,2.0,"Does not actually teach any material throughout the term, which doesn't really work with the whole &quot;learning thing&quot;.  He is confused very easily, but gives basically a full letter grade curve after the final (because everyone is so lost in the class)."
4066,108526,1.0,4.0,"He would be a great grandpa, but as a teacher he is very disjointed, sometimes confusing and puts problems on the tests that should not be on there."
4067,108526,4.5,1.0,he's fun...i would recommend him if you have the chance. definitely not that hard and is actually an enjoyable experience
4068,108526,4.5,1.0,No Comments
4069,108526,3.5,1.0,"He's so sweet and funny! A little obsessed w/ Elvis, but it's cute. He is some times a little random and weird. Great man!"
4070,108526,3.5,2.0,"He is funny, and nice. He is a great teacher. Sometimes he goes off on a tangent"
4071,2107377,1.5,3.0,"Dr. Kelley's lectures are generally uninteresting, showing up to class at 8:30am for an hour and a half was a struggle. My A.P Bio class went into just as much depth as this course, and 90% of the material was a review, yet somehow Kelley managed to make it more confusing. I've never had a professor say ""i don't know"" as much as him."
4072,270323,4.0,2.0,"She's great. Gotta be able to sit through 1.5hr lectures, but her vocal variety and passion keep it fairly interesting (she's a real storyteller). Though she strongly encourages textbook readings, if you take detailed notes in the lecture, you won't be tested on anything not covered there (or in the books read). Overall, reasonable and solid choice"
4073,270323,4.0,3.0,"Senechal is a solid. She loves the topics and gets very enthusiastic about them. Her lectures can seem long and at sometimes seem boring, but you can kind of realize when is important and when you can zone out. Test have straightforward questions, mostly coming from the lectures. But only 3 tests make up your grade so they matter a little too much."
4074,270323,4.5,3.0,"Senechal is a great lecturer and is very clear with what she wants from you, having outlined lectures can make paying attention very easy.  However, as far as the class itself goes, if you're good at memorizing history, the tests will be easy.  Absolutely no curveballs, and the fact that there are only 3 tests make each of them count for a lot."
4075,270323,4.5,1.0,"Easy class if you show up, pay attention, and take notes. Best lecturer I've had and outlines lectures before class to facilitate note-taking. If you pay attention you don't need to read the textbook other than the one specific chapter she tells everyone to read. 6 books to read but all are easy and entertaining. Tests are easy."
4076,270323,3.0,4.0,"I think her class is harder than it seems. Having only three tests as the only grades can be a little difficult. You have to study your butt off to get  a decent grade. If you aren't a history person, this class is super challenging. You have to have time and dedication to get a good grade. Other than that, Senechal is a really chill professor. "
4077,270323,4.5,1.0,"I was the only freshman in class of mostly majors.BEST CLASS EVER. I love Senechal! She made me consider a hist major. Comes off serious but is secretly awesome, rly excited about what she teaches. Take notes and listen! The exams were really easy, one easy paper, not rly any homework, and the books were interesting. Can't wait to take her again!"
4078,270323,5.0,3.0,"LOVE Prof. Senechal! Her outlines before lectures are a godsend and her enthusiasm for her subject definitely shows. The lectures can drag a bit if you're tired or if history isn't your thing, but overall she's a wonderful prof. who I'd take again in a heartbeat. Tests were all short-answer; she spelled out their content with utter transparency."
4079,270323,4.5,3.0,"Best lecturer in the history department, incredibly enthusiastic about her subjects. Tests are very fair based on the lectures and paper topics are quite manageable"
4080,270323,4.5,1.0,Great teacher! She really loves U.S. history and makes it very easy to understand. She puts an outline up and talks the entire time. Book reviews aren't difficult and she tells you everything you need to know to do well on the tests
4081,270323,4.5,3.0,"Nice lady. Lectures can get pretty depressing to go to. Overall, if you do the readings(get the big picture)and take decent notes, an A is definately in reach."
4082,270323,4.0,2.0,"Very long lectures, but often pretty interesting. Book discussions are a part of the grade but it's also a chance to get her to like you. If you take good notes on the lectures and read the books, you will do fine on the tests"
4083,270323,4.5,3.0,"I didn't think she was as easy as everyone said she was.  You have to take good class notes and study them hard if you want to do well on the tests.  A fair amount of reading (textbook + 1 historical novel per week).  Really nice lady. Lectures are very boring, however."
4084,270323,4.0,4.0,She loves teaching and lecturing even if no one is listening to her.  Don't have to do anything besides read novels and read notes for test.  Would definately take if don't mind listening to lectures.
4085,270323,5.0,1.0,"Took her for US history.  I learned a lot in the class.  The lectures are pretty long and detailed so they can get a little boring, but the reading is usually interesting and the tests aren't too hard, but are worth a lot of your grade."
4086,270323,5.0,3.0,Prof. Senechal is a great teacher who loves her subject area.  I learned so much from her and found her class really interesting. Not a class you would skip in college!
4087,270323,4.5,2.0,"one of my favorites so far! her lectures are very detailed and can get kind of long, but she's a fabulous teacher and knows SO MUCH. she's easy to follow and her tests are VERY reasonable if you read...everything."
4088,270323,4.5,4.0,"LOTS of reading.  Long, long lectures whose content is good, but the delivery is a little bit monotonous.  Still, very good prof."
4089,270323,4.5,4.0,"Wish she'd do more seminars.  Not that I don't like her lectures, but she isn't quite as colorful as, say, Professor Jeans."
4090,270323,4.0,1.0,"Just do the reading, take good notes, and the tests are straightforward."
4091,270323,4.5,2.0,"An incredible prof who is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about history! Tests are usually short answer. Passionate about four things: Her home state of Maine, statistics, quotations, and Springfield, Illinois! A great experience!"
4092,270323,3.5,4.0,"What a woman. Very passionate about history. Knows EVERYTHING.  Lots and Lots of reading, reading until the sun don't shine. Thats the only problem."

4094,542711,1.0,5.0,Unorganized. Variables change daily
4095,542711,2.0,3.0,"Gibbs is the man.  Awesome person, but as an accounting professor, he needs work.  Read off the powerpoints and didn't teach much.  He dedicated four days to a chapter--one day of &quot;powerpoint&quot; and the next three days we got out 20+ minutes early.  His final is ridiculously difficult and was extremely long.  Lenient grader though"
4096,542711,2.0,3.0,"Oh Gibbs.  A very intelligent man, but very dull.  His little jokes are entertaining.  His tests are difficult and long.  Does curve though so that's a plus.  Go to class, do the weekly assignments, kick ass on the project and you'll be fine."
4097,542711,3.5,1.0,"He is really nice and made our final exam optional. His tests are hard and LONG. The class is quite boring but you have to go because he takes random attendance, and it counts. Weekly homeworks are really easy."
4098,542711,4.5,3.0,"Great guy, really friendly. Always willing to help. One of my favorites"
4099,542711,2.0,2.0,"smart guy, interesting subject . . . bad combination.  the class was frustrating and it took us 15 hrs to complete the midterm."
4100,542711,2.0,2.0,"Scatterbrained and unorganized. Nice teacher, not good for W&L"
4101,542711,2.5,2.0,Organizational Behavior is the worst class...so worthless.  Gibbs did a bad job of teaching it too.
4102,542715,5.0,1.0,"Prof. King's lectures can be dry but many like his humor and charm. Lectures are also clear, very organized, and the notes he hands out are extremely helpful. Tests are straightforward and fair, and most students are not surprised by their grade. Class had online homeworks due, personally I thought they helped prepare me for his tests."
4103,542715,3.5,2.0,"King teaches a very easy class. Class is boring, but it would be hard to make a cost accounting class interesting.  He is by far the nicest and most approachable professor I have had a W&L."
4104,542715,4.0,2.0,Prof. King is a great guy. His quirky personality makes an incredibly dull topic much more bearable. He was very straight-forward and you always knew exactly what he expected. I would recommend him.
4105,542715,3.5,1.0,I love professor King! I did not put as much effort in this work as in other classes but still got an A. So I am pretty happy.
4106,542715,4.5,2.0,Professor King is a great guy! He loves teaching and is very funny in class. his tests aren't too hard and if you study the handouts you will do great
4107,542715,4.5,2.0,"Professor King is great. His tests are extremely straightforward- the problems are exactly like the ones you go over in class, so if you learn how to do the problems on the handouts then you are fine. Class is boring, but he is so nice and kind of quirky and funny."
4108,542715,4.0,3.0,He is pretty funny but you do have teach cost accounting to yourself. Basicailly all he does is give hand outs then go over those hand outs in class. Assigns a bunch of homework then gives a test that is related to the homework but with a few twists and random questions. I should of gotten a D in this class but he gave me a B- so I am happy.
4109,542715,3.0,2.0,Bill is hilarious.  He makes one of the most boring subjects in the C-school very funny.
4110,542715,2.5,3.0,"Extremely nice guy, but he can be confusing.  Classes are sleep-inducing, but often don't require staying awake.  If you need a lot of help and instruction, don't take him."
4111,542715,5.0,3.0,"so helpful, so nice, awesome prof. the epitome of a helpful caring, w&l prof."
4112,542715,1.5,2.0,Easy class.  Read magizines in class.  Got an A.  He is a worthless lecturer.  Entertaining random stories.
4113,268285,4.5,5.0,Dr. Beckley is a fantastic professor. He is a tough grader but he's genuinely invested in his students' understanding and is eager to meet during office hours (I highly recommend it). I'm sad this is his last year teaching! Take his class if you can.
4114,268285,4.5,3.0,"Professor Beckley is one of the best professors at W&L! He is extremely passionate about what he teaches and is very knowledgeable. You have to work hard in his class to get an A, but he lets you edit and re-submit any paper that you want to get a higher grade on. He is an awesome professor and I learned SO much from his class!"
4115,268285,4.5,4.0,Beckley is one of the most passionate and amazing professors on W&L's campus.  Take his class if you're at all interested in helping others or the study of poverty. He is dedicated to helping his students and watching them achieve.
4116,268285,5.0,5.0,Really amazing professor. Best at this school.
4117,268285,3.0,4.0,"Beckley is kind of a kooky Professor, so be prepared.  I felt he graded papers more harshly when I didn't agree with his opinions than when I did.  Overall just don't take POV 101 and expect an easy class. I'd suggest making a chart to keep track of all the different authors and opinions; it'll be really useful when you write papers"
4118,268285,5.0,4.0,"A really great, knowledgeable, passionate professor. Pov 101 was one of my favorite classes and actually inspired me. It is really hard to get an A in Beckley's class, even if you are a good writer, participate in class, and try really hard. Paying attention in class is really important to writing the essays later."
4119,268285,5.0,3.0,"I want to take every class Beckley offers. He is a great listener, teacher, and individual. Truly one of the professors that make W&L great."
4120,268285,4.0,4.0,"I took Professor Beckley's class on a whim, and he is now one of my favorite professors.  He is AMAZING and loves his job.  He loves good arguments during class and truly cares for his students.  He is an excellent professor, and even though the readings are tough, they are definitely worth it to have had a class with him."
4121,268285,2.5,3.0,"Assigned just as much reading and writing as most humanities professors. Was nice that you could rewrite papers, but wasn't too happy when you didn't feel the way he did. I felt personally attacked when I didn't agree with him and went to meet with him in his office. It was the worst class I've had at this school."
4122,268285,4.5,4.0,"These negative comments must be written by freshmen who think they can turn in a bad piece of writing and still get a good grade. Professor Beckley is one of the best professors at this school. He is a picky grader, but he is trying to make his students better writers. He has opinions, but he definitely encourages discussion and debate in class."
4123,268285,3.0,3.0,"While most professors regard their programs highly, Beckley is a self-styled prophet of his Grand Way: don't expect to get anywhere without paying the All-Knowing One due homage. Favoritism and pedantry are high, respect for dissent is low. Avoid the class: just read Amartya Sen's Wiki page."
4124,268285,4.5,4.0,"HE is AWESOME, he really cares about his students and offers tons of support. The class involves tons of reading and participation, but he tries to keep it nice. You don't need to abandon your major to be in his class. He is one of the best"
4125,268285,1.5,4.0,"Bad professor. Unreasonably tough grader, and not helpful at all. Always think he's right on certain things, so if you present something different, don't expect to be appreciated."
4126,268285,4.5,3.0,"Nice guy, but with the papers you really have to write what he wants to hear to get a good grade - does not reward thinking outside the box.  overall its an interesting class though, and despite assigning a good amount of work, he is willing to help you as much as you need (he lets you rewrite all papers)."
4127,268285,2.0,3.0,"Extremely nice guy, but not my favorite teacher. He assigns a ton of reading, and his lectures are difficult to follow and often make the reading more complicated. if you miss class you have to write a four page paper on the reading, which sucks. i wouldn't recommend him nor would i recommend not taking his class"
4128,268285,1.0,3.0,He preaches his gospel of &quot;twististics&quot; attempting to self-righteously guilt everyone into public service and volunteerism over one's academics.  A lot of personal biases are interjected with the aid of smoke and mirrors. Pretty much a wasted elective.  Go to church instead.  You don't have to abandon your major to be a good person.
4129,268285,4.5,4.0,He's really nice and very helpful and friendly to students inside and outside of class but there is way too much reading for this class and he's a very stingy grader on papers. Very interesting class but don't take it if you're looking for a good grade
4130,268285,4.5,3.0,Professor Beckley genuinely cares about all of his students.  There was a fair amount of reading for the class but most of it was relatively interesting. The class was made up of 1 exam and then 3 papers I think. Fair grader on the papers. I had to work fairly hard for my A- but definitely an easy B.
4131,268285,5.0,4.0,Difficult class with a fair amount of reading. Had no interest in poverty before taking the class only took the class because he was the teacher. He is the best teacher I have ever had and made class fun and helped me in my writing skills. I would recommend this class for everyone.
4132,268285,4.5,4.0,Awesome professor and an awesome class! I reccomend it to anyone who wants an interesting perspective on life.
4133,268285,4.0,5.0,WAY TOO MUCH reading...really nice and interested in his students though.
4134,268285,5.0,3.0,"Although he is a tough grader, he is a great teacher and allows revisions on all his papers."
4135,268285,4.5,4.0,Such a nice man wo cares about students.  Class is challenging and will really think but is rewarding.  Papers are hard but graded fairly.  Have to work hard to do well but is totally worth it.
4136,268285,5.0,4.0,WONDERFUL professor.  The Shepherd Program and Professor Beckley are the only reasons I do not regret coming to W&L.
4137,268285,4.5,3.0,"Beckley's class is based on lively discussions. Very critical in grading papers, but allows revisions. His door is always open if you have questions. Great prof, one of the only classes where I've had to think."
4138,268285,4.0,4.0,the class is mostly discussions but the papers are such torture. awesome prof. though!
4139,268285,4.5,4.0,"awesome professor! loves his job, loves his material and knows his stuff.  entertaining in class and passionate in raising awareness about poverty.  kind of eccentric, but incredible. take his class if you ever get the chance."
4140,268285,4.5,3.0,Such a nice guy!
4141,268285,5.0,4.0,wonderful...the best....take his class!
