0,2451460,5.0,3.0,Dr. Donate was really great. She was extremely animated and loved teaching. She was helpful outside of class if you went to her and cared about her students. Since she was a first year teacher she could get a little disorganized but it was not a problem.
1,2451460,1.0,3.0,"Textbook and homework are very different from class material. Hard to contact outside of class. Doesn't respond to emails unless convenient for her. Feedback is confusing and unhelpful. Nice lady, though."
2,2451460,1.0,3.0,Donate was one of the worst professors I've had here at Davidson. She's very unhelpful throughout the entire course and not very easy to access outside of the classroom if you need help. Very unclear grading criteria and has really unhelpful feedback. Will put things on the test that you never learned in class then say it's our fault for not knowin
3,2451460,4.0,3.0,"Enjoyed my experience with Dr. Donate. Albeit a bit unorganized at times, she cares for her students and understands the realities of attending Davidson. I learned greatly from her feedback, which can seem a bit nit-picky. Be prepared for homework from the manuals and to speak in class."
4,2056199,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Layman's class was engaging, interesting, and I learned a ton. However, only two essays made up 60% of our grade which was frustrating. I would say he is a fair grader, however, you need a 95 to get an A which was not easy when there are only two major assignments. I'm glad I took the class, but just be aware of these things."
5,2056199,5.0,3.0,"Professor Layman is a wonderful teacher who truly lives what he teaches. Though the reading might be a little confusing at points, he always clarifies the reading in class, and is always available to meet outside of the classroom. He encourages thinking for yourself, and there is no &quot;right answer&quot; in this class. I highly recommend Professor Layman."
6,2056199,5.0,3.0,"Professor Layman did a truly wonderful job teaching this past semester. He gave clear feedback on the few major writing projects we had and returned things quickly. His lectures were excellent, clear, and inspired me to learn more about the subject matter. He is truly a top-notch professor that I would recommend to anyone!"
7,2056199,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. This class exposed me to a lot of interesting philosophical ideas, and Dr. Layman did a great job keeping the online format relaxed without sacrificing learning potential"
8,2056199,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Layman is one of my favorite professors. He's very passionate and knowledgable about the subjects he teachings. If you want to get a good grade, I would suggest starting to go to office hours as early in the year as possible. Reading quizzes were super easy if you even glanced at the reading and essays are graded fairly."
9,2056199,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Layman is a wonderful professor and his class is one of my favorites ever. He is very knowledgable, accessible, hardworking, and caring toward his students. If you ever get a chance to take a class with Dr. Layman, I would highly recommend."
10,2056199,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Layman is great! His lectures on the readings are super helpful, but you need to have done the readings. He's really flexible about meeting outside of class and gives really helpful feedback. Would highly recommend!"
11,2056199,5.0,4.0,"Good class. Layman's super cool, funny, and a very reasonable prof. Midterm was graded a bit harshly. Interesting class/ office hours discussion. Very good in office."
12,2056199,4.0,4.0,Be prepared for additions to reading list.
13,2056199,4.0,3.0,"Layman is awesome! He wants you to think for yourself, and puts more emphasis on critically analyzing the work instead of rote memorization. Reviews were actually enjoyable- take home, open note, and based around developing your own arguments. He's readily accessible and eager to discuss anything outside of class. Fair grader. Highly recommend!"
14,2056199,4.0,3.0,"Can be a little convoluted, but passionate and knowledgeable. Loves to field questions and talk during office hours. The textbook language can be tough to understand, but ideas aren't too bad. Kind of a mercuric grader--I've gotten scores from 85-95 on daily quizzes with absolutely no explanation/nothing marked wrong. Tough grader on tests."
15,2056199,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Layman was new to Davidson this year and I took his Ethics class focusing on philosophers like Aristotle and Plato. He's really compassionate, keeps his lectures focused, and always applies the material to situations that students can understand. His work is in political philosophy and he's always available outside of class. You do have to read"
16,643081,5.0,4.0,"Such a great professor, you can tell she really cares about you, her class, and her students!"
17,643081,2.0,2.0,"She's nice, but her teaching gives students the same handle of the language that you got out of your middle school Spanish class. &quot;Advanced Chinese&quot; was taught almost all in English, and we spent the whole semester briefly memorizing bs for quizzes and then forgetting it. Students enter the class far below an advanced level, and leave no better."
18,643081,1.0,3.0,"Worst class I have taken at Davidson. Shen was incredibly disorganized, would show up for class late a lot, and would not have materials ready to teach until 30 minutes into class. She would read off the screen and go off topic a lot during lectures. There was only 100 total class points, which made her unclear grading guidelines a major problem."
19,643081,4.0,1.0,"Very fun teacher, CHI 101 was super easy. Tells you exactly what's on the test, very fair. CHI 228 is a little harder, she expects more out of you because her passion in literature, but overall she is great."
20,643081,5.0,1.0,"Great professor, great class!"
21,643081,5.0,2.0,She expects a lot from you but she really  knows what she is doing.  You can really learn how to write a paper in this class.
22,643081,5.0,1.0,"This class was definitely my easy A, just remember to keep up with your characters and take a few minutes to study everyday. It will only get hard if you put it off until the day before the test, and even then it's doable. No surprises on her tests, you know what to expect and it doesn't change. 102 is just as easy as 101 in my opinion"
23,643081,4.0,2.0,"She's great! Fair expectations, the tests and quizzes are straight forward and she's hilarious. The work isn't hard but you need to put in some effort/work to study and memorize the characters. I would definitely take every class she offers."
24,643081,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher. Tests and quizzes are very easy if you study. If you study hard you will find that you have probably over studied. She gives you the format for the quiz/test so no surprises. Practice your characters! Trying to squeeze in a bunch before a test is not a smart thing to do. Do like 5 everyday, it's not hard."
25,643081,4.0,2.0,She's very nice and if you just go to class and study a night or two before a test you can crush this class.
26,643081,4.0,2.0,"Shes hilarious.  She requires a lot of studying, but her tests are relatively easy."
27,643081,4.0,1.0,"Vivian is the best. Let's you know what she expects, gives pretty easy tests, and makes class time interesting. Unlike many courses at davidson, your work will get you whatever grade you want, even that A."
28,643081,4.0,3.0,"I thought she was great for intro chinese language courses. She is really funny, but the class definetly requires a fair amount of studying."
29,643081,3.5,3.0,Her expectations r VERY clear. shes an extremely fair grader and wants u to do well. but dont take this class if u arent willing to spend a lot of time studying. not for procrastinators!! ur grade will be directly proportional to ur time spent studying.
30,643081,4.0,2.0,"Super Chill Class, not difficult, and she is a good teacher."
31,643081,1.0,4.0,"Steer clear, friends.  Professor Shen may mean well, but her class is a train wreck.  The passengers can try to claw free of the wreckage, but she will smile and go on talking.  If it's any indication, we spent one class analyzing a placemat with the Chinese year from a restaurant off I-77."
32,643081,2.0,4.0,Middle of the road professor.  A three hour class period and only 100 total points didn't help.
33,1884174,5.0,4.0,He is an amazing teacher and funny and hot.
34,1884174,4.5,3.0,If you're not into simply taking notes during lectures than this class may not be for you. While history isn't my favorite I don't regret taking his class. He was SUPER helpful  during office hours - he was a huge help when it came to writing my essays. His grading is fair. I recommend him even if just need a history credit.
35,1884174,1.0,5.0,"This man is not a good professor, plain and simple. His African history course Modern Africa 1825-present was the worst class I've ever taken at Davidson. So freaking hard, so boring. Unclear, disorganized lectures. Very rude to students. I felt like I didn't learn anything. He gave no thought to the insane prices of the books he assigned. ($200+)"
36,643088,2.0,4.0,"Dr. G can not communicate. His teaching style is just dumping a bucket of lab instructions and papers on you and expecting you to figure it out. No lectures but still expects you to deduce the material. He had a mid-sem feedback session and everyone asked for him to teach more, and he said NO! He also gets frustrated when asked questions, like huh?"
37,643088,3.0,3.0,"Dr. G's class was mostly chill with heavy lab-based grades, and a few quizzes and a huge final project. He is very hands-off, but there also wasn't a ton of homework in the class."
38,643088,4.0,4.0,"A solid guy even though lectures are sometimes dry. I would recommend to follow through his office hours and ask for help throughout the semester. The course in itself is challenging, so be prepared to work for it. His reviews are hard but doable, and he curves the test."
39,643088,3.0,4.0,"He was fairly helpful in office hours but wanted you to think for yourself. Class lectures were ok, but they were sometimes very dry and confusing, and he occasionally made mistakes on the board. The homework was pretty straightforward and didn't take long, and he graded it pretty fairly. Labs were long but fine. The tests were hard and abstract."
40,643088,3.0,3.0,"Dr. G is a pretty decent guy. Average to slightly-above-average lectures, where he synthesizes the textbook in his own words and confusingly goes through derivations of equations. He answers questions moderately well but doesn't give too much help on homework. He grades the assignments pretty fairly but asks reasonably tough questions. Not too bad."
41,643088,1.5,5.0,Took two classes with him. Definitely in the bottom 10%  of professors at Davidson. Lectures are not clear and the tests dont match up to what he lectures on. Avoid.
42,643088,2.5,4.0,"Dr. G is an awesome guy. Very fun and easy to get along with. Lectures are decent, but he tends to assign HW that does not relate to his class discussions. Tests are tough but partial credit is everywhere so grades aren't that horrible. Cool guy, confusing teacher."
43,643088,4.5,3.0,No Comments
44,643088,3.5,4.0,Dr. G is a great professor once you learn his style. Don't give up - the tests are very hard. Very helpful if you go to him with relevant questions having thought them through beforehand.
45,643088,1.5,4.0,The lecture sucks.  He doesn't teach you and then ridiculously hard and don't relate to the lectures.
46,643091,2.0,4.0,"His class wasted my time. his class was poorly put together. The final was ridiculous and should've just given us a test instead of lazily slapping together something with zero direction under the guise of ""student creativity"" The entire parameters for the final project: physics, music, impact. That's what we were given to use for 35% of our grade."
47,643091,1.0,5.0,I've talked to far too many people who have had a bad experience in Dan's class. One of the worst people at Davidson I've interacted with.
48,643091,1.0,4.0,"Quite frankly, Dr. Boye does not give a damn about his students. One reason that I chose Davidson was because of the amazing professors & smaller class sizes that allow for more profound professor-student relationships. I experienced the complete opposite with Dr. Boye, who continually demonstrated a lack of respect & empathy towards his students.
"
49,643091,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boye gave clear, straightforward lectures and lots of example problems. He also had us work together in small groups on problems in class. The homework and tests aligned very closely with what was actually taught. He is an extremely kind, approachable person who always makes himself available for extra help. Overall, an outstanding professor."
50,643091,1.0,5.0,"Teachers should always teach from the ground up. Unfortunately, Dr. Boye does not. His lectures are unorganized and if you have never taken physics before, good luck. You will probably never learn anything in lecture because nothing is actually taught."
51,643091,1.0,4.0,"There are four good things about Dr. Boye: He's nice, very accessible during office hours, does fun demos, and a great singer. Avoid him otherwise: his lectures are VERY unorganized, he always lets us out late, and his tests are confusing and too rushed. He's a nice guy but I never walked out of any class feeling like teaching was for him."
52,643091,5.0,4.0,"Professor Boye is one of my favorite professors in the Physics Department and all of Davidson College. He's not easy; the transition from PHY130 with Professor Belloni was not easy. Nonetheless, he is an excellent instructor. I learned the most from his class during lab (where he is exceptional) and office hours. Great teacher and friend!"
53,643091,2.0,5.0,Does not lecture in class
54,643091,1.0,4.0,"Very mediocre teacher. Labs often went up to an hour over. He gave way more homework than was needed. Neither the homework nor labs reflected what would be tested, leaving us to guess what would be on the reviews. Would not recommend."
55,643091,2.5,5.0,"His lectures are often confusing; he likes to jump around from concept to concept. At least there are demonstrations to break up the confusion. I basically ended up teaching myself the material from the textbook. He's kinda helpful at office hours, but you're better off going to the mathscience center or finding a friend. "
56,643091,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Boye is an incredibly nice guy, super easy to talk to during office hours. Unfortunately, lectures are hit or miss and mostly miss... also the cushy chairs in the lecture hall don't help the situation. 230 lab is pretty fun tho. fair grader."
57,643091,3.5,2.0,"Great class if you don't expect to be spoonfed the material. Physics isn't easy, but Boye is very fair on tests. Helpful in office if you go BEFORE hwk due. Convinced me to major. Strategy: read ahead. Lecture is supplemental to the book, not the other way around. Best advice came at the beginning of the 1st class-I am not Dr. Cain-don't expect him"
58,643091,1.0,3.0,"Seems like he doesn't know what he's going to say next, is incapable of dismissing class on time, rarely covers the material before homework covering the material is assigned, assigns said homework in long sets due almost every class period... Would not recommend.  Dr. Boye is one of the regretful few at Davidson who really shouldn't be"
59,643091,2.0,4.0,His lectures are very vague and all over the place and he'll take up extra time at the end of class to start an entirely new topic only to leave most of the class confused. Hes a nice guy and he really knows his physics/music (opera singing background) but he should not be teaching. The textbook is dense yet vague as well. good luck.
60,643091,4.5,3.0,"Awesome professor! Gives great demonstrations in lectures. The most interesting class periods I've ever attended. Highly recommend the class. Tests are actually pretty tough though, especially considering it's for non-majors."
61,643091,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Boye's lectures are interesting, but can be overwhelming.  The material is pretty easy, but he finds ways to make it very difficult.  He is also not very helpful at all in office hours.  His grading can be a little inconsistent."
62,643091,1.5,5.0,Truly terrible professor by Davidson standards. I found that the book did a much better job of explaining physics than his lectures did. Boye is inarticulate to the point of incomprehensible. I hear he's pretty good at singing opera though.
63,643091,1.0,5.0,"The hardest class ive taken here by far. he was so disorganized and all over the place. very, very nice man though. i wouldn't recommend the class..."
64,643091,2.5,4.0,really nice man; scatterbrained in class. lectures were all over the place. cares about his students
65,643091,3.5,3.0,A great guy...fun to be around.  The only problem is he is sometimes hard to understand in lectures.  Ask him to sing opera for you.
66,643091,5.0,4.0,No Comments
67,1376282,2.0,4.0,"Do NOT take this class! Only take Communications with Professor Baker. Sherrill is NOT helpful and TOO difficult. Yes, I got a good grade in the class, but the grade was absolutely NOT worth the suffering I had to endure due to her. I write this to warn you all!"
68,2629665,2.0,2.0,"You can survive the course but it is not enjoyable. Professor changes syllabus, mixes up times and group projects, and doesn't communicate enough. The reading is manageable. The group work is annoying. It is hard to know how he grades. The readings are interesting though"
69,593960,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Mahony is a gentle soul. This class has few assignments, which is frustrating at times since it is hard to gauge where you stand. I thought he was a great teacher most of the time, but sometimes got annoyed with the 2 quizzes which did not really &quot;access&quot; what we had learned, but rather seemed like wrote memorization."
70,593960,3.0,2.0,Disappointed with the class. Grading was random and readings were bland. Should not have taught this class. Felt like kindergarten and everyone was bored.
71,593960,4.0,4.0,"He does very well at engaging everyone and taking everyone's thoughts and it makes it feel less like a lecture. A LOT of reading so be prepared. Only wrote 2 papers but they were graded pretty toughly. Overall a great teacher, and a great religion class. You really gotta understand the books you read or you won't do well."
72,593960,4.0,4.0,"A great, caring professor-- his teaching style just wasn't for me. He was clearly very passionate about the topic and knew his stuff, but he will definitely make you work for the grade... not an easy A! Also, he is very lecture heavy and sometimes his lectures can get boring and repetitive, so make sure you're prepared for that!"
73,593960,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Mahony is one of the best professors I have had at Davidson so far. He is incredibly helpful and is passionate about the material. The class (Classical Buddhism) was incredible and inspired me to want to continue studying Buddhist thought and texts. He's soft spoken and compassionate, yet brings a feeling of wonder and excitement to the class."
74,593960,5.0,4.0,"I love him - one of the best professors at Davidson.  He so holistic and cares about each student as a full person.  During every class he takes breaks for us to stretch, and then points out the beautiful weather and trees.  Definitely take him!"
75,593960,5.0,5.0,"The best teacher I've even had. Clear, interesting, kind. Very difficult material and exams. When Dr. Mahony started packing up to end class, I could hardly believe more than 5 minutes had passed."
76,593960,5.0,3.0,"Bill Mahony was my major advisor and I had a chance to take Buddhist Traditions, Classical Hinduism, and Asian Contempletive Traditions with him. The class subjects were too vast to be adequately covered in one class, but Dr. Mahony's teaching helped fan an interest that has shaped my life. Do not miss an opportunity to take a class with him."
77,593960,4.0,2.0,"I took Classical Islam with Mahony and loved it. He is so freaking cool. Like I want to hang out with him and be friends with him. I think he'd probably be a lot of fun to smoke weed with. He's super chill and very smart and insightful. He is mellow, soft-spoken, and sweet. His grading is very reasonable and his lectures are interesting and open."
78,593960,4.5,4.0,He is a great professor and very nice and helpful outside of class.  I recommend Hinduism over Buddhism and Islam.  Take good notes and ask questions.  He conveys his knowledge to the class well also.  Mahony is awesome.
79,593960,4.5,4.0,totally rocked my life! He is very genuine and always there for students when they need it. I recommend if you are having trouble in his class to go talk to him about it and he will always try and help you out.
80,593960,3.5,2.0,"Mahony is wonderful, and enthusiastic about his work, which is both good and bad. He provides a lot of depth on the plethora of info required of him. Unfortunatly, his enthusiasm causes notes/concepts to be all over the place.  Take the course if you're genuinely interested in Hinduism, not as a quick means to get a rel. credit."
81,593960,5.0,3.0,He is flat out amazing.  So energetic and great.
82,593960,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor.
83,593960,2.0,3.0,he gives such boring lectures but he gives the exam essay topics before the exam. he's a pretty hard grader. and is f-ing weird!
84,593960,2.0,4.0,"I was super excited to take this class, but honesttly, he is very boring and when he actually talks about something interesting, heaven forbid you disagree with him, bc you wont be right.  He has a bit of an ego that taints the whole class."

88,593960,5.0,2.0,"mahony lets you do a creative project instead of a test (at least he used to). one kid brought in some sculpture and set it on fire to demonstrate impermanence or something. he's the man, never pass up an opportunity to take his class."
89,593960,5.0,4.0,Dr. Mahony is amazing.  Probably the most spiritual (in a good way) person I've ever encountered.  His lectures force you to think in new ways.  Final exam is 50% of the semester grade.  Be prepared to read and write a lot for exams.
90,593960,3.5,3.0,The class is very subjective.
91,1507369,5.0,2.0,Melissa is very caring and cares a lot about the material.
92,1507369,5.0,2.0,Melissa is AMAZING! Take GSS101 with her! I am not a GSS major/minor but the class is so enlightening that you will not regret it. She is incredibly intelligent but also compassionate and cares deeply about her students. The class is pretty easy and I found all of the readings/assignments fun and interesting. 
93,1507369,5.0,2.0,She's super fun. Actually cares about your well-being. She is also very knowledgable in her field. Respecting every student and always try to be more inclusive. Class readings are ok. Lots of things are self-evaluated. Gives out really nice grades. Just finish every assignment and A is guaranteed.
94,1507369,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gonzalez is an incredible professor. She's probably the most intelligent professor I've had at Davidson so far. She is a captivating speaker and so knowledgeable in gender and sexuality studies, US and Latino culture, Chicana feminism, and the Spanish language. I could not recommend her more. Her office door is always open to students!"
95,1507369,4.5,2.0,"She's a great teacher. Really cares about the student and making sure you understand. Not a high work load, and I learned a lot. Watched a lot of films. She was very understanding with papers and helped a lot when you went in outside of class. I would definitely recommend her!"
96,1507369,5.0,2.0,"She is SO nice. Very helpful and cares about her students. The material was interesting, and the work load wasn't too much. I recommend her!"
97,1507369,5.0,3.0,"This was an excellent class, and I learned a lot and read things I've never read before. She's so smart, and her lectures always made me think. Going to office hours was super helpful, not just with Spanish, but with how to best express my ideas--go!. It's obvious she cares about her students. Highly recommended."
98,1507369,5.0,2.0,Great class and a great new addition to Davidson. Melissa is energetic and knows her stuff. She understands students and our workloads as well.
99,1507369,4.5,2.0,"Gonzalez is really easy-going and approachable--also, a good teacher of Spanish.  Homework is helpful, work load is LIGHT. Class can get boring, but was overall a good experience.  I recommend."
100,1323072,5.0,3.0,Great helpful and knowledgeable professor 
101,1323072,5.0,3.0,Fabulous teacher! Gave thought-provoking lectures and provided careful answers to my questions. Thank you for inspiring me to study religion!
102,1323072,1.5,4.0,"Terrible teacher. Lectures were useless and she doesn't give you notes. You have to ask her what are on the exams because she won't tell you volunatarily. The class was a jumbled mess of different elements she threw in (paper, quiz, presentation, short writings). The class felt very disorganized. You couldn't pay me to take another class with her."
103,1323072,1.5,3.0,"boring, boring, boring. Lectures seemed hastily prepared at best."
104,2125894,1.0,3.0,"Unfair, and doesn't respect his students."
105,2125894,2.0,4.0,Not the best teaching style.
106,2125894,3.0,4.0,The structure of the class was unclear and a lot of the students were confused throughout.
107,2515019,5.0,3.0,He is one of the most interesting professors in the department. He knows everything in Math and CS and really likes to talk about everything with his students. His research area ranges from pure math to data science and algorithm and he takes a lot of students to do research with him.
108,2515019,2.0,3.0,"I took MAT112 with him last semester, and as much as I enjoy his personality and the content itself, I don't think I learned anything from the class. The homework wasn't graded by him and he wanted us go to the embedded tutor, so I didn't feel a connection or like I could reach out. I was mostly relying on my calculus knowledge from high school."
109,2515019,5.0,1.0,Pulaj is literally one of the best CS professors. People who are rating him low are just salty because he caught them cheating.
110,2515019,1.0,4.0,He's a nice person but extremely not helpful in either homework assignments and tests. He probably gives the most confusing lecture in the department and he recommends going to the tutor instead of him. He basically leaves all the work to ATs and student graders. It literally seems like everything he says is to avoid people coming to him for help.
111,2515019,5.0,4.0,"He is a great professor. Very kind and understanding. He made sure to not burden the students during the rough semester, and cared for the students. Math explanations are sometimes confusing, and the midterms/finals really take a hit on the grade, but he will help you until you get it."
112,1638476,2.0,3.0,He definitely tried to make lectures interesting and have us collaborate which was headed in the right direction but he is just naturally so boring. He would lecture on and on in a tangent. A lot of the work we did was unnecessary and we had to do activities outside of class that did not even correlate to our course. 
113,1638476,2.0,3.0,"He doesn't know how to make the classroom ""alive,"" altho he clearly tries to. Many of my classmates are very active and outgoing students, but we all get muted in his class. The entire vibe is very bad. We have to write a paper, join a DCI D team (lots of discussions outside class time), and act out a dialogue (unnecessary).
Plz don't take him!"
114,1638476,2.0,3.0,"(_) thats the face that I would make for the entire duration of this course. Not a frown, but definitely not a smile. Dr. Bullock somehow balances so well in the mediocrity range it would be so unfair to call him bad. If he's the only teacher available for credit, its doable and you can gut it out. He's a nice guy the class just drags on and on."
115,1638476,3.0,4.0,"He lectured a lot, I didn't really know where the course was headed and work seemed unrelated."
116,1638476,4.0,4.0,Dr. Bullock is a great professor and a good person to talk to in office hours. His seminar was a great class because it blending policy and entrepreneurship which is rare at Davidson. If you like policy/business and don't mind writing you'll be fine.
117,1638476,2.0,3.0,The structure of the class was not very comfortable
118,1638476,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Bullock was mediocre. The grading criteria for papers was awful. It was a checklist, and you could checks all the way up to A-, but if you didn't get the check for &quot;structure of essay&quot; down at C-, then you got a C- on the whole assignment even if the essay itself is good. Class time did nothing but reinforce the readings."
119,1638476,3.0,2.0,"Prof Bullock wants his students to succeed and knows his stuff. However, his class was boring and I don't feel as though I actually learned anything. I also disliked how he graded papers. He uses a checklist rubric and if you hit every point, then you do well, regardless of the quality of the paper. READ textbook for tests. Lectures don't help."
120,1638476,3.0,3.0,"Bullock is your classic 3 rating. There are times where he'll be sort of funny and the lecture might be somewhat engaging and interesting, but this class is so unbelievably boring. He's a solid teacher, but when your surrounded by extraordinary professors at Davidson, solid is below average."
121,1638476,2.0,3.0,The class is pretty basic and if you already have some knowledge of how the US government works or have taken AP gov then you really don't learn anything at all. The tests are rather ridiculous... rather than testing on your knowledge he gives super vague fill in the blanks and makes you say which textbook a quote came from. Wouldn't take him again
122,1638476,2.0,4.0,"The readings are massive, and the tests are a bit ridiculous. He was a nice guy with good intentions, but the class just didn't flow well at all for me. "
123,1638476,3.0,3.0,"People ask me what Env Social Science is and, even after taking the class, it's hard to come up with an answer. The readings were long and not very engaging, although Bullock is pretty good at making the info make sense. The material, assignments, and projects seem pointless at times. Only take this class because it's necessary for the ENV major."
124,1638476,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Bullock has high expectations, but he is wants to help his students succeed. Although some lectures were confusing and fast, most students learned a lot from this course. The course should get better after being taught a couple of times. Office hours are a must if you want to master the material."
125,1638476,2.0,4.0,"Course would have been much better if it had not been team-taught, as profs had very different styles and expectations."
126,1638476,5.0,3.0,"Really knows his stuff. What I really liked about his teaching is that you left the classroom with &quot;the point.&quot; I'm sure once he gets use to Davidson he'll do well. Also, he attends lots of events (theatre,etc) make sure to say hello!"
127,1638476,3.0,1.0,"Really wants you to learn, but doesn't have the best method of teaching yet. Very credentialed and a hard worker, so I'll recommend him in the future."
128,1638476,3.5,2.0,"Bullock is new to Davidson this year, and it is clear. He doesn't have the most exciting lectures, but he knows a lot about the material. The class involves a lot of alternative type assignments like debates and presentations which is a nice change in pace. Bullock clearly wants his students to learn and succeed in this class."
129,1638476,4.0,1.0,"Dr. Bullock is new to Davidson, so he's still learning the ropes a bit - something I expect to become less of a problem as time goes on. Very enthusiastic about the material, has a very forgiving grade curve, loves to talk with students: what he lacks in experience he makes up for in passion. A word of warning: he does not allow laptops in class."
130,1638476,4.0,3.0,"Great class. Team teaching was a little awkward, but the class was very good at making you think. Bullock covers material quickly, and can depend heavily on powerpoint, but he knows his stuff. Tests are taken mostly from notes in class. Not many writing assignments or homework to be turned in. End of semester project is cool, but time intensive."
131,81996,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Heyer is actually really cool and enjoyable to talk to. However, she does not make sense when teaching and left a majority of the class confused just about every day. Her office hours can be helpful but sometimes will leave you more confused. Cool person, not so great teacher."
132,81996,4.0,4.0,"She's smart and amicable. Lectures were a little dry and confusing, but if you've had calc before you should be fine overall. Sometimes I felt like the class and tests were a little unpredictable. Homework is graded. I thought the final was pretty bad, but I guess I did okay in the end."
133,81996,1.0,5.0,"Her tests are hard, but she does not care whether you get a good grade or not."
134,81996,1.0,4.0,"She sometimes does not know anything about the biology perspective of bioinformatics, which is problematic."
135,81996,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Heyer is a solid option for somebody looking to learn to program. She runs  a very hands-on class, which makes grappling with Python much easier. Her assignments can be tough, and her grading style is somewhat nit-picky and unforgiving at times. However, if you stay disciplined and do the work, you'll get a lot out of this class."
136,81996,3.5,4.0,"Meh, I wasn't very impressed. Heyer has an energetic personality, but she gives very hard tests and basically makes you learn the material yourself. Office hours are wonderful and definitely the most efficient way to study. She responds to emails well but gives tough homework problems. It's hard to squeeze out even a B, but it can be done."
137,81996,3.0,4.0,I think the group aspect and learning the material on your own is not the best way to teach this class. I like lectures where the teacher explains the material and she does not do this for this class. Very difficult. A wonderful lady in office hours but must go to do well. 
138,81996,4.0,4.0,"She is pretty friendly and slightly funny at times. She tries to stay organized and has many office hours. She answers questions very well and is willing to help. She is somewhat clear in class, although she basically just makes you do the reading and learning yourself. Easiness is a 2, almost a 1, because the tests are very hard. Overall, not bad."
139,81996,4.0,4.0,"Heyer is a friendly lady who is extremely helpful and approachable during office hours. She basically makes you learn the material by reading the textbook and then clarifies the tricky things in class. She is somewhat clear in class but sometimes brushes by the important things. Tests are much harder than the homework. Overall, not a bad teacher."
140,81996,4.0,3.0,"AWESOME teacher.  Nice, helpful, encouraging professor.  Take whatever you can with her, but be sure to read the material closely, the pop quizzes are hard."
141,81996,5.0,3.0,Amazing. Take every class you can with her.
142,81996,4.5,4.0,The tests were hard but she is very helpful during office hours and if study a lot/ask her for help you can do well.
143,81996,4.0,4.0,OUTSTANDING PROFESSOR! Not difficult class but VERY time consuming! You get a week for each assignment and test and you really need to use most of that time. Her final is brutal. ENSURE you get in office hours. I always left feeling better about myself. You will go from knowing NOTHING to knowing advanced programming techniques! Well worth it
144,81996,5.0,3.0,"Formerly MAT130M, this class kind of changes your perception of calculus. There's so much application aspect, and Dr. Heyer is like the perfect professor for this class. Very rarely, her lectures are boring, and she picks very interesting topics to teach math. She is so nice and really cares about you."
145,81996,5.0,2.0,Take this if you aren't sure if you want to go deeper into math.
146,81996,4.5,1.0,Incredible! I loved this class- if you took Calc AB AP in high school its a breeze. She makes lecture interesting with great examples and is always willing to clarify concepts/answer questions in lecture.  Dr. Heyer is a kind person and so dedicated to teaching. Tests are fair and not too difficult.
147,81996,4.0,4.0,Loved Dr. Heyer. Very enthusiastic lecturer. Tests were thorough but fair.
148,81996,4.5,5.0,"She is tough and her tests are incredibly difficult, but she is always willing to help! Office hours are necessary."
149,81996,5.0,2.0,"Bioinformatics is my favorite class I have taken at Davidson. It is completely different from any other class offered. I actually enjoyed doing the homework, doing the projects, and taking the tests. It was time consuming but worth it!"
150,81996,4.5,5.0,Dr. Heyer is extremely friendly and helpful. The Calculus and Modeling course involves some tough concepts but does not involve a lot of busywork. She is incredibly enthusiastic and the class is definitely worth it if you half to take calculus.
151,81996,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Heyer is sooo radical. In a good way. She hands out A's like candy. Best professor. And is hot, hot, hot."
152,81996,5.0,4.0,Dr. Heyer is great! Her tests are hard-so be prepared. She's very helpful though and enthusiastic.
153,81996,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Heyer is very nice and helpful, but she makes her tests harder than they have to be. Although she doesn't hand out many A's, she is one of the most enthusiastic people I have ever met. I would recommend her for Calculus and Modeling, but I wouldn't count on the grade you want."
154,81996,4.0,4.0,"Tough class but great teacher. You think you are doing great in the class until you get that first test! Expect questions that are above and beyond hw problems. Class is fun to attend. She is very helpful in office hours. Mathmatica is challenging, but she knows it and is always willing to help you out."
155,81996,4.0,3.0,"VERY excellent professor - she was the first to actually help me enjoy a math course. As for difficulty, she only pushes you to use what you know, and coming from someone who usually loathes math, her reviews weren't too bad. Only word of caution: if you don't do your homework, you're screwed; she collects and grades all of it. Highly recommend!!"
156,81996,3.5,4.0,"Nice and helpful, but tricky as hell. Tests are more difficult then what is covered in class and what is in the texts. Expects more then what she teaches."
157,81996,4.0,2.0,"You have to work - make sure you get the HW problems right, study from those for exams, don't leave labs to the last minute, but don't stress the Practicum it will be ok. You have to make sure you get the easy stuff right, and fight the hard stuff when it comes, but make sure you get the easy stuff. You can IM her for help, how cool is that!"
158,81996,4.5,4.0,"Linear Algebra is not like any previous math class, but Dr. Heyer is fairly clear in class and is always, ALWAYS available to help."
159,81996,4.5,4.0,"very clear and precise but her take-home tests are brutal.. overall, she is very nice and easy to understand and get help from."
160,81996,5.0,4.0,"My third semester of math at Davidson, Heyer is a breath of fresh air.  She's so clear (IMO), always has something funny to say, gives out her sn so you can always get in touch with her if you're having trouble.  Probably one of the best professors at Davidson.  She is hard, but if you are persistant, you will do well in that class."
161,81996,4.0,4.0,I often left Dr. Heyer's course completely confused.  But then I spent just about every afternoon in her office getting extra help.  And she'd give me girl scout cookies!
162,81996,2.0,5.0,"Don't let her fool you, she's a nice woman but she tries to trick the students."
163,81996,4.0,3.0,"I thought Dr. Heyer was very helpful, available, and understanding."
164,81996,5.0,4.0,"Really nice, good proffesor, but HARD"
165,81996,3.0,3.0,"Really nice, too smart to explain things in a simple manner."
166,81996,1.0,2.0,No Comments
167,81996,2.5,4.0,did not explain concepts to the level she expected us to perform at
168,81996,4.0,3.0,"Developed great out-of-class relationship, cares about class understanding."
169,1638478,4.5,3.0,"Some lectures were intolerable only because the material can get boring. But I did gain a new appreciation for theater as an art. Van Hallgren is a good teacher but she's leaving this year. This class is worth the fine art credit however. It is not an easy A, which may frustrate you to put in alot of work for a theater class, but its def manageable"
170,1638478,5.0,2.0,"Fun, innovative and always willing to help. The best class and teacher I've had at Davidson."
171,1638478,4.0,3.0,"Carrie is a babe. Her class is what you make it. Put in the work, you'll get an A. I didn't read a single play and I got a B+. She is a deceptively hard grader on the essays, and our one two take home tests were a little tough. Great class for a fine art credit though."
172,81999,4.0,3.0,Fuji is cool. He doesnt care a lot about the structure of the class but if you do your job you will be fine.
173,81999,4.0,2.0,"Fuji is the man. His classes can get off topic easily, but is pretty brilliant. Definitely take one of his classes before you graduate."
174,81999,3.0,2.0,"I switched into his class at the end of the first week of the semester, and he wasn't really willing to help me with what I missed.  That aside, he doesn't care AT ALL about what you do in terms of reading, just so long as you're visibly interested during class.  Do the writing assignments and talk during class, and you'll do well grade-wise."
175,81999,4.5,3.0,Fuji is awesome
176,81999,5.0,3.0,Fuji is an amazing resource.  He has given me sources for research papers for other classes that aren't even anthro.  Definitely meet with him-- he's a genius and very approachable but realistic.
177,81999,3.0,2.0,easy but the most boring class ever.. fuji is also a joke.. automatic B's but A's are hard
178,81999,5.0,1.0,"Rule of B's.  Take this course, write the papers, and you wont get worse than a B"
179,81999,5.0,2.0,"&quot;The Fuj&quot; is the man.  Not too difficult on the course work, but knows his****.  Teaches well, fun classes, interesting material.  Not too upset when asked to be excuse from class due to ****eness"
180,81999,4.0,1.0,Grades easy adn gives very little work.  The reading is not neccessary in order to pass.  I didn't read over half of the material.  He shows movies on fridays.  A great class to only go to when you feel like it.
181,81999,2.0,1.0,No Comments
182,81999,5.0,2.0,"Great prof, really intelligent, really fun, great discussions"
183,81999,4.0,4.0,"Class is hilarious, the guy is more of an older student than antiquitated prof."
184,2598989,4.0,3.0,"I've loved this class with Dr. Yesnowitz. He assigns a really reasonable amount of readings and works hard to engage students' specific interests and questions during class. Class is largely lecture and discussion based, which depending on the readings can be more or less interesting. He's super friendly, accessible, and always willing to help."
185,2598989,5.0,3.0,Dr. Yesnowitz was a great professor. His lectures were engaging and discussion was encouraged. Assignments were interesting and all directions were clear. He encouraged collaboration and was always available to answer any questions. Loved his class.
186,2598989,2.0,4.0,"Nice man. Incredibly hard to stay awake during his lectures. I think the class had the potential to be incredibly interesting (the subject material itself was) but with his teaching... well, no. Also, there is a ton of reading, and it's very dense material. Be prepared for that. I'd never gotten below a B+, but I gave up a few weeks into the class."
187,245849,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Shaw is one of the reasons I love Davidson! I've taken several classes with him and he is my major advisor. His wit and intelligence are great to engage with, especially in office hours. He has always been eager to help and answers questions. The reviews are tough but are the best form of ""test-taking"" that I've experienced. A great professor! "
188,245849,5.0,4.0,"Really awesome professor with great and entertaining lectures. Some of my classmates complained to me about them but personally, I really enjoyed them because I thought they were thought-provoking and he mixes in humor with them. I guess he likes my writing style so his grades my work fairly generously, but for most he is pretty tough. "
189,245849,5.0,4.0,"Old fashioned in a charming sort of way! No gum, no hats, pencil and paper for notes. But his class time is excellent and rarely felt wasted. He assigns a lot of difficult reading but it is worth it because you spend a lot of time discussing and dissecting it. Best lecturer I have ever had, and quite funny. Asked him to be my major advisor."
190,245849,5.0,5.0,"Shaw is a great professor. He cares about his students, but he will push you really hard to get you to succeed. He makes his material interesting, and he has very high expectations for the reviews. Do not expect an easy A whatsoever, but, youll leave the class as a better writer and a much more accomplished student."
191,245849,4.0,4.0,"Great professor but a very tough grader. A B+ for him is an A+ in many other classes. Class is very discussion-based and you need to pay attention to know what to write about. His WRI101 will make you 10x better of a writer, just beware if the grade is worth it."
192,245849,5.0,4.0,"One of the most difficult WRI 101 classes; nonetheless, your essay writing skills will drastically improve. Classes are centered around discussion, and participation and attendance is essential to your grade. 5 major papers including 1 final research paper, but the prompts are very well written and reflect class discussion. Great professor!"
193,245849,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Shaw is an amazing professor! His class, Modern Political Theory, is really interesting and he makes the content engaging. I have to admin it is a hard class though. You must do the reading or the 3 papers (your entire grade) will be very painful. Shaw is really funny and does a great job explaining the tough reading."
194,245849,3.0,4.0,Dr. Shaw's POL 207 class was essentially him going through the books we read page by page and narrating what happened--super helpful if you hadn't read but also very boring. He's a super hard grader. The material was interesting enough but not when you're sitting in class listening to him summarize books for an hour.
195,245849,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Shaw is an extremely smart guy who leads lively and thoughtful discussions. His comments on papers can be unclear and sassy at times, but he will make you a good writer.  This class is tough compared to other writing classes, so be warned. However, if you're into reading/discussing the classics, this can be a great academic experience."
196,245849,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Shaw is an awesome professor. His class was really interesting and since taking it, I've realized just how much the ideas that he teaches have become the things we take for granted in our world today. His lectures are really good and are very helpful. Dr. Shaw is definitely a tough grader, but he is fair. One of the best professors for sure!"
197,245849,4.5,4.0,"Was able to keep students engaged in discussion of topics that have a high potential to not be the most interesting. Knows the topics extremely well. Tough grader, but will make you a better writer."
198,245849,5.0,4.0,"Shaw is the best teacher I have had, ever. His tests are no joke, but they actually test your understanding of the material and actually drive you learn more. I enjoy his classes and think the world of the man. He's happy to help in office hours and will write you a great letter of rec if you earn his respect in class. "
199,245849,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Shaw is really helpful and knowledgeable. He will make you work for your grade and you will surely come out of the class knowing more information. He says that if he was a painter he mostly uses only four of the five colors of his pallette... Meaning that he rarely gives out As. Though he is tough and demanding, he truly is a great proffessor. "
200,245849,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Shaw is hands-down the most amazing lecturer I've ever encountered. Like, lectures so good that you get totally wrapped up in them and forget to take notes. With that said, he's also a very tough grader - his 'reviews' (they're really 6 page papers you have a week to do) can't just be thrown together last minute. Would definitely recommend him."
201,245849,2.5,5.0,"Shaw managed to make old Greek philosophers actually interesting. He leads lively discussions, but he assigns really confusing essays. He grades SUPER HARD and has all these very specific expectations. I feel like the class is unnecessarily hard, esp. for a wri 101. There are some way easier ones out there."
202,245849,4.5,5.0,"He is certainly a great professor you can experience in Davidson. The class involves a lot of reading and writing, though. Take his class and get the best academic experience out of it."
203,245849,4.5,5.0,"Shaw leads very entertaining classes. I had him for writing, and he certainly makes you a better writer, though his grading is harsh. He expects a lot out of you, even though its a freshman class. Don't take his writing class if you want an easy one with minimal work--his involves a lot of reading and writing!"
204,245849,2.5,3.0,"Professor Shaw is so much fun in class, but he's a harsh grader. Make use of the writing center and go see him during office hours for help!"
205,245849,4.5,3.0,"I had Professor Shaw for POL 205. He is an amazing professor; he completely opened my mind to new viewpoints on issues and made me question everything I had believed prior to taking the class. His class is mostly lecture but he does welcome questions. Reviews are tough, go to office hours."
206,245849,3.0,5.0,"This was a tough writing class. I definitely visited him after every essay grade to understand my errors, but he was very helpful. I feel like I understand the books and plays we covered. The one day he wasn't in class he was accepting an award for his ability to defend either side in an argument and remain indiscernible as to his real opinion."
207,245849,4.0,3.0,Such an AWESOME teacher. Had no previous interest N this subject & by end of semester i LOVED this class. VERY LIVELY he encourages class discussion/debate -&gt; good. topics ALWAYS interesting. he's also very clear. his tests are fair and well constructed. He does grades hard h/e and he does not provide any comments as to how to improve the essays.
208,245849,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Shaw is an amazing professor. He is really intense and intelligent. If you are a liberal, he will make you a better liberal; if you are a conservative, he will make you a better conservative. I loved his class and I loved having him as a professor, even though his reviews were killer!"
209,245849,2.5,5.0,Shaw demonstrates the reasons why tenure is a poor system.
210,245849,5.0,5.0,"Spectacular teacher.  Do you want to know WHY you believe what you believe&#63; Other professors put information and ideas in your brain, but Shaw actually expands the size of your brain.  He emphasizes minimal but intense reading, quality over quantity, and exams that actually teach you something.  Best teacher I have ever had, across the board."
211,245849,4.5,5.0,"Prof. Shaw exists on a whole other level in comparison to most professors. As my introduction to the faculty, he represents exactly why you choose a place like Davidson.  Take his courses--regardless of difficulty--and learn something, not just about the material, but about the character and the work ethic of Davidson . My favorite course thus far."
212,245849,3.0,1.0,"Pretty decent, but somewhat full of himself.  Not very good at acknowledging disagreements in the classroom."
213,245849,5.0,4.0,"The quintessential liberal arts professor: widely- and well-read, articulate, rigorous, and has a very keen sense of humor. Truly outstanding. His take-home reviews (if done well) are some of the most intense undergraduate writing exercises because you must cram in as much theory as possible (while still being clear) within four or so pages."
214,245849,5.0,4.0,No Comments
215,245849,5.0,5.0,Best professor at Davidson. Clearly.
216,245849,5.0,3.0,"Outstanding teacher. Prepared, clear, helpful, witty. Excellent texts."
217,245849,5.0,4.0,"AMAZING professor! I'm getting As.  This class is a must.  If you pay attention and take notes, you are guaranteed a good grade.  He is fabulous."
218,245849,5.0,4.0,Best prof. in Davidson's pol. sci.
219,245849,4.0,3.0,"Very intelligent and compassionate teacher. Really cares about his students. Will make you think about what you really believe when reading different texts. Grades essays pretty hard, you will not get an A."
220,245849,4.5,2.0,"he knows his stuff and really becomes the philosopher you're discussing.  reading assignments reasonable (as in, you can finish them unlike other classes).  3 tests/papers."
221,245849,5.0,3.0,Hilarious and engrossing lectures and a very friendly guy. He understands and will convince you that political &quot;science&quot; is really all about political philosophy.  A tough but fair grader who doesn't assign that much work.
222,245849,5.0,5.0,"Looking back, my favorite class at Davidson.  Learned a TON about religion.  Very hard grader, but he will help if you ask.  Hilariously critical of modern America.  Take his class."
223,245849,5.0,4.0,"He is brilliant, witty, and his courses are rigorous but fair. He is easy to like and, personally, I found classtime to be enjoyable. Highly reccommended"
224,2566253,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Penar is a great professor. Passionate about the subject and he truly is an expert. If you are looking for an easy A, don't bother. You gotta work for it."
225,2566253,4.0,4.0,"I was not a fan of Dr. Penar at first, but he grew on me a lot as the semester progressed. Sometimes the course has a lot of reading homework, but normally the workload is manageable. Penar also gives solid feedback so it's easy to improve as the semester goes on. He knows a lot about the subject matter, and the class is organized and engaging."
226,2566253,1.0,5.0,"The sole reason I dropped poli sci major. So pretentious, mandates &quot;summits&quot; where the class has to meet for a class period OUTSIDE of the scheduled time. Makes it overly hard to try and establish himself as competent and it really shows. Required a meet for the final to be scheduled a week out and he didnt show (he forgot). Run screaming from PP"
227,2566253,1.0,4.0,"I cannot recommend enough that you DON'T TAKE this class. He compensates for his lack of knowledge and experience with an absurd workload, tedious and unorganized assignments, and an ego too big for the classroom. He is an unnecessarily difficult grader, not giving full credit because he thinks he could have done better (he couldn't). DON'T TAKE!"
228,2566253,1.0,5.0,I can't stress enough how terrible of a professor Dr. Penar is. I despised his class. He is the most difficult professor I've ever had at Davidson despite the fact that he teaches nothing during his classes. His &quot;lectures&quot; consists of him talking about African politicians he's friended on Facebook. NEVER take his class! He is insufferable.
229,2566253,2.0,4.0,"To be an introductory level class, Dr. Penar's Comparative Global Politics class was not worth the credit. The most readings and papers I have ever done for a class and I have taken much more specific and higher-level courses. A nice guy and clearly very passionate, but did not enjoy this course."
230,2566253,5.0,4.0,"An amazing professor! I highly recommend his class. It will be tough but very rewarding if you are willing to put in the effort. Professor Penar is extremely knowledgeable and personable and willing to talk with you after class. If you're looking to fulfill a requirement, he is not for you. But if you are interested in polisci, take his class!"
231,2566255,5.0,2.0,Do whatever you can to take a class with Bailey!! He is an amazing professor. Really cares about his students and if you show up and work hard you will easily pass his course. 
232,2566255,5.0,2.0,"Impressive person, great teacher. I grew as a person from this class and enjoyed my time doing it."
233,2566255,5.0,2.0,"All you need to do to get an A is show up, do work, and talk a bit in class. Chillest professor ever."
234,2566255,5.0,2.0,This was the best class I have ever taken. Professor Bailey is absolutely incredible. His lectures are thought-provoking and pointed. I learned so much about empathy and understanding myself. Truly incredible class and professor.
235,2566256,5.0,3.0,"Very smart, caring professor. I learned a lot about topics I knew very little about before. Fascinating readings. Gives super helpful feedback. Make sure you go to office hours!"
236,2566256,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Postoli was a really great professor in the classroom, but outside of it there were issues. He was really disorganized with grading and, while he did take the time to give very helpful feedback, he gave it back to us too late to be applied to our next assignment. I also thought many of the assignments were overkill and didn't help me learn."
237,2566256,3.0,2.0,Sokrat has a good balance between lectures and discussions. I usually skip the homework and still can follow along in class perfectly fine. As long as your participate a couple times per class and put some effort into the essays it's not hard to get an A in the class. He is a pretty easy grader and I enjoy how the class is based off French movies.
238,2566256,5.0,4.0,"Sokrat is absolutely wonderful. I hated French until him! Participation-heavy, but it actually helps you a lot and he doesn't make you feel bad for mistakes (I made tons). Writing assignments are tough, but he is helpful, available, and not the harshest grader. Also covers unique topics compared to most FRE classes and explains French grammar well"
239,2566256,2.0,4.0,"You will learn French, but his organization leaves much to be desired. He regularly forgets to collect homework and he forgot to submit our grades to the registrar so it showed up as &quot;No Grade&quot; on our transcripts. For 201 his writing assignments are very demanding, asking us to analyze a literary work for themes and symbols with our limited french"
240,2291829,2.0,4.0,"I'm not a fan. Her grading is unclear and overly picky. She was familiar enough with the lab techniques, but not great at explaining them. If this weren't Davidson. I would give her a better grade, but I have higher expectations. Thoroughly mediocre."
241,2291829,2.0,4.0,quizzed on things before a chance to go over it in class (or even office hours). did not seem to really recognize the needs of the students. disorganized. ridiculously heavy workload out of class. i simply don't recommend.
242,2291829,1.0,5.0,Just dont do it. Im warning you
243,2291829,1.0,5.0,"She is the worst teacher I have had at Davidson thus far. We had two quizzes on online lecture material BEFORE we would even be able to cover it in class, and there was a ton of homework. I've never had less respect for a professor at Davidson, as she seems to be completely unaware of student needs and what is a reasonable work load. Stay away"
244,315517,4.0,3.0,His wri101 for physics and tech class was almost always a physics lecture with a few grammar exercises. If you dont have the slightest interest in physics he might not be for you. There are a lot of papers but he is not a tough grader so a B+ or A is very doable. Very helpful in office hours and is a nice guy overall.
245,315517,3.0,3.0,Very interesting paper topics. Lectures got REALLY boring though. Grading was kind of pedantic and focused on finding tiny grammar mistakes. Most people ended up with good grades though. Take if you want to learn minute grammatics and write really long essays about science stuff.
246,315517,2.0,4.0,"I have had Yukich for PHY 130 lab, PHY 101 (writing), and PHY 310 (electronics). He strikes me as a very friendly man who is a mediocre teacher. He will lead fast-paced lectures that will halfway prepare you for the labwork which takes many hours per week and the two very hard exams (average was a 70). Office hours are moderate, but he is forgetful"
247,315517,3.0,4.0,"Friendly man who at least pretends to be interested in his students. Lectures were ok, not much better than the textbook itself. He assigned a lot of lab work and answered questions decently well, but we had to figure out a lot on our own. There were two exams, both of which were very hard. He was sometimes forgetful but always very friendly."
248,315517,4.0,4.0,"Yukich really tries to connect with students. he is frequently in his office and will try his very best to answer your question. Responds to emails quickly. most lectures are clear, coherent, and fast-paced. He is a moderately (slightly too) harsh grader who assigns a lot of lab work. First test was very hard. I've seen better and worse."
249,315517,4.0,3.0,"Took his Writing 101 class because I thought it might be interesting. I wasn't disappointed, but if you don't have even a slight interest in Physics  you may find the class very boring. That being said, Dr. Yukich was extremely helpful (saving my grade on a number of occasions) and tried to make the material as interesting as possible."
250,315517,3.0,4.0,"Yukich is a very friendly man but not a great teacher. 3 for helpfulness because he's ok in office hours but won't always end up answering your question. 3 for clarity because he tries to explain things in class but sometimes goes off on useless tangents. 2 for easiness because he is a harsh grader who expects a lot of reading. Overall, he's ok."
251,315517,3.5,4.0,He's an ok teacher. He is a nice man and a very esteemed Christian. Probably about 50 years old. 3 for helpfulness because he tries to be helpful but sometimes goes off on useless tangents. 4 for clarity because he is pretty clear. 2 for easiness because it's extremely hard to get an A out of him but not that hard to get a B. Get on his good side.
252,315517,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Yukich is excellent at lucidly explaining difficult physics concepts; however, his tests are hard, but if you study and come to his office hours (which are EXTREMELY helpful) you'll do fine. He is a devout Christian but apart from mentioning it in the first class of the semester, religion never comes up in class. I highly recommend him."
253,315517,3.5,4.0,"Yukich is a chill guy. He's very friendly and very smart. He's a pretty good teacher, but sometimes he doesn't know what he's talking about (i.e. he gets class exercises wrong in class). He grades essays more harshly than the rubrics he hands out would suggest, and office hours are usually more helpful than class time. Overall, he's alright."
254,315517,1.5,4.0,"Dr. Yukich teaches examples and concepts straight from the book, and then demands different concepts and forces you to really stretch what you're taught for tests and hw. VERY VERY UNHELPFUL during office hours. Very upfront with his religious convictions (not necessarily bad, but I didn't feel it was appropriate discussion for a physics class)"
255,315517,4.0,2.0,"Yukich teaches straight from the book (although not as in depth as the book). He's easy to understand, moves at a steady speed, and is predictable. The spot tests are VERY similar to the real tests. He can be a little boring (but I have him at 830 which doesn't help). He's a very easy lab grader, not anal at all! Good for non-science majors too."
256,315517,5.0,4.0,The reviews were difficult but he was a great professor.  Labs with him were especially fun.
257,315517,4.5,4.0,Dr. Yukich was a breath of fresh air after having Dr. Christian for 130. His lectures were very well-structured. He has a good sense of humor and really wants his students to understand the material and succeed. This is a fun class.
258,315517,4.0,3.0,"Great guy, great professor.  He can be a little hard to follow, but for the most part he's a good lecturer.  Talks about his kids (Peter, Paul, Mary, and Tom) all the time.  Thinks that television is evil and gives his wife puzzles as gifts."
259,315517,4.0,3.0,Good with the introductory level course.  Knows his stuff and can teach it.  Helpful outside of class. Very strong christian beliefs (taken as you will)
260,315517,4.0,3.0,Great guy and will go out of his way to try to help. His lectures never get through to everyone and at times it seems as if he doesn't understand everything he teaches.
261,2775171,4.0,3.0,"Professor Cools is very cut and dry. Her classes usually follow a two-test and final exam format with weekly graded problem sets. The readings are always dry/boring/not-easily-understood, but you don't have to do them because she goes over the same material in lecture. She focuses more on teaching practice problems than concepts. "
262,2728067,4.0,2.0,"Claudia is very nice and understanding. She's very good with accommodations; however, sometimes she's very disorganized and the expectations of the class are unclear. The content itself is extremely fascinating but sometimes the way she leads the class is confusing. Overall, I like her as a person, but sometimes it felt a little chaotic. "
263,2728067,5.0,4.0,Don't believe previous reviews. Any changes made were to accommodate us. The class is challenging bcuz she's a philosopher who asks that will make you THINK! She's an amazing lecturer; very knowledgeable. We watched really good documentaries. She's lived all over the world and shares captivating stories. She will change the way you see the world.
264,2728067,2.0,4.0,"Overall, I was disappointed with this class. The professor was extremely disorganized, for we did not get a syllabus until the second week of school. I only received two grades out of close to 10 graded assignments. However, she is very passionate about what she teaches, and we were able to meet with authors of critical race theory which was fun."
265,2728067,2.0,4.0,"I felt that this class had a ton of potential to be great, but it was surprisingly one of my least favorite classes I've taken. The professor was extremely unorganized and didn't seem to know what she was teaching. We also only got to the subject of the class within the last few days of it, and she gave work back very late if at all."
266,2728067,4.0,2.0,"I enjoyed the freedom her class offered &amp; she was very accommodating. She did make multiple syllabus changes, but this was one of the most rewarding classes and she is very passionate about her work. If you need a class with a lot of structure, she is not for you. If you want to learn beyond traditional academic structure, I recommend her!"
267,2728067,2.0,4.0,"She is a knowledgeable professor, however she is unorganized and gives work the night before and it is often a lot of reading. She is reasonable with extensions. There are few actually graded assignments. Overall, she is a good professor, but don't take her class if you are not willing to participate and read."
268,1722501,3.0,3.0,"Park is a somewhat friendly lady but also seems full of herself, often reminding you that she is a master in her field. Coming to office hours will help answer your questions about the reading and assignments, but her lectures are vague and irrelevant. She gives you all the test questions ahead of time (to prepare) but assigns MOUNTAINS of reading."
269,1722501,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Park is a nice and attractive person but don't let this fool you. She assigns a physically impossible amount of reading and is very disorganized. She's great in office hours if you can reach her by email, which she rarely answers. Lectures are hit or miss but material is usually interesting. Not too tough of a grader. Decent classprofessor."
270,1722501,2.5,3.0,"Park is sort of an eccentric lady who is not very available outside class hours. She has office hours, but you must schedule an appointment well in advance. She is well-intentioned and cares about teaching, but her lectures are dull. Tests are reasonably difficult, but most of what is tested is the gratuitous reading that is assigned."
271,1722501,2.5,2.0,Really eclectic lectures... never know what she's going to talk about
272,1722501,4.0,2.0,"A little hard to follow during class and sometimes goes completely off syllabus. If you are a stickler for organization she might not be the one for you, but you'll learn a whole lot through her tangents. Really great prof."
273,1722501,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Park is very very smart and an awesome teacher for small classes. Sometimes she is difficult to pull succinct information out of, but you learn so much along the way. Go see her during office hours and get to know her, she is awesome!"
274,1722501,3.5,3.0,Great professor. Worth it if you're interested in the topic.
275,1722501,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Park is a great addition to the Davidson History Faculty. She is extremely knowledgeable and brilliant- however, she holds class in a way that makes all students feel comfortable and happy. She has a great sense of humor and is very reasonable with the assigned workload. Overall a great class and great professor. Reccomend"
276,2603148,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed Arab Spring with Dr. Khedher. Each lecture was guided by his training as an anthropologist and featured both his own experience/guest lecturers on a wide range of topics. Our final project encouraged us to focus on an area of personal interest. In and out of class, Dr. Khedher is accessible and a wonderful resource/support. 10/10!"
277,2603148,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Khedher is one of the best professors I've ever had. And I've had him for many classes, so this isn't a one off. He is extremely intelligent and capable, and his class heavily emphasize discussion. He's always been flexible and understanding, especially during Covid. Lastly, he's an absolute gem of a person. Take a class with him if you can!"
278,2603148,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Khedher was the most helpful professor, constantly encouraging me to reach my full potential inside and outside the classroom. I feel fair in saying that on top of the grammatical insights, and clear guidelines, Dr. Khedher offers his expertise in anthropology which allows for a sense of cultural immersion. Which even carried over to Zoom."
279,2603148,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Khedher is a very kind and passionate professor. He really cares about his students, and his main philosophy when teaching Arabic seems to be to get you to talk without being self-conscious. He can stray off-topic in class and go on tangents and can sometimes be unclear, but he really cares about getting students engaged and about the subject."
280,1779857,4.5,2.0,A fun professor who definately helped improve my appreciation for theatre
281,2181265,1.0,4.0,"Seminario unhelpful both inside and outside of class, but he was also unapproachable. I had no prior experience with Python prior to this class, and Dr. Seminario was quick to pounce on my lack of programming ability with his biweekly quizzes. From the endless number of assignments to the classwork, everything needed to be exactly his way. No go."
282,2181265,3.0,4.0,"Seminario is a fine choice for 121. He makes you think for yourself, but will always do his best to help if you're stuck. Lots of quizzes that vary widely in difficulty. If you want to do well you'll have to put in the work, but it's not awful. The homework is are the hardest part of the class so make sure you can work well with a partner."
283,2181265,4.0,4.0,"at first, I wasn't always sure what was going on in class. he wouldn't always be super clear with assignments, but after I started to understand his teaching style, it got better. CSC 121 is generally just a hard class but he gives extra credit and is always willing to help out students"
284,2181265,5.0,3.0,"Loved the class. Hit or miss depending on whether you understand it. Worked very well for me, not too much work, not hard to get a good grade with all the extra credit he gives. No reviews was nice."
285,2181265,4.0,3.0,"While the CSC may be a bit dry, Seminario tries to keep things interesting and he's really funny. The course itself is not hard (the homework can take a long time)  but it's hard to do well (get a good grade)  because of weekly quizzes."
286,2039976,5.0,4.0,"As a first-year, I have not had the chance to meet many professors, but I must say it was an honor to meet Dr. Boddery in Writing 101. He challenges you to think critically, for yourself, and, beyond the beaten path. As I have learned, not only will your writing style evolve, but your world perspective. He has piqued my interest in law school!"
287,2039976,5.0,4.0,Dr. Boddery is one of the best professors I have had at Davidson. He knows what he is teaching and does a great job of making it interesting and clear to understand. I wish I could take more classes from him!
288,2039976,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boddery has been one of my favorite professors at Davidson. His lectures are incredibly efficient, and very detailed. I walked away learning a lot about constitutional police procedure, and constitutional law in general. He has a great sense of humor, and will be missed at Davidson. If you go to Gettysburg, take one of his courses!"
289,2039976,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boddery has been the best professor that I have had at Davidson. His lectures are always engaging, and he knows how to facilitate classroom discussion. He is also always willing to help outside of the classroom. I would highly recommend taking any class that you can with Dr. Boddery."
290,2039976,5.0,4.0,"Great professor! He selected very interesting readings and facilitated fascinating discussion. He values each student's opinion and wants to hear everyone contribute to the conversation. He will make you work for your grade, but it's worth it. Would definitely take another course with Dr. Boddery"
291,2039976,5.0,4.0,He is awesome. Like you will end up respecting him.
292,2039976,5.0,3.0,Dr. Boddery has been (hands down) my favorite professor during my two years at Davidson. He is an incredible teacher and I'm so sorry to see him go. He is an excellent lecturer and does a great job of hitting the major points while still supporting a strong class discussion. The whole classroom experience with him is excellent!
293,2039976,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Boddery is a real pleasure to work with. This is the fourth class I've taken with him, and each one has presented unique challenges, but all have been rewarding. Participate often, don't be scared to voice an unpopular opinion, and do the readings. If you do all that, you'll undoubtedly enjoy the class and he will reward you for your work."
294,2039976,5.0,3.0,Dr. Boddery is a phenomenal professor. He challenges his students but doesn't overwhelm them with work. He sets high expectations but will consistently work with you so that you meet them. Really enjoy the classes I've taken with him.
295,2039976,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Boddery's course was incredibly helpful. It gave me a candid picture of what type of work is expected of law students. Before taking this class, I was unsure of whether I wanted to go to law school - after his class, I am convinced that I want to go. Dr. Boddery's feedback was very very helpful, and he made himself available at every chance."
296,2039976,5.0,4.0,Several of my friends currently in law school wish they would've taken Legal Analysis before they left undergrad after I explained the course to them.  It should be a required course in all all pre-law programs.  Dr. Boddery makes the material accessible and enjoyable despite the mountain of work you have to complete. He'll be missed at Davidson!
297,2039976,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boddery is awesome! He is a really clear professor. You know exactly what you will get with him, and his syllabus is very easy to follow. His lectures are always interesting, and he doesn't give out too much busy work, like other professors. He is a fair grader and an amazing professor. Definitely take his class if you have a chance."
298,2039976,5.0,4.0,Legal Analysis was one of my favorite and useful classes here at Davidson. While it required a ton of work it was really helpful to learn these skills for law school. He gives great feedback and is very open and accessible during office hours.
299,2039976,5.0,3.0,"POL 326 is a well organized class with weekly Bluebook exercises and legal writing assignments that give an idea of what to expect from law school. Dr. Boddery gives thorough, intelligent, insightful lectures. The amount of time he spent assisting me outside of the classroom was tremendous. He is always willing to answer questions, great guy!"
300,2039976,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Boddery is an excellent professor. The amount of work can be daunting at first, but expectations are clear and grading is very fair. He makes himself available outside of class and quickly responds to questions over email. Dr. Boddery also gives great advice about law school, so those thinking of applying should definitely take Legal Analysis."
301,2039976,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Boddery is a fantastic professor. His assignments are clear, his lectures are engaging, and he truly cares about helping students improve their performance in his class throughout the semester. There was a fair amount of work to do out of class, but the assignments were all geared towards preparing you for law school."
302,2039976,4.5,4.0,"Very intelligent and relaxed guy. He is very knowledgeable and leads a class that relies on class participation, however he asks extremely insightful questions and seems prepared for class. Kinda helpful in office hours, but sometimes email responses are actually better. The tests were fairly challenging, and the briefs were graded harshly."
303,2039976,5.0,3.0,"I have had 3 different classes with Dr. Boddery and each has been unique but equally rewarding. Do the reading, participate often, and go to office hours and you will be fine. Dr. Boddery is very helpful outside of class and wants you to do well. Class sessions are engaging and he facilitates group discussion so the lectures do not become dull."
304,2039976,5.0,2.0,"I've taken three classes with Boddery and have loved all of them. His classes will by far be the most beneficial  to me after graduation. He is extremely helpful in office hours, extremely organized, and gives reasonable assignments, but makes you work hard and learn a lot. He is really helpful with career advice, and wants you to do well."
305,2039976,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Boddery is easily the best professor in the department. Super clear about what he expects, and does assign a lot of work, but if you do the work he won't destroy your GPA. Legal research and writing was by far the most useful and beneficial class I took at Davidson. Plus, Dr. Boddery is really helpful, even with non-academic stuff."
306,2039976,5.0,3.0,Dr. Boddery is a great professor and did a great job in this class of making challenging material understandable. He is a fair grader and always open to helping students out outside of class. Easily one of the best classes I have ever taken at Davidson
307,2039976,5.0,3.0,Dr. Boddery is a terrific professor and taking his legal writing class was one of the best choices I have made at Davidson. His classes are interesting and engaging and he does a great job connecting class to real-world events. He sets high expectations for his students but always makes himself available to help them do their best. Take his class!
308,2039976,5.0,3.0,"Could not have been more pleased with this class. No doubt it was complicated and tough material, but I genuinely feel much more prepared about what to expect if I decide to go to law school. If I don't, I still learned so much! The best professor I have had in college without a doubt. Always kind, always helpful."
309,2039976,5.0,3.0,"Legal Writing was by far the most useful and interesting class I took at Davidson in my 4 years. Learning how to write legal briefs was difficult, but Professor Boddery made it manageable and was always willing to provide help and clarity. Also, learning how to use the Bluebook in this class was helpful in getting my first job. Highly recommended!"
310,2039976,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boddery has everything I would want to have in a professor--he's demanding, he's clear, he makes the material relatable and compelling, and he is very understanding of his students. He really takes the intimidation factor out of his law classes. I wish i could take him again!"
311,2039976,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boddery has everything I would want to have in a professor--he's demanding, he's clear, he makes the material relatable and compelling, and he is very understanding of his students. He really takes the intimidation factor out of his law classes. I'm excited for his future in teaching!"
312,2039976,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boddery's class is one of the best, most practical classes I've taken in that it teaches you real skills that will give you a leg up on law school and a legal career. His lectures were well-planned, informative, and engaging.  The skills he taught in this class helped me get my first job. One of the best professors I've had!"
313,2039976,4.5,3.0,Dr. Boddery's class was good.  His class is a great one to take while still in undergrad because it gives some indication of what law actually entails.  I appreciated having a class where the expectations for papers were made extremely clear.  Sometimes it is absurdly difficult to 'guess-timate' what a professor wants.  Boddery was very clear.
314,2039976,4.5,3.0,"B's goal is to give you a much clearer understanding of the legal profession, and I believe he succeeds. He will teach you a skill, so the onus is on you to make progress throughout the semester. If you are an undergrad even slightly interest in law, take his courses. You won't regret it."
315,2039976,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Boddery is a really great professor. His class is extremely organized, filled with a good balance of lectures and written assignments. All graded assignments are explained thoroughly, so you know what to expect. He is always available for help, and truly wants his students to succeed. His lectures are both informational and interesting."
316,2039976,4.5,3.0,"When he tells you the semester will be front-loaded, BELIEVE HIM! There is a lot of reading and writing required and it will be confusing at times, but he is often available to pester. This class takes dedication and energy, but I honestly believe it is a true representation of how class in law school will be. It's better to know now then later."
317,2039976,3.5,3.0,"Not a bad guy. Office hours are pretty general, and he isn't great at answering specific questions but will give you vague advice for assignments. Class lectures are good; he describes information succinctly and expects you to participate. The assignments aren't terribly long or demanding, but they are sometimes graded harshly. Tests are doable."
318,2039976,4.0,4.0,"Wow, super tough grader that assigns a whole lot of reading. He makes you turn in brief summaries every week, and I got a C- on the first one even though he said it was good in office hours. Reading each night takes a couple hours. He is fairly helpful but doesn't offer much advice. Knowledgeable and clear during class, expects participation."
319,2039976,4.0,4.0,"He really knows the topics and expects you to participate. The readings can be long, but they are pretty cool.  He's always available for questions too."
320,2039976,4.0,2.0,"Boddery's class was a breeze for me. Admittedly, I knew a good amount the subject before the class began, but his grading is very generous. He's a nice guy and always willing to meet. His assignments are pretty long, but you'll learn pretty quickly which readings you can skim. Overall, I really enjoyed his class."
321,2039976,4.5,2.0,"I enjoyed Dr. Boddery's class because he lectures well and generally keeps the class interactive and the material engaging. I would take him again because his class was interesting and as long as you attend class, answer questions, and study the material he gives you, you will do fine. Grading wise he was fair and provides extra credit if needed."
322,2039976,5.0,2.0,Good amount of reading but not a ridiculous amount. Participation and attendance definitely matter. Good lectures and makes class as fun as it can be. lets out early because he is very prepared and gets through his lectures. I would definitely take again.
323,2039976,5.0,2.0," I would recommend Professor Boddery because he is organized, gives clear expectations and engages his students.  He effectively conveys the material clearly, and is very approachable if additional help is needed. "
324,2039976,5.0,2.0,Dr. Boddery is a very engaging professor whose passion rubs off on his students. Everyone is required to participate in class but it really helps everyone learn by hearing their classmates speak and being forced to so often think for ourselves. Dr. Boddery also manages to throw in a bit of humor for all of his lectures.
325,2039976,4.5,2.0,Dr. Boddery did an excellent job of teaching Con Law. The course covered hundreds of cases and he did a good job of presenting the most important themes and aspects of case law in a clear and concise manner. My only compliant is that class was often let out ten minutes early and it would have been based to use that time with more lecture
326,2039976,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Boddery is by far one of the best professors I have had at Davidson. His lectures are always engaging and interesting, but you will get called out if you don't know/haven't done the reading. The weekly case briefs helped a lot to understand the material. ALWAYS willing to help outside of class. A shame Davidson isn't hiring him for next year."
327,2039976,5.0,4.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed taking Professor Boddery's class this semester! The material was tough, but the class was organized in a manner that made it understandable. Each class proved to be both informative and interesting, where you felt comfortable participating and thinking independently. Extra help was also always helpful and available! "
328,2039976,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Boddery is great.  His lectures are very clear and he posts slides online. Class was interesting, and he frequently asked for student opinions. Workload was manageable, and I was encouraged to understand, rather than simply memorize. Grading is very fair. I would highly recommend him to anybody, particularly if you're interested in law"
329,2039976,5.0,4.0,"Taking ConLaw with Dr. Boddery was a great decision! He is extremely knowledgeable about the material and the legal field in general, which made all of his lectures enjoyable. He sets high expectations for his students  but is more than willing to help them reach those standards and do whatever he can to help them succeed. Helpful, tough, inspiring"
330,2039976,4.5,3.0,Constantly engaged the class in discussion and was always available for help. Boddery makes sure you know your stuff and will ensure you know how to apply the information as well.
331,2039976,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Boddery is fantastic. He is a very nice guy and does a great job of making lectures very interesting. His attendance policy is strict, and participation is key, but if you go to class prepared you will be fine. His tests are very fair. He is always accessible through office hours and by email if you need him. I absolutely recommend him. "
332,2039976,5.0,4.0,Dr. Boddery is great. He's very straight forward with his lectures and what he expects from you in terms of tests and assignments. He also brought us cookies once :)
333,2039976,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Boddery does a great job at clarifying the huge amount of material in Con Law. His lectures are fast-paced, but he covers all the relevant material very effectively and is helpful outside of class if needed. It's worth noting that he heavily emphasizes class participation, so definitely come prepared to discuss and analyze the reading. "
334,2039976,4.5,3.0,"He set this class up to simulate an actual course you'd take in law school, which I thought was not only cool but also really valuable for me as a student who is highly considering law school. We covered a huge amount of material and he moves quickly, but he is an extremely fair professor and I signed up for two more classes with him."
335,2039976,4.5,3.0,"Professor Boddery is an engaging lecturer who made all of the information incredibly accessible and easy to understand. It is important to go to class and be engaged but if you are this class will be one of your favorites at Davidson. The tests are fair and if you have done the reading and attended class you will do well, he is not out to trick you"
336,2039976,5.0,4.0,Dr. Boddery was probably the best professor I've had at Davidson. The class was one that required you to do the readings but Dr. Boddery did a great job of clarifying and explaining in the next class. He was always available outside of class as well.  Not a tough grader but you do have to try and put in effort. Dr. Boddery was also very personable.
337,2039976,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Boddery is a great professor. He is a funny, engaging, and smart professor who really wants his students to do well. His lectures are interesting and it is clear he really knows the material he's teaching. His lectures always provided clarity to dense textbook reading. I would highly reccomend taking his Constitutional Law class! "
338,2293935,5.0,5.0,She is a difficult teacher but will teach you the material and wants you to succeed if you put in the effort. You have to go to office hours and put in the time to study.
339,2293935,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Jha is my least favorite professor at Davidson. While she is knowledgable and smart, she is a horrible teacher. She clearly gives her favorite students in the class preferential treatment while trying to humiliate those she doesn't like. She's lazy, unprofessional, extremely rude, and unreasonable. Look at old tests to get an A."
340,2293935,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Jha is a very difficult grader, impassioned speaker, and, I cannot overstate this, a difficult grader. Despite the knock to my GPA, I would not hesitate to take her class again. I have met very few professors who are as passionate about their subject as Dr. Jha is. She may kick your ass but, by god, you will learn macro. Especially Keynes."
341,2293935,1.0,4.0,"The worst professor I have encountered at Davidson. DO NOT take her class if you can help it. She's volatile and rude, though the class isn't THAT hard if you understand econ."
342,2293935,4.0,3.0,"Pros: Great course content and class discussions. Dr. Jha is knowledgeable and intelligent and wants you to succeed Cons: Her expectations and engagement could be lacking. The only graded content we got back from her (instead of a TA) before the semester ended was an exam, which she returned almost two months after we had taken it"
343,2293935,2.0,4.0,"She doesn't grade anything in a timely manner. She comes to class completely unprepared, rarely gives any explanation of guidelines, and some days is merely scanning through the textbook in class She goes on long tirades of vulgarity which she thinks is poignant. She answers phone calls in class and comes late because she's smoking cigarettes."
344,2293935,2.0,4.0,"She is super unorganized, and at times extremely vulgar. She is passionate about economics, but her passion seems to cloud her ability to teach the material properly."
345,2293935,1.0,4.0,"I don't understand this new influx of positive reviews for Dr. Jha. She's intelligent and caring, but plays favorites, is a sporadic grader, and comes to class so often that students can't help but recognize that her class is not a high priority to her. Taking her compounds the difficulty of any ordinary class. Avoid."
346,2293935,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Jha had a rough start at Davidson, but she has really picked up her game. She genuinely cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Grades may be rough but she finds ways to help bump you up. I absolutely love her, she is so smart and knows so much about Macroeconomics and will make you fall in love with the subject too."
347,2293935,5.0,3.0,"Great class. Very interesting subject area and not too difficult, especially if you've taken Macro Development."
348,2293935,3.0,2.0,"Huge potential to become leading professor in department once organization increases and daily class structure tightens up. Passionate about economics, solving world problems, and educating youth to have meaningful careers in life. Tests were straightforward, and Dr. Jha helped students prepare to the maximum extent. Must speak in class."
349,2293935,5.0,3.0,Dr Jha's macro class is a great one and she is an inspirational professor. I had her for both semesters of her first year here and can say that class became a lot more organized and assignments were returned much quicker in the spring.
350,2293935,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Jha is a really sincere professor and very honest, which is quite refreshing. She is also a really difficult professor in terms of workload as she assigns a problem set every week and gives 4-5 tests during the semester. The workload is definitely a bear but she does try to be accessible and grade leniently on tests."
351,2293935,2.0,4.0,She seems to care and really love economics. Her course was quite disorganized and items on tests were often a surprise. Would have preferred a teacher who presented their expectations more clearly and made it clear what should be known and prioritized for tests.
352,2293935,5.0,3.0,"Jha is a new professor that loves what she does. Although you can tell she loves her students, she's a little unorganized. That can improve though."
353,2293935,5.0,3.0,Jaya Jha commands nothing but the best from you! She helped me become a better student. She is a real master at economics and makes you fall in live with the subject.. She forces you to truly learn the concepts through active engagement and challenging yet friendly questions!
354,2293935,5.0,4.0,Jaya Jha is a very articulate and damn well read professor. She explains the toughest concepts in the easiest ways. She is a little tough with grades but learning in her class is amazing.
355,2293935,2.0,4.0,"Good person and passionate about Economics, but teaching isnt her thing."
356,2293935,1.0,1.0,"Dr. Jha was the worst professor I had ever taken at Davidson. She is very disorganized, unprofessional, and unreliable. She came to class late probably every single Monday of the school year. Her lack of professionalism resulted the terrible grade of her students. Don't ever take her class even if you have to"
357,2293935,1.0,5.0,Dr. Jha is a nice person and good lecturer. Completely disorganized. Came late to class A LOT. Waited up to 45 minutes for her to show up for office hours... and thats if she did end up arriving. Did not give graded assignments back in a timely manner. Final grade was a complete shocker. Horrible experience.
358,2293935,1.0,4.0,"Great personality, nice person. But completely inaccessible outside of class, skips her own office hours, frequently skips/cancels class. Lectures are disorganized, and direction and expectations on exams and assignments are often very unclear. I didn't get a single grade back the whole semester; my final grade was a complete surprise."
359,2293935,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Jha was all over the place. Lectures were good, notes were good. She was disorganized and came to class late probably 8 times. The overall structure of the course was a little confusing, topics were hit twice. Tests weren't too bad, some unexpected aspects we weren't prepared for, but its macro. Deal with it."
360,2293935,3.0,2.0,"It's her first year here, so all of this could very well change. She was very disorganized and pretty terrible about handing back the few assignments we had. That said, she is a solid economics professor. The department needs someone like her who is outspoken and tells it how it is. Also the class ended up being an easy A so all in all it was chill"
361,2232495,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sainte Claire was one of the most fair, kind, and passionate teachers I've ever had. The class was very organized and well structured, and was not too demanding. I felt like I learned a lot and enjoyed my time in class."
362,2232495,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Sainte-Claire is the cutest human being on the planet--super sweet and caring. If you put a little bit of effort into her class, you will do just fine. She assigns a good bit of reading, but skim it the night before and you'll be okay. Lectures can be a little dry, but they're very straight-forward and she does her best to mix things up."
363,2232495,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Sainte-Claire was kind, but taught straight from the book.  I kind of wish she expanded a little bit outside of it.  I think her tests were also a bit too easy."
364,2631868,1.0,4.0,"I am so lost in this class. He is the worst professor I've ever had. His lectures are him reading off the slides quickly, then moving on. There are no guidelines on any assignments and he assumes we already know everything about microbio. We cover about 6 new chapters while trying to study old material for an exam. DO NOT TAKE! nice man, awful prof"
365,2035915,5.0,5.0,"Great professor. LOTS of reading (from someone who loves reading). Toughest grader I've had so far (from someone who hasn't gotten a B yet). So worth it though! He is incredibly knowledgeable and you will learn a lot, especially if you participate (which he expects). Take as many notes in lecture as possible. Study hard for the reviews and essays!"
366,2035915,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Ceka was great! TAKE NOTES during his lectures. The powerpoints occasionally are really helpful but for the most part what he's saying is what you need to know. We had three reviews-- the second and third were take-home and open-note. It's definitely possible to get an A, but you'll have to put in some work. "
367,2035915,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ceka was awesome. He uses slides a lot and is very lecture heavy. He will certainly learn your name if you participate, but be wary of making your participation worthwhile. It's a LOT of reading (as most Poly Sci classes are), but they're pretty much all relevant and worth your time. Overall, really loved Dr. Ceka's class!"
368,2035915,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ceka is one of Davidson's best professors. I have taken three of his courses and plan to take a fourth or fifth. He is a brilliant lecturer and is very thoughtful about every aspect of his courses. You have to put in effort in his classes to do well though. It's not an easy A, but it is manageable. He is very clear on expectations."
369,2035915,5.0,4.0,Dr. Ceka is one of the best professors I've ever had. He is incredibly knowledgeable and is excellent at teaching (a lot of smart people aren't). His Russian/East Euro Politics course has been one of my favorite classes at uni.
370,2035915,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ceka is one of the best professors I've ever had. I can't recommend him more highly. The work he assigns is challenging, but by no means overwhelming. It's composed mostly of readings and papers. Great for both experienced and new political science students."
371,2035915,4.0,4.0,"An absolutely wonderful professor, when lecturing he really draws you in and makes the subject enjoyable. Although, it can be difficult to take notes and study for tests because of his heavy reliance on readings and discussion"
372,2035915,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ceka is the best professor I've had at Davidson. He makes you work hard and earn your grade, but you'll learn more in his class than most other professors. He's inspirational, caring, and if you pay attention, he offers amazing opportunities. One of Davidson's gems."
373,2035915,4.0,3.0,"Very invested in his students and Davidson as a whole. He only really knows the names of the people who speak in class... so participate if you want his respect. Quite a bit of textbook reading, but the material is interesting. Take notes on his lectures!"
374,2035915,5.0,3.0,Ceka is such a great professor. His lectures are very interesting and IR was one of the best classes I've ever taken. There's a bit of reading but it's all interesting. He makes the class very relatable to current events and makes you want to learn. The only bad side is that it's hard to get anything above a B because of his grading. But take him!
375,2035915,5.0,3.0,"Everything in this course including the lectures, the slides, the readings was phenomenal. Overall it was probably one of the best taught classes I have ever taken. Ceka is also an amazing professor and I cant wait to take a course with him next spring because he is so engaging. "
376,2762955,5.0,4.0,"This class is an excellent introduction to the world of digital art using the Adobe Creative suite. It also provides a foundation for art and design theory, which makes it accessible to artists of all levels. Much of the software is taught via homework assignments instead of in class, which may be challenging depending on your learning style."
377,2762955,4.0,3.0,"Interesting readings for homework and projects were very open-ended. V accessible for feedback. Resources used to learn adobe apps were sorta unhelpful and it's a self-taught type of class. While she does have demos she occasionally teaches in class, a lot of it is learned on your own and you learn through critiques and advice from classmates"
378,653515,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ewington is not an easy professor, but she is one of the most caring professors I have ever had. She makes you work for it, but is very devoted to all of her students. Highly recommended professor for anyone excited about learning."
379,653515,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Ewington is an excellent teacher and in turn expects those in her class to be excellent students. Its not impossible to get a good grade, but you have to really work for it. The homework she assigns can be a bit much, but its very helpful in preparing for the unit tests."
380,653515,5.0,4.0,"If you're interested at all in Russian, Russian literature, culture, etc, take Ewington. She's excited about the material and engages you with the material. Prepare for lots of reading if you're taking a literature class but know that it's manageable. Wonderful professor who is really caring and respected."
381,653515,5.0,4.0,"If you are serious about learning a language at Davidson, then Russian is the best choice. Each class Dr. Ewington taught was packed with new material. She expected a lot from each student and was prepared to help us exceed her expectations. The weekly oral exam, which sounds stressful, was life saving when a I went to Russia in the summer."
382,653515,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ewington is a knowledgable professor who wants you to succeed. The language classes I have had with her have been engaging, relevant, and very instructive. Russian is a difficult language, but if you are motivated, and put a good amount of effort into the daily homework (something I wish I did better at), you will be positioned to succeed."
383,653515,5.0,3.0,"Above all else, Dr. Ewington is passionate. If you take her classes seriously and demonstrate even the tiniest bit of enthusiasm, you will do well and enjoy your experience. Beyond that, you'll have learned quite a bit of Russian. If you're interested in learning a language at Davidson, take her classes."
384,653515,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Ewington is very passionate about what she teaches. She loves seeing her students become interested not only in the Russian language, but in Russian culture as well. However, she assigns quite a lot of homework compared to other language classes. Be prepared to work hard for a good grade in her class. Her office hours are not the most flexible."
385,653515,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ewington is easily the best language teacher I have ever had (and I have had 6). She knows her stuff and makes Russian so much easier to learn than it should be. There is a lot of homework, but if you pay attention in class you don't have too much to worry about."
386,653515,4.0,4.0,Take RUS 101 for your foreign language requirement! It can be intimidating but Russian is very desirable. It's an intense class but you learn so much very quickly. Dr. Ewington is happy to meet in office hours to help and provides pen casts in English to help you understand material. Davidson's Russian department is great.
387,653515,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Ewington's classes are rigorous but are worth taking. Her lectures are helpful and she is very fair with marking. She's also understanding as long as you talk to her about any issues. Very productive discussions in her lectures and she sets thoughtful assignments. Be prepared to read but she rarely sets ""busy work"". Very enthusiastic professor!"
388,653515,3.5,4.0,"This class is not easy; however, it does really prepare you for writing in college. Ewington truly cares about her students' success. This said, the readings were often dull (ex: 18th century Russian travel writing) and didn't pertain to current events nearly as much as I would have liked. She expects a lot, so GO TO OFFICE HOURS."
389,653515,3.0,4.0,"Not the best class to take if your wishing to fulfill your WRI 101. She is extremely passionate about Russia, kinda crazy actually. The class is tough and she actually wants you to make conclusions about Russian culture which you do not know about - if you are like me. I don't recommend taking this is you don't love russia. "
390,653515,5.0,3.0,"Choosing to study Russian was one of the best decisions I made during my time at Davidson. The courses are fast paced, but you will always receive enough attention and help with any difficulties that you come across. As long as you put in adequate effort and keep up with the work, you will be successful."
391,653515,3.5,3.0,Once you start to learn the language you realize there is a structure to it all. Dr. Ewington does move along pretty quickly but she is more than willing to talk to you and help you practice. Office hours were extremely helpful and if you don't understand the first time she will try until you do. Don't skip out on the work and you'll do just fine.
392,653515,4.5,3.0,"If you want to differentiate yourself from every other post-grad applicant take Russian. Everyone knows Spanish or French, and Arabic is very colloquial. Russia will remain an economic and political interest. And RUS 101 is a great place to start. It is not a very easy language, but Dr. Ewington is great and always available to help or review!"
393,653515,5.0,2.0,"Ewington was very efficient and organized, and since russian is such a small department, you'll always have a small class. everything is directly by the book, which is small and pretty easy to follow. HW is mostly online, tests cover exactly the chapter material. Great language to take @ Davidson!"
394,653515,2.5,4.0,Grades ridiculously hard. Most of assigned reading is completely unrelated to writing assignments and lectures/class discussions are rarely helpful. You have to go to her office hours to actually learn writing and even then she isn't always clear.
395,653515,4.0,3.0,"Russian is a difficult language to learn, and Ewington will move at a fast pace, so  if you fall behind it can be hard to keep up. That said, she really loves the language and is more than willing to give help if you need it. By no means an easy course, but if you work at it, it will pay off. I also appreciated her input on my study abroad plans."
396,653515,4.5,3.0,Challenging but rewarding
397,653515,3.0,5.0,"Very tough class. Boring and difficult to be open minded. Unless your in love with Russian, which she very much is, not worth taking. She grades you like seniors majoring in Russian. I recommend not taking this class, she is an awful teacher."
398,653515,3.0,4.0,Grades WAY to hard for writing 101. The class is boring and the material is boring. She is very passionate about Russia though.
399,653515,3.0,4.0,"Definitely a tough class, and while she does play favorites a little, all you have to do to get on her good side is work hard. Really helpful during office hours, and going to talk to her can make or break you in the class."
400,653515,3.5,4.0,"She assigns a lot of reading and her favorite &quot;difficult&quot; essays to write. While I definitely think she is helpful in office hours, classes have sometimes been unclear to me (especially at 9:30 AM). While I learned a lot, I should have chosen an easier writing class I was more interested in."
401,653515,4.5,4.0,AMAZING professor! She is extremely dedicated to helping students improve their writing. She puts in a lot of time to give students the tailored advice and guidance that makes the Davidson W experience so valuable.  She is a difficult grader but  she rewards students for hard work and personal improvements.Her enthusiasm for Russia is contagious
402,653515,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Ewington has high standards and high expectations, but she is very fair.  She extremely enthusiastic about her job and loves teaching.  She has frequent office hours and is abundantly helpful."
403,653515,3.5,4.0,"Professor Ewington is incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about her subject - sometimes frighteningly so. I have often felt attacked by her when trying to make a point. Speak up, go to her office hours, and quickly earn her respect in the class. It pays off in better grades. But make any points succinct and fail-safe, or she'll tear it apart."
404,653515,5.0,4.0,Her lit classes are so worth it - you learn so much and really grow in the class.  Great teacher.
405,653515,2.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS (Russia and the west) as your W course.  Way too much unnecessary reading and a ton of papers.  There are easier, more interesting W courses out there.  Class is a complete bore."
406,653515,5.0,4.0,Awesome prof!!  Hard grader but always fair - provides LOTS of feedback so you know what to do next time.
407,653515,5.0,4.0,Excellent professor.  She's fabulous outside of class.  Her classes are difficult but well worth the effort.
408,653515,4.0,2.0,"I loved this class (Russian Women Writers). She is insightful, intelligent, energetic, really made it fun. A TON of reading though. I got behind by the end of the semester. I don't know how she is in the real Russian classes, but her W course was well worth it!"
409,653515,1.0,5.0,"WORST CLASS EVER!!!!!!! if you don't want your gpa to completely suffer than DO NOT take this aweful class! she is quite possibly the worst professor EVER, and never listens to anyone-don't bother giving an opinion because if the rare opportunity for you to speak in class arises, she will just tear you down for anything against her love of the lit."
410,653515,2.5,3.0,"the at sessions are WAY more helpful than class, and she doesn't provide much feedback for ways to improve."
411,653515,4.5,3.0,"Professor Ewington is amazing! I absolutely love her class. It's SOOO much reading, but she's so nice and really passionate about Russia and Russian literature. And she provides great feedback on papers. I've learned so much about Russia in two months."
412,653515,1.5,5.0,HARD AS HELL SAVE YOUR GPA STAY AWAY
413,653515,1.0,4.0,By far the worst professor at Davidson.  Plays favorites.  Terrible lecturer.  Don't bother speaking unless you simply reiterate something she has already said and/or with which she has already agreed.
414,1962189,4.0,4.0,She's great!
415,2762959,2.0,5.0,"Not great at explaining, has a class structure where students have to teach themselves, does not understand that they make their courses way too hard and give too little time on tests, I do not recommend."
416,2762959,4.0,5.0,"Hardest class I've ever taken at Davidson. I liked the flip lecture style though where we watch videos for hw, then we did practice problems in class with classmates. Hardly any break throughout the semester and constantly learning topics, super tiring. 12 hrs of work outside of class per wk. Mastery grading. Good teacher though"
417,2332884,5.0,3.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed my experience w/ Dr. Lawless. Very friendly and passionate about medical ethics. Class is all readings and articles posted on Moodle, which he explains clearly. Must take notes based off his lecture and slides, which are not posted online. Participation is very important, a definite requirement if you're looking for an A."
418,2332884,5.0,2.0,African American Political Philosophy was a great class. Lawless gave clear and concise lectures that made the often dense class readings understandable. He gives great feedback on papers and assessments were very fair with no surprises. Take good notes and you will do very well in any class with him. Very fair grader as well. Highly recommended!
419,2332884,5.0,3.0,"Loved Professor Lawless! Some readings were long and tough, but his lectures really helped explain the material. He's a rather easy grader and gives good feedback on papers. The mid-term and final were very straight forward and as expected. If you have the chance, take his class"
420,2336981,5.0,3.0,I took WRI 101 with Blum and it was an amazing experience. His class was more of a discussion/reading based and he really makes it very interesting. Participating matters a lot so get ready to read and analyze the texts. The workload was very balanced and we only had 3 papers for the whole semester. His feedbacks are very helpful.
421,2336981,5.0,2.0,"I love Dr. Blum! He's really nice and is a fair grader. He gives good feedback on papers and his rubrics are clear. You definitely have to participate in class, but it's not hard as the content is pretty interesting. He also gives you 2 weeks between when the outline vs final paper is due, which makes it easy to stay on top of the work. "
422,2336981,5.0,3.0,"Professor Blum is great! I took Religion and Violence for my WRI101 and class discussion was super interesting. I consider myself a good writer, so this class was not hard for me. You do have to post discussion questions each night for reading and if you are the discussion leader you have to write a 1-1.5 page discussion paper, but they'r not hard."
423,2336981,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Highly recommend for writing 101
424,2336981,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Blum's class is discussion-oriented, but he never tries to instill his personal opinions about the topic. He faciliates the discussion well, and when someone makes a statement that is a bit unclear, he restates it lucidly to make sure no one miscomprehends it. His thoughtful feedback reflects his caring personality, and the grade is reasonable."
425,2336981,5.0,3.0,"My favorite class I've taken thus far. The class is all discussion-based with a handful of papers for your grade. Blum is very good at mediating class discussions and letting you do the talking. If you have a talkative class, you will love this style. Blum can be sort of stingy when it comes to getting an A, but his class is great nevertheless."
426,2336981,1.0,4.0,"Dr Blum is the worst professor to take 101 with, the classes he provides seem interesting at first then they start to get boring, so I would suggest not taking his class. Plus, he does not give an A. If you can settle for a B, then you might like Dr. Blum."
427,2336981,5.0,2.0,"One of the best classes I've taken thus far. Reading assignments are manageable, interesting, and sometimes even entertaining (I busted out laughing several times while reading and often brought content up in outside conversations). Class is mostly discussion-based. Dr. Blum directs it very well, and also gives great feedback on papers."
428,2336981,5.0,3.0,"I took his WRI 101 class and found it extremely interesting. Blum is a great professor who obviously cares for his students. The class had a lot of reading, but it was manageable. I would highly recommend taking a class with Professor Blum."
429,2336981,2.0,5.0,Just don't take his writing class no matter how interesting the class sounds!
430,2336981,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Blum is great. He's funny, the readings are interesting, and the whole class is discussion based. He's never picks a side, only lets others talk and he mediates. He's genuinely interested in what you have to say, and he does a good job at making you see the correctness in both sides. He grades fairly, slightly tough, but not impossible at all."
431,2336981,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Blum is amazing. His Religion and Violence writing class was interesting and a huge help to my writing skills. He does an excellent job facilitating class discussions and is genuinely interested in students' opinions. Also, there's not just one style of writing he looks for; if you're a good writer, he grades you well."
432,2336981,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Blum is a gem. Religion in the Public Square was not at the top of my WebTree list, but I am so glad that I took his class. I learned a great deal about what it means to participate within the public sphere. His class is discussion style and very low stress so feel free to speak up! He also has an adorable dog that he keeps during office hours."
433,2336981,5.0,4.0,"Blum is fantastic - easily my favorite non-science professor. Leads engaging discussions, offers detailed feedback on essays, holds students to high standards without being a killer grader. Papers were long, but satisfying to write. Doesnt shy away from intense, hot-button issues, yet approaches them in a measured manner. Hope Davidson tenures him."
434,2336981,5.0,4.0,I took his religion and violence writing 101 and it was my favorite class my first semester! He is a great teacher and so helpful on feedback on essays. I 100% suggest his class.
435,2418902,2.0,4.0,Teaches in a very weird manner. No time for questions
436,622822,4.0,3.0,"All lecture based, tests are quite difficult but if you study well then you can excel. "
437,622822,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Kello is a super kind person and takes an interest in his students. His class is mostly all lecture and can get a little bit boring, but it is clear he is passionate about the field. The tests and quizzes are difficult, but he is generous with curving and offers extra credit. You really do have to read the textbook to grasp all the material."
438,622822,4.0,3.0,"Professor Kello is a great man and super passionate about psychology, but the class is all lecture and kinda boring. He goes kinda fast, so for a deeper understanding play close attention to the textbook. Tests are kinda hard. He expects thorough answers on the short-answer questions, but doesn't really clearly ask what he's looking for."
439,622822,3.0,4.0,"A good guy with relatively interesting lectures, but his tests are tough. Lots of material you need to know for them. That said, he holds plenty of review and help sessions and has extra-credit opportunities."
440,622822,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Kello is my favorite professor at Davidson. He's extremely knowledgeable about IO/OD and psychology in general. He's a tough grader, but he's also very fair. You will get the grade that you work for."
441,622822,2.0,4.0,"The class was excessively difficult, exorbitant amounts of material that were covered in extremely dull lectures. He doesn't learn the names of his students and he was aloof and fairly unavailable outside of class. Entirety of grade was based upon two tests. He did offer extra credit."
442,622822,3.0,4.0,"The class was based on lectures that repeated what the textbook said. The hardest part of the class was the amount of content, but with only two tests the entire semester, he made it hard to master and retain. Not really available outside of class but did offer extra credit."
443,622822,5.0,4.0,"Really great course. Dr. Kello was an impressive professor, his lectures were interesting, clear and I learned a lot of information thats helpful in everyday life. His tests were challenging and you definitely had to spend time with the textbook to succeed. It was a lot of information to memorize but I learned so much about psych."
444,622822,3.5,3.0,"The class was fine, lecture was interesting and he's a funny guy. But you could completely skip all the lectures, just read the textbook and still get a decent grade. Lectures and review sessions are totally pointless. also the reviews are pretty easy once you figure out his multiple choice question have similar 4 answers, just reworded."
445,622822,5.0,2.0,"Kello is the man. Fascinating material, impeccable lectures and study guides for the tests. Offered rare extra credit."
446,622822,5.0,3.0,"I think he tells the same jokes every year, but he's really funny and so easy to get along with. His lectures follow the book/test material exactly, so take good notes and you'll never have to read."
447,622822,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Kello is a really great professor. Don't take psych 101 expecting an easy grade; its a tough course no matter who your professor is. But Kello is great, fair grader, all mc tests, pretty funny, extremely willing to meet outside of class and do anything he can to help. gives us a nice break halfway thru class. only 3 tests all year though"
448,622822,5.0,2.0,"He can get off on tangents, and can be a little dry.  But a simply brilliant guy, really knows his stuff, and generally pretty funny too, in that industrial-psychologist kind of way."
449,622822,2.5,3.0,"He's funny, however, that doesn't keep me from falling asleep in every class."
450,622822,5.0,3.0,"Cool guy, very dry.  Really knows his stuff, and brought in some great guests over the course of the semester.  Fair about grades and all."
451,622822,5.0,3.0,"His class is reasonably hard, although very fair.  It's just very detailed and covers a very wide range of topics.  I really enjoyed Kello...he has a great sense of humor!"
452,622822,4.5,3.0,"Amazing!  His dry sense of humor and *extremely* in depth knowledge of psych (not just I/O, his specialty), made his one of the best classes I've taken here.  If you get a chance, take a class with him.  Lots of reading, but doable."
453,2080998,3.0,3.0,"She is a very nice person, yet her lectures are kind of dry. Yet, it was online when I had it so that could be part of an issue. Follow any rubric she gives you. Don't make the mistake of 601 words, when the paper should be 600. Also, read. READ your textbook. Every paragraph in the chapter is necessary to do well on her tests."
454,2080998,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sockol is great! Her class is very organized, and lectures are clear and easy to follow. She always uses clear examples and gives us time to ask questions before changing topics. She is a tough grader, but isnt any harder than your typical Davidson Professor."
455,2080998,1.0,4.0,Sockol made easy topics hard through unnecessary grading strategies. The tests were clearly made to trick students because it was the only way to make any sort of curve in the class. The material on its own was fascinating but I found her grading made the class less about learning and more about grading.
456,2080998,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sockol runs her class in an organized and clear way. She gives ample explanation of her expectations, so maybe something has changed since the previous reviews. Every assignment is given out with an example of what it should look like. Dr. Sockol is very intelligent and always willing to help her students however she can, in class and beyond."
457,2080998,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Sockol's is very clear and fair. We usually cover a set of disorders each week, and lectures outline everything we need to know about symptoms, prevalence, treatment, etc. Tests accurately cover what we learn in class. The final project was reading a novel as a case study and presenting our diagnosis and treatment in a group."
458,2080998,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Sockol is one of my favorite professors at Davidson. Her lectures are always engaging, and she has lots of background in the field which makes for great anecdotes. Her tests are hard and take some getting used to; talking to her during office hours makes all the difference. She also is great to talk to about your professional goals."
459,2080998,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Sockol has unreasonable expectations. I worked very hard in the class and went often to talk about studying strategies. The material isn't difficult, but tests are confusing and never accurately reflected my knowledge of material. The weighting of tests are disproportional to other work done in the class. I would never take her again."
460,2080998,3.0,4.0,"So much material for this class, it's all about memory. Lots of assignments and midterms. Extra credit opportunities but expects a lot for them. Seriously do not skip class, she does not include everything on her slides so you will miss out unless you find someone else's notes."
461,2080998,1.5,4.0,"The material is not hard to comprehend but her test questions are unclear and she is unreasonable about giving credit back. She is extremely inflexible about logistical issues (not being able to attend extra credit screenings, rescheduling tests, etc.) and she does not understand the Davidson culture."
462,2080998,2.0,5.0,"Truly unpleasant experience: material was not challenging, but sheer degree of work was unreasonable. Ran like 200 lvl lecture, seminar, and experiment. Disproportionate weighting: poster+presentation+peer review5% participation+responses40%. Grading was arbitrary, poorly explained, and not given back. Inflexible and unaccommodating for students"
463,2080998,2.5,4.0,"Take this if you're serious about psych. Be ready to do a LOT of work outside of class (seriously).  The work is rewarding & exciting. Go to office hours. If you don't, you will likely not perform well. You learn the most from this course outside lecture. Dr. Sockol is very well connected & bright, but sometimes forgets we aren't graduate students."
464,2080998,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Sockol is incredibly smart and knows what she is talking about, but her expectations are incredibly high and at times it is unclear what those expectations are. To really understand, go in to office hours and talk to her (ask specific questions and do it often) so that you can get necessary feedback to do well. Time demands are unreasonable."
465,1233133,4.0,2.0,"Pettersen tried his best to make class fun. Participation is a really big part of your grade. He is also very understanding about late assignments, but not about missed classes."
466,1233133,4.0,4.0,"he rarely actually lectures.you learn out of the book.so just buy the book instead of wasting your time in the class.in his defence, when he does lecture, its really good"
467,1233133,5.0,2.0,"Super friendly and smart!  He knows his stuff and is extremely helpful if you go to him with questions.  Overall, his class was pretty easy; not too hard to pull out a good grade with him."
468,1233133,5.0,1.0,"Pettersen managed to keep our interest every class; his hands on activities and well thought out lectures rarely bored.  He consistently interspersed entertaining activities with grammar, so we actually learned the material.  He was easily approachable, very helpful, and a great, personable teacher.  I highly recommend his class. Thanks professor!"
469,1233133,4.0,2.0,"Young intelligent professor. He is very straightforward and very fair. His tests are exactly as they say and if you master the concepts the class is pretty easy. Its a shame the essays arent weighed heavier because of the effor they take. French is a hard language, but he makes it simpler. Highly recommend his class."
470,1233133,3.5,3.0,"Pettersen just finished his first semester teaching at Davidson.  He is young, funny, nice, helpful, articulate, and genuinely interested in the lives of his students.  Grades include workbook exercises, compositions, tests, and an oral and written final exam.  The class is highly focused on French films.  Take his course!"
471,622829,5.0,3.0,"This guy is the man. Fantastic teacher, hilarious, fair tests. Best teacher ever"
472,622829,4.0,3.0,This art class was boring and demanded memorization. He is a fair grader and gives extra credit and points back if you talk to him. The paper wasn't too bad. He livens up lectures by imitating the figures and describing the myths. Great teacher but average class.
473,622829,4.0,4.0,Great professor. Cares about students and strives to be available. Fair tests and fair grader. Sometimes lectures are boring or off topic but one of the best teachers here.
474,622829,4.5,4.0,I cannot say enough about this man. He is an incredible teacher and an inspiration.  He is the most humble genius I've ever met.  Go to his dig in Cyprus if you want an even more eye opening experience.  He is demanding but shows a deep and genuine concern for students and alumni.  Show him respect and he will undoubtedly treat you like family.
475,622829,4.5,4.0,"FANTASTIC professor. Don't take Greek Art and Architecture if it's not a subject that interests you, though. Requires a lot of tedious memorizing. That being said, Toumazou is extremely helpful, and he genuinely wants you to succeed. If you make an effort to improve, he'll help you get there! I can't speak highly enough of him."
476,622829,5.0,4.0,Dr. Toumazou is a boss. Incredible personality. Lectures were captivating and hmorous. Made me interested in Roman art. The material itself lends itself to a lot of memorization. A good class to satisfy the art requirement.
477,622829,4.5,4.0,"I've taken both his Greek and Roman Art and Architecture courses, both were fantastic. He is far more passionate about the Greek course and so the Roman ends up a little easier, but I would direct anyone to Toumazou. Amazing professor, very happy to talk at any point. Lots of fun in class."
478,622829,5.0,4.0,"I loved Toumazou. He was always enthusiastic to present whatever slides we were looking at that day. He really knows about every thing we looked at. The class was not difficult but your grade really does reflect how much effort you put in, if you study you will do well. He gives you the essay topics for the tests beforehand, which I loved."
479,622829,5.0,3.0,"Are there  any professors, anywhere that bring their subject matter to life like Dr. Toumazou&#63; He &quot;paints&quot; vivid pictures of very old subjects. You don't want to miss his lectures and you couldn't sleep thru them. His passion for his subject matter makes me wonder if Zorba was really a Greek&#63; Maybe he was from Cyprus after all."
480,622829,5.0,2.0,"Incredible professor.  Very funny (maybe that's just his accent), but very knowledgeable.  Easy to approach outside of class and willing to talk.  You can't say enough about him."
481,622829,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Great personality; he inspired me to pursue further study in Classics.Very funny guy, too. Take his class!"
482,622829,5.0,3.0,"What to say&#63;  He's amazing.  His vagaric tendencies make class really funny, and there's no doubt he knows what he's doing.  Single handedly keeps Philip Morris and Coca-Cola in business, and is a spectacular teacher to boot."
483,2377969,5.0,3.0,She's nice and cares about the students. There's some readings but not heavily emphasized during classes. Very interesting class and wide range of films. We're asked to analyse films deeply and write essays about them. Interesting essay prompts. Shares valuable insights and is very encouraging which helped me excel in/outside of class. 
484,2377969,5.0,3.0,"Dr. McCarthy was a great prof for 101 (Race on Film). She can seem kind of aloof but she's very thoughtful and cares about her students learning. Very Social-justice-oriented and wants her students thinking critically about their assumptions. The films are good for the most part, but the readings aren't that important. Definitely worth taking."
485,2377969,4.0,3.0,"This was a solid class. I learned a lot of German. It wasn't too challenging but neither was I bored. The tests were tricky, but she curved them."
486,1892599,5.0,2.0,"You must take a class at Davidson with Dr. Bowles. Not only is she extremely flexible, understanding, and more than fair, but she is also incredibly empowering and well-spoken. Her lectures are profound and the content we learn travels beyond the classroom. Highly recommend Dr. Bowles to anyone, no matter what subject you are majoring in."
487,1892599,4.0,4.0,"Dr Bowles is my favorite professor at Davidson so far. I have so much respect for her insightfulness. She is also extremely willing to help you outside of class in your personal life. Class was an enjoyable way to question your own worldview and learn about Anthro. I would 100% recommend. If you put in the effort, the takeaway will be worth it."
488,1892599,5.0,4.0,Dr. Bowles is one of the best professors at Davidson College. This semester she absolutely blew my mind. Class is hard but worth it.
489,1892599,2.0,3.0,I didn't enjoy my class experience. This was an elective for me but I could have chosen a different class in the department and learned more within anthropology. I just walk away with a depressed view on society.
490,1892599,2.5,4.0,"She is entertaining to have as a professor but assigns way too much reading and expects you to retain all of the information. She also is not very welcoming about office hours, explicitly telling us to not come to her with questions, which is something I really dislike. I personally would not take another class from her."
491,1892599,4.5,4.0,"Bowles is my favorite professor at Davidson. However, this is a seminar course and she not only expects you to read an exorbitant amount per class, but expects you to understand it as well. She is always available to help or talk, but if you don't put in the required work and participate, your grade will show it."
492,1892599,5.0,3.0,"Participation is key.  Lots of reading, that must be read carefully.  Weekly papers on them.   Bottom line: she keeps it real."
493,1892599,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bowles is awesome, she has a brilliant understanding of Anthropology and inspires and encourages creative thought and discussion in class. Actively participating in class and challenging yourself to apply learned concepts will speak for itself once you are tested on the material. I would highly suggest her courses!"
494,1892599,5.0,2.0,Really personable professor. She isn't afraid to shed light on issues of race and privilege even if it pushes students out of their comfort zone. You can tell she loves her field and it translates into how well she teaches this class. Very understanding and helpful during office hours. Great intro for anyone who might be interested in anthropology.
495,1892599,3.5,2.0,"Dr. Bowles' 101 course was somewhat interesting but bored me over time. I had her first class at Davidson, so her grading was generous, but I have heard she has made it more difficult with mid-terms and weekly reading quizzes. Be prepared to be called on if you don't participate. I went the whole semester without saying anything but still got a B."
496,1892599,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bowles is very engaging professor. She can get people out of their comfort zone and there is a quite bit of work in the class but if you work hard, you can do well. She is also very nice and interesting. She is someone you want to have."
497,1638652,5.0,4.0,"Hilarious, kind, knowledgable, and changed the way I think about the world around me. Hard to get an A in the class, but worth taking the B for the experience. "
498,1638652,5.0,3.0,"Taking a course with Dr. Zamir changed my life. Needless to say after an interaction with him, he is remarkably intelligent. He always engaged my questions and taught me the art of thinking better. His courses are powerful storytellers that can shake everything you knowget ready. Will probs still be talking about his courses when I'm 90 yrs old."
499,1638652,5.0,2.0,"Zamir is a great teacher but a better person. He was a professor I could get clear feedback on my classwork, but also could be honest with life questions. I plan on visiting him often during the rest of my time at Davidson, and taking some of his religion classes at electives. Go to office hours and you will do very well. Very fair grader."
500,1638652,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Zamir has a cult following of people who like to think they're really smart, probably because his classes are very often on really meta topics. He's a great man, and very intelligent although a bit jaded. Definitely take advantage of office hours to show him you care. He also takes feedback very well!"
501,1638652,5.0,2.0,"Best professor here. Illuminating, non-linear, engaging."
502,1638652,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Zamir is easily one of the best and nicest teachers at Davidson. It doesn't matter how interested you are in Islam, take one of his classes anyway. He is hilarious, passionate, and very very intelligent. Get this man tenure now!"
503,1638652,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Zamir has been by far one of my favorite professors here. Really knows his stuff, does a great job of articulating it, and is very helpful in office hours. Also just a very genuine person who really cares about his students."
504,1638652,4.5,3.0,Very interesting and likeable professor. Passionate about the material and engaging with the students. First time teaching Islamic Mysticism but clearly very knowledgable on the subject. Fair grader. Challenged the students without overwhelming us. Overall great experience.
505,1638652,4.5,4.0,"I think this class (Islamic Ethics) has been my favorite class thus far in my Davidson Career. Dr. Zamir is engaging, passionate, and approachable, but not a push over. As a class we engaged in challenging discussions related to the readings (of which there were many, but all of them interesting and and worth doing)."
506,1638652,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher, really knows his stuff, always prepared, easy to access, funny, and very helpful."
507,1638652,4.0,2.0,"Islamic Mysticism with Professor Zamir was one of my favorites classes at Davidson. As long as you keep up with the reading and attend the classes, youll be fine."
508,1638652,5.0,3.0,"Definitely one of the best professors here. He is very passionate. He know so much and conveys the information very well. Anytime I went to office hours he was extremely helpful. The class involves a pretty good amount of reading and the tests take a while to prepare for, but he is a fair grader."
509,1638652,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Zamir is one of the best professors I have ever had at Davidson. His enthusiasm for the class fosters an engaging environment, and he communicates even difficult material with ease. There's a good amount of reading, but tests and papers are always graded fairly. Take any one of his classes. You will learn so much and enjoy him as a teacher."
510,1638652,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Zamir is one of the best professors I've had at Davidson. His enthusiasm for the class fosters an engaging environment, and he communicates the material with ease. He assigns a good amount of reading, but his tests and papers are always graded fairly. Take any one of his classes. You'll definitely enjoy it and learn more than you anticipate."
511,1638652,4.0,3.0,"Professor Zamir is a smart and engaging professor. There is a decent amount of reading, but you go through it thoroughly in class, and you will learn a ton. All assignments are extremely fair. He's also super interesting as a professor, and is able to add a lot to the material."
512,1638652,4.0,3.0,"I loved Islamic Ethics with Zamir! My class had 12 so discussion was fun, and he really encouraged debate. I loved when we read Birgivi/older text on morals/ethics. He really wanted to engage us in the readings and to grapple with how/if muslims still apply some of these teachings. This being said DO YOUR READING. You'll get the most from the class"
513,1638652,4.5,3.0,"I loved Islamic Ethics with Zamir! He framed the course around discussion which was great in our class of 12 people. I enjoyed when we got into the nuances of religious doctrine/texts, because he really wanted us to examine if/how Muslims grapple with questions of ethics today. This being said DO YOUR READING. You'll get the most out of the class."
514,1638652,4.5,3.0,Dr. Zamir is very helpful and engaging.
515,1638652,4.5,3.0,"Zamir's class was by far my favorite from last semester. He is engaging and entertaining in class and his lectures complement the readings perfectly. His tests are fair and I learned a ton amount about Islam. Zamir definitely focuses on learning, rather than simply memorizing, information."
516,1638652,5.0,3.0,"Zamir is an awesome teacher.  His discussion-style class allows for great exploration of the material, his chosen readings cover the course very thoroughly, and he offers very clear insight to end the discussions.  If you do the readings, he will make sure to help answer any questions a student can have, and his added humor makes the experience fun"
517,1638652,4.0,3.0,I really enjoyed the class. I had almost no knowledge of Islam before I took the class and by the end I felt that I had learned a ton. He is really willing to help you learn if you make the effort. Discussion based class. Prepare before class and be ready to talk so you get the most out of every meeting.
518,1638652,4.5,3.0,"This was one of my favorite classes at Davidson. Professor Zamir clearly knows what he is talking about and cares about helping others understand. Learning all of the arabic words was definitely difficult. It was a great class, though, and I would recommend taking any class you can with Professor Zamir- overall just a great person and professor."
519,1638652,4.5,3.0,Sunni and Shiite Islam was a great class- Zamir is both a great lecturer/teacher and a great person- his passion for the subject is clear. I believe that his top priority in the class was to make students learn and enjoy the material- not just memorize it like busy-work. I learned a lot in the class and would recommend Zamir to anyone taking a REL.
520,1638652,5.0,3.0,"Hands down one of the best classes I've taken.  He is a great professor who does a fantastic job of making the class very interesting, clear, and informative.  I learned more about Islam than I could ever have imagined."
521,1638652,5.0,3.0,"Sunni and Shi'ite Islam was one of my favorite classes at Davidson. Zamir is funny and does a great job of explaining the material and readings in class. There are a lot of Arabic terms to learn, but he is very clear about what you need to know. He even gives a thorough study guide for the final and midterm. Not much written work; learned a lot."
522,1638652,4.5,3.0,"I really enjoyed Intro to Islam with Zamir. He did a great job introducing students to a topic that most of us had no background in. There is a fair amount of reading, and I recommend keeping up with it. However, it's usually very informative and interesting. Not an easy religion course by any means, but a great class."
523,2541825,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Tamagawa's lectures are very crucial to help you prepare for your exams, as she gives different examples and problems with clear explanations. The group activities are also very engaging and helpful to assess your current skills. The homework redos encourage you to go back to problems you missed the first time and strengthen your weaknesses."
524,2541825,5.0,3.0,"Best math professor I've had yet. Class has the same every day structure -- turn in homework, one-question quiz, then lecture. Does a great job at teaching math and breaks it down into easy and understandable concepts. Tests reflect lessons learned in class. Required a textbook but didn't really need it. Accessible outside of class for help. Cool!"
525,727298,5.0,2.0,"My favorite prof at Davidson. Incredibly intelligent man. Very accessible for office hours, but you have to make an appointment because he is usually booked. Really cares more about you enjoying the class and engaging in discussion rather than tests/papers. Very fair/easy grader on papers, and everything is take home."
526,727298,5.0,2.0,The bomb full stop
527,727298,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lustig is definitely my favorite professor at Davidson so far! His take-home tests are time consuming, but they always cover material that is well covered in the class and they are fairly graded."
528,727298,4.5,1.0,"Not necessary to read ahead of class, but it will aid you in discussion which he places a high priority on. Knows the topics very well and will help you if you need it. Grades easily as long as effort is shown."
529,727298,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Lustig is a good professor. The material was really dense at times, which made lectures a little boring, but that wasn't his fault. He values participation ALOT. We only had two tests and a final, all essay based. He's very good with extensions and wants everyone to understand the material. Boring, but would take again. "
530,727298,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Lustig is a really cool teacher. He's very helpful when discussing very deep topics. Also, he let our freshman writing class re-write our papers for class as many times as we needed so as to get a better grade. I would definitely take his class again."
531,727298,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lustig was amazing. Lectures were very interesting and he encouraged the whole class to participate. Lectures were more like a guided discussion than a boring one sided speech. Loved his class
532,727298,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Lustig's class is awesome because he is awesome.  He's an incredibly smart guy but he genuinely cares about his students and he's an incredibly fair grader.  If you show up to class, do the reading, and participate you can do well.  And you will enjoy the class while doing so.  One of the few Davidson classes you can say that about."
533,727298,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Lustig has been my favorite professor here at Davidson.  He is a truly brilliant man who presents controversial topics in an unbiased manner and leads fantastic class discussions.  He wants you to learn rather than just regurgitate and because of this does not place much emphasis on graded work.  Go to class, engage, and you won't be sorry"
534,727298,2.0,1.0,Nice guy but can go off on tangents rather than following the outline. Reading was a lot but the class was interesting and not too hard
535,727298,5.0,3.0,Dr. Lustig is a brilliant professor. Rel256 has been one of my favorite classes at Davidson. It is both interesting and useful and I recommend that all pre-med students take this class. Overall I would say that anyone thinking about taking this class should take it. You will be happy you did.
536,727298,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lustig is my favorite professor at Davidson.  He is incredibly brilliant and interesting to listen to.  I learn a new vocabulary word just about every class.  He is a very kind grader and always available.  Take his class if you get the opportunity!
537,727298,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lustig is easily my favorite teacher in the religion department. He is brilliant and truly cares about his students. I suggest taking as many classes with Dr. Lustig as possible.
538,727298,5.0,2.0,"I took an independent study with Lustig on C.S. Lewis and it was fantastic. After we figured out a syllabus, he was very flexible with our schedules. If you can take an independent study, do it. It's fun, you get to be around a brilliant professor, and it won't kill you with work."
539,727298,4.5,3.0,Dr Lustig is a fantastic professor in the religion department but knows so much about many other subjects. Honestly he may be the smartest man I've ever met. Tests are student friendly and he will work with you if you have any trouble. Not a tough grader. He is more interested in you actually enjoying the class and learning the material.
540,727298,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lustig is brilliant, yet unpretentious. He explains Kant and the like with precision, clarity, and passion, weaving lectures that leave students enraptured.  One of those rare teachers who provokes thought beyond his discipline, Dr. Lustig embodies what Davidson advertises itself to be: generous and genius. Do not graduate without taking him."
541,727298,4.5,3.0,"I've taken both Death, Dying and the Afterlife (257) and Religious Ethics (250) with Dr. Lustig and have very much enjoyed both classes. Dr. Lustig is a very interesting man with an extensive background in the topics he teaches and this is reflected in his lectures. He is always willing to meet with confused students as well. Fair reviews."
542,727298,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Lustig's class is awesome. It's obvious that he's a brilliant guy, but he's so down to earth that conversation really doesn't feel condescending. He's a great lecturer and does a good job of balancing lecture with discussion. Reviews were very fair and the class was really interesting and relevant. I very highly recommend a class with him."
543,727298,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Lustig clearly knows what he's talking about and has a passion for the subject matter. He really likes class participation. Reviews are difficult but make you think and, overall, fairly graded. Definitely recommend taking a class with him!"
544,727298,5.0,3.0,"I looked forward to going to class each day more than I have for most classes. I found the lectures and discussions interesting and thought-provoking, yet relaxing. I highly recommend Religion, Ethics, and Medicine, especially for premedical students."
545,727298,4.5,3.0,Dr. Lustig is a really great professor who knows the material he teaches and cares about his students' success.  His lectures might be a little unfocused from time to time but they never disappoint as far as content and quality are concerned.  Brilliant and friendly professor.
546,727298,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lustig's lectures are very deep and engaging, maybe more so than any professor I've had at Davidson. Come to class with an open mind and ready to dive into tough material. The class discussions about &quot;hard cases&quot; are a highlight. There's considerable reading, but the subject matter is fascinating and challenging, which livens it up."
547,727298,5.0,3.0,"Death, Dying and the Afterlife is incredibly pertinent. Through various religious and secular perspectives, and through several powerful narratives of those experiencing death firsthand, it was a relief to reckon with a topic our culture handles poorly. Dr. Lustig was instrumental in reshaping and deepening my understanding of our mortal existence."
548,727298,5.0,3.0,"Religion, Ethics, and Medicine was one of my favorite Davidson classes. Through a diverse and accessible reading list, Dr. Lustig engaged the class in important ethical discussions from the perspective of various religious traditions. Knowledgable and accessible, Dr. Lustig is the quintessential liberal arts professor- you'll be glad you had him."
549,727298,4.0,3.0,"Issues in Religion and Science was an interesting class, even if it starts off slowly as we worked our way through the history of the conflict. So if it starts off dully don't worry, it picks up. Lustig is friendly and a good lecturer. Keep up with the work so you can participate in class, he'll love you for that. I'm glad I took this class."
550,727298,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Lustig is very enthusiastic and always willing to help a student in any way he can. His passion for the material was apparent, providing clarity in lectures and a great learning environment. The class was very interesting, definitely worth taking!  I wanted to immediately enroll in another! He's genuine and kind. I highly recommend his courses!"
551,727298,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Lustig is incredibly attentive and helpful, seems to genuinely care for his students, and is an expert in theological ethics. His class was engaging not only by the nature of the issues at hand, which ranged anywhere from marriage and sex to war, but through class discussion which he thoroughly promoted and encouraged. Definitely recommend it."
552,727298,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lustig is a really great professor.  His lectures can be a little scattered at times, but  the material is really interesting.In lectures, you get all of the information that you need to succeed on reviews. His reviews are very straightforward and fair if you've been paying attention in class. I highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Lustig."
553,727298,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Lustig is extremely knowledgeable, but also one of the kindest professors at Davidson.  He seems to genuinely care about the well-being of his students.  It is clear that he appreciates participation and interaction with students.  His classes are extremely interesting and he is very enthusiastic about them."
554,727298,5.0,2.0,"Terrific professor. Really enjoyed both my classes with him. Lustig is very knowledgeable, and presents the material in an engaging manner. Highly recommend taking a class of his."
555,727298,4.0,2.0,"Very passionate and experienced in his subject, especially on the topic of healthcare reform. Presents his own opinions considerately. Paces the class and designs tests so that its not always necessary to take on the entire reading load. A very valuable class to anyone hoping to thoughtfully approach issues in medicine. Also has a cool voice."
556,727298,5.0,2.0,"Lustig was very fair in grading assignments, even though it sometimes took him a little while to get them back. He was available in office hours, and was always willing to clarify things to help you out."
557,727298,1.5,3.0,Incredibly boring class.
558,727298,3.0,3.0,"Lustig REALLY knows his stuff! He's also really good about trying to make sure everyone understands whats going on every day. He covers a lot of interesting areas and ties religion, philosophy, and science together really nicely. It's not always easy to be in this class, but it was worth it."
559,727298,3.5,4.0,"Lustig clearly knows a great deal about bioethics, and has interesting experience to add to discussions. Talked for most of class, sometimes getting off on tangents or repeating himself. Tests were fair but he grades pretty tough. Overall good guy, not the best at responding to e-mails though."
560,727298,2.0,2.0,This is a really cool character.. however his class was wierd. I would leave his class not knowing of anything he just talked about for 50mins. I wish there was more class discussions the topics often provoked intelligent convo's but class lacked engagement. test were simple enough but *2 B honest* when i tried i failed & when i gave up i passed B-
561,727298,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, knows a lot about the subject and actually wants students to do well. Changed the format of the tests to fit how we tested well, although after he did that, he graded a little tougher. Great class, overall"
562,727298,3.5,4.0,"Liked and disliked the class: Lustig's opinions are insightful and interesting, but his subtle derision of your own (unless it coincides with his) turned me off.  The class focused solely on christ., which while expected, other views would have been valued.  Keep up with the readings, and his tests aren't as bad as they seem. Funny guy too."
563,727298,3.5,4.0,"He is a great guy but I feel that grading was a little unfair.  Lectures were interesting but sometimes got off topic and started wandering.  Not that hard as long as you keep up with the readings and make sure you particpate in class, he likes that a lot."
564,727298,4.0,3.0,"Great guy, interesting lectures, lots of reading, fairly tough grader."
565,727298,4.5,2.0,"This guy is great.  For being so brilliant, he communicates very well with students.  He is very personable and works with his students so they can do well.  He has an amazing amount of knowledge on the topics.  After all, he has done pretty much everything.  The lectures get off course b/c of the students, not b/c of him.  Take the class."
566,727298,3.0,3.0,"This guy must take a huge toke before class, because he has the one of the most undisciplined lecture styles of any prof.  He writes outlines for his lecture, and will intend to get through the outline for class, but will spend the entire class on one bullet point from the outline.  Also, inserts his own political bias into lectures."
567,1329427,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Kelly is very smart and knowledgeable about his field.  He's funny and his classes are engaging.  Nevertheless, the rumors you've heard are true.  I didn't find nightly readings to be overwhelming, but his take homes were brutal.  I'm talking writing 14 pages closed note in two to three days.  It was a great class, but proceed at your own risk."
568,1329427,4.0,5.0,"Really great lecturer, gets you invested in the content, but has insanely high expectations of students. That comes with its ups and downs, he really trusts you to produce good work but will knock you down for even small formatting errors."
569,1329427,4.5,5.0,"It was a lot of work, but I loved the class and he helped to improve my writing dramatically. He's one of my favorite professors at Davidson. Oh and make sure you keep up with the reading. There are pop quizzes."
570,1329427,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Kelly is incredibly intelligent and down to earth. He treats his students with respect and seems to actually know what will interest them. The class is challenging, no doubt. Work load can be a lot and you need to keep up with the readings. I learned SO much from Dr. Kelly, I'm eager to continue taking his classes in the future!"
571,2550037,5.0,5.0,"Professor Key is exceptionally dedicated and helpful. The textbook is great, but it's reduced to a supplement because she prepares even better recorded lectures (for Fall 2020) and practice problems. Her assignments are impressive in both quantity (truly a lot) and quality (calculated difficulty and engaging context). Overall highly recommend!"
572,2550037,4.0,5.0,"Professor Key's Orgo 1 class was the hardest class I've ever taken at Davidson in terms of workload. That being said, Professor Key is one of the best professors I've ever had and she was very accessible and helpful outside of class. Take her class if you want to really learn the material and aren't afraid of a challenge."
573,2607381,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Smith(her last name is Blake rn) is practically an angel. Lectures are made super easy to understand. She's caring and warm, generally accessible outside of classrooms. Remember to attend her classes because she grades in-class activities. Master-grading makes this course a lot less streessful."
574,2607381,5.0,3.0,Dr. Smith was such a sweet and easy-to-understand professor. I wish more people taught math like she does because she makes it so easy to understand. She's probably the best math teacher I've ever had.
575,2607381,5.0,3.0,"Heather is the nicest person ever. I came to Davidson not wanting to ever take a math class. After two classes with her, Heather Smith is my math major advisor. Enough said."
576,2607381,5.0,3.0,Dr. Smith is an incredible professor! Good teaching and detailed feedback given on time. Everyone go take her class!
577,2607381,4.0,3.0,"A great professor! I highly recommend, however, she is a ruthless grader. The questions are all or nothing. The questions are not especially difficult, but you will have to study. She refuses to take last grades, so don't forget homework or forget to attend class. She is a great help outside of class as well."
578,2607381,4.0,3.0,"Definitely one of my favorite professors at Davidson, she is a very sweet lady and is very patient with students. Because it was a beginner class it wasn't too hard but if you're struggling office hours are a must because if you don't solve problems the way she teaches, they will be counted wrong but she's very good at explaining concepts."
579,2607381,4.0,3.0,"The most impressive trait of Prof. Smith is that she has very clear logic, and once you follow her logic, you'll find it easy and comfortable writing formal proofs. She also uses mastery grading to make this course less daunting."
580,2607382,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Wiedemann is very friendly both in and outside class. He explains theorems clearly and if you have trouble understanding them immediately, he would patiently guide you during the office hour. His adoption of &quot;mastery grading&quot; policy in MAT150 makes the course a lot easier than it could have been."
581,2541848,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Busch is awesome. I took his WRI101 class because of the requirement, and it ended up being my favorite class from that semester. He explains things very thoroughly and constantly checks in to make sure everyone understands. He also gives extensive feedback that is super easy to learn from. I highly recommend taking one of his classes!"
582,2541848,5.0,3.0,Dr. Busch is very accessible outside of class and the detailed comments he left on my writing were very helpful. I became a better writer and thinker because of his class. 10/10 would recommend.
583,2541848,5.0,3.0,"I loved having Dr. Busch as a teacher. He was always willing to meet outside of class and talk about my work in depth, and he gave incredibly detailed feedback on assignments. He seemed to genuinely care about our class and often asked for our input on what he could do better. I am definitely a better writer after this class."
584,2541848,5.0,3.0,"I had professor Busch for my Writing 101 class which was philosophy based. Personally I found the course material difficult to understand, but I'm a better writer now because of him. He was always available for office hours to discuss material, your paper, etc. He was extremely engaging. Questions and mistakes were encouraged. Loved this class!"
585,2541848,4.0,2.0,Dr. Busch is SUPER accessible outside of the classroom and makes sure that every person in the classroom has the chance to equally succeed. He is very clear with his expectations and is extremely humorous. Took this class for credit but highly enjoyed him! Would take again if I was a philosophy major.
586,2541848,4.0,3.0,"Professor Busch is very engaging and intelligent. His class is lecture-heavy but he emphasizes participation and does a lot of small group discussions to make the class more engaging. He is very accessible outside of class and gives detailed feedback for the response papers. Overall, I would recommend his class to fulfill the philosophy requirement"
587,2541848,5.0,2.0,"Never written a rate my professor before, But I have to for Dr. Busch. He's super caring for his students and genuinely wants them to learn more about Philosophy, and it shows in the effort he puts into his lectures. Always understanding if you need an extension, and there really isn' enough I can say about Dr. Busch: he is simply the goat."
588,2541848,5.0,3.0,"Busch is the best teacher I've had at Davidson. He knows his stuff. Readings are super short. Essays are 500 words. Grading is very nice if you put the work in. Philosophy is confusing, but Busch explains it very well. He answers questions and is available in office hours to help. I really recommend taking a class with him. Funny guy too."
589,2541848,5.0,3.0,Dr. Busch was heavily invested in his students success. He is a very smart teacher who shows students how to think through problems.
590,2541848,5.0,5.0,"Have never taken a philosophy class before, and I really am glad to have taken it with Dr. Busch. I had a hard time trying to understand everything, but he was always there during office hours! He's intelligent, and if you work really hard and show that you are, you'll definitely get a good grade!"
591,2541848,5.0,4.0,"This guy was intimidating at first but if you really get to know him he is a fantastic professor. Dr. Busch is very engaging in the way he teaches- always looking for input from his students. He is a tough grader because he expects a lot from you, but the feedback he gives is probably the best i have seen from a professor. Truly a great professor!"
592,2541848,5.0,3.0,"I hate philosophy, I didnt enjoy the class, but damn do I respect him. He is brilliant and is so funny. Very lecture heavy and I would be lying if I said they weren't boring at times but he'll stop randomly and tell funny stories. Super helpful outside of class and really interesting to talk to. Made a dull class tolerable due to how good he is"
593,2541848,5.0,3.0,One of my favorite professors I have had at Davidson. Made me truly interested in philosophy. Very engaging and his lectures are super interesting. A moderate amount of work but very understanding and always extremely helpful. Super passionate about teaching.
594,2541848,5.0,2.0,"I've taken 2 classes with Dr. Busch and I've really enjoyed both of them. His lectures are clear and if he doesn't explain a topic well, he won't move on until everyone understands. He is awesome in office hours, helping map out papers and assignments. If you want to try philosophy or need a 4th class take one with Busch."
595,2541849,5.0,2.0,"He's really easy. If you do the homework, participate, and loosely study you will do just fine. If you already have taken Spanish it will be an easy A for you. He makes the material easy to understand and is not a tough grader."
596,2541849,5.0,3.0,"I only signed up for this class to get the credit, but now I am considering minoring in Spanish because I enjoyed it so much. Pasero-O'Malley is an amazing professor who really cares about his students. He goes above and beyond. Everyone in our class loves him. I would definitely take a class with him again. &iexcl;10/10 recommend!"
597,2541849,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor at Davidson. Extremely kind, caring, and understanding.. I have never really enjoyed Spanish as a subject, but he made me excited for class every day. Yes, he cares that students do well in his class, but more importantly, he cares about the genuine well-being of his students. Great professor, great teacher, amazing man."
598,2670874,1.0,1.0,"As someone who is interested in becoming more fluent in Spanish, I was really disappointed by this class. The asynchronous style did not work for me. The only conversation I had was in AT sessions and all work assigned by Prof Lin seemed like busy work. Prof was not easy to reach. Do not take this class if you actually want to learn Spanish."
599,2607383,1.0,5.0,This guy gives a ridiculously amount of work and sets a ridiculously high standard for grading everything. You will spend most of the week doing just his work and receive a bad grade for the work you have done. He just makes his class intentionally hard for no reason.
600,2607383,2.0,3.0,"I got a c+ in this class without ever scorning below a 90 on a test or quiz. Guy grades homework like its 1940s Germany. NO MISTAKES ALLOWED! Bruh, this is where we are supposed to make them."
601,2607383,1.0,5.0,"Lots of work , talks about his daily issues a lot , and only wants you to use his exact methods to answer problems"
602,2607383,5.0,3.0,Dr. Zhuang is def the best prof! I took his class online during the first semester of my freshmen year and had a really good experience. He cares about students and keeps encouraging you. Hw takes some time but really helps you have a better understanding about all the concepts. I am also lucky to have him as my holistic advisor. Take his class!
603,2607383,4.0,3.0,Zhuang was very open and willing to help any student. Wants to be sure people understand the material and does a great job of teaching that built on itself.
604,2607383,4.0,2.0,"Had a great experience in Professor Zhuang's class. Super caring guy who really tries to connect with his students. If you study you'll be fine, and office hours always helps."
605,2607383,5.0,4.0,"Professor Zhuang is one of the most caring professors I have ever met. He wants to get to know each and every one of his students as much as he can. He is so passionate about his work and it shows. He is not easy, but he is very understanding. I highly recommend."
606,2607383,1.0,3.0,The professor is kind in nature but very hard to understand the concepts.
607,2588965,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Schmidt is the best teacher I have had at Davidson hands down! He actually teaches in class, and his tests are actually on what he says they are on! If you go to lecture and don’t read the book you can probably get a B. If you only read the book and study that you will also probably get a B. If you do both then you will get an A. "
608,2588965,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Schmidt was a great PSY101 teacher. He covered a lot of content clearly, and the pacing and course expectations were always very clear. He was very passionate about the subject, and also was extremely helpful in office hours. There are a lot of very small pop quizzes, and it is helpful to do the reading even though there is a lot."
609,2588965,5.0,3.0,"Professor Schmidt was amazing couldn't have imagined a better professor to teach me about psychology. He was engaging in class and kept us constantly engaged with real life examples. There is a lot of reading. You are not forced to do it by any means, but there will be stuff on quizzes you can only know from the reading. Overall, I loved his class!"
610,2588965,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Schmidt was my favorite professor this semester. PSY 101 has a lot of content to cover, but he was organized enough from the very beginning so you knew how to best manage your time to not get behind. He was transparent with our grades throughout the semester. He is passionate as well. He is approachable and office hours are extremely helpful."
611,2588965,1.0,5.0,"His lectures are very subpar. Sometimes he explains key concepts poorly, and I get confused by the end of the lecture, so your textbook is going to be your best friend. He also gives hard quizzes that you would never have the time to complete (start w short answers). I hate the pop quizzes he gives. I don't think I learned a lot from this class..."
612,2588965,4.0,4.0,"Karl Schmidt is very knowledgeable and expresses his passion for psych very well. However, for not taking psychology before, his psych 101 class was a lot for me. It is a lot of material and he is unclear on what he wants you to know for tests and what he wants from papers. Be ready for some small pop quizzes and to have a lot of reading material."
613,2588965,4.0,2.0,Dr. Schmidt is definitely a solid choice and I would take his class again. It's not too difficult to get an A if you stay on top of studying and come to class. The information is all relevant and interesting.
614,2588965,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Schmidt is amazing! I took this class for major credit and will definitely be taking more classes with him. The textbook is easy to follow and his lecture material is from the textbook, so the readings set you up well. He cares a lot about his students and will stop at nothing to help them succeed. Plus the experiment days are really fun!"
615,2588965,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Schmidt is an approachable, passionate, and engaging professor. He teaches with clarity, grades fairly, and is clear on expectations. He gives fun assignments and relatively easy tests. Its essential to review notes every class and participate. This class is incredibly interesting and well-taught."
616,461096,5.0,3.0,Dr. Belloni is an incredible professor and mentor. Definitely take him for intro physics if you can. 
617,461096,5.0,3.0,"Belloni is the best professor I had while at Davidson. I had him for at least 3 physics classes, and enjoyed each of them (likely because he was the professor). He's very bright and down to earth, and truly cares about each of his students. For those looking to take intro physics, absolutely take it with him if he is teaching the course. "
618,461096,5.0,2.0,"I loved learning physics with Dr. Belloni. And I am not a physics person! Highly recommend his class, and from my experience, he has the most accessible office hours of any professor at Davidson."
619,461096,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Belloni is extremely kind and approachable. His lectures are engaging as he is very animated. He made physics, a difficult science, really simple to understand. Problem sets from the textbook are assigned frequently and his office is always open for help, where he will actually walk through problems with you to ensure you understand concepts."
620,461096,5.0,3.0,"Hands down, he's one of the best professors at Davidson and definitely the best professor in the Physics department. You can see that he wants you to love physics, and he works hard to achieve that. Tests were always fair and homework was moderate, but he was always available for help. Best part of the class is his lectures. He's funny and clear."
621,461096,5.0,3.0,Dr. Belloni is probably the best professor I have had so far at Davidson. He is always available for office hours and they are very helpful. Wonderful person. No more to say.
622,461096,4.5,3.0,"Not flawless, but probably my favorite teacher at Davidson. He has office hours many hours every single day and will effectively answer all of your questions (emails are less helpful). Class lectures are usually informative and interesting, with a few exceptions. Homework and tests problems were tough, but they were relevant and graded very fairly."
623,461096,5.0,4.0,Wonderful professor! Tests are almost a guessing game though; hard to gauge what is important and what isn't. Would definitely take again!
624,461096,4.5,3.0,"Belloni is the man. 5 for helpfulness because whenever you ask him a question, he goes on and on to assure himself that he's answering you're question. 4 for clarity, because most lectures are clear and interesting, but occasionally he'll brush by something that's important. 3 for easiness, because everything is fair and not overly difficult."
625,461096,4.5,2.0,Probably the best professor I've had at Davidson so far. He's extremely passionate about what he is teaching and makes things very easy to understand. He makes it easy for you to learn and get a good grade. I'm extremely happy that I took Astronomy and HIGHLY recommend the class to anyone and everyone.
626,461096,4.5,4.0,"He is FABULOUS! Best professor I've had so far at Davidson. I was terrified of physics but he made it managable and interesting. The subject matter is hard, but he's an incredibly clear instructor and helpful outside of class. Go to office hours! Class is amusing and engaging. Labs were time consuming but you finish them during the lab period."
627,461096,5.0,3.0,"Fair with grades. Extremely helpful in and out of classes. Great teacher, better person. The in-class demonstrations made 8:30 so worth it."
628,461096,5.0,3.0,"To demonstrate Newton's Third Law of Physics, that forces push in equal and opposite directions, he sat on a rolling chair in the middle of the class while holding a fire extinguisher filled with compressed gas. He then used the extinguisher as an air gun to push him around the room. Enough Said"
629,461096,4.0,3.0,"If you want to get a science credit out of the way, take Dr. Belloni. He's one of the nicest professors and (probably) the easiest of all Physics profs. Go  to his study sessions!! He is extremely fair and wants you to succeed. Take-home quizzes and simple daily problems are just the little things he does to help your grade. Take this class!"
630,461096,5.0,2.0,Lectures are very interesting. He is always willing to help you in office hours. Reviews are fair and you can even get help during take home reviews.
631,461096,5.0,2.0,"had for 120 and 220. premeds tend to avoid taking physics at davidson, but belloni remains the BEST prof i've had here. besides being a nice, funny guy, he makes everything seem so easy. with him, you WILL understand physics."
632,461096,4.5,2.0,Pretty funny in the classroom. Has reasonable ability to convey topics. Make sure to utilize office hours. He makes things straight-forward in one-on-one situations.

635,454971,2.0,4.0,This was one of my hardest classes. Interesting content but hard teacher. The tests are very detail-oriented and focus more on memorization rather than learning the art. There is also not a lot of direction given on the paper needed for the class (one of the major grades along with two reviews and a course final).
636,454971,4.0,3.0,"Very straight forward in his expectations and the work. Reviews are very formulaic and easy to study for. If you want an A, you have to read though... Great guy, really cares about his students, and very willing to help especially if you try and develop a relationship there."
637,454971,4.0,4.0,"Larry Ligo. He's a great person, invites the class to his house, and very into art. As a 100 level course, it is heavy memorization. Basically the entire course is memorizing, so if you spend lots of time out of class you'll be fine."
638,454971,4.0,5.0,"Larry the Legend. Tough grader, and your grade is decided by two tests and a final. However nice guy and an interesting card. Cares about students."
639,454971,1.0,4.0,TERRIBLE; don't take any course with him; you'll thank me later !!
640,454971,2.0,5.0,This was a nightmare. The material is so interesting but his tests are unreasonable. So much memorization that sucked out any enjoyment I could have had. Tests are on material not even remotely covered in lectures. Papers require a lot of effort and they are generally unhelpful. Such a shame and disappointment. I love art history but not his class.
641,454971,3.5,4.0,"Ligo was a very good art teacher. Art 100 was an exhaustive course and full of what seems to be like an exorbitant amount of learning, but I also really enjoyed the class. He is always available to meet and will work with you if you come to see him. His reviews and grading are pretty tough mind you, but he helps students who come see him often."
642,454971,1.0,5.0,"Rather ridiculous course. It could be interesting information, but his grading standards are less about learning and more about memorization. Also tends to explain what he wants after the fact, when its useless."
643,454971,2.5,5.0,"Tough class. Dr. Ligo demands a lot from his students. The tests are hard, like really hard. He told the class before the first exam, ""Probably half of you will fail."" If you aren't in love with art and the study of it, stay away. Side note: he's really nice and invited us all over to his house for lemonade and cookies"
644,454971,5.0,4.0,"Ligo is an incredibly wonderful professor! His class was one of my most challenging so far, but extremely rewarding. He well-presents the material and I loved the class, however expect a decent amount of reading and a lot of memorization for tests. One of my favorite professors, very enthusiastic and loves teaching. Listen to his advice for tests!"
645,454971,3.5,4.0,"This class is a huge time commitment although the professor is great. He is always willing to meet with you and discuss. The material is what makes this class hard. The time you spend on reviewing the material directly correlate to your grade. Two intimidating test and 4/5 short easy papers, and a final."
646,454971,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Ligo wants his students to succeed. He is always willing to meet with students and lets you know how much you need to study for reviews. He provides all the necessary resources, how much the student learns and gains is in the student's court. Great, engaging lectures. Only short papers and reviews. Loved the course."
647,454971,4.5,5.0,"Difficult, but worthwile professor. Wants people to take his class seriously. No art experience before class, and it was work, but Ligo helped me learn more than I learned in other classes combined. Talk to him often about tests and papers and you will be fine."
648,454971,4.5,3.0,Ligo really cares about his students.  He is extremely approachable and welcomes all questions.  You have to do the reading in his class if you expect an A.  His lectures are entertaining for the most part.
649,454971,4.5,3.0,"This was my first art history course, so I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  Dr. Ligo loves enthusiastic students.  Show him that you are interested and he'll be glad to meet anytime to discuss the course material.  Do not save studying to the last minute, it is impossible to remember all the images overnight."
650,454971,5.0,3.0,This was probably my favorite class at Davidson so far. His classes are really interesting and fun. It's a lot of work but it is worth it. If you are the type of person to procrastinate of only half heartedly pay attention don't bother taking this class or any other art history
651,454971,2.0,5.0,tests were extremely hard and was not sympathetic towards a freshman who knew very little about coping with college-level work
652,454971,3.0,5.0,"Ligo is a crazy man, and this class is extremely time-consuming if you want to do well. That being said, I went in knowing absolutely nothing about art and came out with a really good understanding of it as well as a great appreciation for it. Tests are very tough though - listen to exactly what he wants or else you will most likely suffer."
653,454971,4.5,4.0,"I intended to take Survey as a low-priority 5th course. By the end of the 1st class, I knew I wanted to throw myself into it 100%. Dr. Ligo has a great approach to art history--emphasis on the &quot;Why&quot; over mindless description--and gives engaging & animated lectures. It's definitely easier if you read. Go talk to him. Take him seriously on test prep."
654,454971,4.5,4.0,"I intended to take Survey as a low-priority 5th course. By the end of the 1st class, I knew I wanted to throw myself into it 100%. Dr. Ligo has a great approach to art history--emphasis on the &quot;Why&quot; over mindless description--and gives engaging & animated lectures. It's definitely easier if you read. Go talk to him. Take him seriously on test prep."
655,454971,4.5,2.0,Is a stickler for time--if you show up one minute late you will be marked as absent.  but very understanding of personal/individual situations.
656,454971,3.5,5.0,"Ligo is tough, and not subtle about having favorite students, but he is fair, and definitely knows his stuff. If you do everything expected of you, and pay attention,  taking a class of his can be really rewarding. Don't be late. He's intimidating; I hear visiting him during office hours helps, but I was too scared! Still, a good prof overall."
657,454971,1.5,5.0,Do not show up late for class unless you want to get publicly humiliated and still get marked absent.
658,454971,3.0,5.0,I learn so much from his class. But he's very unorganized in lectures and expects students to take initiative in everything. Limited office hours and little outside help. His favorism sucks. Bad idea for first art-history takers.
659,454971,3.5,5.0,"This man is a hardass - his modern architecture course has a ton of information and he wants you to know all of it.  If you show interest in him and his class, he will favor you.  You DO NOT want to be on his bad side."
660,454971,4.0,3.0,"He is a great and interesting professor, keeps the class alive and gives clear lectures...though he can speak quickly at times. If you show effort and talk to him out of class, he will give you a good grade, i ended up with a higher grade than i should of according to my test grades etc. just because i showed him i was interested in the material."
661,454971,1.0,5.0,This man is EVIL.  He picks his favorites & will find strange & personal reasons to give bad grades.  He's completely insane.  Just a terrible teacher in every way.  Sucks the joy out of art history.
662,454971,2.5,4.0,"Disorganized, went on long and unnecessary tangents throughout class that only wasted time. He was late for each meeting I set up with him, and demanded to be reminded about meetings the day of (date book&#63;&#63;&#63;). Not the worst, but certainly one of my least favorite class experiences. I went in passionate about art history and came out detesting it."
663,454971,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Ligo is a very challenging professor, but enthusiastic about teaching and he has a passion for art. ASK questions and go see him..he likes to see effort so speak up. Definately follow directions and listen to his advice for tests."
664,454971,4.0,3.0,"Professor Ligo has been teaching Art History at Davidson for some time and sometimes you feel he has created his own facts.  Sometimes you are right.  But his stories are fun.  Tests are hard and when he says you'll fail if you don't do the work, he's just trying to be honest."
665,454971,1.0,5.0,Impossible
666,454971,4.5,3.0,Dr. Ligo rules. Really energetic and enthusiastic in class. Lectures are always well prepared and students participate a lot for a lecture course. He's very clear in communicating the knowledge; he isolates well the most important details. He can be funny and the course is really interesting.
667,454971,3.5,5.0,"nice guy,just ask him questions if you aren't sure..more concerned with the history of the time period than details in the painting, make sure you give him what he's asking for on tests.  difficult class but he wants you to do well."
668,454971,1.0,4.0,SO hard and it actually sucks.  Not a nice guy at all and does not teach the material.  He is too concerned with himself and not his students to actually care about what he is teaching.  I was so disapointed by him.  I would NEVER take him again.
669,454971,1.5,4.0,"Pedantic in his grading, dictatorial in teaching, Ligo belongs in a high-school, not in a college--especially not Davidson College. His grade won't reflect your knowledge of Art, it will reflect your ability to follow his instructions. Beware."
670,454971,5.0,3.0,"FREAKIN AWESOME. as long as you follow is instructions for writing papers to a &quot;t.&quot; that includes what he says your thesis will be. awesome tho, nice guy"
671,158013,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Wills is an absolute joy of a professor to be around. Took her class on Mormonism, a subject I was already interested in, and didn't regret it. She is so passionate about the things that she teaches that it makes every class fun and exciting. Only had a midterm and final essay and weekly Moodle posts so easy class with interesting material. "
672,158013,5.0,3.0,"GodLoveSex with Dr. Wills is one of the greatest classes at Davidson. She's not afraid to get down and dirty with the material and cracks jokes left and right. If you work hard, engage with the material, and participate, getting a good grade isn't impossible. One of the best professors at Davidson. 11/10"
673,158013,5.0,2.0,Professor Wills is the greatest professor I have had at Davidson. She is so sweet and funny and her classes are always hard to get into because of her high demand. The readings she assigns are fascinating and extremely engaging. I highly recommend taking a class with her!
674,158013,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wills is one of the most considerate and engaging professors I have had. She chooses readings intentionally and focuses on quality rather than quantity. Class time always leads to good discussion, which Dr. Wills facilitates with a healthy balance of humor and good insight. She clearly is invested in her students well-being and growth."
675,158013,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Wills is really passionate, frank, and hilarious. You will have A LOT of reading in her class. She is a tough grader and expects you to participate in class because it helps you to stay engaged in the class. Don't be afraid to speak up in her class even if you think it's not the right answer- she's open to all ideas, no matter how outlandish."
676,158013,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wills is a great lecturer, and very funny. She is very helpful during office hours. Extremely good feedback and is clear in her expectations. Very supportive and encouraging, and is genuinely concerned about you as a student."
677,158013,3.0,3.0,Lots of reading and really great books. Very accessible and fair with everything. Wish that people in my class were more involved but Dr. Wills is so funny and engaging. Huge treat to be in her class.
678,158013,5.0,2.0,"She assigns a lot of reading, but is the best professor I've had ever. She is thoughtful, interested in her students beyond how far you'll expect, and so kind. I really want to take more classes with her in my remaining time at college and would recommend you do too!"
679,158013,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Wills is so engaging as a professor. She has a unique sense of humor--tells a lot of random stories about her family--but is lots of fun and really loves her kids and the class. Definitely my easiest class this semester because you read for discussion, not for reading quizzes, and she makes discussions great. Would take again!"
680,158013,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wills is easily the most entertaining professor at Davidson. She is so funny and really nice. She's also extremely smart, but still clearly values student's opinions and discussions. There was a lot of reading, but other than that not too much work. She definitely tries to make class useful and enjoyable."
681,158013,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Wills is a super friendly and helpful, but expects a lot from her students. She was a tougher grader than I expected."
682,158013,4.5,3.0,"She was very nice and very easy to approach outside of class. Very friendly and easygoing, overall a great person. I found her to be a pretty hard grader though. She also participated way too much in discussions- it was almost like a lecture."
683,158013,5.0,1.0,"I had Wills for a Mormonism course. She is easy-going, and hilarious. Most of the material she presented was interesting and we had thought-provoking discussions. She is understanding of the burden a student of Davidson college faces, so she doesn't kill you with work. I hope to take her again!"
684,158013,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic teacher. She's hilarious and extremely clear/helpful. Some people complained about how much reading there was, but her choices of books are diverse and interesting. Loved her, take all her classes!"
685,158013,4.5,3.0,Took Imagining american religion and Women in American religion.  SHE'S THE BOMB.  Class was always interesting regardless of how interesting the text was for that day.  She brings so much passion and energy to the subject.  VERY brilliant in this area and it shows.  She excepts deep investigation in papers but is fair.  TAKE ANY CLASS WITH HER
686,158013,4.5,3.0,Amazing professor! Passionate and funny. Class was never dull. She is brilliant but may seem a tad unorganized.  Loved her teaching style.  She loves open discussion and it's always stimulating. I would take any class with her!  She's great!
687,158013,4.0,1.0,"The subject was not at all my cup of tea and I literally read less than ten of the assigned readings all semester, but I did very well in the class and enjoyed discussion. I've actually since read one of the books, after the class has finished, because it looked interesting. Lerner book is awful. Bednarowski is worse.  But Wills made it worth it."
688,158013,4.5,2.0,"If your taking a religion class it has to be with Dr. Wills. She is extremely nice and quite funny always making jokes or talking about something random about her kids but it makes class fun. The readings are not difficult, autobiographies, and the test are not too bad, includes fill in the blank =D."
689,158013,4.0,3.0,Her lectures are pretty much the same as all the other professors. In class discussions she leads well but sometimes will participate too much. Very nice and intelligent though.
690,158013,3.5,2.0,"Definitely not a hard grader. I had for my Humanities group leader, and I barely had to put effort in on my essays. She is strict on grammar though. Class was fun, and she is a nice and approachable teacher."
691,158013,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite teachers here! During classes you will always be laughing. She gets off topic sometimes, but it is entertaining. She is so understanding, likely b/c she was a Davidson graduate too. Talk to her about anything! She genuinely loves religion and her students. You read a lot for her but it is enjoyable and her tests are fair-ish."
692,158013,4.5,2.0,Wills is an awesome person. She is so nice and approachable and is the only reason I didn't drop Humanities 150 right away. I eventually did drop Humanities but am looking forward to taking a religion class with her
693,158013,4.5,4.0,Definitely take a class from Dr. Wills.
694,158013,5.0,3.0,Dr. Wills is responsible for some of my best experiences at Davidson.
695,158013,4.5,2.0,"TRIPLE CHILI PEPPER!!!  Not only is she hot, but she is one of the most understanding, sweetest, and reasonable professor I have ever had. Class wasn't that interesting but her energy and excitment will get you through it. A MUST TAKE!!"
696,158013,5.0,2.0,Anne Blue Wills is super-smart and knows SO much.  Gets excited about students' individual academic interests.  Definitely go to talk to her during office hours--she'll be incredibly helpful.
697,158013,3.0,2.0,"One could not ask for a kinder, more charming professor.  After all she went to Davidson.  But at least in my class, her lectures never went very far and we tended to tread water with the same thinking over and over again.  Class was a chore.  Written work was fun if you wanted it to be.  She was always glad to meet, but come with questions."
698,158013,4.5,2.0,She was a great professor. Read and pay attention in class and you will pass. She works hard to help her students do well.
699,158013,5.0,3.0,"Very interesting class, was mostly history. Got into some theology, but the class and lectures centered around historical perspective. She's great and really personable. Was Davidson grad so understands the workload. Don't go to office hours without knowing what you want help on. She'll help, though"
700,158013,4.0,2.0,"She is funny and cool. Make jokes and she will like you. Lots of reading, but if you listen to her lectures, you'll be fine."
701,158013,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Wills is great! Take her for humes- very helpful, interesting, and fun."
702,158013,2.5,2.0,Double chili pepper. Her lectures were OK. Easy grader. I asked for help once and she was not helpful at all.

705,2222415,5.0,3.0,"Lecture heavy class but great Prof. Really knows his stuff and genuinely cares about his students. Moderately tough grader, but I also was just adjusting to the style of writing he was asking for. When I went to office hours to go over tests and papers, it was clear how I could improve. I enjoyed this 101 class so much I now plan on majoring in ANT"
706,2222415,5.0,4.0,"While Dr. Samson's lectures could be a bit long, he always tried to make them interesting and make us laugh. There was a lot of reading, but it was all informative and valuable to the course. On written assignments, he's a harsh but fair grader, giving you feedback that helps you become a better writer... as long as you can read his handwriting."
707,2222415,4.0,4.0,"aka Clay Samson. Harsh grader - if it isn't his interpretation, it's wrong. Response prompts 2 are broad but he expects immense detail so don't mention something without fully unpacking it/that you dont fully get. Disorganized but flexible with his syllabus and VERY ACCOMMODATING (GIVES EXTENSIONS). Values participation but picks apart ur comment"
708,2222415,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Samson is a professor who truly cares not only about his students, but about the world they live in. He motivates his lectures with his personal beliefs but generally use them as a jumping off point in the discussion. He is flexible about deadlines and extremely knowledgable as he teaches across 3 disciplines so has a unique perspective."
709,2222415,3.0,3.0,"He is very knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches. However, he is very disorganized. I the class rarely knew what we were supposed to read. The prompts for papers (besides the final paper) were given out a week or less from the due date. He does give lots of feedback on papers however, he is not an easy grader."
710,2449746,5.0,3.0,Dr. Bersch is one of the most talented professors in the political science department. She invest heavily in her students' success and evidently plans her classes with a lot of care. 
711,2449746,5.0,2.0,I love Dr. Bersch!! She's very interesting and really wants to get to know her students and for them to do well in her class. Very easy grader and accessible in office hours. She will want to ask about your life outside class too. Lots of group discussions in class make it easy to form a study group for her few reviews. Take her class!!
712,2449746,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Bersch loves her subject. She's knowledgable, partly because she's extremely curious. For Tuesday thursday, she assigned roughly 50 pages of light reading. Homework is skimmable, honestly. Also, she brings a lot of cool guests--if you don't love her, which you will, she has five guest lectures from ambassadors and others. Really interesting!"
713,2449746,5.0,3.0,"This professor has an ability to assign (though a lot of) great readings, and gives very specific feedback about your grade. Lets you do cool final projects, helpful during office hours, and incredibly enthusiastic in her lectures."
714,2449746,5.0,3.0,The reviews from 04/03/2019 and 12/22/2018 sum her up pretty well.
715,2449746,5.0,2.0,Professor Bersch is an amazing teacher. Her lectures and assignments are clear and meaningful. Comparative Global Politics has some boring sections but she does a great job keeping students engaged. Go to her office hours and it will help a lot! Highly recommend
716,2449746,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Can assign large amounts of reading but will cover all of the important content in her lectures. Will often split the class into small discussion groups which makes the class go by faster. 3 tests and 1 final paper, all of which are reasonable. Very engaging professor."
717,2056530,5.0,3.0,"He is a great professor and really cares about his students. There is quite a bit of reading, but it is manageable. I would highly recommend talking to him outside of the classroom because he has a very interesting life and perspective. Take any one of his classes. He is great."
718,2056530,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ewoodzie is an incredible professor of sociology. It is evidently clear that he is passionate about all aspects of sociology. That being said, he expects the most out of his students, so be ready to read, participate, and work hard. His grading is somewhat vague, but if you !go to office hours! he will help. Participation matters!!"
719,2056530,4.0,4.0,"Dr. E asks a lot of his students because he truly wants the content of his classes to have an impact. His workload is daunting at first, but doable once you catch on. Go to office hours. READ!!!!! Speak up in class. You'll be fine... do not expect your work to be graded and returned promptly."
720,2056530,5.0,3.0,"Okay, so the 5's on helpfulness and clarity are not necessarily true, but I NEEDED to bring up this guy's rating. Ewoodzie is one of my favorite professors and more importantly, one of my favorite people on campus. He LOVES what he teaches, and he teaches it a lot better than most. I left many classes mind-blown. He is very helpful in office hours"
721,2056530,2.5,3.0,"Dr. Ewoodzie loves the content he teaches, and it shows. We had no tests, only papers. He has high expectations (especially for class participation), but vague grading criteria and feedback at times. The class was very interesting and I really enjoyed the books we read! He's a nice guy all around."
722,2056530,3.0,4.0,"Really cool guy, facilitates great class discussions.  I took his 101 his first year here - I think he expects too much.  Very tough grader, even with class participation.  Reading amount is doable, and necessary if you want to participate in discussion.  If you're very into the content, you'll enjoy this class.  If not, you'll regret taking it."
723,1309014,5.0,3.0,"Dave Wessner is an incredible scientist, person, and teacher. I wish I had tried harder in this class and went to more office hours to really take advantage of him as a resource. It was very easy to fall behind on the class and the material is involved so stay on top of reading assignments. He loves to talk about viruses (look him up)"
724,1309014,5.0,3.0,Dr. Wessner was always eager to teach and help his students in any way he could-really made me excited to come to class! Will absolutely try to take another class of his.
725,1309014,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wessner is an amazing professor and I will definitely be taking his classes in the future. The tests are challenging and long, but as long as read the course reader and do the practice test questions, they are easy A's. He always takes the time to ask each student about their weekends and he's truly caring. 100000% recommend Dr. Wessner"
726,1309014,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wessner was by far the best professor I had last semester. He was friendly, kind, caring, and genuinely excited about what he was teaching. Lectures were clear and he went over stuff until we understood it. Labs were great, he was always there to support us and expectations were clear. Overall an amazing prof. and class!"
727,1309014,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wessner is the best. He cares so much for his students and wants us to succeed. He is so excited about biology. He makes a huge effort to incorporate real world examples and discuss current events related to the topics we studied. Attending class is key, and on tests, you must give incredibly detailed answers to prove you know your stuff."
728,1309014,5.0,4.0,"This class was hard no doubt but Wessner made it a joy to take. He gave great lectures, graded his difficult tests very fairly, and made lab very manageable and not intimidating. He gave great feedback on assignments and grading criteria was very clear. I am not a science person but Wessner's great energy pushed me to do well in the class."
729,1309014,3.0,4.0,"I learned a lot in the class, but I often wished it was more based in concepts and less in details. It was also extremely backloaded - 50 percent of our grade came in the last week or two from a final, a last test, and two group projects."
730,1309014,5.0,4.0,"I loved my Bio 111 with Dr. Wessner. He always brought his energy, passion, and bow ties to the class. This is a professor who is truly excited about teaching. The class is not necessarily easy, and some of the tests were challenging. Homework was just keeping up with reading. I highly recommend this course if you want to learn from a great prof."
731,1309014,4.0,4.0,Best class so far. I really want another class with him! It was challenging but he was super helpful and always encouraging us to learn in the most cheerful way :-)
732,1309014,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wessner made this class MUCH easier with his teaching style. He values clarity above everything else, the way science should be taught. Makes class very interesting and grabs your attention (he threw candy at us on Halloween!). Also CARES about your life, before every class he asks us what's going on on campus. 100/100, want as major advisor."
733,1309014,5.0,2.0,Awesome professor who is always interested in the subject and willing to offer help. Fair grader and you get what you put in workload-wise.
734,1309014,3.0,4.0,"I have to say, this particular class is over-rated. Nonetheless, he is an extremely nice professor. The class material was easy but test were hard to do well on and his expectations are not clear on other assignments. Just don't be fooled by how laid back he is. 100% on all assignments should get you good grades."
735,1309014,4.5,3.0,"Really sweet guy, very approachable and helpful in lab. Tests are pretty difficult. Really passionate about the subject and teaching. Overall,great professor and great class."
736,1309014,4.5,3.0,Awesome professor. Easy to talk to and has a great passion for what he teaches. Enjoyable class.
737,1309014,5.0,1.0,He's the coolest professor!! Very sweet as well.
738,1309014,4.5,4.0,Sweet but INCREDIBLY hard tests.  Doesn't matter because he is cool.
739,1309014,5.0,4.0,"I had him for the AIDS Pandemic.  I'd recommend him for any class because he's a really nice guy, but AIDS is his specialty and it was a pleasure getting to learn from him.  One of my favorite professors at Davidson!"
740,1309014,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Wessner is a quality professor who is knowledgeable about the subject material and who likes to teach. I only wish I had a better background in cell biology and genetics before I took his microbiology course. As an aside, the course topics weren't planned well and the Blackboard textbook was a drawback, but overall the course was solid."
741,1309014,5.0,3.0,Wessner is the man. Period.
742,1309014,5.0,4.0,Incredible professor.
743,1309014,4.5,4.0,Makes those little &quot;buggers&quot; very visible. This is a class that you will look forward to every week. The work load is immense but with this prof as your guide...you will become so knowledgeable about the &quot;micro&quot; world that exists all around us.
744,1309014,4.5,3.0,"I don't feel like I need to add anything here...he gives good lectures, he is helpful in labs, his grading is fair, and his tests are difficult."
745,1309014,5.0,3.0,He's greeeaat
746,1309014,5.0,2.0,"He's the man....that's all anyone really needs to know.  Plus, he's a pretty easy lab grader, which is rare at Davidson."
747,1309014,5.0,3.0,Great!
748,1309014,5.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher, really enjoys teaching and is willing to accept the fact that he doesn't know the answers to some things.  Again, great teacher."
749,1309014,3.5,2.0,Cool dude.
750,1309014,4.5,4.0,He's the man...nuff said
751,1309014,5.0,4.0,great guy. really enthusiastic!

756,1309014,5.0,3.0,Very helpful!!!
757,545115,2.0,2.0,Absolutely loved psychology in high school but her class bored me. I tried to listen to the lecture but she only lists experiments. Online classes were her talking to herself and I felt like I learned nothing. Do not need to read the textbook to pass and quizzes embedded in the book are graded for completion. No office hours. One big paper.
758,545115,3.0,3.0,"Munger is a fine as a person, but she only lectures about past psych studies. Some are interesting, but it quickly becomes very boring. Those are all you need to study for tests, which are timed and take home. You have to visit art and write short essays on them, critique journal articles, and write an essay. Homework is easy and helps your grade."
759,545115,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Munger is a very sweet and kind person, but her class did leave something to be desired at times. Lectures consisted of learning about experiments that studied topics we learned about in the book, which sometimes got boring. Lots of textbook reading, and you have to study to do well on exams. Criteria for assignments not always clear."
760,545115,3.0,4.0,"I liked Dr. Munger, but her class was dry and I feel like I know actually very little about psychology. We had readings, but you did not need to do them to pass, and her lectures heavily focused on studies that did not really help focus the class on the material. Her tests were easy."
761,545115,1.0,3.0,"Don't take! I took AP Psych in hs & loved it - unfortunately Munger doesn't teach the material. Lectures are only case studies & when u get close to learning a concept she switches studies. After the 1st test u know what 2 expect on the rest, but 2 get a good grade u need 2 memorize minor details frm the millions of studies learned."
762,545115,2.5,2.0,"I was really looking forward to taking this class, but the lectures soon became boring (all case studies) and the tests were hit or miss. She is not very clear with what she wants for assignments and does not know names. She means well, but sometimes she doesn't know how to help students out. Overall I liked her as a person and ok as a professor"
763,545115,1.0,5.0,Professor Munger was very unengaging and awkward in class discussions and the class frequently lapsed into silence due to poor leadership. Her comments on papers were unhelpful to say the least and It did not always appear she had read the content of my essays when I went to talk to her Overall a highly mediocre at best.
764,545115,2.0,5.0,she is not a good teacher. she did not even know my name when i emailed her. her lectures seem interesting in th beginning but become painfully boring as the semester goes on. i did not like her at all. do not take any of her classes. she is not a good teacher
765,545115,3.5,3.0,"Although Dr. Munger really throws you into the material from day one, you eventually catch on, and she'll help you if necessary.  She loves her work and it shows, and she brings great energy to the classroom."
766,545115,4.5,4.0,"Very nice, intelligent, and interesting woman though she's a completely different person than me. 301 is the best preparation for grad school or research that exists in any undergraduate curriculum. Incredibly interesting articles to read and good discussions about them. Only class I've taken with her, might be totally different than 101."
767,545115,4.5,3.0,"Highly recommend this class/seminar for psych majors and for the film concentration.  Expected to speak up and do all of the reading.  No tests, but blackboard posts required for each class and several papers due throughout semester.  Graded medium.  Always fun to watch film clips when they were relevant!  Read 2 articles for each class."
768,545115,4.0,2.0,"Her lectures are very boring, tests are very easy. after the first one you realize exactly whats gunna be on the test. grade depends too much on things like attending lectures, other people's experiments, and going to museums (none of this is extra credit, its part of the grade)"
769,545115,3.5,1.0,"Munger is very much a research-based professor, which works for and against her.  Her classes, seem more like a formality that she has to do, or a place to cull new research participants.  Regardless, the class is very straight forward and if you do your reading you'll do fine."
770,545115,3.5,2.0,"Dr. Munger is a very nice professor, however, her lectures were fairly bland.  They were all about studies and not about material.  Did not explain much of the material on the quizzes and tests."
771,545115,3.5,2.0,Culture Points are good.
772,545115,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Munger is an extremely nice woman-always willing to help during office hours.  However, her lectures were all about experiments and case studies which got old fairly quickly.  She also reads right off of something she had already written when lecturing, making the class not so exciting."
773,1331549,2.0,5.0,I really think Dr. Lye might be an incarnation of the Buddha...His wisdom is unfathomable. I bow at his feet always.
774,1331549,3.0,3.0,"I found this class, especially the readings, to be fascinating.  He is an average lecturer.  One thing I didn't like is that he seems to dismiss the class as unable to understand non-western religions; his opinion is always the best.  This wasn't a problem except for the essays."
775,1331549,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Lye makes a class that could be super boring really exciting and interesting. Plays off the tests and papers like they will not be hard/that important, but they are actually pretty hard and important."
776,1331549,4.0,2.0,"took it as a non major and still loved it. very confusing subject - zen - but class is still chill. only a midterm (essays) and a final paper and presentation. thought provoking but easy to space out in too. not much work at all. got a B+, didnt do but what was required. i probably couldn't have done better though - maybe offic hours"
777,1331549,4.5,3.0,"Hard to get A's on tests, talk to him about essays beforehand and he will basically spell out exactly what he wants on them. He's a cool guy, his lectures aren't extremely engaging for me unless you are really into the topic, but if you study hard you should be able to get B's on his test no problem."
778,1331549,4.5,3.0,Hun Lye is totally amazing. He gives great lectures and his grading/assignments are definitely reasonable. I plan to take every course he teaches why I'm here...he's that good.
779,1331549,5.0,2.0,"One of the best lecturers at Davidson. He speaks with clarity, incorporates alot of student participation and makes the material fascinating. Plus hes hilarious. Tests and reading assignments are very reasonable. If you pay attention to his lectures, take notes, and participate you will get a good grade. Highly recommend. One of Davidson's best."
780,1331549,2.5,3.0,Doctor Lye's classes are just ok. That pretty much sums it up.
781,82289,5.0,3.0,The class is terrific. Prof. Chiristian is very helpful and kind. He offered clear and comprehensive lectures of computation science.
782,82289,1.5,4.0,"He is old and confusing and makes a lot of mistakes during lectures. When you ask him a question, he might end up laughing at you and totally avoiding it altogether. He gives hard tests and assigns a good chunk of homework. Lectures are subpar. The labs are moderately interesting, but they are graded harshly. I would not recommend."
783,82289,2.0,4.0,"This guy is terrible. He constantly makes mistakes during class, gives gratuitously difficult tests, and notoriously holds the record for ""most dull lectures"" at Davidson College. This is my 3rd physics class, and with tons and tons of studying I'm just barely pulling a B+. He also skips chapters in the book. I absolutely do NOT recommend this guy."
784,82289,5.0,5.0,"possibly the most rewarding class I took at davidson,but also the hardest.  The homework sets will have you slaving away for hours but Dr. Christian was always there to help and definitely was willing to work through the hard parts with me."
785,82289,4.5,5.0,"Great teacher.  I loved the use of high level theory and examples and then how he worked them into real life problems.  But be ready for moderately difficult tests.  Definitely not the hardest in the department, but close."
786,82289,3.5,5.0,This was a hard class but Dr. Christian was willing to help. I was glad to have taken AP Physics in high school.
787,82289,1.0,4.0,has a hard time explaining the concepts in useful and meaningful ways
788,82289,1.0,5.0,Tenure gone wrong.
789,82289,1.0,4.0,"Worst teacher I've had at Davidson! He makes at least 10 errors per class with his examples and just can't explain material at all. Why he gets paid to teach&#63; Who knows... Also, Psylets are worthless. Please don't waste your time at Davidson in this class."
790,82289,1.5,5.0,"Worst professor ever. He's brilliant, but an unclear, impatient, condescending old man when it comes to teaching. Avoid at all costs, unless you enjoy being talked down to every other day by a professor with no social skills whatsoever."
791,82289,2.5,5.0,"Dr. Christian is a nice guy, very intelligent and excited about physics, but his lectures are sometimes hard to follow. The book is definitely necessary to supplement the notes."
792,82289,1.5,5.0,"wolfgang, while obviously very intelligent, is the worst teacher i've ever had in my life. he made absolutely no sense at all the entire semester, he didn't help when i went to see him outside of class, and he gave ridiculously impossible tests."
793,82289,2.0,4.0,"Confusing, especially if you don't have a strong physics background from high school.  Additional work comes in the form of &quot;JiTT&quot;, &quot;Physlet&quot;, and &quot;Prelab&quot;, making for a time-consuming course.  Be prepared for low grades, even with a lot of effort."
794,82289,2.5,3.0,Lots of theory in class and then tests on examples and not theory. Really into his physlets which aren't really that good or helpful.
795,82289,1.5,4.0,"Awful. He was never available for help, he talked down to the students, then he gave tests that were borderline impossible."
796,82289,1.5,3.0,No Comments
797,82289,3.5,3.0,"All over the place; a lot of theory; good examples, not always explained clearly"
798,82291,1.0,4.0,"Professor Neidinger was the worst professor I've ever had. He lectured every class the whole class and his lectures were the least clear and most boring lectures on the planet. As someone who took calculus in high school, I knew most of the material, and he even had me confused. Final exam was horrible: studied for 17 hours and got a 75."
799,82291,5.0,2.0,"My class was a bit rowdy, because some people didn't take Calc 1 seriously. However, if you sit in front of the room, understand how he approaches the questions, and go to office hours, you'll find that Calc 1 is easy. His lectures are focused on solving examples, which coincide with his daily homework. Definitely read the textbook before homework!"
800,82291,5.0,3.0,"homework daily, but it is an easy grade booster. Tests are pretty easy and office hours are key. He helps you on homework there so you can get good grades on it."
801,82291,2.0,4.0,"Nightly graded homework. Lectures are essentially nonexistent. Learning in class is done through 2 or 3 examples done on the board followed by a &quot;real world application&quot; and a proof, there is very little actual teaching. Tests are difficult, but not impossible. He is accessible outside of class and helpful in office hours."
802,82291,2.0,5.0,"The class is really hard and we have a huge amount of homework, even for Thanksgiving break! However, he is a good lecturer."
803,82291,4.0,3.0,"Actually a pretty good professor. He is quirky and almost always in a good mood. He is extremely helpful in office hours, but he has a hard time responding to questions in emails. Lectures are generally good: sometimes confusing but he analyzes and explains things pretty well. Homework was long and graded harshly but was great prep for the tests."
804,82291,3.5,3.0,"A great teacher who is really enthusiastic about his job. Really likes to help students and will answer all your questions in office hours. Homework is long and graded somewhat harshly. Tests are fair if you understood homework material. As a math major I like him and am sad he's on sabbatical next year, as I was looking forward to another class."
805,82291,3.5,3.0,"Pretty straight forward. Lectures consist of doing proof for theorem you are doing, then 2 or 3 example. Homework was almost identical to lectures. Homework is mandatory as he collects and grades each one. Tests were challenging but not impossible. Very quirky dude, one time he danced in front of class to a song about the Pythagorean Theorem."
806,82291,3.5,3.0,"Average Davidson College professor. Pretty helpful in office hours, but he speaks so quickly that lectures can be confusing at times. The homework doesn't take too long and isn't hard to understand, but he is a very nit-picky grader so not a big difference between an A and a B. The tests are fairly difficult, but the homework is fairly good prep."
807,82291,3.5,3.0,"Neidinger has become one of my favorite math teachers. He tries to be funny and is really interested in his work. Because of this lectures and be kind of confusing . This class is not my favorite material-wise, and the homework is demanding. When you ask for help, he tries not to give the answer away."
808,82291,3.5,3.0,Tough class but a good teacher. Expects a lot from students but very helpful in office hours. Does mumble some but it's because he's so enthusiastic and loves his job. Laughs a lot and approachable. Homework is graded decently and returned on time. Tests are hard but not unreasonable.
809,82291,3.5,3.0,Mumbles in class and laughs at his own jokes. Really fast-paced but great in office hours. Loves what he does. Tests are okay if you know how to do the homework but homework is graded harshly.
810,82291,4.0,3.0,Dr. Neidinger is great! He's super corky during lectures which is funny. He explains material clearly and often gets really excited when explaining new concepts; he really loves math. Very understanding also and great in office hours.
811,82291,3.0,4.0,"Took Neidinger for Linear Algebra and honestly, that's a tough course on its own. Neidinger was hilarious in class and was always excited to teach because he loves math, but he was confusing most of the time (maybe it's the subject's fault). I just didn't get a lot of the material but he's super helpful in office hours. "
812,82291,4.0,4.0,"Neidinger is a good man, and he tries to be widely available to people in office hours and sometimes after class. Homework is graded harshly, and tests are relatively difficult, but that's the name of the game here. He returns homework quickly, describes things in more than one way during class, and is usually very friendly and approachable."
813,82291,1.0,5.0,"He is impossible for computer science. This is the equivalent of a 101 class but he assumes that you should just automatically know the material. His grading is very confusing. In office hours, he is misleading - told me that my program was ""great"" but then I got a 72%. Very frustrating, would not recommend this class."
814,82291,5.0,2.0,"Great professor to take in order to fulfill math requirement. He is incredibly cheerful in class, clear in what he expects of you, and reasonable in terms of works. He tends to go on tangents during class, but as long as you write down the essentials, you won't have much trouble studying."
815,82291,3.5,2.0,"As a math major and someone who has seen the material before, Calc 3 was easy for me, but what I didn't understand Neidinger explained very well.  Even though I've only had him for lower level math, I think I might ask him to be my adviser because he seems like a smart guy and is definitely helpful."
816,82291,5.0,3.0,"I loved Calc 3. Neidinger makes everything super clear and easy to understand. I would recommend this class. Also, he is super helpful in office hours and will meet with you outside of office hours as well."
817,82291,4.0,3.0,Great in office hours- kind of awkward lectures... but pretty straightforward.
818,82291,4.5,3.0,"He made math very straight forward, which made up for his sometimes awkward or boring lectures. His teaching was clear and tests were about the same difficulty as the homework."
819,82291,3.5,3.0,"First 3 weeks are hard if you haven't taken BC calc. Neid loves math, I would make sure yu have someone you can talk to about HW problems, and don't allow urself to fall behind."
820,82291,4.5,3.0,"Sticks to his syllabus. As a result he moves fast sometimes, but is very approachable and extremely helpful outside of class.  Goofy, funny, really likes math.  Good class, good prof."
821,82291,1.0,4.0,Is not very helpful if you fall behind - He expects everybody to get the material easily so therefore does not explain the material well if you are not able to get it the way he first explains it.
822,82291,4.5,2.0,Very excitable about math.  Neidinger truly loves teaching.
823,82291,4.5,2.0,"This man loves what he does.  Despite the fact that he is super excitable, he will go any lengths to make sure that you understand the material"
824,82291,4.5,3.0,"Wonderfully awkward and so excited about math. I liked the class, I liked the Neid."
825,82291,4.0,4.0,"I had him for calc II. He is a good lecturer, but he is even better 1 on 1. He's really funny and i'm not sure if he means to be. There is a lot of homework due each class, but to study for tests you really only need to study the notes. He's a good prof, its worth it to take his class."
826,82291,5.0,3.0,"Professor Neidinger is the sweetest man ever. He explains things well and is very helpful after class. Homework every night, in-class tests, and no quizzes. I highly recommend getting him as a teacher."
827,82291,2.5,3.0,"im not sure why these people say he was very clear. He was very nice, and sweet, btu hes not very clear i dont think at All... if youre good at math, hes probably okay, but if youre going to have trouble i think their are others who are more clear."
828,82291,5.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher, really clear and helpful, loves what he does"
829,82291,4.5,1.0,"Tests were easy, at least hour of homework for every class, no pop quizes. Very exicted to teach math, great math teacher."
830,82291,5.0,3.0,"Really sweet professor.  Helpful, and tests are on exactly what was taught."
831,82291,1.0,4.0,No Comments
832,82291,4.5,3.0,Awesome teacher- gets excited about math- explains very well- goes pretty fast
833,1786242,2.0,5.0,"most overrated prof @ Davidson. Yes, she is brilliant and I think she does legitimately cares about her students in her own, strange way. However, she micromanages to the point where you're wondering if what you're doing is your work, or hers. She's passive aggressive too and makes her unapproachable due to fear of her criticizing your every move. "
834,1786242,3.0,4.0,"Really enjoyed the content taught in psych 220, but at times Stutts' lectures could get boring. She will give you tons of feedback and help if you ask for it. Hard MC on tests, but short answers and essay questions straightforward. 2 essays/projects that bump up your grade. Have to work in this class, but A/A- is attainable."
835,1786242,4.0,4.0,"Super interesting and applicable material about stress/general health and psych. Lots of textbook readings, class is very lecture heavy. Tests have hard MC, but short answers/case studies are straight forward. 2 essays that can boost your grade. Very type A, but fair grader and nice person."
836,1786242,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Stutts is an amazing professor. She is always willing to meet in office hours, and it feels like she truly cares about her students. She offered great feedback on papers when I met with her, and I plan to take many more of her classes. While participation and attendance are mandatory, she makes going to class and engaging in discussion easy."
837,1786242,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Stutts is outstanding. Both knows and cares so much about her work, it makes participating in the class feel very worth it. For a freshman class, she is very helpful in setting you up for future courses while still helping you adjust. She loves teaching first thing in the morning, so if you can't participate fully at 8:05am, it will be brutal."
838,1786242,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Stutts is easily the best professor I've had at Davidson. You can tell she is so incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about her field. Her lectures are clear and she is helpful in office hours with papers. She also is the fastest grader; I received my exam grade the next day. She has high expectations but is fair, and you'll learn a ton."
839,1786242,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Stutts gives clear lectures, and her progression of content follows a logica flow, which makes the review easier. She provides essay templates for writing assignments, but make sure to check with her on content and she is willing to go over paper with you. Tests are fair as long as you review the content, but you do need to put some time."
840,1786242,5.0,3.0,Clear with instructions and grading criteria. Helpful during office hours and easier to get to know there. Makes a 75 min class go by quickly
841,1786242,5.0,4.0,"took my WRI 101 with Dr. Stutts. Because she expects so much from her students and is ridiculously organized, she can be kind of intimidating, but don't let that scare you off. She is an amazing professor and really helps you grow as a writer/ scholar. Pro Tip: Go to office hours (even when she doesn't require it). She will help you immensely."
842,1786242,3.0,3.0,"I don't recommend taking a class with Stutts. She assigns long readings in the textbook each week in preparation for a reading quiz almost every Thursday.  In addition, students have to complete forum posts once a week. There were also two 10 pg papers and four exams including the final. Attendance was mandatory."
843,1786242,5.0,3.0,"She is so nice and a genius. Talk with her about papers outside of class and you'll get a better grade. Read the textbook, ask questions, be on time. She's amazing and made an 8:15 fly by!"
844,1786242,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Stutts is one of my favorite professors at Davidson. Her classes are fascinating, relevant, and full of information. She uses powerpoints, lectures, group activities, video clips, clinical notes, and community involvement exercises all as learning notes. I've taken every single class she's ever taught; she's funny, personable, helpful, AWESOME"
845,1786242,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Stutts is incredible easily the best professor I've taken in the Psychology Department, and I would say the best I've taken at Davidson as well. She is dynamic, clear, fair, understanding but not easy, and funny. Seriously everything you could want in a professor, and one of the smartest women I've ever met. Take Dr. Stutts people !!!"
846,1786242,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Stutts is very smart, energetic, and passionate.  Her lectures are engaging and she facilitates great discussions.  She gives very clear directions and if you follow them, you'll do well.  Participation was important in my class, but I can't speak to others.  Take a class with her - you'll love it!"
847,1786242,5.0,3.0,"Wish i could have added more tags-Amazing professor, there for you, clear about her expectations and goals. I would recommend taking a class with her!"
848,1786242,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Stutts is without a doubt the best prof I've had at Davidson. She's smart, caring, and funny, and her assessments aren't that hard if you read the textbook. She made me want to major in psych. She talks kind of fast but I couldn't have asked for a better prof for both 101 and 234."
849,1786242,4.5,2.0,One of the best professors at Davidson. Class was always interesting even though it was an 8:15!
850,1786242,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I've had so far at Davidson. She's even making me reconsider my major. Stutts explains concepts so well and is so available outside of class for questions or just to chat. So glad I had the chance to take a class with her! Looking forward to taking her classes in the future!
851,1786242,5.0,3.0,"Excellent, always willing to help. Made class exciting everyday."
852,1786242,5.0,2.0,She is very helpful and goes over most of what you need to know in class. She is a great professor!!!
853,1786242,5.0,2.0,"Best professor by far that I have ever had at Davidson-and if this is her first year, she will only rise even further.  She is young, energetic, and fun, but also explains things very well inside and outside of class.  Office hours were helpful AND she wanted to talk.  If Davidson doesn't renew her contract, then it is an idiotic institution."
854,1786242,4.0,2.0,Dr. Stutts is young and very energetic. Her tests are mostly from notes and if you study you will do well. The writing assignments are interesting to do and applicable to class. She goes very quickly through the notes so you may miss some things here and there but she incorporates videos as nice breaks. Interesting class and good professor!
855,2009491,5.0,4.0,The most awesome and clear professor for Intro to Economics. I would recommend a class with him to anyone. Profitz is open to help anytime and give more than enough practice problems and resources to make the class easier.
856,2009491,4.0,2.0,"Profitz is the man. Young, witty, and self-deprecatingly awkward. He's a hilarious guy, gives very fair tests, and often manages to make ECO 101 (boring and beyond easy) actually interesting with his humor and real-world examples."
857,2009491,3.0,2.0,"Although I loved Fitz for both Econ 101 and Micro, I thought Latin American Economic Development was quite boring and very theoretical unlike math-heavy microeconomics (I personally like math-heavy). It's not much work and is easy but I often fell asleep in class. Take the class if you're an Econ major who needs the cultural diversity requirement"
858,2009491,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've had at Davidson. There are 3 tests and he will weight your best test 25%, second  best 15%, and worst 5%. Plus he puts last years tests and the year before tests online beforehand to help you study. Also posts solution guides to problem sets before they are due so everyone gets a 100 on homework. His lectures rock too."
859,2009491,4.0,4.0,"Fitz is as funny as an econ prof can be. He loves the material and cares about the students, but I had him in his first year as a prof and he has more to learn about the art of teaching. His tests are brutal and make you apply the concepts from lectures and homework in new ways. I got my worst grade at Davidson in his class but still like the guy."
860,2009491,4.5,2.0,"Hardly any outside work, the problem sets are helpful and fairly easy, plus he lets you work with others and gives you at least a week to complete a 1.5 hour max problem set. He assigns reading, but he goes over it all in class so it isn't necessary to do unless you are confused with the material. Tests are reasonable too. Proffitz rocks"
861,2009491,3.5,2.0,"A lot of reading for Latin American, but don't have to do it because he goes over all of it. Pretty easy class with a laid back professor. Boring though and kind of a lot of writing for a non-S course"
862,721305,5.0,2.0,"Professor Mills is an incredibly genuine, warm, and kind hearted woman. Her teaching style has been well refined by years of experience and her class was always one that I looked forward to. She is clear and thoughtful and a very good discussion leader. She is also not a terribly harsh grader and gives helpful, well thought out comments. Love her!"
863,721305,4.0,4.0,"This class is certainly not one to take if you're a slacker. She assigns a lot of reading, you get penalized for missing class, and participation is essential. As much as I tried to keep my head down in class, she'd still call on me, so be prepared for class. Nevertheless, she is sincere and helpful so I hold nothing against her."
864,721305,5.0,3.0,Professor Mills truly cares about each of her students. She even invited our class to her house for desserts right before exams started! The class was mainly discussion based with journals due midway through and at the end of the semester. I hope to take more classes with Dr. Mills in the future!
865,721305,3.5,4.0,Dr. Mills is extremely willing to talk to students about their work. She is especially good to see in person/during office hours. She expects a great deal from students and is a tough grader. This class is very much for prospective English majors.
866,721305,4.5,3.0,"Hands down the nicest, most sincere professor I've ever had. Dr. Mills has a genuine interest in students and their thoughts. She makes people want to talk in class and facilitates great class discussion. Journals sound a little overwhelming at first, but they truly are beneficial and she loves to get to know through them!"
867,721305,4.5,4.0,She's cool.
868,721305,5.0,3.0,"She's one great professor. Take her before you graduate with an English degree! She's approachable, friendly, willing to help always, and loves the material she teaches. She is well spoken and really wants everyone to do their best. It's refreshing. And her clothes are always so stylish, impresivo!"
869,721305,5.0,4.0,"Smart, funny, engaged, loves to teach and that's obvious.  Very helpful outside of class on projects and papers.  Made me want to major in English!"
870,721305,5.0,3.0,"The one word I would use to describe Dr. Mills is: SWEETHEART.  She's so kind and thoughtful, always encouraging you in your passions and endeavors.  Her grading is WELL THOUGHT OUT and well explained, and she begins each set of comments with your name as if writing a letter.  Basically, she's going to engage with you personally to succeed."
871,721305,4.5,3.0,"i really like her; she definitely knows her stuff.  although she is going to have her say, she respects any differences in opinions."
872,721305,1.0,5.0,Made me hate women poets--she can just come across as sort of crazy/loony.  No help if you go to see her.
873,721305,4.5,3.0,"Great at facilitating creative, interesting discussions. Warm and engaging. She did assign way too MUCH reading, though; it was impossible to do it all, yet her tests required us to be responsible for every word. Harsh grading scale; high grades were achievable on indiv. assignments, but final grade was likely capped at a B+ when we 1st walked in."
874,721306,2.0,5.0,"She refuses to give A's to anyone, has contradictory feedback, and no structured lesson plan. Absurdly almost no writing for a writing class, but harsh grading on the few writing submitted. "
875,721306,4.5,4.0,"While at Davidson, she was one of the best professors I had.  Is she conventional? No, however, she will make you see the importance of literature that is not necessarily a part of the canon.  She stresses character development and her writing style is organic and appealing.  I took three classes with her, including an independent study."
876,721306,1.5,3.0,"If you are shy like me, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  Very in your face and to be honest somewhat terrifying.  Very unclear about expectations; grades seemed completely arbitrary.  Also extremely unorganized.  Complains about how she would rather be elsewhere.  Overall, very poor teaching."
877,721306,1.5,4.0,"Awful.  I would never ever recommend her class.  She is extremely rude, and is far from understanding.  Her grading is arbitrary, and often contradictory.  Do not take her class unless it is necessary. Students bond  discussing how irrational she is. Advice: Just try to be on her good side."
878,721306,3.5,4.0,I had my eyes opened about the literature. Very passionate teacher. Very frank and old school. Very detailed-oriented. Helpful to those who are open and like to question the text. ALWAYS read. Be proactive and you'll get a lot out of the class. DETAILED tests.
879,721306,3.5,3.0,Enjoyed her class. Took a while to adjust to her style. She's frank and doesn't spoon-feed the work to you. Def controls the class but goes with the flow the class gives her. Learned alot about the Carib sensibility. Will take another class with her.
880,721306,2.5,2.0,"Tests were difficult very detail oriented...in order to do well you must take notes during class, especially on things you think are not important to know... Also she, skipped around on the syllabus a lot. Final grades were arbitrary...my test grades and final grades did not correlate (final grade was way higher), so stay on her good side."
881,721306,1.5,4.0,"Worst professor at Davidson. The syllabus is a complete waste of paper, she can't manage her time, and her reviews are bogus. There is no way of telling what you are going to be tested on, so you are left reviewing a ridiculous amount of material for nothing. Avoid her at all costs."
882,721306,3.5,2.0,"I loved Dr. Flanagan and Afr. Am. Lit. The class was mostly easy, except for our one review, but she was really funny and engaging. I never skipped a class b/c I didn't want to miss anything she said. Didn't learn too much on A.A. Lit but it's a great class for non-majors; just stay on her good side and your grade wil be fine."
883,721306,1.0,4.0,"HORRIBLE. extremely disorganized. slightly rude. lectures difficult to follow. we never did what we were scheduled to do. grades very strangely, inconsistently. did not teach the main authors of the Caribbean. I definitely do not feel like i learned anything important about Caribbean literature and absolutely do not recommend her"
884,721306,2.0,3.0,"Work load not bad, but difficult reviews. Disorganized and not well time-managed.  Arrogant and focuses only on her own home of Trinidad and related topics.  Cover your mouth when you yawn or she well call you out hard. Avoid."
885,721306,3.0,1.0,"Very fun! An awesome lecturer, I love her accent. She deserves a serious award for being able to keep my attention through an hour and fifteen minute class. fairly easy grader. often does not respond to emails&#63;"
886,721306,2.5,2.0,very energetic and fun.. easy but do not get a lot done.. she is extremely nice and fun to have
887,721306,2.0,2.0,"Completely disorganized and unclear. Often dumped the responsibility of teaching onto student presenters, guest lecturers, or movies that babysat us while she was absent b/c of a conference elsewhere. Never even taught us the periods of African-Amer. Lit. Was ultimately an easy grader but was VERY capricious in her grading. Was SO not worth it."
888,1651100,5.0,5.0,"Brian was an awesome instructor. I have been an Art Studio major for two years, and he was a huge step in my work and growth. He was always there to help the class understand the process of printmaking, and his patients was eternal. I fell lucky to have met him and to have the opportunity to learn from him. His stories were hilarious too."
889,1651100,5.0,1.0,Great Guy!
890,721318,3.0,2.0,"She's a nice person and brought our class lots of yummy baked goods, but the class was only ok. She over led group discussions and her writing prompts were sometimes really vague. She was helpful in office hours and was a fair grader. All in all, an easy Wri101 teacher"
891,721318,5.0,3.0,"Excellent, couldn't imagine taking this class with any other professor. She's passionate, very nice, and also challenging, which is what you want in a W professor. A's are well-earned in this class."
892,721318,3.5,3.0,Dr. Gibson is a very passionate teacher and loves her students. An interest in medieval literature is a must though to be engaged in the class. A lot of reading and be prepared to do a heavy amount of IDs on tests.
893,721318,4.5,1.0,"Dr. Gibson was one of the few teachers who seemed genuinely eager to teach every day. Her classes were only disappointing when no one was willing to discuss. For having such an ancient subject matter, I'm amazed she kept me interested."
894,721318,5.0,3.0,amazing.
895,721318,4.0,3.0,So fantastic! I could listen to her talk all day.
896,721318,4.0,3.0,She's very very passionate about what she's teaching... but unfortunately that passion can be lost on the students. I often found myself watching the clock. She's definately a tough grader and I couldn't figure out what it was she wanted.
897,1522088,5.0,4.0,"Nate graduated from Davidson in 2006, so he knows what it's like to be under the work load. That being said, he's really understanding and very approachable. The subject matter and direction of the projects are all up to you. Also, if you find something that you really want to do, you can talk to him and he'll make accommodationsarrangements."
898,1522088,4.5,3.0,"In the beginning my class didn't care for him, but we bonded with our many hours in the art studio, and came to like him a bunch! Extremely willing to help, you don't have to be an artist, just come eager."
899,2462125,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Spikes is just incredible. He's funny, you can get ahold of him if you need to miss and he is understanding, he gets the information you need to learn across, and all he expects is for you to pay attention, do the speeches and evaluations, and attend class. Super easy to pass and you'll be a better public speaker at the end of the course."
900,2462125,4.0,2.0,Super super light hw. Decently easy grader.
901,2462125,2.0,3.0,"He was very sketchy about grading and never showed us why we got the grades we got. Class, however was easy. We split time between presenting and taking notes on the reading. The tests were all open book."
902,2462127,5.0,4.0,"Unexpectedly, Modern China (HIS 386) ended up being my favorite class. She is a tough grader. If you're hoping for an A but writing isn't your strong suit, look elsewhere. Amazing lectures, she is clearly a genius and an expert in her field. Very helpful during office hours!"
903,2462127,5.0,3.0,"I really love the course. There are a lot of reading, but reasonable for a history class. Definitely not an easy grader, but she gives helpful feedback and really wants her students to learn more from the course. Take her class if you are interested in history. Don't take the class just for a graduation requirement."
904,2666925,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Sample is very considerate and would always hear out his student's thoughts about the course material. You don't have to worry about cold calling, or being pressured to speak. However, you should be prepared to talk with your table partners. Definitely one of my favorite professors at Davidson! I recommend taking one of his classes :)!!"
905,2666925,5.0,3.0,"I love Dr. Sample, he's an awesome professor! Always providing different modes of teaching which makes his course super engaging and fun to take. Definitely more engaged in sci-fi now. Fun texts and of course different ways of interacting with the materials. Both fun and chill class with cool topics to be learned!"
906,2666925,5.0,3.0,"Based on class discussions and light interesting readings -- occasionally, he would switch the type of homework and we'd watch episodes, a video, podcast, etc. Big assignments were fun and creative. Very organized, yet flexible professor. He's very enthusiastic, engaging, and teaches interesting topics. My favorite professor at Davidson by far!"
907,2666925,4.0,3.0,I enjoyed taking this class with Dr. Sample. Class was lighthearted and usually consisted of a discussion of the readings for homework.
908,377268,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Ramirez is a great professor, lecturer, and scientist. In class, he is incredibly friendly, very engaging, and offers helpful explanations of tough topics. Not so much in office hours. He doesn't display that same friendliness, give helpful feedback in office hours, or seem concerned about you. Did not feel welcome in office hours whatsoever."
909,377268,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed Psych 282 because of Dr. Ramirez. During class, he explains in great detail the readings that are assigned and always answers questions. He has a love for the topic and wants everyone to succeed along with learn as much as they can. I loved this class and found Dr. Ramirez to be an amazing teacher."
910,377268,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Ramirez is a great lecturer! He really does seem to love neuroscience. I like the professor, not the class. Thought I would be a psych major, took this class, and changed my mind. This class was all theory. All in all, love the professor, hated the class."
911,377268,4.5,3.0,Dr. Ramirez's specialty is neuroscience but he did a great job with the Learning course I took.  He is very helpful and understanding.  And he really cares about his students... and the rats.
912,377268,5.0,4.0,"Expect to read extreme amounts of text in order to do well.  Don't expect a social science class - his specialty is neuroscience.  The class is tough, but he is extremely nice and does his best to make the lectures interesting."
913,2492856,5.0,3.0,One of Davidson's best. He's a very gifted teacher who has a natural ability to just explain things clearly. He cares a lot about his students and it's clear he is invested in our success. Dr. TS is also easy to talk to in office hours and gives valuable advice about involvement in biology outside of the classroom. I can't wait to have him again.
914,2492856,5.0,3.0,"Dr. TS cares so much about his students and he is an amazing professor. He explains content very clearly. If you put in the effort you will do well. I rarely read the book and still got an A, so if you are short on time skip that. His lab is hard though, I recommend going to office hours for that."
915,2492856,5.0,3.0,Thurtle-Schmidt is hands down the best professor I have had at Davidson thus far! He has very engaging lectures and is very friendly and accessible outside of class. His charismatic personality makes his lectures very interesting. He is very straightforward about his expectations for the students and I would highly recommend him to anyone!
916,2492856,5.0,3.0,"Biochemistry is an intimidating subject that Dr. Thurtle-Schmidt made extremely approachable. His lectures were extremely clear and the class was comfortably paced. Very transparent on what we should know for tests; I had zero surprises. Super patient in lab, and always available in office hours for extra help no matter how simple a question."
917,2492856,5.0,4.0,Great teacher... explained this really well.
918,2492856,5.0,3.0,Absolutely amazing. Best professor I've had. His lectures were always to the point and he made sure the entire class understood the material before moving on. He was always very transparent about tests and what he expected you to understand. Always available outside of class.
919,377278,5.0,3.0,"The class was difficult, but only by nature of the material. Lectures were incredibly helpful- she teaches via examples in class- and I never felt like I needed to teach myself. There is moderate homework, but manageable if you plan ahead and get help if needed. She is great at explaining things in office hours and was always flexible w/ due dates."
920,377278,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Hauser is a good professor (her lectures align with the homework and exams), but the class is very hard and requires 20+ hours of work a week. As such, don't take this course with another difficult lab as the 20+ hours of work for CHE 220 prevents you from studying (and therefore excelling) in other courses.





"
921,377278,3.0,4.0,"SO MUCH BUSY WORK! Assigns an excessive amount of Mastery assignments so if you fall behind on those, your grade drops due to late points. Readily accessible though and open to offering incompletes (I had one). Offers clear lectures in class but homework is harder than practice problems. Nice lady, slightly awkward but answers questions in detail"
922,377278,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Hauser is a great professor who made me love chemistry! Her class is a lot of work but if you stay on top of things youll make it through and you will learn a ton. She is a very caring professor so if you need some flexibility, just ask. I rarely read the textbook except to brush up where I needed so dont waste time reading ever chapter."
923,377278,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Hauser was a great lecture professor for CHE220. She was very clear about expectation and was a very fair grader, and also didn't expect us to use the textbook to teach ourselves; if something wasn't taught in class directly, it wasn't on a test. Definitely not an easy class, but if you put in the work, you can do well."
924,377278,5.0,3.0,"Hauser's definitely a solid prof who cares about student success. Her tests are tough, but she's more than willing to work with you. Also doing the homework thoroughly/paying attention in lecture is a must if you want to succeed on reviews. The lab is tough, but we have a different lab teacher"
925,377278,5.0,4.0,"Big fan of her teaching style (applied problems that lend well to broader concepts) yet I understand how it could be problematic if the analytical approach to chemistry doesnt come naturally. Test grades have a big standard deviation. Reviews are tough but fair, and not harshly graded. Heavy but reasonable hw load. Interesting/challenging/friendly"
926,377278,1.0,4.0,"Hauser is the most clueless professor I have ever had.  She tries to make jokes throughout class, but they all just piss people off.  This class should be a joke, but Hauser makes this seemingly easy class one of the most insane classes I have ever taken.  She is so unclear and, even if you ask her questions, she will not answer.  Labs are long."
927,377278,4.0,4.0,"I had Hauser while she was team teaching ENV health with 2 other profs,  but  I found her lecture style to be fast pace & interesting. She definitely is demanding, but I was impressed with her ability to explain concepts to an intro class like env health even though she normally teaches upper-level chem. Worth it if your interested."
928,377278,2.0,5.0,"Take this professor. Not only is she nice, but she is EASY. This class is supposed to be difficult, but trust me, everyone who complains do so because they don't put in the work. A B+ is well within reach and she curves. Don't make the mistake of not taking her!"
929,377278,2.0,4.0,"The course is very disorganized.  Dr. Hauser is kind and well-meaning, but it is hard to keep track of expectations."
930,377278,3.0,3.0,often tells stories about her brain-dead kids and tales from her uneventful past and in this way makes analytical chem seem marginally less boring.
931,377278,1.5,5.0,"Maybe I'm just not meant to be a chemist..but...none of the info from 215 got through to me. Even after doing the assigned readings and problems, I was never prepared for the tests. Labs were miserable (long and grueling) and it was hard to make a good grade."
932,377278,1.5,2.0,Dr. hauser is a kind woman but a terrible teacher.  She lectures straight out of the book and isn't helpful during office hours.  I wish I had taken blauch.
933,377278,3.0,4.0,"so, i got great grades on the problem sets, but they didn't quite help me on the tests; those were not great.  and i usually left her office more confused than when i went in.  she really wanted to help and was nice about it, but what she said never made sense."
934,377278,5.0,3.0,"She was very clear, had a good class agenda, and always offered plenty of extra help."
935,377278,5.0,1.0,"dr. hauser is so clear.  very sweet and very helpful.  she lectures on exactly what she wants you to know, gives great study guides (past exams) and review sessions.  really made class enjoyable."
936,377278,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Hauser is a very good and very clear lecturer, so there's never any doubt as to what she means by something.  She is patient and helpful in lab and is sensitive to special situations(such as when you're the only female in the class...)"
937,377278,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Hauser does her best to make the material interesting and involve students in her lectures, but the class itself is very difficult.  A lot of reading/studying is needed in order to do well, and she assigns a lot of work."
938,336320,3.0,4.0,"Calc II was asynchronous, which really affected how I felt about the class. It was pretty hard, but Dr. Chartier made himself available to help. The embedded tutors are amazing. USE THEM. If you show effort, he'll notice and curve accordingly."
939,336320,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Chartier's is the BEST. He welcomes any kind of questions and never lets students feel like they are dumb. Not only that he gives very good advice in Office Hour, but if you prefer, you can also email him. He is excel at helping students imagine the mathematical problem situation, and he explains meaning behind formula well! TAKE HIS COURSE!!!"
940,336320,1.0,5.0,"Chartier is a complicated man. He is not a great teacher EXCEPT WHEN HE IS MIMING! Fortunately, he mimes frequently. If you want a good grade on the project, do your presentation in mine."
941,336320,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Chartier is such a chiller- he wants everyone to succeed and isn't in the game to destroy your GPA. If you go to class, do your homework and pay attention you'll do just great. He loves to tell you about his life and hear about yours and he genuinely cares about math. Even though I hate math, I didn't dread his class."
942,336320,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Chartier spends a good chunk of class time talking about his personal life instead of teaching the material. His infographic project has vague directions and little guidance. Is often traveling and takes a long time to respond to emails. Lectures are not engaging at all, very monotonous."
943,336320,5.0,3.0,"I'm terrible at math, but this professor made me feel like I could succeed. Very good at explaining concepts, gives partial credit in tests which helps A LOT and will always make time outside of class to meet with you and help you."
944,336320,5.0,2.0,He is an amazing professor. I just took the class as a distribution requirement and he made me enjoy math. 100% recommend it.
945,336320,4.0,4.0,"Chartier's a great guy and pretty funny. Pretty good at explaining stuff, very helpful in office. Very caring prof. Super cute dog he brings to office hours. Homework was challenging and and tests were surprisingly tricky."
946,336320,4.0,3.0,Chartier is a good teacher and an even better person. He will make you laugh pretty much every class and does not have a hard time connecting with students. He is quite helpful in office hours and a pretty good lecturer. The homework load was reasonable (about 3-4 hours per week) and graded leniently. The tests were quite a bit harder. Not bad!!!
947,336320,4.0,3.0,Chartier is a great professor. He's great at explaining things in a way that makes it easier to understand. Homework is graded fairly but tests will need you to be able to apply those concepts a little more broadly. Highly recommend. Very friendly and great in office hours.
948,336320,4.0,3.0,One of the best teachers at Davidson. Really enthusiastic about his work. Makes the material easy to understand. Very willing to help outside of class. Homework is decent and graded fairly but the tests are tough. Know the homework and the material and be able to apply it.
949,336320,4.5,1.0,"Chartier is an awesome teacher. He cares about his students and really loves to teach. I found his grading fair and easy, and not too much work. I would recommend him."
950,336320,5.0,2.0,"He is great, always helps you and really nice clear and great."
951,336320,4.0,3.0,"I have had Dr. Chartier as my professor for multiple courses, and I have enjoyed him in each course. Very charismatic, very helpful. His classes are appropriately challenging, but if you put in the work you should have no problem."
952,336320,4.0,2.0,Very friendly and helpful.  Lectures are easy to follow and he is more than willing to slow down to explain a topic. Always telling stories to make class more enjoyable.  Finite math with Chartier is a great class for non-majors.
953,336320,5.0,3.0,Finite Math with Chartier is the ideal math class for non-majors. A challenge at times but really not too bad. Chartier is very nice and engaging and only wishes for everyone to do the best they can and learn to appreciate math. He will also be the only math teacher you will ever have who is also a professional mime. Talks about his kids non-stop.
954,336320,5.0,2.0,"I went into this class not expecting to like math much - just fill the requirement and move on. Chartier goes out of his way to make sure the concepts are understandable and relatable, and will leave some parts off of tests if he thinks they aren't important or engaging enough. Easily one of the best professors I've had at Davidson."
955,336320,5.0,4.0,Great teacher and very quirky. He may have the greatest vocabulary ever for a math professor though.
956,336320,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Chartier is GREAT. Do whatever you can to take his class, he really tries his best to ensure that his students understand the material. His office hours are amazing, and he goes over any homework problems with you to make sure you get it. His tests are really difficult, but the homework really helps. He is funny and brilliant guy. Take his clas"
957,336320,5.0,5.0,"His explanations are great. His tests are very hard though, but he does make the class interesting"
958,336320,4.5,5.0,"Chartier's a great professor who explains things pretty well. The course material of calc 135 is tough, but Chartier starts from the beginning and really made things understandable. He can be kind of arrogant (just let him get started on his mime gig) but class is interesting and it's sometimes fun when he mimes the material."
959,336320,3.5,4.0,"Though Chartier is a nice guy and generally fair, his teaching style did not work for me at all.  If you had problems on the homework, you HAD to go to office hours, since he wouldn't go over anything in class.  Also -- he unconsciously started trying to mime 3d figures.. which did not work for me at all, since I need to see things on paper."
960,336320,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Chartier is absolutely amazing! Take him if at all possible. He is extremely clear in notes and homework follows notes very closely.  Extremely helpful during office hours. tests are not too harsh, he gives partial credit. funny guy who cares a lot about his students and who really wants to help students learn math."
961,336320,5.0,3.0,I had absolutely no interest in math and dreaded having to take a math course at Davidson....but Dr. Chartier changed all that.  The class has been one of my favorite courses taken in college.  Dr. Chartier is very good at explaining concepts and is clearly very interested in the subject matter and in helping students learn.  And he's a mime!
962,336320,5.0,4.0,"He's probably the best calculus teacher...his lectures are interesting (he's a professional mime) and he's extremely helpful in office hours. Watch out for the curveballs he throws on tests, though."
963,336320,3.0,3.0,"a lot of the class had to do with mime and his son... and bringing pineapples.  he ginuinely wants to help people understand math better, but doesn't quite get it when his students are still confused"
964,336320,5.0,1.0,"This is the best class ever!!!  If you want to learn a lot of really cool stuff about infinity, probability (and loads of other topics), watch mime sketches, and play with math toys, take this class with this prof!  It is always fun and Dr. Chartier is always really helpful, caring, and interesting."
965,336320,4.5,4.0,"Chartier pretty much rocks.  But, if you're taking Calc II, DO NOT expect the easy grade.  You will have to work hard to do well on his tests.  Homework = the easy grade.  And don't forget...he has performed internationally as a mime!  Very helpful in office hours.  Has a great sense of humor."
966,336320,5.0,2.0,"An awesome professor and a really cool, friendly guy. He is the kind of professor who will strike up conversation with you outside of class. Genuinely cares about his students and wants to see everyone do well. Definitely a great class for non-majors or majors who want to take something on the light side!"
967,336320,4.5,4.0,No Comments
968,336320,5.0,1.0,Motivates the material of the course very well.  Sometimes gets frustrated when students don't immediately pick up on lecture points.  Easy grader.
969,336320,4.5,1.0,"Much of class is spent on things having nothing to do with the topic, such as movie technology and mime."
970,57804,5.0,4.0,"He is retired this year, but he deserves great appreciation despite his overall score. Dr Davis is the most knowledgeable mathematician I've ever seen, and you can see that math is his passion in the class. Sometimes he goes to his own math universe, but I was really glad to have him as my prof. He never punishes you for non-calculus mistakes."
971,57804,5.0,4.0,"As one of the three authors of the calculus textbook, Professor Davis is indeed very intelligent and his lectures are very content-heavy. One advice would be to read the section the day before the lecture so that you can understand what's going on on the day of the lecture. Although his lectures may be tough, his tests are very reasonable and fair."
972,57804,4.0,4.0,"Be prepared for a lot of in class note taking, and pay attention to example problems.  Reading sections in the textbook also helps.  Writs and reviews are very fair.  Davis laughs at himself for little quirks on his computer math program."
973,57804,5.0,3.0,"I took his calc3 and algebra courses. I really don't understand why the average is only 2.5. He explains key concepts very clearly and make things easy to understand. He lots of homework for calc3, but anything less than that would clearly be insufficient. If he is really a tough grader, then every professor at Davidson is a tough grader."
974,57804,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Davis is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met.  Gives clear lectures with lots of examples to make things concrete. Very fair grader on tests and homework, and gives valuable feedback on proofs. Help is always available. The course material is also interesting. I learned so much and had a lot of fun taking this course with him."
975,57804,2.5,4.0,"Dr. Davis is an extremely intelligent professor. Help was available always, however, I didn't go to his office hours because I did not find them helpful. His tests are tough, you will have to study a bunch to get above a B. His lectures were confusing and he often made mistakes while doing problems. I would not recommend taking his class."
976,57804,3.5,3.0,"Much easier than Math130 (calc 2). It seems as if there was more material covered in Calc2 than Calc3. In reality it was about the same. The material covered is easier to relate with each other. Dr Davis assigns homework every single class. As long as you understand how to do the homework, his reviews should be easy."
977,57804,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Davis is a brilliant professor. He knows the material really well. If you need help, be sure that you have clear and concise question to receive a meaningful answer. His tests are tricky. As long as you understand and are able to do the homework, his test should be manageable."
978,57804,3.5,5.0,"Yes, his class is hard. However, lot of people who take his course are taking Calc 2, one of the hardest courses anyone can take (regardless of professor). He always will walk you through problems as long as you ask and devote a bit of time to the class, as one should. If you struggle with math do not take this class. He also makes decent jokes."
979,57804,1.0,5.0,He is an awful teacher who is unclear. Going to him for help doesn't do anything- I have spent way too many hours in the tutoring center because of him ugh. 
980,57804,1.0,5.0,"Simply Awful, Nice guy when you meet with him.  You won't get any help but nice guy.  Avoid this class at all costs, no credit for showing work miss one part miss the question.  He is simply not fit to teach basic math."
981,57804,2.5,4.0,"Dr. Davis is a nice person. He will always be there to help you during office hours, even though sometimes he might be confusing. His class was more like a lecture and attendance is essential to understanding the material. Homework is rather tough - maybe harder than the tests - but he doesn't really count it (5%). "
982,57804,2.0,4.0,"Don't. Just don't. I had BC Calc before this, but I  left every class confused. He assigns homework on topics that he doesn't teach, and going to office hours is not particularly helpful. Davis is incredibly smart, but not good at explaining. The reviews and writs weren't terrible, but daily class is not enjoyable. "
983,57804,2.0,5.0,"This has been my worst class. Davis is a very kind person but does not tell the objectives of the lesson, I'd leave the class not knowing what I was supposed to have learned. I taught everything myself and even when I knew the material the tests were next to impossible. I got 2 questions right and he curved it to a B.  Do not recommend."
984,57804,1.0,5.0,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. If you are not a math person, which you may not be if you're taking no previous exposure do not take this course. Steven Davis is the worst math teacher I have ever had. His teaching style is not helpful to visual learners nor people who struggle with abstract concepts. Ridiculous amount of homework. Stay away"
985,57804,3.0,5.0,"A genius, but unfortunately he is so smart that he expects you to know everything except what you are supposed to learn in class. Doesn't teach in class. Homework is impossible to do with out going to office hours. Only take this class if you took AP Calc in high school and know everything already..."
986,57804,3.0,5.0,"Too Smart for his own good. Understands the material so expects you to understand it as well. Doesn't teach in class and gives a lot of homework. Extremely helpful in office hours, but you won't really learn anything in class. Expects you to teach yourself."
987,57804,2.5,4.0,Doesn't teach at all. Homework is nearly impossible to do. Take this class only if you love to teach yourself.
988,57804,2.5,4.0,"Dr. Davis is a very smart, however he is very hard to learn from. I spent so many hours in the math and science center and in his office hours. He really wants to help so office hours are useful, but for the most part you will have to teach yourself. Tests are hard and he assigns a lot of homework."
989,57804,3.5,3.0,"Difficult class for me.  Nice professor who was willing to help, but explanations and lectures weren't the easiest to follow."
990,57804,4.0,2.0,"Davis explains things clearly but his lectures move fast.  If you look away for even a minute, you will be lost.  His tests are challenging but not unreasonable and he often curves.  He doesn't penalize for trivial mistakes even if they give you a wrong answer.  If you are bad at math, beware.  Otherwise, you'll be fine."
991,57804,1.5,5.0,"His classes were pointless to attend, the assignments were the same difficulty whether I attended class or not. He does not explain concepts well."
992,57804,3.0,4.0,"This is a difficult class, and I spent 3-5 hours on homework (twice a week). His lectures focus more on proving calculus concepts rather than teaching you how to do the problems, which can be frustrating when doing the homework. Tests are difficult, but he grades fairly on how much you know."
993,57804,2.0,5.0,I learned completely from the textbook-not what you want to do in a math class. I wanted to major in math before this class- not anymore. He is very smart but his notes are useless and tests are impossible though you probably wont fail them.
994,57804,1.5,5.0,"the worst math teacher ever. lectures show what the word 'boring' really means. tests and quizzez are hard, hws are not bad, mathematica labs are sometimes hard, but do not count much for your grade. 2 reviews and 2 quizzez and final exam are only graded materials, so you really need to do well. helpful outside, but still wont be able to understand"
995,57804,3.5,2.0,He's not necessarily easy yet if you do all of your homework and study all of your notes you will do perfectly fine. Take good notes and see him the minute you are having trouble he WILL help! Scrambled at times while teaching but once the material and his teaching style sinks in he's easier to understand.
996,57804,3.5,5.0,"He's a genius and really knows his stuff, but he's a little all over the place as far as teaching. You really need to do a lot of oustide work to understand the material for yourself."
997,57804,3.0,4.0,Teaches at one level and tests at another. Hard tests. quizes are take home. nerdy. DO NOT TAKE his classes
998,57804,1.5,5.0,by far the worst prof i ever met in my life.
999,57804,4.5,4.0,very difficult tests but quizzes were not quite as difficult.  the homework takes awhile even though it is not a large part of your grade.  definitely curves tests. extremely fair even though difficult. such a nice guy! extremely helpful and always willing to meet!
1000,57804,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Davis is a genius.... But at times expects us to be geniuses as well when we're mere Davidson students. Tests are damn hard, although the work isn't too bad..."
1001,57804,1.5,5.0,"worst professor i had so far, his teaching style in computer science was not clear in the slightest, seeing him outside class helps negligibly, had to work incredibly hard just to pass the class & it has left a permanent dent in my GPA, don't take him under any circumstance!"
1002,57804,2.0,4.0,Hard! :(
1003,57804,1.0,5.0,The only way I could describe how horrible a professor Davis is would be to use his own crappy grading scale: a G on his: &quot;God-awful.&quot; DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!
1004,57804,3.5,5.0,"While Dr. Davis definitely knows his stuff, the class sessions were often boring and the tests were incredibly difficult."
1005,57804,3.0,3.0,"I find that his class is hard and he is not the best teacher, but he's such a nice guy!  His tests are very hard, but he secretly curves them, so you'll get a B- when you should have gotten a D or F.  This is my second semester in a row having him."
1006,57804,2.5,4.0,"He's very hard and his class is very boring, but that's just him.  I think overall, he's a good teacher, but it's a struggle to stay awake.  Very hard tests and quizzes."
1007,57804,3.0,3.0,"Nice guy. But insanely boring. Class was virtually naptime, which was frustrating beyond belief. Very helpful in office hours, but classtime was the most boring experience of my life. I don't fall asleep in class. Ever. But I did! Every time! Was better than calc for a non-math person, but rough."
1008,57804,2.0,4.0,Very boring.  I don't remember the last time I didn't doze off in class.
1009,57804,2.5,4.0,I really don't like this class.
1010,57804,1.0,5.0,You could do homework and work problems and still have no clue what to do when you opened a test...it seemed to not be related to class work at all.
1011,57804,3.0,4.0,Davis is not that great of a teacher you have to learn from the book or go to his office hours.
1012,57804,2.5,3.0,"great grading scale: A,B,C,D,E (euphemism for failing), F,G (God awful bad)"

1018,1872360,5.0,3.0,Professor Costa is one of the best professors I've had at Davidson. She sets extremely clear expectations and provides a lot of thorough and detailed comments. She deeply cares about all of her students and desires for them to succeed. Her honesty coupled with her knowledge of theatre make her class well worth taking!
1019,1872360,4.0,4.0,"Listen, she's not for everyone, but she is a good professor. I learned so much in her class. Yes, she's tough, and she can sometimes be disrespectful and cross boundaries. But she really cares for her students. She cares about their mental health and wellbeing. She's a good professor... albeit a bit (a lot) unconventional."
1020,1872360,1.0,2.0,"This class was a hugely disappointing experience for me to say the least. I found Professor Costa to be condescending, and disrespectful to her students. I looked forward to taking this class, but left after always feeling dejected by her poor treatment of  myself and the other students. Theater class should be enjoyable-not something you dread."
1021,1872360,4.0,3.0,She's a great professor! Sometimes a little harsh but overall she wants to help. This class does require a lot of work but it's manageable.
1022,2607601,5.0,2.0,Dr. Frazier-Rath is one of the best foreign language teachers I've had. She genuinely cares about her students success and persists in being an iconic teacher. The classes are fun because she makes them fun.
1023,2607601,5.0,2.0,Dr. Frazier-Rath is one of the best professors I've ever had! She is incredibly knowledgable and down to earth. The course was discussion based and students were involved in designing the syllabus. There is a lot of homework assigned but it is worth it. I learned so much just speaking with her. She is also very accommodating and approachable.
1024,213498,5.0,4.0,I took his Literary Analysis class and absolutely loved it!! By far favorite class and professor at Davidson so far!! He's is so accessible outside of class and very helpful and insightful. 100% suggest taking a class taught by him. He isn't an easy grader but very fair.
1025,213498,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ingram is hands down one of the best professors I have ever had. He makes class fun and engaging, and class always flew by. He is incredibly knowledgeable and made me love the material. His intro to Shakespeare class is amazing and even if you don't have much of an interest, you will get into it. Would highly recommend taking his classes."
1026,213498,5.0,3.0,"Randy is the best professor I have ever had.  He is a great guy and is always willing to help you when you need it.  He will routinely expand office hours to help students and will bring candy to class.  The one caveat is that he is a tough grader, but if you work with him, he will always help you out.  If you ever have the chance, take Randy! "
1027,213498,5.0,3.0,Dr. Ingram is arguably one of the best professors I have taken at Davidson. He is very knowledgable about anything Shakespeare and his Intro to Shakespeare class is amazing! He's not easy but not too difficult to do well. You just have to put in effort and if you genuinely enjoy Shakespeare it helps alot! He's also amazing to casually chat with!
1028,213498,4.5,3.0,Dr. Ingram is easily one of the best teachers I've ever had.  He made both class and typically dry readings thoroughly enjoyable.  He's hilarious and will have you laughing the whole class period. DEFINITELY take this class!!
1029,213498,5.0,3.0,"Great professor for humanities, and the lectures he gives are awesome. A great sense of humor and very meaningful insights and contributions to discussions without being overbearing. Fair grader."
1030,213498,5.0,4.0,"Considering this was not my favorite subject matter, Dr. Ingram made this class fantastic.  I loved every minute of it...even having to do the readings I hated.  One of the best professors I've ever had."
1031,213498,5.0,3.0,"Loved Dr. Ingram...thought I would hate the survey but he made it very enjoyable. It was my favorite class and he is one of the best profs at Davidson. Hilarious, interesting, nice etc. TAKE HIS CLASS!!!"
1032,213498,5.0,3.0,"Each of Randy's Brit Lit classes is organized around a clear thesis.  Listen for it -  it will help you along.  Randy makes this otherwise boring material worthwhile.  Wonderful, hilarious professor.  Randy is a MUST for english majors and the overall davidson experience."
1033,213498,3.0,4.0,"Average lecturer & capricious grader w/very unclear expectations of written work. Some long, very dry, and boring readings. Class would've been a complete chore if he weren't at least likeable as a human being. As a prof., I've definitely had better; his appearance, dinners, movies, etc., don't change that. I'm not a fan."
1034,213498,4.5,1.0,"Love Randy Ingram. . . not only does he look like Kevin Spacey, but he's an awesome teacher as well."
1035,213498,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ingram is an excellent professor.  Unfortunately, I don't think I got the most of him as one because our class was a seminar.  I wish he had said more and my classmates less.  Nonetheless, he got us excited about Shakespeare.  The evening movie showings and dinner at his house were a nice touch."
1036,213498,5.0,3.0,"Incredible.  Inspired, witty, brilliant--easily the best professor I've had.  You'll work hard but he's worth it.  His class always felt like something out the &quot;Dead Poet's Society.&quot;  On sabbitical 05-06."
1037,213498,5.0,4.0,AN AWESOME PROFESSOR!!!!
1038,213498,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor. Very funny. Knows what he's talking about. Very fair, though tough, grader. Very interested in the material. Has us over for movies and dinner classes. Bottom line: The kind of prof you came here for."
1039,213498,4.0,3.0,Dr. Ingram is the man.
1040,213498,5.0,4.0,"Really knows how to work with students on writing. Fun in class, made me want to go to my 8:30."
1041,213498,5.0,3.0,"Incredible professor! Ingram is very intelligent, funny, and likeable, and he enjoys his job and does it well. Leads excellent discussions and manages to get everyone involved and liking English! A definite recommendation."
1042,213498,5.0,4.0,"Interesting lectures and class discussions.  He's a tough grader, but very fair.  You'll get a lot out of his classes."
1043,1026567,5.0,3.0,Professor Boyd is the sweetest teacher! She cares so much about her students and truly values mental health. She is flexible with assignments. Weekly quizzes are extremely manageable and the tests are open note. I highly recommend taking psychology with her! 
1044,1026567,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Boyd is 100% the best PSY101 professor, especially w/ COVID! She's incredibly caring, and does a wonderful job of teaching you practical psychological skills to de-stress, sleep more, etc. in addition to typical PSY 101 topics. The course gives a basic overview of lots of topics, so it's a good foundational course to figure out your interests."
1045,1026567,5.0,3.0,She was an amazing professor. She cared so much about her students and was very reasonable. Anyone lucky enough to take her class will surely appreciate having done so. You will learn a lot and have a fun time doing so.
1046,1026567,4.0,3.0,"Dr Boyd's lectures are very interesting, informative, and fast paced. For tests, she is very helpful and available during office hours. She works to ensure that grading is based on different strengths and wants to see you succeed."
1047,1026567,5.0,3.0,"Excellent professor. Clear, detailed lectures. Clear grading criteria for assignments and great feedback. Exams were fair and as expected. Did not test anything not on her study guide. Very fair grader. Also very caring and understanding of students stresses at Davidson. Very interesting class and worth taking even if you are not a Psych major."
1048,1026567,5.0,4.0,Professor Boyd has a deep knowledge and understanding of the material and does a great job of conveying the material clearly and thoroughly. Make sure to pay attention to the personal examples of different concepts that she provides during class. Print out the Powerpoints on Moodle for class and use those to write what she says during class.
1049,1026567,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Boyd is both a wonderful person and professor. She is engaging, enthusiastic, and focused. Her class is not easy, and you have to put in work to do well, but it's great and if you are willing to exert the effort, you will succeed. The class was fairly assignment heavy. Don't take this class thinking it'll be the easy 4th class in your schedule."
1050,1026567,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boyd is the best professor to take 310 with. Her lectures are engaging and she's a very fair grader. The tests and assignments are tough, but she's always available for help."
1051,1026567,4.5,3.0,"I absolutely loved this class! She always keeps its interesting and will answer any questions you have, she is super helpful in office hours and help me so much when I missed days due to an injury requiring surgery. Absolutely take her class, she is a genuinely nice person and an AMAZING professor"
1052,1026567,4.5,2.0,"One of the best professors that I have ever had! She is energetic, engaging, and always ready to help! She does a good job of linking the material learned to current events and always has activities to do in class. Not too hard if you study a bit."
1053,1026567,5.0,1.0,"Dr.Boyd is THE BEST psychology teacher you can take.  Her lectures are always interesting, she is extremely helpful through email or office hours, and it is easy to do well in her class if you try.  She gives you very clear study guides for reviews AND the final. Everyone should take PSY 101 with her even they arent psych majors. You wont regret it"
1054,1026567,4.5,3.0,"Even if you are not interested in psychology, you have to take Psych 101 with her. She brought us play-doh to relieve stress the other day. Her outlines are clear, and she is always available for office hours. Super nice, super helpful."
1055,1026567,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boyd has made learning psych stats very fun and interesting. While the material is a little complicated by nature, she really does her best to make sure everyone understands."
1056,1026567,5.0,2.0,"If you were even remotely interested I demand you take psych with Boyd. She's amazing. LOTS OF INFO THO.. but she simplifies and test are fair and str8forward (not meant to trick you) She really cares & it's obvious. I'm not psych major but I looked forward to this class EVERY day. Interesting material, great class, great professor. Can't go wrong!"
1057,1026567,5.0,2.0,Awesome professor! I have fallen in love with psychology because of her. She is extremely fair and clear in what she expects us to learn. Her tests are fair and only on material covered in class. Definitely take her class!
1058,1026567,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic teacher. Her outlines help you set up your notes in an organized way. Tests are really straightforward and only on material covered in class. Such a fun teacher, definitely take her class!"
1059,1026567,5.0,3.0,"The course covered a lot of material and therefore the tests took a considerable amount of time to study well for, but she kept lectures engaging and was super helpful outside of class! If you take good, detailed notes, you hardly need to read the textbook--mainly just study your notes for the tests. I definitely recommend her!"
1060,1026567,5.0,2.0,"LOVE her.  She is the reason why I am a psych. major.  She really wants her students to succeed and lets you know exactly what she expects of you.  If you do it, getting an A is not difficult.  The subject matter wasn't the most interesting, but she made up for it."
1061,1026567,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Boyd is really helpful and understanding.She is a fair grade. Let's you know whats going to be on the test. You do not need to have taken a psychology class prior to this, you'll probably end up loving psych after the 101 class with her"
1062,1026567,5.0,2.0,Dr. Boyd was by far the best professor I've had at Davidson! Her lectures are interesting and well-organized. She's very understanding without being a push-over. Made me decide to become a psych major.
1063,1026567,5.0,3.0,"TAKE BOYD'S CLASS! She is such an awesome professor. Not only is she extremely organized and clear, but she also brings in cookies and chocolate! Talk to her during office hours; she's incredibly helpful and approachable. Don't slack on reading and ask her questions because she does test you on everything! But a great class and a great professor!"
1064,1026567,4.5,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVEN'T EVER TAKEN PSYCH! Dr. Boyd is an amazing professor, but if you don't have a backround in this class it's super hard. Make sure to read the textbook! Dr. Boyd is very interesting, knows her stuff, is super helpful, and truly wants you to succeed. Her lectures are rarely ever boring. Great Professor!"
1065,1026567,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Boyd is a really nice, engaging, and quality professor. The survey course moves fast enough to keep up student interest, but concepts are not too difficult. The course is not a breeze, although a good grade is possible if enough work is put in. I would recommend the class."
1066,1026567,5.0,3.0,"I love Professor Boyd. I had never taken psychology before, and after her class I decided to become a psychology major."
1067,1026567,4.5,1.0,"Boyd was always friendly and her classes were never boring. The assigned reading was totally pointless, you learned everything in class. Tests were simply memorization of facts, not too difficult."
1068,1026567,5.0,3.0,"Awesome! Always loved going to her class, especially helpful and conducts great lectures! TAKE BOYD! GOOD LIFE DECISION!"

1070,2185739,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Icard is so funny and so engaging, especially when he tells stories from his practice. His tests make up almost all of the class's points and are difficult, but he's an easy grader when it comes to other assignments. He does reviews before each of the tests and covers what will be on them, which is very handy. Overall a really fun professor!"
1071,2185739,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Icard is an easy professor. Everyday we finished class early and his lectures are clear and to the point, but he talks pretty fast. Not really any homework outside of class other than the research review due at the end of the semester. He spells out what will be on the test during the review session and the tests are all multiple choice."
1072,2185739,5.0,1.0,"Icard was a wonderful professor and very understanding! I highly, highly recommend taking a class with him. The material was super interesting. As long as you show up to class and take notes on the lectures, it is not difficult to pass. There are only a few tests and one project throughout the semester."
1073,2185739,5.0,2.0,I enjoyed his class and all the stories he has about diagnosing people with different psychological conditions. You learn so much that has larger real-life applications. Get ready to really study his powerpoints and notes to do well on tests.
1074,2185739,5.0,2.0,Dr. Icard is the bomb! He wants his students to succeed. His tests are straight-forward and his lecture material is SO applicable to life outside of his class. I will 100% be taking more classes with him in the future. 10/10 recommend.
1075,2185739,5.0,3.0,This class is one of my favorites that I've taken at Davidson. The material is fascinating and taught in a very practical and interesting way because Prof Icard brings his own experience from running a private practice into his lectures. He puts his lecture power points up on Moodle which is extremely helpful. Highly recommend taking his class.
1076,2185739,5.0,3.0,"I honestly love this man. If you have the chance, take him!!!"
1077,2185739,5.0,3.0,Professor Icard is soooo AWESOME and so easy and fun to look at :)
1078,2185739,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Icard is the absolute bomb. There is a lot of content to learn this class, but that comes with the territory. He is amazingly receptive, intelligent, very chill, super interesting to listen to, and is very lenient. He teaches off of his power points and does his best to avoid surprises on a test. Would take his class again in a heartbeat!"
1079,1843725,3.0,2.0,"His lectures put the class to sleep. That being said, he is a super nice guy and really likes teaching. Tests weren't hard but he grades papers somewhat toughly. Attendance isn't mandatory which is nice."
1080,1843725,3.0,2.0,"He is a really really nice guy, however, he is really really boring. He's very helpful though."
1081,2638367,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Gay is a very caring and engaging professor. If you are looking for a light work load and a GPA boost, I definitely recommend taking his classes! You don't need to read to participate in class (much of classes are general discussions). He formats the classes so students have flexility to chose which papers they want to do which was nice."
1082,1853985,1.0,3.0,Pretty easy in terms of work if you can figure out what she wants. Most of the time she is extremely unclear about the assignments and makes you want to pull your hair out. 
1083,1853985,1.0,1.0,A nice woman with absolutely no idea what she's doing. Easy class if you already know spanish. Horrible at explaining grammar.
1084,1853985,2.0,3.0,Doesn't help at all. Very confusing and unorganized. 
1085,1853985,5.0,1.0,"Easiest Spanish class I've ever taken. If you do the work, you get an A."
1086,1853985,2.0,2.0,"The lectures are more discussion based since it's assumed that grammar fundamentals have already been established in previous classes. It really helps when everyone participates, although that may not usually be the case because she's unclear at times. Tests are hit and miss, but writing assignments are straightforward. Workbook isn't checked often"
1087,1853985,1.0,5.0,"Reinaga is a terrible professor! Difficult to understand, classes are not structured well, tests are extremely difficult, and office hours are pointless. Unless you are ridiculously good at Spanish grammar, do not take any Spanish 201 with her."
1088,2282022,5.0,1.0,Dr. Horowitz was lovely. She really cares about her students (both in relation to school and personally) and it shows! She's really easy to work with and her feedback was helpful. Very easy A if you show effort :)
1089,2282022,5.0,2.0,"(I was actually in WRI 210 but it wasn't an option above) Dr. Katie is definitely one of my favorite professors at Davidson. She's well-organized, caring, and always willing to help if you ask for it. Her grades are fair and feedback is super helpful. Getting a good grade isn't a problem if you put work into it."
1090,2282022,5.0,2.0,"Kaite Horowitz is truly one of the best professors Davidson has to offer. Not only does she foster empathy, cultivate dynamic discussions, and promote learning within her classroom, she also truly strengthens each student to become a better writer. Feedback on drafts and in her office hours are both beneficial and clear."
1091,2282022,5.0,2.0,"Professor Horowitz is a great, non-conventional teacher. She is a great speaker and truly supportive of her students, their identity, and their beliefs. Outside of learning how to read, she teaches empathy and real-world issues that everyone would be aware of. She truly values your learning over the assignment. I highly recommend any of her classes"
1092,2282022,5.0,2.0,Want to take an easy writing class? Prof. Horowitz is an amazing professor and really cares about her students. Her assignments are easy to follow and you can ask her for feedback before its due.
1093,2282022,5.0,2.0,"Really enjoyed this class! Excellent job at teaching dense societal concepts -- gender, sexuality, etc. Very fun and enjoyable assigned readings -- learned more about topics I never really knew abt but important to learn. Classes were led by student discussions. Cares about creating a safe and inclusive learning environment for students"
1094,2282022,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Horowitz is one of the best professors I've ever had, and you shouldn't get through your college career without taking a class with her. Brilliant, engaging, and has a well-rounded understanding of a large number of gender, sexuality, racial, and class subjects. Makes dense subjects so easy to understand!"
1095,2282022,5.0,2.0,Her #MeToo writing class was my favorite. She has high expectations but is very understanding and grades easy. She is passionate and extremely knowledgeable in her field and available outside of class. I'm definitely keeping an eye out for her future courses!
1096,2282022,5.0,2.0,"I had GSS101 with Dr. Horowitz and it was one of my favorite classes. The class was fun, engaging, and thought provoking, and is part of the reason why I am now so interested in studying Gender and Sexuality Studies. She is an amazing professor and everyone should take a class with her!"
1097,2282022,5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors I have ever had. Very good at facilitating class discussions and articulating what she is trying to say. The class material is very interesting, and class flies by because she makes it fun. My only complaint would be that she takes forever to grade things and get it back to you."
1098,2282022,5.0,3.0,"WOW! Katie Horowitz is the best professor on the face of this planet. She is so encouraging and kind, and she's also a master (mistress?) of her field. I truly loved my time in her classes, and would recommend her to everybody. She will change the way you look at the world in the best way possible and the best accomplice ever. Thank you, Dr. Katie!"
1099,631350,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ringle's GIS course can be really great for hands-on learners. You learn ArcGIS (marketable skill!) with pretty realistic scenarios that can easily be applied to real life. He'll ask you to do a final project to showcase the skills you learn, which is useful; just be sure to pick a topic you actually care about/have real data to support."
1100,631350,4.0,4.0,Dr. Ringle is perhaps the most knowledgable professor I have ever had. He is so passionate about his work and I think it really showed in his lectures. Some were boring but most of them were interesting. The exams are mainly textbook based so it was great to really listen to the lectures and absorb the material. Wonderful!
1101,631350,3.0,3.0,"This class requires a lot of reading and class participation. Test require remembering everything said in class and read for homework. The lectures are boring. He grades on the tough side but it usually reflects the time you put in to the assignment. Overall, average class and decent teacher. He tries to connect and be funny but it's really just awkward."
1102,631350,2.5,4.0,This was a very confusing class. No structure to his lectures so material is hard to follow and put into notes. Quite boring lectures too so it was a struggle. Reading selections seemed quite random at times and I still don't know how it all tied together. Also posed very strange questions. He's clearly very intelligent but shouldn't teach.
1103,631350,1.0,5.0,"This professor is incredibly boring and is generally not open to help unless you come to see him at his office hours. If it doesn't fit your schedule, tough luck. Classes are miserably boring and topics covered are usually uninteresting. If you need to take an Anthro class, there are much better options available."
1104,631350,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Ringle is a nice guy, but his classes are terribly boring. He isn't very clear in class, but one on one he can be very helpful. He's even more helpful if you pretend to be interested in the material. Beware of this class if don't plan on putting in 110%. He covers a ton of material and expects you to know it all."
1105,631350,3.5,4.0,"People like to hate on Ringle. He's fair, relaxed, and cool (though mostly because he's uncool and has become retroactively cool). Great teacher, fun/hard class"
1106,631350,3.0,3.0,"Lectures are the most boring experiences of your life. The books he assigns are uninteresting and hard to understand, but he's at least aware of this fact. His grading is hard to understand, but for the most part fair. He's not cool, but he is nice."
1107,631350,1.0,5.0,"Dr Ringle is the most boring teacher ever. Class is a drag, and he is never available to help. He is a harsh grader and expects his class to be your entire life."
1108,631350,4.0,3.0,"The subject material is less interesting in this intro course, but he shows A great interest in the topics he teaches, and is very helpful if you visit his office. Test may me a little difficult, but he is not an incredibly difficult grader. Papers are also not harshly graded. Great professor. One of the best at davidson. He even curves."
1109,631350,4.0,2.0,"Very interesting topics. He shows A great interest in the topics he teaches, and is very helpful if you visit his office. Test may me a little difficult, but he is not an incredibly difficult grader. Papers are also not harshly graded. Great professor. One of the best at davidson. He even curves."
1110,631350,1.0,5.0,"Dr Ringle is very difficult. His lectures are extremely boring and there is no way to memorize everything you need to for the tests. He is not available and when you manage to track him down, he is not helpful at all. STAY AWAY! Worst class in Davidson."
1111,631350,2.0,4.0,"SO BORING. It is physically impossible to stay awake during his lectures and he assigns impossible amounts of reading. even for davidson. He is probably one of the least accessible professors at Davidson and a perfect example of how overrated they are. Unless you are an Anthropology major, I say avoid him at all costs"
1112,631350,2.0,3.0,"Very knowledgeable, but never, EVER take a class with him. Unless, of, course, you are an anthro major and enjoy treacherous readings and unbelievably dull and confusing lectures. All the awkward moments do offer some comic relief."
1113,631350,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ringle is by far my favorite professor ever. He has taught me so much about Mesoamerica that I have decided to change my major to Anthropology. I find his sense of style refreshing, and his personality endearing. Take his class if you want a professor who not only cares about his subject, but about his students well-being as well."
1114,631350,1.5,4.0,"stay away!  he will bore you to tears and frustrate the heck out of you.  at first he seems sweet and caring, but he's the most inaccessible professor at davidson.  lectures drone on, he expects you to do way too much reading, and he wears horrible sweaters in the winter time."
1115,631350,4.0,3.0,I think some of these comments are unnecessarily harsh. Dr. Ringle's class is interesting and he is very informative. He is always available for extra help. He is clearly very passionate about his field and it makes his lectures fun! My only complaint is that he didn't have very many graded assignments. Study hard for tests!
1116,631350,2.5,4.0,No Comments
1117,631350,2.5,4.0,"Low level course, but taught as if for senior majors.  Very difficult tests/assignments, extremely boring lectures.  Lots of memorization.  Really nice, definitely knowledgeable."
1118,631350,1.0,3.0,Horrible professor. Had no idea what my grade was going to be during the semester. We didn't have any graded assignment until 3/4 through the semester.
1119,703030,2.0,4.0,"I wouldn't recommend taking a class with Dr. Savage. While he is a very insightful person, his grading is super weird and random. I have received worse grades on art that he told me was better than art I have gotten better grades on. He is also very harsh and blunt in critiques and feedback. Don't take this class if you're sensitive lol"
1120,703030,4.0,3.0,Love this teacher and pretty easy to get a B even if you haven't done any kind of art before. Definitely recommend meeting with him before sculptures are due to talk about your ideas and to get his feedback before grading. Requires 7 hours per week outside of class so be aware of that because that is extremely important for getting a good grade. 
1121,703030,4.0,3.0,"Savage is awesome. I didn't understand a lot of what he said about metaphors and artistic expression, but still loved sculpture class and learned a lot. He is long-winded in the lectures though and doesn't always make sense. Easy B, hard to get an A."
1122,703030,5.0,3.0,"Maybe one of my favorite people I've ever met. You are MISSING OUT if you don't take at least B asic Scuplt with him. Doesn't matter if you're ""not good at art."" He's very different, you can still do well in his class with a good attitude."
1123,703030,4.5,3.0,"This man will change your life.  Brilliant, easy going, incredibly caring, and devoted to those who work hard and care about their work.  He alone is worth all of the tuition I pay to go to Davidson. Take sculpture."
1124,703030,5.0,3.0,"Amazing person and professor.  Best professor I had at Davidson. Lets you do whatever you want for class.  The more you get to know him, the more you like him.  Make sure he sees you working in the studio.  Also use the lab tech as much as possible, if it's still Josh, he really knows his stuff.  He has the ability to make a good project, great."
1125,703030,4.5,4.0,"Cort is the man.  Hard to say much else.  Josh, the current studio technician, is awesome as well.  Both are incredibly helpful and knowledgeable guys.  The sculpture studio is ridiculously well equipped.  Cort expects a lot of studio hours out of you, but is generally receptive to any genuine ideas you have."
1126,703030,2.5,4.0,"He was nice and funny, very knowledgeable. Class was very time consuming and you had to have lots of time to spend in the studio. He has high expectations. A friend of mine failed the first assignment bc he felt she hadnt spent the 6 hrs/assignment minimum when she had, she had just never drawn before."
1127,703030,4.0,4.0,"basic drawing: Likes modern art and uses it for many examples, as a result you learn about your subject matter as well as mod art. Very interesting. Learned tons from class. Have a new appreciation for art. Fair grader. Very hard to deviate from a B grade in the class. Strongly recomend. I had 0 art experience before and he really tried to help."
1128,703030,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Savage is laid-back and comical; he cracks jokes & speaks in funny accents. He is good about letting kids do their own thing, but he has high expectations & will dish out a C if you make crap. He likes to see kids working in the studio; work on your project when he can see you! Go see him during office hours; he's bad at responding to emails."
1129,703030,4.0,3.0,"Not only is Cort laid back, but he's an amazing artist and really patient with all of his students. By far one of the best classes at Davidson yet. Simply put this class is awesome and he's an amazing professor!"
1130,236092,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Churchill cares about improvement in her class; wherever you start from in terms of writing ability doesn't matter as much as your upward trend and commitment to improving your writing. Her readings weren't as helpful as they were time consuming, but my writing improved and I don't regret taking her class. Also flexible with extensions + grades"
1131,236092,3.0,4.0,"She's good not great. She is quirky, for better or worse, but she's a decent person. Her class is bizarre and can either be very funny or stressful. She can turn on a time between being super understanding and kind to unbelievably passive aggressive; in fact, one of the most passive aggressive people ive met. Her grading is tough but very helpful"
1132,236092,5.0,3.0,Dr. Churchill is awesome and my writing improved dramatically from her class.  She really encourages you to think and her class cultivates unique insights and critical thinking.  She is very organized prompt passionate open and truly a breath of fresh air from many of the humanities English polysci philosophy professors at Davidson.
1133,236092,4.5,4.0,"She tends to switch between being really cool and funny and incredibly judgmental at the drop of a hat. Very helpful with her comments on papers, but a tough grader."
1134,236092,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Churchill is one of my favorite professors.  She does require a lot of work, but nothing unmanageable if you want to learn.  Definitely visit office hours; she is extremely helpful and excites you about writing! She is a tough grader, but she's willing to help you improve.  She is intimidating at first, but when you get to know her she's great!"
1135,236092,4.5,4.0,"Churchill is so amazing. It's refreshing to see a professor like her who really cares about her students. She is a stickler for detail but her office hours are GREAT! if you usually dont use office hrs plz reconsider with this one. Very Tough grader. Expects ALOT but is understanding, manageable, and considerate. Forces you to think and BE CREATIVE"
1136,236092,5.0,5.0,"She knows her stuff, but for a writing course she expects too much out of the class.  There are assignments or reading for basically every class.  If you are looking to be an English major and want to improve a lot in your writing, then take her class, but the mass amounts of busy work are not worth it for someone just looking to get a decent grade"
1137,236092,5.0,4.0,"Go see her about your papers, and take her advice seriously. She grades fairly hard, but is extremely helpful. She'll also push you to think about stuff to write about. Overall, she's a great teacher, and I would highly recommend her."
1138,236092,3.5,4.0,You can definitely tell she is one smart cookie and she knows her stuff when it comes to Literature and English which can make her slightly intimidating. She expects a lot out of your writing but I thought my writing definitely improved over the course of the semester. Good professor overall.
1139,236092,5.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed the readings for this class and I loved her lectures.  Her classes are never dull and she tries to incorporate pictures, audio, and video, which is diverting and holds everyone's attention.  While she can be tough grading papers and brutally honest, she is generally witty, clever, and helpful.  I would take another class with her."
1140,236092,4.5,2.0,"She's a great teacher with a passion for not only the subject matter, but for her student's understanding of the subject matter.  I highly reccomend her class."
1141,236092,5.0,3.0,Great professor.
1142,236092,4.5,4.0,"An exceptional teacher. She's fun, funny, and very helpful, and she made me reach potential that I didn't even know I had. I was really stretched and challenged, but my skills in literary analysis and writing grew tremendously. Overall, an enjoyable but quite tough prof. and course. Both are totally worth your while."
1143,236092,4.5,3.0,Best teacher at Davidson
1144,236092,5.0,4.0,Great class discussions. Always willing to talk and help outside of class.
1145,236092,5.0,4.0,"best prof i've had at davidson! yeah she's tuff, but she's fun, too. if ur looking for an easy a take someone else, but if you really want to learn this is the one. no problem with guys, by the way, that's ridiculous, take it from this guy."
1146,236092,5.0,5.0,"Very cool.  Don't know where people are coming from with the 'man hating' thing--she's friendly and fun, and antagonistic only when effective in debates. Asks a lot of her class, but you emerge a MUCH better writer. Taught me best things on writing I've ever learned. Worth the hard work."
1147,236092,4.0,4.0,"ah! this class is muy dificil.. but also totally worthwhile. it'll hurt you, and don't expect anything better than a B on ANY assignment, but you'll come out of it a much better writer."
1148,236092,4.0,4.0,"She was very helpful, and encouraged people to see her outside of class.  Very nice person, and any claim that she does not like guys is completely unjustified."
1149,236092,2.5,4.0,"not a fan, bitter, rude, did not make interesting literature enjoyable.... i wish i hadn't spent a month trying to understand what she wants because it is entirely impossible"
1150,236092,4.0,4.0,"Smoking hot! There's something about her that is very attractive. Although thought to be a man-hater, I found her open, thoughtful, and entertaining. She is a feminist, but not the buzz-cut kind."

1155,2185789,5.0,3.0,By far my favorite professor at Davidson. Too bad she is leaving.
1156,2185789,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Adnot is great both in and outside the classroom. The reading was a bit intensive but it is not necessary to take notes to do well on memo assignments. Also, go to class, she literally uses every second of class time and assumes everyone will be present for her in-class work. Overall, if youre looking for a caring professor take her."
1157,2185789,5.0,3.0,Dr. Adnot is new to Davidson this year but really understands her students and genuinely tries to make sure learning is fun and applicable. She only has a few assignments but enough to where nothing is a maker or breaker. Dr. Adnot is inspirational both in and out of class and values learning before grades and is always willing to give feedback.
1158,2185789,4.0,4.0,"She gives great feedback, has varied and interesting lectures, and is incredibly thorough. Tough both in terms of workload and material, but you can tell that you're learning relevant information the whole time. LOTS of reading, but reading almost always consists of foundational/influential texts that are regularly referenced n the field."
1159,1296957,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fache is an amazing professor.  She is nice and cordial even though she demands good work from you.  Highly Recommended.
1160,1296957,4.0,2.0,"Madame Fache is one of the most genuine and caring professors at Davidson. She heads the class in a way that makes all students, regardless of language ability, feel comfortable. Her sunny disposition and light workload will never make you regret taking the course!"
1161,1296957,3.0,4.0,Caroline always makes class enjoyable and is overall a very good teacher. There were pop quizzes and the exams were very hard. Lots of unpleasant surprises. Bon chance ;)
1162,1296957,3.5,2.0,"Great professor! Assigns short sections of homework problems every night that she doesn't check, but are helpful in doing well overall and on pop-quizzes. Do the work ahead of time and you'll be fine; you will get what you put into it. Fache is wonderful to talk to outside of class! She also does a good job of creating a stress-free environment"
1163,1296957,5.0,5.0,Wonderful professor -- very helpful and class is always fun.  Very fair on the writing assignments.  Just do the work and you'll do great.
1164,1296957,4.5,2.0,Great professor. Class is always interesting and engaging with her and is not too hard. Just show interest and do some genuine work and you'll be fine.
1165,1684038,2.0,3.0,He never had a lesson plan and was always very nervous. There's literally 4 essays and that's it.
1166,1684038,4.5,1.0,"Friendly, slightly nervous guy. I learned a ton, and the material was very interesting. Fair & forgiving grader. Very confersational guy. Also head of the center for ethics and sponsors great talks!"
1167,139848,4.0,4.0,"I took his class when he was a visiting professor at George Washington Univ., probably in 1983.  Several people make reference to his obsession with his mortality.  When I had him as a professor, I think he was a preacher/pastor/something like that.  He understood how science and life fit together.  I did go on to medical school, never forgot him."
1168,139848,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Putnam is a strange lecturer. He is laidback, humorous, and consumed by his own mortality. If he finishes lecture early, he'll ramble on about life to kill time. He is a big kid and wants to leave class and lab as much as we do. He does want you to succeed tho and I learned SO MUCH. But warning, it is a ton of memorization and cramming."
1169,139848,2.5,3.0,"Dr. Putnam's strengths are definitely in his role as Premedical Advisor. His lectures are extremely disorganized, and trying to ascertain what he sees as important is like drawing names out of a hat. That said, he's a really nice guy and I love his stories, although he is obsessed with his own mortality. No lab reports. Only 4 grades for the class."
1170,139848,3.5,4.0,Putnam is the best bio prof i have had. very very approachable and veru funny! Great class
1171,139848,1.5,4.0,"Greatest bio prof i have had. very very approachable. great, funny guy"
1172,139848,2.5,3.0,"Lab is interesting, lecture leaves a lot to be desired..."
1173,139848,3.0,4.0,No Comments
1174,139848,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Putnam is a dirty old man but he's hilarious.  you'll be writing as many quotes as notes, and if you do the work, you'll get a very good understanding of what's going on"
1175,139848,4.0,4.0,Arrogant from all the pre-meds spending all their time sucking up to him.
1176,139848,5.0,3.0,"Really nice, don't be intimidated by him just because he's the premed director.  He'll expect you to work, but if you do your grade will show it."
1177,139848,4.0,4.0,No Comments
1178,139849,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Nutt is an amazing professor. He's the most cutest professor ever! Tests are hard but he's always available and will do anything to make sure you understand the material. tests will prepare you for the MCAT. spots, problem/review sessions are super helpful. Problems sets are somewhat long, but again, helpful. labs are fairly graded."
1179,139849,4.5,4.0,Exemplary professor. He shall surely be missed.
1180,139849,4.0,3.0,"Professor Nutt is a total boss. He's super old/old school, but is literally the nicest guy ever and will do anything he can to help you, as long as you haven't been a lazy idiot. He is challenging yet fair and will force you to understand the concepts… which is the point. Highly recommend"
1181,139849,4.5,4.0,"Great. great professor. Office hours really help and the problem sessions and review sessions are really beneficial. Do the problem sets and you'll do fine on reviews. do the web experiments, extra credit is always a plus. problem sets vary from each set, one week it'll be hard, and the next week it'll be a breeze."
1182,139849,4.5,2.0,"Nutt's a great professor; take him especially if you're trying to prepare for the MCAT.  Some say his reviews can be difficult; however, they're similar to practice tests he hands out and are easily manageable as long as you know your chemistry.  Always available for outside help.  Great guy."
1183,139849,3.5,4.0,"If you're looking for an easy way out of Chemistry 115 don't take Nutt.  However, if you're looking to leave the class actually prepared for further Chem classes take Nutt.  He's an awesome professor and although his reviews are hard he really wants to help and gives extra credit."
1184,139849,3.5,5.0,"The class is hard as hell from the get go, especially the first month or two when you're getting used to his handwriting and really scattered lectures. Do the spots a few times over and go to all the review sessions (I can't stress this enough) and you'll be good. Labs are easy enough, reviews are a b*tch but again, do the spots and you'll be good."
1185,139849,5.0,2.0,"He is a great teacher. He is very clear, he offers extra credit, and will help you out whenever. He has problem sessions right before every problem set is due and review sessions too. The best teacher I've had so far."
1186,139849,4.5,4.0,"By far, my favorite prof at Davidson. He is super nice and super helpful. He understands that this is a hard class, and helps students by giving the previous semesters' tests, spots, to help study. Has problem sessions were he goes over difficult problems on the homework or in the spots. A pretty hard class, but Nutt made it interesting."
1187,139849,4.5,4.0,"Nutt is one of the most helpful professors at Davidson. The man truly cares about you learning the material and he will go to any length to help you out. Go to his review sessions and do the spots and you should be fine. But if you need the help, he's there for you."
1188,139849,3.0,3.0,"The material is pretty difficult but Nutt makes it easy to do well by giving practice tests, making labs easy, and giving out Web Experiments which are basically extra credit."
1189,139849,4.0,4.0,Dr. Nutt was awesome. Problem sessions were extremely helpful. Tests were fair. Use the spots.
1190,139849,4.5,4.0,"He is a great professor. His tests are challenging, but he has sessions the afternoon before every Problem Set is due and the afternoon before each test. If you go to these, know the lecture notes, and study the old tests he makes available you will do well in his class. The web experiments help your grade a lot. He's very helpful outside of class."
1191,139849,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Nutt is by far the most helpful and approachable teacher I've ever had.  I've never known a teacher willing to stay until 6:30 at night to make sure that everyone understands the material.  The class is hard, but if you study and do your work, you'll be fine.  I don't think I'll find a better professor during my college career."
1192,139849,3.0,4.0,Nutt is one of those professors that shouldn't be teaching at 8:30 AM becuase he is less awake then you are. That said he is an extremely nice guy and overall a great professor. Tests are hard so do the Web Experiments and the old tests (spots) before hand. If you do that you'll be fine. He also provides help session every week to go over homework.
1193,139849,4.5,5.0,"SO HARD!!!!! He is probably the nicest professor on campus though. Be prepared to get some not great grades on tests. Class goes very fast and can be very frustrating, but he is very willing and happy to help!!!"
1194,139849,2.5,5.0,Confusing at times.  Lots of work.
1195,139849,3.5,4.0,"I had troubled understanding the concepts and would have benefited going to office hours (he's a much better teacher one-on-one) but test averages in that class were horrendous!  Labs are really easy, but boring, and only worth 20% of the final grade.  NO lab reports due, which is always nice."
1196,139849,3.5,4.0,"Tough class that requires a ton of work, but Dr. Nutt was very helpful outside of class."
1197,139849,5.0,5.0,"Chemistry is going to be hard. BUT, Dr. Nutt was so kind, helpful, and a very forgiving grader! I enjoyed being taught by him!  DO YOUR WEB EXPERIMENTS! They're quick and help your grade so much!  Dr. Nutt knows our entire huge class by name, and is very willing to go the extra mile to help you!"
1198,139849,4.0,4.0,chemistry stinks.
1199,139849,3.5,2.0,No real complaints here
1200,139849,4.0,4.0,"Chemistry at Davidson is going to be hard, whoever you take it from, but Dr. Nutt is one of the best professors as far as clarity goes.  Plus, a supernice guy."
1201,139849,3.5,4.0,Dr Nutt is a hard teacher but if you work hard you will do fine. Tests are really hard so labs and problem sets bring up your grade. You will have to do a lot of work in this class to do well.
1202,139849,3.5,3.0,"The tests were relatively straight forward, but he'll throw a question or two into every test that covers something you only barely touched on in class.  However, as Chem teachers at Davidson go, Dr. Nutt's one of the easier ones."
1203,139849,4.0,3.0,"If you need help, go to his office.  There is a caveat, however, you must show that you worked hard trying to understand the problems BEFORE coming to see him.  Tests are difficult but the lab grade helps you along."
1204,139849,4.5,2.0,Take it in the spring when there are fewer students.  He really will give you a lot of help if you need it.  Good guy.
1205,139849,3.0,4.0,"He rewrites his online notes on the board, and calls that teaching class.  The test are very complicated and ten times more confusing than any of the examples in his notes.  The problem sets take atleast two days to do."
1206,139849,1.5,4.0,"Standard lecture teacher. Students might as well be a number and if you don't get it, tough."
1207,1974870,2.5,4.0,Very hard teacher with extremely hard tests. Homework is graded harshly but the project can boost your grade slightly. Not recommended. Condescending and just not very good.
1208,1974870,5.0,3.0,Class always interesting and material is explained very well.  She is great in office hours and very willing to help.  The textbook is very readable and helpful as well.  The tests are really tough but the homework is a great preparation for it.  Probably the best math professor in the department but unfortunately she's only a visiting professor. 
1209,1974870,3.5,5.0,"Bloody hard teacher with 20-hour-long exams and subjective grading. She's great in office hours, but class is mediocre. She explains things clearly but doesn't usually explain things. She can be condescending sometimes. She tries to reach out to her students, but her steep grade deflation has lost my respect for her. Proceed with caution."
1210,1974870,4.0,5.0,"She gives incredibly difficult exams and grades homework very harshly. Her teaching methods are very strange and are only effective for some students. She is young and tries to reach out to students, but only in office hours is she actually helpful. Things are explained somewhat clearly at times but not always. I wouldn't recommend if you want an A"
1211,1974870,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor who really likes what she teaches. Extremely knowledgeable, helpful and reachable. Really cares about her students. Tough tests but doable. Doesn't keep attendance but better participate in class and show that you have put some thought on the material. Would definitely take her classes again."
1212,1974870,4.5,4.0,"she is a nice and young lady who really tries her best to reach out to students and be helpful. but expectations are high, and tests are lengthy and difficult. lectures are goos, but homework is still hard and might require office hours. you're not likely to get on her bad side, but make sure you don't."
1213,1974870,4.5,2.0,"She's young and fun, and understanding if you don't understand something. She never seems condescending if you don't understand something, is available for lots of outside help, and also is clear about what she expects you to understand. "
1214,266843,1.0,4.0,"One of my worst experiences at Davidson. Pretentious, rude, obnoxious. He made me feel like I couldn't succeed. I've never received lower than a B on an essay in all my time at Davidson, but he made me feel stupid and incompetent. He will tear you down if you don't meet his standards. If I could go back and take this course... well I wouldn't. "
1215,266843,1.0,3.0,"Very full of himself. Very large ego. Difficult to please. All-in-all, just not a very kind professor. "
1216,266843,2.0,4.0,"Pretentious and hard to please. He will mark down stylistic choices without explaining why. When I asked him how to improve in the course, he said he couldn't help me. I did fairly well overall, but he was a headache, and I would not take him again."
1217,266843,4.0,3.0,"Professor Parker is great. He does not openly state his expectations, but the class is very engaging. His discussions are interesting and thought provoking. He is genuinely interested in what his students think. He does not hold a lot of office hours, however."
1218,266843,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Parker is great, my favorite professor at Davidson so far. Highly intelligent and very entertaining lecturer. It may take a few weeks of class for him to grow on you, though. Classes are heavily discussion based, so read thoroughly and go into each class with a few solid ideas about the reading you'll do fine."
1219,266843,5.0,4.0,"If you have ever smiled, cried, or felt any emotion over a book in your entire life, Prof Parker (if you give him the chance) will help you help yourself understand why. And that may be the best gift any professor has ever given me. He's knows more than you. And he always will. If you are okay with that he will make you a better student and person."
1220,266843,4.5,3.0,"A total genius, albeit quite quirky and sarcastic--so you better like a dry sense of humor. DEFINITELY take Parker for Intro to Fiction, not Nelson. He is kinder and a better overall teacher. I learned a lot from his creative writing tips and skills."
1221,266843,4.5,3.0,"I had zero interest in English going into this class, but I ended up loving it thanks to Prof. Parker! Parker is very sarcastic and quirky, but thats what makes the class great.  He will tell you that he is not everyones professor and its true. If you can take a joke and want to read good books, then he is your guy. No regrets at all."
1222,266843,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Parker is an acquired taste. I had him for Intro and Advanced fiction writing- at first I thought he was pretentious and obnoxious (which he kind of is...) but by the end of the semester I loved him. He's a fair grader, offers great advice for your writing, and always takes the time to ask about how YOU are doing. Great, if quirky, professor."
1223,266843,3.5,3.0,I had him for Intro to Fiction Writing and he's my advisor. He's an incredibly quirky guy but he's great. Class was always interesting. You have to devote time to your work and reading other people's work but it's always fun to read what other people do. The one-page assignments are kind of hard. You don't really get grades until the very end- grr
1224,266843,5.0,4.0,Pr. P is a rare gem.  Consider yourself lucky if you get to spend time with him and talk poems.
1225,266843,4.5,4.0,"Parker is one of those rare professors that actually cares about your life.  If you take the time to invest in his class, he will invest in your success.  I sincerely adore him.  Please take classes with him.  He has helped my writing and helped me make several life decisions."
1226,266843,4.5,4.0,"He is intimidating for the first few weeks of class, but you get past that.  He is a great teacher.  More than that, he's a great person. He is really interested in his students and is always willing to help. By the end of this class I decided to major in English, and asked him to be my advisor."
1227,266843,5.0,4.0,"People love him or despise him...the truth is, like it or not, he's smarter and better read than you.If you think thats ego,he also knows that he's only smarter and better read because he's been doing it since he was our age. If you think he's pretentious, take him again a year or two later after you've read more. You'll see he was right all along."
1228,266843,4.0,4.0,"Liked him more as the semester wore on.  He's one of those teachers you have to get used to.  Very difficult to get a good grade, but also difficult to get a bad one.  Great books.  Discussions were incredibly theoretical, so get ready for that.  I wasn't always certain what in the world we were talking about!  I recommend this class for majors."
1229,266843,3.0,5.0,"he has an ego and is a terrifying grader, but as an individual hes kinda nice."
1230,266843,4.0,2.0,"If you have any interest in writing poetry, this is the class to take. The Parkerisms are nonstop, he always has a witty comments to say, but he also really wants to help people become better at poetry. You can tell he is passionate about it and you will really benefit if you are passionate too."
1231,266843,4.5,4.0,"I've had Parker for Intro to Poetry Writing, and can't say enough about him.  He's amazing; although he may seem pretentious, he is incredibly helpful and knowledgeable of his craft.  Hilariously witty and really fun to be around.  Kind and fair, and ready to help you be the best poet you can."
1232,266843,1.0,4.0,"Very hard. Pretentious. As long as you kiss his ass, you will do fine in his class. However, he does have his moments, few thogh they are."
1233,266843,4.5,3.0,No Comments
1234,266843,1.0,3.0,"Unclear, pretentious, presumptuous."
1235,309854,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Alexander is one of the friendliest professors I've ever had. I truly wish he taught more classes than just Politics of North Africa, because I'd take them! He knows his material and will bring in AMAZING speakers. He literally knows the authors of everything he assigns us to read. We got to talk to many of them when they visited too..."
1236,309854,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Alexander is awesome and I wish he taught more than North African Politics. His lectures are full of the best stories, and he isn't a tough grader at all. He's just an all-around cool guy who really likes talking to his students. I've told all my friends to take his class"
1237,309854,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Alexander is the man.One of my favorite professors in my time here, and great with majors and nonmajors alike."
1238,309854,5.0,2.0,"This class was awesome. His discussions and lectures are incredibly interesting and if you bring questions to him in his office he is very helpful. The best professor I've had at Davidson, by far!"
1239,309854,5.0,3.0,THE BEST OF THE BEST!!! A MUST MUST MUST!!!
1240,309854,5.0,3.0,Simply the BEST of the BEST!! A MUST MUST MUST take.
1241,309854,5.0,3.0,"EXCELLENT class, excellent professor.  Very sharp and a pleasure to listen to.  He sums up so much information that by the time the semester is over, you really have a good handle on international politics.  highly recommend!"
1242,309854,5.0,3.0,Good teacher and always willing to help with great advice.
1243,309854,4.5,2.0,Great class.
1244,309854,4.5,1.0,"Great guy.  If he can overcome his biases and stick to syllabi, will make a very strong professor."
1245,309859,5.0,4.0,"I took intro poly sci, Quest for Justice from Prof. Ahrnesdorf as a freshman at Kenyon College over thirty years ago. I remember the classes fondly and my disappointment when he left after his visiting professor sting concluded. His enthusiasm for the subject and teaching was obvious and a key reason why I became a political science major."
1246,309859,4.0,2.0,"Kind, nice professor. Classes are lectures and you'll be expected to regurgitate information for papers, so make sure to take notes. Accounts for growth when grading, and always responds quickly to emails."
1247,309859,4.0,3.0,I loved having class with Professor Ahrensdorf. He is so accessible out of class and really made an effort to know me as a person and not just a student. He cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Take a class with him if you have the chance!
1248,309859,5.0,2.0,"Professor Ahrensdorf is a truly kind teacher who loves his subject, and gives great lectures. Though reading heavy, Ahrensdorf is clear on where the most important reading points are as to not overwhelm his students. He is always prepared and gives clear criteria to his students. If ever confused, Ahrensdorf is always willing to meet."
1249,309859,2.0,2.0,"I would not recommend taking a class with Ahrensdorf. His teaching style is outdated- lectures are tedious and repetitive. He also does not encourage any critical thinking and expects students to regurgitate everything he says on papers. There is not clear grading criteria. However, he is accessible out of class and encourages office hour visits."
1250,309859,5.0,3.0,Really enjoyed by POL101 class with Ahrensdorf. He is so kind and easily accessible outside of class. He really cares about his students and wants to get to know them personally! I would definitely take another class with him!
1251,309859,4.0,4.0,"Professor Ahrensdorf is so excited and invested in what he teaches and really cares for each student. His lectures really make you think, but with that being said, my 2.5 hour class with him just speaking and taking questions can get pretty tiring. If you show up to class you don't have to worry about reading everything."
1252,309859,5.0,3.0,His classes are extremely engaging and thought-provoking. Pay attention to what comes out of in-class discussion and you'll hardly get less than A-. I would take any of his classes again and again.
1253,309859,5.0,5.0,"Politics and Literature class at DKU: Not an easy class but very helpful for a PolSci major. I enjoy having learned and had lunch with him after class. We had some funny discussions about how to fool your parents to major in PolSci by telling them that you are going to law school. Anyway, his class requires lots of careful reading and discussion."
1254,309859,5.0,4.0,"Professor Ahrensdorf is an amazing professor that deeply cares about his students. His lectures are fascinating as he truly cares about the subject matter. The papers do have to be written based off what he wants, but he is extremely accessible in office hours so this is not a problem."
1255,309859,5.0,4.0,"Wonderful, wonderful professor. Knowledgeable but easily accessible. Respected, nice and patient. DO read materials before class to fully grasp lectures."
1256,309859,4.0,2.0,"Super energetic professor who gave quite engaging and lucid lectures. In office hours, he genuinely cares about getting to know students on a personal level. My only problem was that, for papers, he pretty much wants you to include what he talks about in class. Not as much original thought as I would hope or expect in such a philosophy-based class."
1257,309859,4.0,3.0,"Great class. Even when the material isn't exciting, Ahrensdorf does a great job at keeping the class engaged through discussion. His passion for Poli Sci is evident. You can go into his office hours twice before each paper and he will critique it. Great intro to Poli Sci."
1258,309859,5.0,2.0,"He is incredible, and has greatly shaped my Davidson experience. Lectures are fascinating, thorough, and well prepared for. The reading is not lengthy, and always relevant. He does expect you to follow what he says in class for the papers, however. Go to office hours. He is so nice and helpful."
1259,309859,4.0,4.0,Ahrensdorf is an exceptionally talented and intelligent professor. He definitely is a tough grader but is always willing to work with you on the major papers he assigns in his courses. It can definitely be a challenge in his class but it's also super rewarding to work with him and succeed in the course
1260,309859,2.0,3.0,Tough grader and pays more attention to grammar on paper than content.
1261,309859,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ahrensforf is fantastic. He loves what he teaches and is incredibly enthusiastic in every class. Office hours are helpful- he will take the time to help you, get to know you well, and try to support you as best he can. Definitely take a class with him- great discussions and expects original thought (all grades are essays or final exam)."
1262,309859,4.0,4.0,Dr. Ahrensdorf is a really nice guy. He doesn't give out A's very easily. Very accessible outside of class. He'll squeeze in as much time for office hours for you. You don't always need to do the reading to be alive in class as participation is only 5% of your grade. Papers are a high percentage so you must make sure to reach out to him about them.
1263,309859,4.0,4.0,"Quirky but passionate. Looks for specific details in papers (50%), so GO TO OFFICE HOURS. He gets to know students well. Will read paper TWICE before you submit the final. Take all advice. A lot of 101 is regurgitation and comparing/contrasting ideologies, but still worth taking. Course would be better titled liberal democracy vs its adversaries."
1264,309859,5.0,4.0,Ahrensdorf is my favorite professor I have had so far and probably the reason I will be a PoliSci major. He is very enthusiastic and engaging in his lectures. He knows what he's talking about and really appreciates demonstrated interest. He is an all-around awesome guy. I will take as many classes as I can with him.
1265,309859,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Ahrensdorf is very very intelligent.  He is also a great lecturer and is passionate about the material.  His 101 class requires lots of regurgitation of the material, but it is interesting.  The only issue is that he is quite a tough grader and is picky.  Take good notes in his class, and you really don't need to do all of the readings at all."
1266,309859,4.5,2.0,This class is pretty reasonable for an introductory level course.  There is a lot of reading.  Do it and class will make a lot more sense.  He is very helpful outside of class.  Lectures can be somewhat boring but go to them because he grades for participation and they make the tests/essays much easier.
1267,309859,5.0,3.0,"Extremely great professor. Go to his classes, take good notes, participate, try to do some reading, talk to him about your papers (before and after), and the class will be great. This class made me totally rethink democracy."
1268,309859,2.0,3.0,"Ahrensdorf's class is a bit like a semester long delivery of two or three academic papers. The paper's are incredibly smart and cogent--and his delivery immaculate--but he asks you to do no real thinking. Paper's will be graded well if you regurgitate the class notes. You will learn information, but you will not discover anything."
1269,309859,4.0,4.0,"Great professor. Tough grader, but unbelievably willing to help you in meetings outside of class. Loves to get to know you as a person and a student. Tough but reasonable"
1270,309859,4.5,2.0,"Ahrensdorf is a great guy. He is SUPER helpful during office hours and makes sure you have the understanding you need to do well on his assignments. 209 is pretty dry and is not my interest, and yet i received all A's.  The workload and reading assignments are light, and there is no final, just an essay. Overall, I found this class enjoyable."
1271,309859,2.0,3.0,"My impression of Ahrensdorf differs with the norm on this site.  I did not enjoy him as an individual.  The material was interesting, but he expects you to regurgitate his beliefs, seems disingenuous, and disregards comments students make if they don't agree with his own.  He is clearly very intelligent but does a miserable job encouraging thought."
1272,309859,2.5,4.0,"I did not love this class. I just could NOT get excited about philosophy. I did not appreciate, either, that we were required to buy two books from which we read about 15 pages in each. Blackboard next time&#63; I enjoyed him and his enthusiasm is certainly infectious...and a lot of people ADORED this class. Probably just my own tastes speaking. 7.5/10"
1273,309859,4.0,4.0,"The class goes over political theory and while it can get confusing at times it serves as the base for future political classes. TAKE IT. GO to his office, i was some what intimidated at first but when i went he is extremely nice. Not necessarily an easy A but during test you will know what to expect."
1274,309859,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Ahrensdorf and his &quot;Intro to Political Theory&quot; is the reason I became a poli sci major.  He is extremely intelligent but also has a genuine interest in each of his students.  At times he can be all over the place, but facilitates amazing discussions.  Not an &quot;easy A&quot; class but you get out what you put in."
1275,309859,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Ahrensdorf is an incredible teacher and a wonderful mentor.  I've had two classes with him, and both have been thought-provoking.  Classical thought is his forte.  Outside of class, he is very helpful and appears to truly care about his students' wellbeing.  Always writes comments on papers, as well."
1276,309859,5.0,1.0,amazing dude
1277,309859,4.0,3.0,"You can get away without reading what he assigns. In fact, waiting until after class to read it will help you better comprehend what he wants you to focus on. TALK TO HIM ABOUT YOUR PAPERS! Doing so will improve your grade by at least one letter each time you do if you come prepared and LISTEN to what he tells you. Tests aren't bad if you prepare."
1278,309859,5.0,4.0,"He is an absolutely amazing professor.  The way he communicates the material let me see it in ways that I never could have found myself.  His lectures are amazingly articulate and he encourages student questions and participation, which helps to digest the material.  I was never interested in poli sci before taking this class, and now I love it"
1279,309859,4.0,4.0,"Fairly good class for a basic intro to politics, and Ahrensdorf knows his stuff extremely well.  Some of the material seems a little archaic, though, and his 8:30 lecture is absolutely soporific."
1280,309859,4.0,4.0,"Great lecturer, and quite helpful outside of class.  Pretty tough grader.  Would recommend his class."
1281,309859,4.0,3.0,Wonderful professor.  Highly recommend!  Very intelligent and inspiring.  (He's a nice guy too!)
1282,309859,5.0,3.0,"Great guy, great professor, great class.  I highly recommend!"
1283,309859,4.5,3.0,"Great professor. He not only knows his stuff, but is also very funny. Very helpful. Always takes time to talk to students, sometimes even an hour. Take a class with him! You won't regret it."
1284,309859,4.5,2.0,No Comments
1285,309859,2.0,5.0,"his expectations for tests were not clear in the slightest, tough grader, wouldn't take him again, his 8:30 was soporific"
1286,309859,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ahrensdorf is an engaging, devoted and fun (!) professor who always has a line of students waiting outside his office, because he is willing to explain class material or just talk about life in general. Take a class if you get the chance!"
1287,309859,5.0,3.0,"Very interesting lectures, extremely intelligent"
1288,309859,5.0,3.0,Very good at teaching and really cares about his students. He provides an interesting but controversial perspective (i.e. the Straussian perspective) on classical political philosophy and its bearing on modern political philosophy.
1289,309859,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Ahrensdorf is an excellent professor.  He loves the subject and is willing to re-explain things again and again. You can write papers off his lectures (the readings help only for quotes) and meeting with him prior to a paper or exam (he always gives the questions beforehand) helps tremendously.  If you can, take a class with him!!!"
1290,309859,4.5,4.0,"An amazing and very intelligent teacher, take advantage of his offer to preview your papers, it will improve your grade significantly."
1291,309859,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Ahrensdorf is purty kewl if not for his shame of his true German heritage.  Forgive me, but I cannot overlook this."
1292,309859,5.0,4.0,No Comments
1293,309859,5.0,3.0,"Excellent lecturer and very helpful with papers.  Reviews drafts and actually helps you find topics that are interesting and ways to write about them that will get you a good grade.  Compared to the rest of the department, he is a slightly easier grader."
1294,309859,5.0,1.0,**** Dr. Ahrensdorf and the horse he rode in on.
1295,309859,3.5,4.0,No Comments
1296,309859,5.0,3.0,Professor Ahrensdorf is an articulate and engaging lecturer who motivates the course texts.  He is both fair and helpful when it comes to coursework.
1297,309859,5.0,2.0,"This is man who knows his field and is passionate about what he does.   Students are first... and if you want a great professor, his classroom is where you want to be."
1298,309859,4.0,3.0,"He's pretty funny in class, but not intentionally at all. He's a nice guy and willing to help during office hours. Only had 2 papers and 2 tests that he gave us the questions to ahead of time. Material is pretty dry though"
1299,309859,5.0,3.0,This man is what education is all about.
1300,309859,4.5,2.0,Very interesting class and a very helpful professor.  3 papers and final which he gives you ahead of time.  Definately recommend it.
1301,309859,5.0,3.0,"Very effective and intelligent instructor.  Amazing command of literature, theories, and concepts."
1302,2773613,5.0,3.0,"It's apparent that the Professor is very knowledgeable in the subjects he teaches. His dynamic & sincere manner of communication makes each & every lecture engaging. I enjoyed him as a person & as a lecturer. I wouldn't say that the class is easy, but if you take the time to analyze the readings, class discussions are genuinely interesting. "
1303,2773613,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Pyle is incredibly engaging and passionate. He will continually blow you away with his experience and stories, and he's ridiculously knowledgable about his fields of study. His classes require a lot of reading (and you really need to do them for class), but the readings are interesting and actually matter for class discussions."
1304,2773613,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Pyle was a fantastic professor who is incredibly knowledgeable on a multitude of subjects. Hes an impressive individual who is exactly the type of person you want to soak as much information as you possibly can from. There is a lot of reading in his class, but its not super difficult so dont worry about that.."
1305,2773613,5.0,3.0,"Doctor Pyle's class was legitimately the most engaging and interesting class I have taken during my short time at Davidson college. While his class is reading heavy, I never found myself dreading or procrastinating the selected readings, as they were always very enjoyable. His massive knowledge on many subjects makes him a great professor."
1306,55922,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lawing is an amazing professor. I've taken a few classes with him and always enjoy them. While he has a critical approach, he gives amazing feedback on projects and does above and beyond to help his students achieve what they want out of the course."
1307,55922,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lawing is awesome. He really cares about the music department and about his students. Gives excellent feedback, and is passionate about the courses that he teaches."
1308,55922,4.0,3.0,interesting class and can tell that he is really passionate about what he is teaching. watched a lot of videos. class has listening and written tests. written tests can be a bit difficult but not terrible. gives huge extra credit to students for going to see professional musicals. really great guy teaching a really great class.
1309,55922,3.5,2.0,"He is a wonderful professor and the class material was fascinating. The &quot;lectures&quot; consisted of watching videos of musicals. There was almost no work outside of class.. except when a test came along. The tests were totally unpredictable and a sometimes ridiculous in the specifics. Overall however, there was very little work outside of class."
1310,55922,4.0,3.0,"He has great passion for theater and music. However tests were extremely specific given the range of material covered, and you never knew what you were going to get. The format changed each time. He's fun to talk to outside of class. For someone w/ little previous interest in theater, I would highly recommend AMT for a fine arts credit. Just study!"
1311,55922,1.0,1.0,"I don't know what I did, but Dr. Lawing hated me from day one.  He was condescending and rude to me about everything; I dreaded having to talk to him because I knew I would leave feeling like crap.  He plays favorites with certain musicians and makes it obvious when you aren't one of them.  I hate music now and he is definitely part of the reason."
1312,55922,3.5,4.0,"I found this class incredibly hard...listening tests require lengthy studying and the written tests were impossible. However, Dr. Lawing is a great teacher and the class is fascinating. This is a good class, and if you put in A LOT of work, you will get a decent grade."
1313,55922,4.0,3.0,I loved this class!!!  Dr. Lawing did a great job in his first semester teaching American Musical Theater.  If you're interested in the subject matter then you will love this class and do well in it.  My favorite class at Davidson!
1314,55922,4.5,4.0,"Jazz is a great way to get a fine arts credit.  You basically just watch the Ken Burn's documentary.  Dr. Lawing's really nice, but listening tests can be tricky and written tests demand that you know quite a bit."
1315,55922,5.0,2.0,He makes music interesting and fun. Jazz is a great class even if you don't know a lot about it or music in general. Easy grader.
1316,2003570,1.5,2.0,"Dr. Milligan's lectures were hard to follow, but they were most engaging when she lectured about topics she was most knowledgeable in, namely Nigeria. Did a lot of work with classmates outside of class to prepare for tests due to confusing lecture, but she was an easy grader overall. Expects everyone to participate. Would not take her class again."
1317,2003570,3.5,2.0,"While Professor Milligan may come off as being scatterbrained she is very knowledgeable about the region and gave us insights that most professors wouldn't have been able to give, given her experience there. Super passionate and really appreciated class participation. Really enjoyed her class once I got over her intimidating nature."
1318,2003570,3.0,3.0,"Milligan was an attentive teacher and was great one on one, but her lectures were scattered and somewhat hard to follow. She was an easy grader but directions were somewhat vague. Class participation is crucial, though she provides opportunities for digital participation as well."
1319,2003570,2.0,2.0,"Dr. Milligan is very established in what she knows about Nigerian and Middle Eastern Politics, but not much else. She is an easy grader but her lectures are all over the place and ends up writing all over the board but it doesn't make sense and is hard to read. Always left the class feeling confused and frustrated."
1320,1190520,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Beschea's class was fine for the most part- he greatly emphasizes participating in class. There isn't a terrible workload, and the homework isn't graded, but you need to have done it because that is how you participate. Tests were memorization heavy, but you will know what to expect. He is a funny and caring guy who made class enjoyable."
1321,1190520,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Beschea is funny and makes you excited to go to class. FRE212 is all about the phonetic alphabet which looks like Minecraft enchantment symbols. It did not really improve my French speaking, but I still enjoyed the class. There is not much homework, and the quizzes and tests are very fair. He is very helpful and wants you to do well!! "
1322,1190520,5.0,4.0,"In this phonetics class, you really had to do the practice questions to pass. Professor Beschea is strict when it comes to doing the given assignments, but he does this in your best interest. He really wants his students to do well in the class and learn from it. His in-class explanations were really helpful. He is also very funny and supportive."
1323,1190520,5.0,2.0,"ABSOLUTE GEM! Made phonetics a fun and engaging class. Extremely personable with clear and interesting lectures. Answers questions in detail and encourages questions and participation. Will work with you on pronunciation or misunderstanding of material. Reviews were easy, HW took 1hr or less depending on how in-depth you study. EASY A if you try."
1324,1190520,5.0,4.0,Beschea is an excellent teacher. His class is tough but he is a fair grader. He sometimes gets off topic but covers all the material before tests. I would highly recommend taking his class.
1325,1190520,4.0,4.0,"Hes a good prof, but the material can be hard depending on which of his classes youre in. Oral French Grammar is tough. However, Beschea explains things well and is willing to help you. He also doesnt take things overly seriously, but you can impress him by coming to class on time, prepared, with homework done, and hen participate well each day."
1326,1190520,4.0,2.0,"This ended up being my favorite class of the semester, largely because of Professor Beschea. He likes to joke around and makes you less self conscious of your French, is a fair grader, and class is always light. Tests are fair, homework isn't too hard and we always go over it in class. I highly recommend taking any French class with him."
1327,1190520,2.0,1.0,"Honestly, he's not a hard teacher and he really does care about his students, but he often went off topic, was very unclear in his teaching, and was awful at answering questions. Also, he clearly picked on some people more than others. I would have rather not gone to class and taught myself from the textbook for the test."
1328,1190520,5.0,2.0,"Professor Beschea is the funniest, chillest professor you will take at Davidson. Super relaxed, always joking around in class and makes learning French fun. Show up to class, work decently hard, go visit him and you'll be completely fine."
1329,1190520,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Beschea is hilarious and loves discussing medieval France. His assignments are unclear sometimes, but he's open to explaining anything in office hours. A lot of great discussion and, other than a few major assignments, the workload was pretty easy"
1330,1190520,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Beschea is a nice guy, but I found his class a little difficult. There were so many assignments sometimes it was hard to understand what he wanted from us, and when it was due. He does know his French grammar though. Our class laughed a lot and talked a lot too, he can be pretty funny. "
1331,1190520,4.0,2.0,"Beschea is a great prof, really entertaining and fun. His tests also aren't hard if you study the vocab and grammar. He answers your questions and helps you understand the language. Definitely recommend if you want to have fun learning French, but you do need to study. Assigns hw, checks rarely, but definitely do it for practice. Also, pop quizzes."
1332,1190520,5.0,1.0,"Le Prof is so great. Super, super nice. Highly interested in all of your questions. Good energy in class. You will always look forward to going. Very genuine, and loves to joke around in class. He is like the Frenchie Uncle that you always wanted. Unless you're a female. Because then you will be very pleased that he is not related to you..."
1333,1190520,4.5,1.0,"MY FAVORITE. very entertaining, teaches you lots. so funny. euro hawt. must go to class. so easy. highly recommend him. checks homework rarely but do it because it helps you with tests. love love love"
1334,1190520,4.5,2.0,"Great professor, very entertaining. Extremely helpful. Great class."
1335,1190520,3.5,1.0,He's good. Nice & funny. If you do badly in this class then you must be trying real hard.
1336,1190520,5.0,1.0,"a really nice guy. class wasnt too hard, but always interesting. im never staring at the clock like in other classes. he really makes an effort to make sure you understand the material, but he notices if you dont come to class."
1337,2699898,3.0,2.0,"If you are looking to learn French you will have a tough time with her. She does speak in French for a majority of class in attempt to teach you as if you are a child just beginning to understand language. If you don't mind this method then go for it, if not you can skip her. She is not the most organized and you probably won't learn a whole lot."
1338,2699898,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Hope was a really wonderful professor that clearly cared about her students and how they learned French. She rightly believed that having such grammar-based material doesn't adequately teach a language which I very much appreciated. However, she was often unclear with expectations and is a professor that does not believe in giving 100% scores."
1339,90751,1.0,5.0,Worst experience ever.  Would not recommend.
1340,90751,4.0,4.0,Dr. Brown is a conscientious professor who cares deeply about his class and takes a genuine interest in students. He is fantastic but is not always understanding and can place great demands on students. Chemistry of Natural Products is a must-take for those considering a Chemistry major or minor - or for students who want an awesome class.
1341,90751,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Brown changed my college experience: after taking his class, I changed from an English to a chemistry major! This class was fun, interesting, straightforward, and useful. Dr. Brown is really passionate about teaching and is always more than willing to help. Pay attention to what he says in class and you'll be golden!"
1342,90751,5.0,4.0,Best professor I have ever had at Davidson. A definite must!!!!
1343,90751,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Brown is an amazing professor. Passionate and knowledgeable about his subject, he is a good communicator and is extremely accommodating to students and makes himself available to them. I am so glad to have had his class and I would recommend his courses to anyone. He made organic chemistry a fantastic course - one that most students fear."
1344,90751,5.0,4.0,Best professor I have had at Davidson.  Extremely helpful durig office hours! makes labs a lot more interesting
1345,90751,5.0,4.0,"Visiting professor&#63;&#63; What is DC waiting for&#63; He IS what a teacher should be in every sense of the word! Every new prof should study his ways. Orgo is the &quot;beast' of undergraduate science studies.  Yet, he subtly makes his students immerse themselves in this complex subject. He is the YODA of chemistry. It is a real privilege to be taught by him."
1346,90751,5.0,3.0,"Great professor! He was always willing to answer any questions. His tests were hard, but fair."
1347,90751,5.0,4.0,Best professor EVER!
1348,90751,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Brown is the best teacher I've ever had at Davidson. He works so many extra hours to help his students. He's always availabe for questions...plus he gives multiple help sessions before tests. Also, he's extremely fair when it comes to grading. And he's really funny. I would highly recommend taking Organic with Dr. Brown!"
1349,90751,5.0,4.0,"Everything they said here is so true.  Amazing guy.  Loves his field, loves teaching, and will go to any lengths to help you learn.  Plus he's hilarious."
1350,90751,5.0,2.0,"Is there anything that this man WON'T do for his students&#63;  Dr. Brown is spunky, considerate, and ever-so-helpful.  If you have the chance to take Organic with him... do it!!!"
1351,90751,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Brown is by far the best Chemistry professor I've ever had. He is entertaining in class and makes Organic Chemistry truly fascinating. He is ever so helpful during office hours with Organic Chem problems, finding internships and academic advising. He is an excellent mentor and friend."
1352,90751,5.0,4.0,"Awesome, awesome professor--completely devoted to students."
1353,90751,5.0,3.0,One of my favorite professors at Davidson. He is great in lecture and wondeful outside of class. Shows a genuine concern for his student's lives. One of the very best.
1354,90751,5.0,3.0,best teacher i've ever had.  no contest.
1355,90751,5.0,3.0,"Awesome.  If you take Organic, take it from him."
1356,90751,5.0,3.0,He is the reason I'm a chemistry major! Best professor I've ever had.
1357,90751,5.0,3.0,Dr. Brown is the reason we have so many chemistry majors and minors!
1358,90751,5.0,4.0,Organic chemistry is fun!
1359,90751,5.0,4.0,One of the best!!!!
1360,90751,5.0,4.0,One of the most incredible teachers I have ever had.
1361,90751,5.0,4.0,Very responsive to student needs. Plan to devote your whole life to organic.
1362,1962624,3.5,3.0,"professor Jacobus is an interesting man. His class was sometimes awkward but he made the best of it. He frequently would say random stuff to get our attention. Also, he knows a lot about psychology and science. He invited us over for dinner at his house (we had a small class) and it was the highlight of the semester for me!  "
1363,2228866,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Hucks is a loving, caring, warm-hearted person. She knows a lot about Africana studies and the class relies heavily on book readings, moodle readings, and that is about it. There is a mid term, 4-6 page essay, and final review. If looking for an easy B to A, take this class."
1364,2699907,5.0,2.0,"Dr. GB was one of my favorite professors at Davidson. It's a real loss that she's leaving the school because she is truly one of the most caring, responsive professors I have ever met. She is extremely open with students and flexible to their needs without being a push-over. The way she structures such a rigorous course is superb."
1365,1831555,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Martinez makes sure everyone feels safe within the classroom and is an empowering role model for all BiPOC women in academia. She is highly respected, a phenomenal lecturer, and deeply cares about every single student inside and outside of the classroom. Highly recommend."
1366,1831555,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Martinez is a lovely professor who genuinely cares about the well-being of her students. She is inspiring as a woman of color in her field. She is resilient, out-spoken, and motivational. Dr. Martinez creates a safe space within the classroom and makes all of her students feel valued."
1367,1831555,4.5,2.0,"Dr Martinez is a great professor who is super passionate about her field and her classes. Class participation is very important, and the classes have a clear schedule each week. Tests are harder than expected, and there is a lot of reading, but definitely interesting. Discussion based format is great as well. Would recommend and take again!"
1368,1831555,3.5,4.0,"Martinez will make you work - but it's worth it! She is very interested in your opinion and wants to see you succeed, if you ask for help she will be your best friend!"
1369,1831555,3.5,4.0,"I only took this class to fulfill graduation requirements and I hated it for the most part. Two 15-17 page papers, 3 3-5 page papers, and a ridiculous participation policy. My average without the participation grade was an A- and I ended up with a B for my final grade. I would avoid her if I were you."
1370,1831555,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Martinez is awesome! Her style is dynamic and she's interesting. She pushes you to challenge yourself in choosing writing, discussion, and research paper topics and is open to hearing all perspectives on discussion topics. Take her classes and you won't be disappointed."
1371,1831555,1.5,3.0,She failed my participation grade because I missed class with the flu. Enough said.
1372,1831555,5.0,3.0,Dr. Martinez is super helpful both in and out of class - she also does a good job of making course material relevant to current events or even life at Davidson.  Not an easy grade but if you put in work and take the class as a chance to learn better public speaking strategies you will do well.
1373,1831555,4.5,3.0,I enjoyed COM 101 with her. She was a fair grader (definitely not easy) and I greatly improved my pubic speaking skills. She lectured during the first few weeks and then we had speeches every week after that. 4 major speeches. Be sure to PRACTICE! She is wonderful after class as well. One of Davidson's best in my opinion.
1374,369284,3.5,3.0,Very sweet professor with a genuine passion for the language and her students. Lectures can be very interesting or can ramble/become somewhat receptive. Try to get to know her outside of class.
1375,369284,4.0,2.0,"I took this class to finish my language requirement and was afraid I was in a level that was too tough for me, but Vasquez assured me that I was in the right class and she would help me do my best. Very little homework day to day and a few small essays. Not a very demanding class and she couldn't have been a sweeter lady!"
1376,369284,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Vasquez is a nice lady, but I did not enjoy her class too much. As this was a writing course taught in English, we only had one exam, but 6 papers. She was very helpful during office hours, and was sure to be very available for everyone. She also hates it if people look at the clock, chew gum, or are absent. "
1377,369284,5.0,3.0,I couldn't have asked for a better Spanish teacher! She is extremely helpful and fair. Definitely requires hard work but it pays off. Always prompt in returning work and eager to help you understand and do better. Definitely take her class if you have the choice between her and another professor.
1378,369284,5.0,2.0,"Hands down, Senora Vasquez is the best 201 professor at Davidson! She is enthusiastic, helpful,interesting, and very nice. The work load is limited to a couple tests and 8 compositions, but its very managable. Sra. Vasquez speaks slowly which is super helpful.  I would recommend her to anyone at Davidson!"
1379,369284,5.0,2.0,Vasquez is amazing. She is kind and helpful and I recommend her without qualification.
1380,369284,5.0,4.0,Favorite professor at Davidson! She absolutely loves teaching and cares about each student.  Has high expectations that makes you want to succeed.  Always willing to help and talk outside class. Easy grader- but a good bit of work.
1381,369284,3.0,2.0,"Great teacher, repeats a lot of her lessons, which can get irritating, genuinely nice lady.  Easy class to bs if you don't read, not too much outside of class work except compositions"
1382,369284,5.0,3.0,"HIGHLY recommend for 201!  Contagiously enthusiastic, didn't have much interest in SPA before this and she has made me want to take 260 and even study SPA abroad. Very clear in her expectations and ALWAYS willing to help. Class goes quickly, work was never overwhelming.  More essays than tests, rewrites always offered. DEFINITELY take her 201!"
1383,369284,5.0,2.0,One of the most enthusiastic teachers I've had here. She gives so much extra credit it's insane. As long as you participate all the time in class and do the reading all the time she loves you! She is always eager to help if you need it.
1384,369284,4.0,4.0,Vasquez can be great if you stay on her good side. Sweet and helpful. She wants to be best friends with all her students. A little absent minded and if you point out her mistakes she'll hate you forever. Optimism makes even the most boring subjects engaging.
1385,369284,5.0,3.0,"While I've been lucky and had all great Spanish teachers, Profesora Vasquez is the my most favorite. She cares for students like no other teacher I've ever met. She's a tough grader at times, but she'll make you think & definitely improve your Spanish. I highly recommend her for 201."
1386,369284,1.0,3.0,No Comments
1387,369284,5.0,3.0,"She'll definitely inspire you to learn material that you might not want to. She's a little uptight about attendance, but besides that she is a great professor who takes a lot of her time for her students."
1388,369284,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Vasquez's enthusiasm and optimism is contagious!!  She truly values each one of her students, regardless of whether or not they're great at Spanish.  She also loves class participation, so get ready to talk!"
1389,369284,5.0,2.0,Profesora Vasquez is a good teacher...very passionate and enthusiastic. Be prepared to participate in class; she'll call on you at least once a day to talk. Everything on tests is taken exactly from what she teaches in class.
1390,369284,4.0,2.0,most super-psyched woman about spanish you'll ever meet.
1391,369284,5.0,3.0,awesome.
1392,369284,5.0,4.0,"Prfa. Vasquez is one of the best teachers at DC. Unbelievably brilliant, knowledgable, & a memory like a bank vault. She's not easy, but she is likely the most student-focused prof on campus; you'll recognize that from the second she walks through the doo"
1393,369284,5.0,2.0,No Comments
1394,369284,4.5,2.0,"Hated Spanish before this class, but now its tolerable.  Very helpful professor and presents the material clearly.  Cares about her students and any concerns or problems that they have.  Very helpful and nice."
1395,2157198,5.0,3.0,Dr. Pang is my favorite professor! She gives great feedback on papers and values seeing improvement over the course. She will give you the grade you deserve. I hope to take another one of her classes in the future.
1396,2157198,5.0,4.0,I loved Dr. Pang she was a great professor for WRI 1010!
1397,2157198,2.0,1.0,This class was fine. Very overrated but very easy. The class is so disorganized and we spend just as much time moving chairs around to go from small group to whole class discussion as the discussion itself. Dr. Pang is nice and is passionate but the class itself is pretty awkward. Lets students decide the second half of the course which is cool.
1398,2157198,4.0,3.0,"It was a writing course, so of course it was paper heavy, but it seemed manageable. She gave great feedback when it came to revision sessions. If you put some effort in, you'll be just fine. She is enthusiastic and places a huge emphasis on in class participation. Her lectures are basically discussions and she has multiple group activities."
1399,2157198,5.0,2.0,"She is wonderful. Gives great feedback, great lectures, and really engages students. She is available outside of class, office hours are best, and she is really sweet. She never demeans any insights, and really values vocal participation. Definitely a structured course, which is nice for planning. Would have her again for sure."
1400,2157198,5.0,3.0,Really cares about students and makes learning the material exciting and engaging. Took a class with her for my religion credit but now planning to take more!
1401,2157198,5.0,3.0,"If you are looking to get your religion credit, take a class with Dr. Pang! Easily one of the best professors at Davidson. She's so knowledgeable and brings back the joy in learning."
1402,2157198,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Pang's Chinese Religion class was an extremely interesting one. She is very knowledgeable and friendly, both in and outside of class. Class periods are usually 1/3 lecture, 2/3 class discussions. My advice would be to come prepared (read the readings!) and have some points ready to talk about. Take Dr. Pang's classes you won't regret it!"
1403,2157198,5.0,2.0,Good professor. Tibetan Religion is one of the easiest classes in the school and Dr. Pang is very nice.
1404,2157198,4.0,2.0,"Very nice, kind of boring lecturer when there is a big class."
1405,2157198,5.0,3.0,She is a very helpful  and interesting professor. Always willing to help outside of classes. Not a very hard grader on essays but not easy as well.
1406,2157198,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Pang was such a great professor. She is very interesting, and if you need help outside of class she is very willing to work with you. Aside from that, her class was so interesting and I am not a religion major."
1407,2157198,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Pang is amazing. I am not even particularly interested in religious studies, but I loved taking her class. She is a very fair grader, does not expect a ridiculous time commitment to reading and homework outside of class, and is very organized. Her syllabus has everything on it that you will need to plan for, which is helpful. Love her!"
1408,2169507,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Brandt gave me both, worst grade, and worst experience at Davidson. He doesnt care about what his students think of him or what they suggest. He also doesnt care if youre taking the class only for the requirement. I wouldnt recommened for non-math majors because hell ruin your entire semester. I learned nothing at his class."
1409,2169507,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Brandt has battled through adversity: when a cocky student attempted to question his teaching style, he remained cool under pressure, and stuck to his disciplined regiment. Easily approachable, Dr. Brandt dishes dimes (assists) students thoroughly during office hours. His class is tough, but you if you survive the rush you will dismantle math."
1410,2169507,4.0,4.0,"Big AB is new and it shows in his lectures that are understandable to some but confusing to most. That said, he's really committed to helping you learn so he's is almost always available for office hours. Even if you do poorly on the tests, he'll replace your bad test score with your final grade if you do better (and you almost certainly will)."
1411,2169507,4.0,3.0,"Very engaging professor. He's super willing to work problems out with you until you understand the material and can do it on your own. One of the nicest professors I've had here. He is a new professor, but he's really trying and will go back and work more with the class if his teaching was unclear."
1412,2169507,5.0,3.0,Great class planning and lectures.
1413,2169507,5.0,4.0,"Great guy, cares about students a lot. Follows the textbook closely and assigns a reasonable amount of homework. Has great accessibility either through office hours or quick email replies. Just be sure to buckle up for linear algebra as it does require substantial studying outside of class"
1414,2169507,1.0,3.0,A very decent person but does not explain things very well. I always have to understand the many concept elsewhere after the class. He is very helpful but its hard to understand Math the way he teaches.
1415,2169507,2.0,3.0,"He is a very nice guy but as he is new to teaching, need s a lot of improvement in his techniques. He does not explain the questions that well neither does he solve them on the board. He knows all of it but does not know how to deliver it very well. I now it takes time and experience for someone to improve but a student can not afford a bad grade."
1416,2169507,5.0,3.0,"Axel is great. Very fun, quirky guy. Makes class enjoyable. Pretty much says exactly what's in the book during his lectures. A decent amount of homework, but allows you to do it in groups as long as you're not just copying. Helpful office hours, answered questions directly."
1417,305828,1.0,4.0,mmm
1418,305828,1.0,4.0,Listening to him ramble on consistently ruined my day. his assignments/grading standards make no sense. His ego is through the roof--half of the readings are his own work. Did not know it was possible to make film music the dullest topic. Over the entire semester 
1419,305828,2.0,4.0,"He definitely knows what he is talking about, but you will have the worst time in his class. He hyper-focuses on irrelevant details and his dry lectures with no class engagement just made the class a study hall. Also, Dr. Lerner comes off very condescending both in class and with any communication you have with him, so beware of that experience. "
1420,305828,4.0,3.0,"I can't speak on his performance as a humanities professor, but Dr. Lerner is great for film. His lectures can get boring sometimes, but he's funny and we cover some interesting stuff. The tests and assignments have clear criteria, and they are graded fairly."
1421,305828,1.0,4.0,"He was awful. His lectures are boring and always irrelevant. You get the feeling that he became a professor just so that he could force a group of people listen to how ""smart"" he is. His essay prompts are over a page long and consistently ridiculous. Do not ever take a class with Neil Lerner."
1422,305828,4.0,4.0,"Lerner was a great discussion leader for HUMs- he does sometimes have trouble staying on task, but all of the tangents were ultimately relevant to the overarching themes of the course. He's very easy to talk to during office hours (go to office hours if you want to do well on the papers) and loves engaging in discussions outside of class."
1423,305828,1.5,3.0,Completely out of his depth as a Humanities professor. His comments on papers had no relationship to the grade he gave. He was incapable of running a discussion section without spending half of it on personal tangents to the point that our discussion quality was substantially higher without him. Passive aggressive to boot.
1424,305828,2.5,4.0,"Do not take any one of his classes expecting to just fulfill an arts requirement. He expects a lot out of every paper and project and you have weekly 2 hour film viewings. He is a good lecturer in class, but not that relateable to students. I did learn a lot about film studies, but the readings were often repetitive and excessive. "
1425,305828,5.0,4.0,"Learned a lot about techniques used in different films. Not a very applied class, mostly watched movies and discussed film techniques. Tons of reading, 2 hr screening every Wednesday with a 5-question quiz on the movie the next day. Would recommend if you're looking for something outside the box."
1426,305828,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Lerner tries to be helpful, but make no mistake, the listening sections on the tests are HARD.   If you are looking to fulfill your fine arts requirement, look elsewhere!"
1427,305828,4.5,1.0,"Dr. Lerner is the man! The class is all lecture, but still interesting and easy to follow. Occasionally, he will try and cram to much into a single lecture if he's behind making it hard to follow. Very helpful during office hours. Tests are largely memorization but not too bad (except for the final). One paper which is a really fun assignment!"
1428,305828,3.0,5.0,"Excessively detail focused tests. Takes away from understanding broader concepts, because for every test you will spend hours upon hours trying to memorize the titles, authors, and exact date of 60 songs. He will then play 15 seconds of any part of only 8 of the songs. Aka, even if you know your stuff, you can still get screwed. I hated him."
1429,305828,5.0,3.0,really fun and interesting lecturer
1430,305828,5.0,4.0,"Great prof--entertaining, knows his stuff. One of Davidson's best."
1431,305828,4.5,4.0,"pay attention and you'll notice that everything, according to him, has sexual undertones. EVERYTHING."
1432,305828,5.0,4.0,"Pretty interesting. What seem to be obvious points are sometimes pretty subtle things, and he expects us to start to think similarly for ourselves. Kept the discussion informal but still drove home some points."
1433,305828,5.0,3.0,"Very passionate about what he's teaching, and very clear. A little awkward at times, especially talking about all of the sexual/racial implications of music, but overall a very good teacher."
1434,305828,5.0,5.0,Entertaining. Expected us to think for ourselves at times--which to some is a real challenge.
1435,305828,3.0,4.0,good lecturer
1436,305828,4.0,3.0,"kooky, occassionally off-topic, but interesting discussions"
1437,305828,2.5,2.0,"While a good lecturer, not that great in discussion.  He tends to emphasize what he thinks and not pay much attention to other thoughts.  In one class he kept trying to drive home a point that nobody else in the class saw.  An easy grader though, so not totally bad."
1438,305828,3.0,3.0,"Taking this class was a terrible experience.  He was boring and defensive.  Instructions were rarely clear, but lectures, while bland, were fine.  Tell him exactly what he wants to hear and you'll be fine."
1439,305828,5.0,4.0,"Smart, funny, mildly subversive; always well-prepared."
1440,305828,5.0,4.0,Great class.
1441,305828,4.0,3.0,No Comments
1442,305828,4.0,3.0,"Lerner is a really great professor, very knowledgeable, but also very tough.  I worked pretty hard and didn't get an outstanding grade, actually a bit disappointed. I really really liked him before I got my grade and then I didn't quite as much."
1443,305828,5.0,2.0,"He was an awesome prof.  I came in not really having any music background, but he really brought the class to life.  Your homework is to listen to music...honestly, how hard is that&#63;  The tests are impossible if you don't do the listening, but they are very easy if you do the listening.  It's not tricky at all.  Take this class.  He's awesome."
1444,305828,4.5,5.0,"Film Music: wow!  I did poorly in the class - thank God I pass/failed.  Even then I barely passed, but I learned more than I thought possible.  Lectures can get boring, but he does his best to keep them entertaining.  Also sees homoeroticism or phallic symbols in *everything*.  Very helpful outside of class - great just to talk with."
1445,305828,4.0,3.0,"Lerner is a very organized and very knowledgeable Professor.  He attempts to give a well-rounded understanding of the materials even with the restraints of the semester's brevity.  Difficult essay grader (once an English major), but definitely an entertaining and informative lecturer and professor."
1446,305828,4.0,4.0,"Be prepared for listening to kick your butt. He's awesome, though. A bit jaded as a professor, he has a great outlook on lots of stuff. So down to earth and approachable. Get talking to him on anything, he's fascinating, well-spoken, really interested in students' lives, and intelligent. Love him."
1447,305828,5.0,4.0,"Thought I would hate this stuff, but he made it interesting. Watch out for his quizzes. Pretty entertaining lectures, though."
1448,305828,4.5,2.0,"Film Music - thorough lectures....funny, interesting, cynical.  A lot of reading but covers needed readings in class."
1449,305828,5.0,4.0,"Very knowledgeable, very thorough. Very interesting class. Highly recommend it. Be prepared to study."
1450,2581157,4.0,1.0,"One of the most caring professors Ive had so far at Davidson. Very knowledgeable &amp; accommodating! The class wasnt hard at all itself &amp; assignments were fairly easy. The readings can be slightly challenging, but theyre discussed thoroughly in class. The class was very rewarding beyond an academic sense. Highly recommend her!"
1451,2581157,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Chapman is one of the best professors you can take 101 with, she is very understanding and cares about her students deeply. She is also verh approachable and her feed backs are great way to check your progress in the class."
1452,1497767,4.0,5.0,"Very smart and sweet, but sorta has a bad humor. (he tells really dry jokes). Prepare more time for written investigations (they are fun tho). Homework is manageable but tests are monstrous. He could make basic materials very hard in tests. Highly recommended if you're a math major and good at math. Not recommended if you're not."
1453,1497767,4.0,4.0,He can go a little fast and gives a lot of homework but he is a great teacher who is always willing to give additional help.
1454,1497767,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Yerger is indeed one of the harder professor in the Math department of Davidson, but his teachings are more than inspiring. One will need to get really ready to be into the realm of mathematics if they want to have a solid grade in his course. The pace of his lecture is indeed fast, but if you want to interpret it in another way, it's efficient"
1455,1497767,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Yerger is an incredible professor who really wants his students to succeed. He is very passionate about math, and while it's true his classes are difficult, if you show interest in and engagement with the material you'll do just fine. He is extremely accessible for office hours, and he really cares about his students."
1456,1497767,4.0,2.0,"Homework amount was pretty fair, some days it was rather quick other days took a few hours depending on how well I understood the material. Lectures were easy to follow, and if you ever were confused Dr Yerger explained it more. Overall, I enjoyed the class and thought Dr Yerger was a good math professor"
1457,1497767,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Yerger is an excellent teacher. While it is true that he gives a lot of homework, much of it requiring several nights to complete, it is straightforward, and there for the students' benefit. While his tests are hard, he is lenient with grading, making them okay. He is a very nice man outside of class and is always accessible."
1458,1497767,1.0,5.0,Only take this class if you have a solid background in Calc and are only taking it to get the credit.  His written investigations take forever so start early. The tests are way harder than the homework and written investigations but allows cheat sheets so write down as much as you can on them.
1459,1497767,1.5,4.0,"The homework is nothing like the class and the tests are nothing like the homework. The lectures are terrible, and you have to spend a lot of time in office hours if you want to know the material. He's brilliant but he doesn't understand why you don't understand the material so it's hard for him to explain it to you. Tests are next to impossible."
1460,1497767,4.0,4.0,"Friendly and awkward. Real helpful in office hours, but he speaks quickly and sometimes vaguely during class lectures. The tests are brutal, but he provides a little bit of grade inflation and lots of partial credit so grades won't be too bad. Homework is good practice, but that takes a while as well. Lecture quality is reasonable."
1461,1497767,4.0,4.0,"Yerger is extremely awkward and isn't great at communicating with students. he is friendly but strange. The homework was graded harshly and took a while. tests were tough. He was good in office hours, but he spoke quickly in class. I'd recommend him only for people who are really serious about math."
1462,1497767,4.5,4.0,"Awesome professor and great class. Graph Theory is Dr. Yerger's research area, so he gets very passionate about teaching it. The reviews are incredibly hard, but if you keep up with the homework you'll be fine. Only take this class if you're serious about a math major."
1463,1497767,3.5,3.0,"Professor Yerger is a nice guy, and his class was manageable. Homework often includes things not learned in class, and tests are quite difficult. However, he is great about giving partial credit."
1464,1497767,4.0,4.0,"Really nice guy, really helpful outside of class, but the material is incredibly hard and he expects a lot out of each student.  If you need help, he will absolutely end up giving you answers, but only after making you feel a bit stupid.  His tests are long and hard, but doable.  Pretty good overall."
1465,1497767,3.0,3.0,"Yerger has a big heart, but he teaches straight out of the book and speaks very quickly. He's really only a good teacher for students who are SERIOUS about math (and very good at it). A lot of the time, going to office hours is more valuable than going to class. He has a specific way of doing and saying things that can sometimes be confusing."
1466,1497767,4.0,4.0,Yerger is the man! He looks out for his students and you will learn a lot. He wants to make sure you understand the material especially when you visit during office hours. He is extremely smart and nerdy.
1467,1497767,2.0,4.0,A very socially awkward teacher that is just way too smart and this comes across in his teaching. Everything is fast-paced and he can be unknowingly offensive when answering &#63;'s but he really does want to help *first yr teacher*. He is VERY beneficial for math majors and excessive/over-the-top for any1 else (lot of work). u'll learn more than enuf.
1468,1497767,4.0,4.0,His class was very challenging but not unreasonable.  I gained more from Math 220 than I have from any other class so far.  He is very reasonable and understanding.
1469,1497767,4.5,4.0,"His class was very challenging, but he is very reasonable and understanding.  Very approachable and willing to help.  Great sense of humor by my dorky standards."
1470,2640555,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Luis is so kind and truly wants every student to succeed. He gives a lot of reading and he is a somewhat tough grader, but at the same time, he gives you honest and clear feedback which is incredibly helpful. The class is reading heavy, but he runs the class so it is extremely engaging the entire time!"
1471,2640555,5.0,2.0,Dr. Luis is simply so kind and understanding and wants you to be the best possible student ever! His course was so engaging and combined a mix of mediums. He wants the class to be meaningful to YOU and makes you create free-formed projects that will live beyond the class which I loved and appreciated so much! He also was extremely accessible!
1472,2640555,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Luis is a phenomenal professor who's very kind and understanding. His class was one of the best I've taken at Davidson. He uses a mix of materials (readings, podcasts, music, art) to engage with his students. If you're reading this review trying to decide whether or not to take his class, I would recommend that you do!! Best choice ever."
1473,2654904,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Marsicano is a very funny and passionate professor. He doesnt grade a lot of things (only participation and papers), but if you put in the effort youll do well. He assigns a lot of readings, but as long as you know two of them well each week, youll be in great shape. Highly recommend taking him!"
1474,973504,5.0,2.0,"If you genuinely work hard in any of her classes and go to her for help, you should do fine. I am so sad she is going to  be on leave for a year :("
1475,973504,4.0,3.0,I love Dr. Sparling! She is a sweet lady. Take notes and do the practice reviews at least twice.
1476,973504,2.5,3.0,"She is a fairly nice lady but is hard to follow and get along with. 3 for helpfulness because she partially answers your questions in office hours but also sometimes says ""Read the textbook"". 2 for clarity because her handwriting is messy, and she speaks too quickly. 3 for easiness because the tests are very manageable, especially if you read."
1477,973504,2.0,3.0,"Went to her for help once and she told me to read the textbook. Wasn't a very helpful meeting. Her lectures are fine and her tests are fair if you know what you're doing, though."
1478,973504,4.0,2.0,"Alica is bae. If you are interested in public health or econ, you need to take her. She is amazing - will take time out her busy weekends to sit down and talk with you - really cares and supports about her students. She's disorganized and her class is very bottom heavy (3 essays due during finals) but "
1479,973504,2.5,3.0,"Sparling is a nice lady, but she has bad handwriting, is disorganized, and flakes out on her office hours a lot. Everything  on the test is also on the board, which is nice. She is somewhat helpful during office hours. Tests are moderately difficult but not super hard. Small projects help your grade. Sometimes it's hard to understand her (accent)."
1480,973504,3.0,3.0,Great professor. Her class was complicated because of the incredible volume of info but easy because she teaches exactly what you need to know. She also goes beyond for students interested in learning for the sake of learning. She's extremely nice but can be disorganized. Tests are straightforward and side-projects our definite grade-boosters.
1481,973504,4.5,3.0,Professor Sparling is a knowledgeable (esp in health econ) and very helpful professor who will go out of her way to make sure that you succeed in her class-as long as you put an acceptable amount of effort into her problem sets. Her tests are extremely well written and accurately assess the material covered in class. Would highly recommend.
1482,973504,4.5,3.0,"She is a great teacher.  Some people are saying that she isn't organized but I completely disagree.  One of my favorite professors here.  She is so nice and really wants all of her students to do well.  That said, if she sees that you aren't willing to try, she is going to focus on students who are, rather than going out of her way to help you."
1483,973504,2.0,3.0,"She is a health econ expert so she is very knowledgeable on every aspect of the health care system and is pertinent to the real world, but the class was taught in a haphazard fashion. Her writing on the board is illegible at best and you get the feeling that the class has no direction. There's a lot of potential for the class."
1484,973504,3.0,3.0,"She puts everything you need to know on the board. Tests are easy if you take good notes in class. It isn't that exciting because there's so much material to cover in so little time, but she does a good job explaining everything clearly."
1485,973504,2.0,2.0,"Her class was very easy, even for a 101-level intro. course. Her lectures can be a bit difficult to follow, but they duplicate the textbook almost verbatim. Her reviews and the final were very easy. Be prepared to do several projects where you are randomly assigned to a group."
1486,973504,2.0,1.0,She's very disorganized. Dont expect to get tests or assignments within at least a month. Her tests are really easy though and she is pretty nice.
1487,973504,2.5,4.0,"Because Intro to Health is her specialty, she is very passionate about this class. She is knowledgeable too. But like in other reviews, she is not a great teacher. Even though her advices aren't very helpful when you visit her, she really cares about her students. I almost abhorred her lack of organization. Her reviews are fairly difficult."
1488,973504,1.5,5.0,"Worst professor that I have had at Davidson.  She is a very nice lady who wants her students to do well.  However, her writing is illegible, as are her notes, and her english is very strange; her test questions can often be interpreted in different ways.  The class material is not hard, but Sparling makes it an extreme hassle."
1489,973504,4.0,4.0,"Despite the stigma surrounding Dr. Sparling, she is a very intelligent teacher, and writes by far the best tests in the entire econ department.  Her language can be confusing , but if students actually study correctly they will do well.  You need to know it, not memorize it.  Know it and you will do well, memorize it and it's not happening."
1490,973504,2.5,5.0,Her tests were based on the notes but sometimes the notes were unclear or contradictory. She was very nice and understanding but not the greatest teacher.
1491,973504,1.5,4.0,"Extremely nice person, but not a great teacher. Also tries to stick it to you- if you get stuck in her class make sure to study what isn't on her problem sets and practice tests because that is what is likely to be on the tests"
1492,973504,1.0,5.0,"Simply not a good teacher. I went into this class considering an econ major, haven't taken another econ class since.  I would leave classes confused, and going in for help only left me even more confused.  Her tests were extremely difficult.  Just take this class with a different professor."
1493,973504,1.5,5.0,She's a terrible teacher! Obviously knows her stuff but couldn't explain it to you to save her life
1494,973504,2.0,5.0,"Tests were extremely difficult, and she just flat out stinks at teaching. I would leave many classes simply confused. Going in for help rarely resulted in clarity. Try to get another teacher for this class."
1495,185030,5.0,3.0,Overall I loved his class! Going online this semester had growing pains for sure but he handled it really well. This is a language class so expect homework every day.
1496,185030,5.0,3.0,Great professor who adapted well to online teaching. I enjoyed coming to his classes and felt I learned a good amount of German in the process. The only downside was too much emphasis was put on a poorly-programmed online learning textbook
1497,185030,5.0,3.0,"Highly recommend taking a class with him. Cares a lot about the students, loves to talk to you outside of class, invests a lot in helping you do well in his class if you just ask and do the work. Can be tough but he takes participation/effort greatly into account when grading."
1498,185030,4.0,4.0,"Chapter tests were way too difficult, but were only 20% of the final grade and curved. Daily vocab quizzes are an easy grade boost, and class discussions were quite funny and engaging. You have to show up to class. If you put in reasonable effort and enjoy foreign languages you will do well in this class."
1499,185030,5.0,3.0,"Professor Henke is the best history professor I've encountered. Brilliant, funny, and engaging."
1500,185030,5.0,4.0,"Henke is a brilliant man and a great teacher. His classes are very reading heavy, but if you actually do the reading and pay attention you should do fine. Our class is all class discussion, in German of course, and 3 hours of it. But despite this and the 100+ pages of reading per week, his class is my favorite."
1501,185030,5.0,5.0,"Extremely tough class, but Henke is amazing. Favorite professor by far. Keeps class entertaining, but makes you work for your grade. Definitely take a class with him if you can."
1502,185030,4.5,3.0,"Henke is hilarious. I had no problem getting up at 8:30 for this class (well...). Anyway, there is LOTS of vocab assigned, but it's totally manageable if you stay on top of it. There are daily vocab quizzes and weekly tests, which ends up being a good thing because no single test has much weight. I totally recommend German with Henke!"
1503,185030,4.5,4.0,Wow!! This was the best language class ever. Henke is amazing! If you put in the work he will totally make it worth your while. I'm bummed I can't take him for 201.
1504,185030,4.5,3.0,"Henke is the best. Funny and engaging, by far the best Humes professor I've had. Really insightful and knows his stuff."
1505,185030,4.0,3.0,Henke was an awesome discussion leader for humes. He is a pretty tough grader but also very fair and is always willing to help if you go to office hours. Make sure to get his section in whichever part of the humes track you are at.
1506,185030,3.0,4.0,"If I was heading off to class and someone were to say, &quot;Have fun!&quot; this is the only class where I could say &quot;Will do!&quot; I learned a lot and I love German, yay!"
1507,185030,5.0,4.0,The single best professor I've ever had.
1508,185030,5.0,4.0,"Henke is awesome, the best professor I've had in humes. He's smart and demanding but doesn't dominate discussion. Not sure I can say Goethe, though."
1509,185030,5.0,2.0,"Herr Henke is a great professor! He made German fun and interesting. He is always enthusiastic about the material and was really into German. The class is a lot of work, but he offers extra credit. I was dreading this class, but it ended up being great. Just study for the weekly quizzes and keep all of your material for the cumulative portfolio."
1510,185030,2.0,4.0,"You won't fall asleep in his classes - one of the most engaging teachers ever, and plus he won't let you. He will challenge you, but his great attitude will make you want to do the work, which is crucial because GERMAN 103 IS A LOT OF WORK."
1511,185030,3.0,4.0,"Absolutely one of my favorite profs at Davidson.  He's fascinating and a wonderful teacher.  Had him for 101..then denham, then mcculloh...so coming back to him renewed my love for german!  TAKE HIS CLASSES.  if you like soccer speak up, because he'll like you if you know stuff about it. i got teased for months about not having tickets to WC 2006.."
1512,185030,5.0,5.0,"Henke is a wonderful example of pure German blood in all its splendor.  Strong, tall, with light blue eyes, Henke stands out among all other Davidson professors as the one uebermensch."
1513,185030,3.5,4.0,No Comments
1514,185030,4.0,4.0,Burkhard is fabulous.  Definitely the best and most fun professor in the German department.  Take his class.
1515,185030,4.5,2.0,"Great guy, great professor.  Very challenging, yet ultimately rewarding."
1516,185030,3.0,2.0,"Don't get on his bad side.  Also doesn't always seem incredibly interested in students, especially those who are struggling for whatever reason."
1517,185030,5.0,5.0,henke is so cool!!!:)
1518,185030,5.0,3.0,"one of the best teachers at davidson, to be sure"
1519,185030,5.0,4.0,Helpful and fun! Made me love German again!
1520,185030,5.0,4.0,No Comments
1521,185030,4.5,3.0,Hilarious. Gets involved in class and makes it enjoyable. Easy if you have propensity for language.
1522,185030,4.0,4.0,Great professor if you have an aptitude for languages...not sympathetic if you are struggling.
1523,185030,5.0,4.0,Henke rocks
1524,185030,5.0,5.0,"Great guy, great sense of humor, makes learning fun"
1525,436947,4.0,3.0,Dr. Barton is fantastic. He is passionate about clinical psychology and it shows. He is also extremely personable and really wants to get to know his students!
1526,436947,2.5,4.0,Barton is a great professor that you can really develop a relationship with. His tests however are somewhat out there and do not benefit those with different learning styles (i.e. they are commonly 60 multiple choice with a few short answers). His term paper is not so bad. He gives you the final exam &#63;s before you take it. Not easy to get an A.
1527,436947,4.5,4.0,"helped me figure out what psych classes to take, really funny. loves beer and fishing, loves talking about beer and fishing. made me crack up in class."
1528,436947,3.5,3.0,"A great guy that you can just talk to for hours and hours. As a person, probably my favorite professor at Davidson. Not a great teacher, though. If you don't understand something, he'll tend to explain it in the same way. Assignments are large, difficult, and sometimes unclear. But he's great to see for help and will work very hard with you."
1529,436947,5.0,3.0,"Anyone who can make a 10:00 that interesting deserves two thumbs up. Great lectures, middle-of-the-road test, very fair. Extremely approachable! Take this class!"
1530,436947,5.0,4.0,Dr. Barton is amazing!  Spend some time with him outside of class--he's a wonderful person as well as a good professor.
1531,475861,3.0,4.0,"This professor is alright, I've definitely had worse. Her lectures are often very boring and way more confusing than they need to be. She is not good at answering questions or being challenged. She cares a lot about her students, but is not lenient or understanding with extenuating circumstances."
1532,475861,4.0,3.0,"This was a solid class. Some of the tests were a little tricky but nothing unmanageable. The problem sets sometimes took FOREVER, but they weren't too hard. Lectures were dry but informative. She was very available outside of class."
1533,475861,3.0,3.0,Dr. Beeston gave a lot of online homework and there were many tests in the class. Her office hours were limited. To do well in this course you have to get help from her outside of class. Labs usually took up the whole lab period and took a substantial amount of time outside of class to complete.
1534,475861,4.0,2.0,I found this class easy after having AP chem. She is a slightly harsh grader but I didn't think she was that bad. Labs are fun. She is very helpful with review sessions and letting us know what she expects on tests. Homework is easy if you're good at chem. I struggled a bit with the art aspect but a great lecturer so I learned a lot.
1535,475861,4.5,3.0,"Pretty good professor and a very nice lady. She is more than willing to answer pretty much any question in office hours as best as she can. Lectures are good but can be fast-paced, so try to do the reading ahead of time so that you follow along. You can redo each homework question 10 times. Tests are middle-of-the-road. I would probably recommend."
1536,475861,4.0,2.0,"So this class is usually taken by non-majors and I found it to be pretty basic. Dr. Beeston is a great professor who is really good at explaining things and being available for her students. Easy and fun class, excellent teacher!"
1537,475861,3.5,3.0,"She is a sweet old lady. She is helpful in office hours and will guide you through the homework and assignments. Lectures are decent, but she flies through them and usually isn't willing to answer questions. The tests are manageable, not really easy or hard if you practice the material ahead of time and read the textbook. Overall, not too bad."
1538,475861,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Beeston is very smart, really knows Chemistry, but she puts the onus on you to do well. She will lecture (dryly, but the information is all there) and then expect you to figure it out yourself. Go to the science center for help, not her office hours. Lab is hard, focus on sig figs. It's A LOT of information. "
1539,475861,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Beeston gave us chapter packets that we filled with her class lectures, making studying more feasible. Though Chemistry in general is hard and many thought her exams were tough, I personally did well because I read the textbook and worked through the textbook problems. Doing well in this class all comes down to putting in the hours."
1540,475861,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Beeston is an amazing person! She is a very nice woman who is very supportive of her students in office hours. She is understanding especially about the difficulty of the class. I did not like her style of teaching, although nothing personal to her. The tests are extremely hard, lots of homework too. "
1541,475861,4.0,4.0,"The class is difficult, but not excessively so. Homework is directly aligned to exam questions, and you have 10 chances to ace each homework assignment. Tests are tough but very doable with a large amount of studying. Labs are kinda fun but graded very harshly. On occasion, there are small amounts of extra credit. Lectures are fast-paced and boring"
1542,475861,3.5,3.0,"Beeston is a boring old lady who rushes through course content and spends most of class time cranking examples, most of which are noticeably easier than the homework problems. Homework is good prep for the test, and she gives out practice tests, but assignments creep up quickly and the software used is kinda crappy. Overall, knowledgeable and fair."
1543,475861,4.0,2.0,"Super nice. It's not her fault that some tests are difficult. Chemistry is just a difficult subject, so don't blame it on her. She's very understanding, gives extra credits and is a very generous grader. Take her class."
1544,475861,3.0,4.0,"Super nice - tests require studying for more than one day, but you can easily do well in the course if you put in enough effort."
1545,475861,3.5,3.0,"She is very helpful outside of class. In class she is a little more drab and confusing, I think she gets nervous or something. She is also a really nice person and willing to work with you!"
1546,475861,4.5,5.0,One of the nicest professors I've ever had...pretty good class for non-science people (Chem of Art & Artifacts).  The labs are easy and fun but the tests are hard.
1547,475861,3.5,4.0,"She can be a bit boring and she expects you to know your stuff, but if you're into chem it's probably a dream. Not so much if you just want to get a lab out of the way."
1548,475861,4.5,3.0,"I didn't like the class a lot, but it was the best way to get that obnoxious lab science out of the way.  She's woah nice, but lectures are boring."
1549,475861,5.0,3.0,"One of the best classes I've taken here...she is super helpful, the class is really interesting esp. for non science people."
1550,475861,5.0,3.0,Ruth is awesome. Very helpful and straitforward. She's the best teacher to take a lab with.
1551,475861,4.5,2.0,Dr. Beeston is a BEAST. She's great.  A mother-hen.  Go in during office hours and she's helpful and awesome.  Great to fulfill your lab credit but lectures are boring.
1552,475861,4.0,1.0,"Very nice woman, class isn't too tough; nevertheless, her monotone teaching style will put you to sleep in no time. ;)"
1553,1757924,1.5,1.0,"I was really looking forward to taking this class, but after this experience have no interest in ever taking another art class- because of the possibility of having this bad of a professor again."
1554,1757924,4.0,3.0,"She is a great teacher, and does not deserve the bad rap a lot of people give her. If you have difficulty in her class, TALK WITH HER, she is very willing to help her students if you let her know you're having a hard time. She loves when students take risks and experiment with painting. Don't expect a conventional class."
1555,1757924,1.0,3.0,"I can't really say weather or not the class is easy, because I haven't received one grade yet. Hagit is nice and an amazing artist. I'm sure she knows what she's talking about, she just doesn't know how to articulate it. She has a couple catch phrases that she literally uses over and over, despite questions or progress. Its a joke."
1556,1233649,4.0,4.0,"He is extremely helpful in office hours and will sit with you for hours to answer any and all of your questions. He tries to be clear in class, but he doesn't always explain things well and moves pretty quickly. The homework problems are hard and can take a while, unless you go to office hours. Tests are really hard; average is usually about B-."
1557,1233649,3.5,4.0,"Klein is a good man and a decent teacher. He is fairly helpful in office hours and answers questions well during class. He explains things well during class but occasionally brushes up on something important, like a formula or theorem. 2 for easiness, because homework consists of difficult problems which are graded harshly. Overall, not bad."
1558,1233649,2.0,4.0,Hard to understand though very nice teacher.  seems to believe that you can apply a theorem to any problem he can give you without any explanation. very helpful in office hours and is there almost every day.
1559,2611969,2.0,3.0,"He's nice and caring, but the class material is vague and boring. His explanations are unclear that never really reach the point. I think he has real passion for the material but went off on too many tangents."
1560,2611969,1.0,1.0,He's interesting but gets off-topic a lot. Don't take his classes. Waste of time.
1561,2611969,5.0,2.0,Dr. Kim was my favorite professor at Davidson so far. He is so passionate about what he does and loves to connect with his students. You will get out of this class what you put in. Very fun discussion and interesting reading. Homework was mostly just discussion posts and reading. He is very knowledgeable in his field and always there to help.
1562,2611969,1.0,1.0,Students were expected to read lots of materials but he doesn't really teach the course. Easy class and easy A but I learned nothing. He is always emotional and difficult to understand. Don't waste your time. Worst class I had in Davidson
1563,2611969,5.0,3.0,"Phenomenal teacher who made me want to change majors because of the passion he shows for Sociology. He is truly a great guy who cares about his students needs, and grades incredibly fairly. His Demagogues class was truly special!"
1564,2611969,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Jae Kim is an amazing professor with a great outlook on Sociology. He engages with his students and wants everyone to do well. He creates a great environment for students to thrive and asks a lot from you, but if you preform and participate, you will be fine. Can't wait to take another class with him! :)"
1565,391945,3.0,4.0,"She is a great lecturer and is very caring/understanding. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just reach out to her and she will usually be willing to negotiate deadlines. That being said, never do anything last minute. She is a tough grader, but she acknowledges your effort. HEAVY readings! You must read in this class to survive!"
1566,391945,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Tilburg is really down to earth. This course was discussion-based and heavy on the readings, but she did not expect you to understand everything. Critical thinking seemed more important to her than knowing everything. There were a few lectures but nothing dry. I highly recommend visiting her in office hours while you are planning your essays."
1567,391945,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Tilburg is a fantastic professor! She helped me improve my writing skills drastically and is always available outside of class. She is incredibly supportive and helpful in all academic endeavors, and her lectures are amazing. Take a class with Dr. Tilburg!"
1568,391945,5.0,4.0,"Tilburg was definitely the best professor I have taken at Davidson so far, and Ive taken &quot;perfect 5.0&quot; Smith. She had a clear passion both for the material and for teaching, she cares a lot about her students and her lectures are extraordinary. Absolutely take her if you can, but make sure you are putting as much work into the course as she is."
1569,391945,5.0,4.0,She lectures really well (like seriously best lecturer I've had) but gives an unrealistic amount of reading
1570,391945,4.0,4.0,You will enjoy this class if you are very interested in the subject. LOTS of reading and tests and paper topics can be very challenging. You can certainly do well if you put in the work. Takes points for minor issues like using &quot;however&quot; to start a sentence in a paper or not including an exact date in identifications. Very knowledgeable prof.
1571,391945,5.0,4.0,Tilburg is so funny in lectures and keeps things super interesting. Her tests are very fair and she expects a lot but it isn't warranted. Definitely take her even if you aren't a history major--she understands all levels and is great all around.
1572,391945,5.0,5.0,"I hated history until this class. Tilburg assigns a lot of reading, she's a tough grader, lectures are dense and she talks fast. As long as you do your work, participate, pay attention and interrupt for clarification if needed you will do well! Although the class is tough, she's incredibly bright & her & the class are worth taking! Best professor!"
1573,391945,5.0,3.0,I loved the lectures in this class Tilburg is truly a gem in the history department and I would recommend her to anyone (even people not interested in history). Her 100 level classes are straightforward and her expectations are fair for a survey course. Somewhat of a tough grader on papers but overall she's a fantastic teacher!
1574,391945,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Tilburg is a great lecturer, and discussions are really interesting. Only complaint is how much reading came out of the class. She cares about her students a great deal, and any visit to office hours shows it. "
1575,391945,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Tilburg really loves what she does and genuinely wants to pass along her knowledge to students. She's funny and her lectures are very clear & concise. She can be a pretty tough grader on papers, and sometimes the readings are a bit too long. Overall, she's a good professor. It definitely helps if you really love the topic of the class ."
1576,391945,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Tilburg is such a great professor. This was my first class with her and I definitely want to take more. Her lectures are clear and engaging. Although she's not an easy grader, she is very helpful and understanding so it's not that hard to get a good grade if you put in the effort. "
1577,391945,5.0,3.0,I had Dr. Tilburg for European Metropolis 1870-1914 and it is by far the best class I have taken at Davidson. Dr. Tilburg is extremely engaging and has a real passion for her subject and students. Do the readings- participation is huge. Overall positive professor and very helpful. Highly recommended.
1578,391945,5.0,3.0,"Davidson is extremely lucky to have a professor as incredibly intelligent, fascinating, and jovial as Dr. Tilburg. &quot;Modern Body&quot; is a discussion-based class where lectures are engaging and well-organized. She is very fair when grading essays. Go see her during office hours! Highly recommended if you're interested in France/women studies!"
1579,391945,5.0,4.0,"Amazing class, amazing prof, take it as a freshman!"
1580,391945,5.0,3.0,"She has awesome powerpoint lectures, always assigns sweet texts to the class, and is very approachable.  Really cool to talk with."
1581,391945,5.0,2.0,"As an English major, I was ambivalent about taking a history class, but this one was great. The readings and art were diverse with no 'textbook-y' readings, and there was a lot of flexibility in the class. Her lecture are incredibly organzied, too."
1582,391945,5.0,3.0,"So willing to help, though email and office hours.  Not an easy grader.  But always checking to make sure we understood what was going on.  Great teacher."
1583,391945,4.5,4.0,"She is a great teacher, and is not rigid. I hated history before this class, but she made it interesting. When you do the assignments is up to you, and there is a final paper. The reading is pretty demanding, but it was really interesting. The in class discussions were great, she is a good lecturer."
1584,391945,5.0,3.0,Til rocks. Readings are excellent but long. Papers are manageable and lectures worthwhile. She's great to talk to after class and very helpful in office hours.
1585,391945,5.0,3.0,Man - I REALLY like Dr. Tilburg.  Very easy to work with; loves her students; definitely makes the material easy to learn.  I dig her flexibility & openness.  GET HER if you can!!
1586,391945,5.0,4.0,"Very intelligent, fun class. Learned a lot and enjoyed it!"
1587,391948,3.5,2.0,He's a good teacher. It's easy to slip through and get a B or higher. It is good to have a little background in French though.
1588,391948,5.0,2.0,Fun and energetic. Always offers help and his tests and workloads are very manageable.
1589,391948,5.0,2.0,"Great and funny old professor (sometimes his jokes go a bit overboard, but still). Class is a bit hard, requires memorizing lots of grammar and vocab, but he is very willing to help with any question you could possibly have."
1590,391948,5.0,3.0,Best professor ever! SO much fun! Take his 103 class and you wont regret it! Not such a heavy work load but definitely requires a lot of memorization and participation.
1591,391948,5.0,2.0,Dr. Jacobus is the best!  His classes are always fun and engaging and he allows the dialogue to go off on tangents rather than stiking to a script.  The learning curve in this class is very steep and there is something new to learn every day.
1592,391948,4.0,2.0,"This is a class that meets every day, so it was pretty important that Jacobus was fun. His class was really engaging, we simply talked the whole time in frech. Not too hard at all, but you have to get most grammar in AT."
1593,391948,2.0,3.0,"He's ****ing nuts. The class is very awkward, but it's a big joke. Not too hard to do well, but it's extremely hard to stay motivated"
1594,391948,4.5,2.0,"J'adore mon professor du Francais.  He is a really smart guy, he injects his faciniation with cubism and poetry into class, he is infinitely flexible, and does land development on the side (a definite plus in my book).  He does call people, but it is more as a courtesy than as a punishment.  Also, expect to get close with your class, tight even."
1595,391948,5.0,2.0,Don't skip his class is right.  Classes are fun and interesting especially when someone skips and gets called out on it.  His tests and grading are fair.
1596,391948,1.0,5.0,"Awful, awful, awful. I never want to repeat that experience again. Very unfair, obviously plays favorites. My least favorite class in 4 years of Davidson. Unfair grader. Don't skip class- he'll call you on his cell or worse yet, give you a paper to write."
1597,2575122,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bratt is great! We didn't have any tests, just open-note quizzes, and there was a big group project at the end. Participation was important and there were a few student-led classes throughout the semester. There can be a lot of reading for homework, mostly journal articles and textbook readings, but it's useful information. Class is fun, too!"
1598,2575122,5.0,3.0,Dr. Bratt is so chill and smart. Her classes are really interactive and the quizzes make you think about what you've learned from so many different angles.
1599,2575122,4.0,3.0,The class is very organized but she is also flexible about stuff. Her lectures are great.
1600,174870,5.0,4.0,"Great attention to details, writes everything on the board so very easy to follow and take notes"
1601,174870,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors I have ever had. the way he delivers each key point is just meticulous and impeccable. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
1602,174870,2.0,5.0,"How bad could calc 1 be, right? I had an A in it in high school, but in Mike's class that was not the case. His lectures would frequently delve into mathematical theories rather than the information we needed to do the tests and homework. There are only three tests, and class averages are usually a C- at best. On top of that there is no real curve."
1603,174870,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Mossinghoff is a great teacher who is very passionate about math. Be prepared for daily dad jokes. He is a really nice guy and very helpful in office hours; however, his lectures are often long and tedious. Homework is also lengthy and challenging. Although boring sometimes, Mossinghoff's lectures were very insightful."
1604,174870,3.5,4.0,Cryptology is an extremely interesting topic and Mossinghoff enjoys it. I thought it was fun to learn this material. He is a great lecturer but he grades very harshly. Homework is extremely long and the grades don't reflect effort. Tests are hard and long. I found it necessary to go to office hours to thoroughly understand what was expected.
1605,174870,2.0,3.0,"Nightly homework, but no room for explanation of the problems you didn't understand. Lectures are long but the notes you get from them don't usually help very much. His idea of preparing for tests is reiterating all the subsection titles that you covered for the chapter. Textbook poorly explains concepts. Overall, very little assistance from MM."
1606,174870,3.0,4.0,"So I really like Mossinghoff as a person. Whenever I see him in office hours he makes sure to catch up with what's going on and get to know students. However, his homework and grading are tough. In office hours, he's good at explaining concepts but reluctant to give homework feedback. I really like what I'm learning though!"
1607,174870,3.0,5.0,Pretty average lecturer. He doesn't really stand out to me in a good way. He explains overall concepts well in office hours but doesn't offer much advice for homework problems. He seems to believe that he can assign 10-hour-long homework assignments and still give you a failing grade. I don't think this course is worth taking from Mossinghoff.
1608,174870,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Mossinghoff is an incredibly smart guy who really knows his stuff. In class he is a pretty clear lecturer, and is very helpful during office hours. Really tough grader on tests, raw averages are often in the C/D range. However, gives opportunities for test corrections and scales. Homework is not a ton of work, although it is nightly and graded."
1609,174870,3.5,5.0,"Pretty tough class, homework graded pretty hard, and tests were difficult. Talks very quickly and hard to follow, however he really does know what hes talking about and is helpful in office hours."
1610,174870,4.5,4.0,"Mossinghoff is one of the best professors I have had at Davidson.  While lectures can be dull, its because of my lack of interest in the material (I hate math). While there is a lot of homework and he isnt an easy grader, he is extremely helpful in office hours and is very good and making the material understandable."
1611,174870,4.5,4.0,"One of the smartest people I have ever met, I feel honored that I've had him as a teacher. If you like math and you work hard, you will do fine."
1612,174870,2.5,4.0,"I can say without a doubt that he is my least favorite math professor. A typical lecture from Dr. M consists of a boring lecture about a theorem followed by a proof right out of the book. His tests are reasonable but his grading is absurd. Good guy, dry sense of humor, but does not know how to teach. Fails to point out where things come from."
1613,174870,5.0,4.0,"Difficult for an introductory class but he is as clear and helpful as he can possibly be. Visit his office hours for homework assignments and tests. Tough grader, but not much more than your average Davidson prof."
1614,174870,1.5,4.0,"He really is a nice guy that tries hard, but that's where it stops.  Not a clear prof, assigns work that takes several hours - more than most upper level classes.  Avoid for the intro level classes."
1615,174870,1.5,4.0,"Dr. Mossinghoff is a nice guy, who belongs at a research university, not a liberal arts college.  His lectures involve copying proofs from the book onto the board with no explanation.  His method of grading is not even cogent.  If you can still tolerate the material after he teaches it, you might consider pursuing a thesis in that area."
1616,174870,3.0,5.0,"Mossinghoff's lectures were usually hard to follow and focused almost always on theory.  His take-home tests were extremely difficult but weren't so bad if you're ready to devote 10+ hours of serious thought.  Rewarding, challenging problems.  Clearly a good mathematician, but not the best lecturer. Worth taking if you're serious about math."
1617,174870,1.0,5.0,"This class was the bane of my existence.  Dr. Mossinghoff lectures purely on theory without providing concrete examples.  If you want extra help, he is reluctant to provide it at his office hours.  In the end, you are not at all prepared for his ridiculous tests.  Extremely unapproachable and makes you feel dumb if you don't get it the first time."
1618,174870,3.0,4.0,"Mossinghoff can throw a dry joke into a lecture every week, but this is the only redeeming quality of the class. The class is only a lecture about the idea of a section and a few examples, thats it. Not talkative or particularly helpful in office hours. A nice guy, but not a teacher who sparks enthusiasm in the course. Dreaded this class above all."
1619,174870,3.0,3.0,"Mossinghoff is a really good teacher.  He's so funny, even though he doesn't mean to be.  An entertaining, if slightly difficult class."
1620,174870,3.5,3.0,"It's a good class.  He's not the easiest prof around, and lectures can be a little dry.  But he's still a nice, fair guy.  He'll always try to help you if you need it."
1621,174870,2.0,4.0,Is unable to explain theory to those who aren't incredibly math oriented
1622,174870,3.5,3.0,"Brilliant, but a little bland."
1623,174870,5.0,1.0,awesome
1624,174870,2.0,4.0,Smart man but doesn't explain things well to others who don't understand material as well as he does. The tests are really hard and it seems that he likes to give bad grades.
1625,174870,3.0,3.0,No Comments
1626,174870,2.0,4.0,He doesn't understand that no one understands what he's talking about.  Nice guy but speaks a different language.
1627,1643286,3.5,5.0,One of the smartest guys in a brilliant department but sometimes is literally unable to explain what he''s thinking because there''s so much going on. Really cares about his students office hours all the time but if you don''t know the material come review time you''re SOL.
1628,1643286,4.5,5.0,not easy. very helpful.
1629,174872,5.0,4.0,"Mark always makes himself super available for office hours or to answer questions over email. It is a tough class and a lot of material is covered throughout the semester but he really wants his students to succeed. He is one of the most understanding professors. Also, he's brilliant, so if you have any questions, do not be afraid to ask."
1630,174872,2.0,4.0,He is nice and knows his stuff but his style of running the class is kind of unorganized.
1631,174872,3.0,4.0,The content of discussions is great but he is a little too casual about the structure of the class. Oram exams - about fifty percent of your grade.
1632,174872,5.0,5.0,"Mark is fantastic. I had him for ECO105 &amp; 205 &amp; recommend taking these classes with him over anyone else. His classes are fast-paced and can be grueling (expect to spend 7-9 hours min. on his tests + his regression analysis paper is much more demanding), but you won't regret getting to know one of the warmest and best professors in the department."
1633,174872,5.0,4.0,"Straight to the point, and understand every single question of mine"
1634,174872,5.0,3.0,"Mark is a really cool guy and a great professor.  He moves briskly through lectures, so it is helpful to read the book section for the lecture the previous night (as he suggests).  Labs and problem sets are not too difficult. Tests usually have one difficult problem, so study well beforehand. Also, start the paper early.  He'll answer questions."
1635,174872,5.0,1.0,Best Teacher Ever
1636,174872,4.5,4.0,"One of the best and overall nicest professors I've had. Very fast paced but gets you ready for econometrics. Also, be warned, his tests are difficult and force you to apply concepts, not merely regurgitate them."
1637,174872,4.0,5.0,"Mark teaches a solid Statistics course that is fast-paced and difficult to follow sometimes, but he makes his PowerPoint lecture slides available online for note-taking in class. His tests are tough, the labs are busywork, and the regression analysis paper is quite a task, but he is extremely helpful and fantastic to work with outside of class"
1638,174872,3.0,4.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU ARE EXTREMELY PROFICIENT WITH POWERPOINT. HE GOES VERY FAST AND EXPECTS YOU TO TEACH YOURSELF THE MATERIAL IF YOU DONT GET IT THE FIRST TIME. THE TESTS ARE INCREDIBLY HARD AND HE NEVER SLOWS DOWN IF PEOPLE DONT UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL.
1639,174872,4.0,5.0,An awesome professor! Yes the class was horribly difficult.  But he is very helpful and I enjoyed his classes.
1640,174872,3.0,5.0,He covered more material than any other professor that teaches the course and he grades more harshly than anyone else in the department. He failed quite a few in my class.
1641,174872,4.5,4.0,"tends to teach harder courses which explains the difficulty of his classes. extremely helpful in office hours. he's a genius and goes through material like one which can explain confusion during lectures, but he will slow down if you ask. one of the best professors in the econ department."
1642,174872,1.5,5.0,Not enough HWK relative to the difficulty of his reviews and exams. Back breaking!! Too dependent on Powerpoint and does not explain concepts very well. Lots of office hours but poor teaching style.
1643,174872,2.5,4.0,Not enough homework relative to the difficulty of the tests and exam. Not enough diversity in overall grade components. Lots of office hours but not of much use.
1644,174872,3.5,5.0,"Not my teaching style... he uses power points. Pretty hard tests, not enough HW for practice: you are expected to do it on your own, which for me did not work out. Other than that, he is an awesome person and is always willing to help. Not to mention that he is the best looking teacher on campus."
1645,174872,4.0,3.0,"He is a really good econ. professor, he enlivens the subject matter so it is not as dry as it should or could be.  His style of teaching from his powerpoint slides didn't work with me, as the dark room, the subject material, and the cool wall behind my head destroyed my wakefulness without fail.  Yet, I am doing well in his course. I recommend it."
1646,174872,4.0,3.0,"Really awesome professor. Knows his stuff, and breaks everything down to the basics. Read your notes everyday after class, and keep up to date with the homework and you'll be more that fine. Very helpful with office hours. Teaches mostly from pp slides, so if ur not good with that, it 'could' be a problem. even so, a must take."
1647,174872,5.0,3.0,"Overall great guy, and great teacher.  Very energetic and enthusiastic."
1648,174872,4.5,3.0,one of best econ professors
1649,174872,5.0,3.0,"Mark's a great guy.  You just can't get a more laid-back econ prof.  Extremely intelligent, knowledgable, and flexible."
1650,174872,4.5,3.0,"Awesome guy...insists on being called Mark; easy-going, and a great teacher"
1651,174872,5.0,4.0,No Comments
1652,174872,5.0,3.0,Very helpful inside and outside of class.  Great guy.
1653,174873,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU JUST NEED A VAPA CREDIT! There are 2 tests, 3-4 mini assignments, 1 paper, and a final (need a 60% or better to pass the class). Test 1 is 10% of your grade and ALL tests are based on detailed memorization of artwork. Discouraged office hours and told me to ask a student for notes before coming to him. AWFUL MAN. AVOID"
1654,174873,2.0,5.0,Professor Smith is a very nice person and is very passionate about art history but his class is absolutely miserable. I would STRONGLY recommend that you don't take any of his classes. The tests are incredibly challenging because they are based purely off of the memorization of paintings and art work. I also found his lectures to be boring.
1655,174873,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Smith will teach you a lot about art. He knows and cares about his material, and he is enthusiastic to help students learn it. Building a relationship with him is huge! Its true that he tells personal stories and can come off as pompous, but I dont think he means to be snobby. Get to know him and show him you care about art; youll be fine."
1656,174873,1.0,5.0,"Do not take his class, I regret it so much. Impossible memorization tests, requires you to know title, date, artist, period and significance of HUNDREDS (not an exaggeration) of art pieces at a time. Takes off points for no reason, and boring lectures. One redeeming thing is that he obviously loves what he teaches."
1657,174873,4.5,4.0,"Smith is always willing to meet with students in office hours to go over past tests and papers. He is a tough grader and tests require a LOT of memorization, but you come out of the class with a deep knowledge of American Art, and therefore American History. Would not recommend taking just to get an easy art requirement. "
1658,174873,1.5,5.0,"While the class was 100-level, Dr. Smith taught to the senior Art History majors in the room. Instructions for papers and assignments were vague, and he was very disorganized. It was difficult to know what to study, and, while readings were clearly assigned on the syllabus, the class was weeks behind. Lectures were very boring, especially at 8:15."
1659,174873,4.5,5.0,Very engaging professor who is interested in what he's teaching. Really likes it when you asks insightful questions and is very helpful during office hours.
1660,174873,3.0,3.0,"He did translate for the Pope. He did ride his bike throughout Europe. I think his stories are funny. If you want your education handed to you on a platter than don't take him. If you want to learn about art, he's great. Why do you think we went to Davidson&#63;"
1661,174873,1.0,4.0,Makes stuff up.  He translated for the Pope/ rode a motorcycle from London to Jerusalem&#63;  I think not.  Takes points off of your work for no reason and won't explain why.  Singlehandedly ruins the art department at Davidson.
1662,174873,2.0,3.0,Extremely spacey.  Does more bragging about his world travels/good restaurants in France than teaching about art.  And his lectures are often times nonsensical.  Forgets about his own tests and assignments.  Avoid.
1663,174873,2.0,4.0,"Very unclear in class - throws in random French words all the time which usually don't make any sense. For outside help, he basically tells you to &quot;think more&quot; and that's about it. Acts a little sketchy sometimes too."
1664,174873,2.5,5.0,"Nice guy, but very difficult and tedious class! DO NOT take this class if you just want your fine arts credit (unless you absolutely love art of course). Lectures are extremely boring."
1665,174873,1.0,5.0,creepy & pretentious
1666,174873,5.0,3.0,AWESOME!!  That is all...
1667,174873,4.0,4.0,"A LOT of slides... but a great guy, class is interesting, he's smart as hell.  reviews are very intimidating."
1668,174873,4.5,3.0,Great guy and explains things very well but his tests are unrepresentable of work done.
1669,99116,3.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Plank for WRI 101; there are 4 books (and essays), about 60 pages for each class, and final paper. In class, he lectures and it is boring. He will like you if you talk. He is a confusing grader and just wants you to regurgitate the ideas he talks about in class. He plays favorites - try to get on his good side by participating!"
1670,99116,5.0,4.0,"I LOVED my class with Dr. Plank. He truly is an amazing, caring professor and cares about his students and their ideas. I was able to explore my own ideas in the papers and receive feedback. He is a tough but fair grader and be sure to take detailed notes during class. Take a class with him! He is so insightful and caring."
1671,99116,5.0,3.0,"Professor Plank is one of the best professors I've ever had. So caring, kind, and brilliant. Hearing him take about these memoirs was a delight. A pretty easy A, too. All you have to do is write down everything he says in his lectures and word vomit that in your papers and you've got an A. He appreciates bright thinkers and good readers."
1672,99116,5.0,3.0,"Professor Plank is hilarious and respected professor who truly cares about the well-being and success of his students. The WRI101 course I took with him consisted of reading five memoirs and writing five essays related to each of those memoirs, as well as a final project. Pay attention to the arguments he makes during class and take good notes."
1673,99116,4.0,4.0,"Pretty smart guy. This was a writing course--we read 5 American memoirs. Discussion based, sometimes boring. 5 essays about the books. He graded hard, and I felt discouraged sometimes, but his comments made sense. You need deep analyses. 8-12 page paper final. He told us that back in the day, his 500 page dissertation was about 4 lines of text :o"
1674,99116,5.0,3.0,"Karl Plank is one of the best professors I have had at Davidson. I took Genesis Narrative with him, and the way he takes the class through a journey into the mind's and motivations of the characters was truly enlightening. It's not easy but well worth it."
1675,99116,2.5,2.0,Easy
1676,99116,1.0,5.0,Probably a really nice guy but the worst grader I've ever had at Davidson. Horrible. 
1677,99116,1.0,5.0,Incredibly difficult grader and very unclear. Don't take him. 
1678,99116,3.0,4.0,"Plank definitely grew on me. His lectures can be very boring at times, but extremely interesting at others. You could probably get away without doing much work, but you need to make sure you do well on the papers. He doesn't give grades away for those."
1679,99116,5.0,4.0,Incredibly brilliant and kind. He genuinely cares about both the subject matter and his students. Take good notes and you'll be fine.
1680,99116,4.0,3.0,"Lots of students groan and complain about Dr. Plank, but he is a fantastic teacher. He lays out each assignment very clearly, and expects you to reiterate what he lectured about, so take good notes. He is definitely one of my favorite professors here, as he is extremely caring about each student's health and well-being. I highly recommend him."
1681,99116,2.5,4.0,One of my favorite professors at Davidson College. He is brilliant and really cares about each student!
1682,99116,4.0,5.0,"I love this professor!  He is super hard, especially when it comes to grading, but he teaches you so much."
1683,99116,2.0,5.0,"I took Jewish Rel. Life honestly looking to learn about a different culture. I ended up hating the class, mostly b/c Plank graded reviews really hard, even though his class didn't seem difficult. He's a nice guy, but awkward during office hrs & never made it clear why I didnt do well. Simply a poor life decision taking that class with him."
1684,99116,5.0,3.0,A mind-expanding class.  Definitely worth it - he has a great sense of humor and is always willing to consider students' opinions in evaluating the reading material.
1685,99116,4.5,4.0,"Plank can be a little boring sometimes (it's that calm, slow voice early in the morning), but I learned SO MUCH in his class.    He's also very approachable (albeit a little socially uncomfortable) and loves to get to know his students.  Do expect to regurgitate a little, but some original thought is encouraged.  Overall a great prof."
1686,99116,3.0,4.0,"He's a great lecturer but he gives way, way too much reading. He's tough but you can do well IF you take good class notes and basically repeat everything he says in class on your papers. He's all about specifics and details, so you have to show him you've &quot;had your nose in the book&quot; (his words not mine) on exams and in papers."
1687,99116,3.5,5.0,"Dude, this guy teaches English classes about religious texts.  If that's what you're looking for, then take him, but don't expect it to be easy.  I tried to be creative and did not do so well in his class.  A friend of mine, however, quoted him in papers and did quite well even though they were supposed to be reflective in nature."
1688,99116,3.0,3.0,"I went into this religion course with minimal religious background and ended up doing very well.  All you need to do is take a lot of notes every class and regurgitate what he said in class in your essays.  He's undoubtedly brilliant.  Not very helpful when I went for extra help. Don't miss a class, and expect to work."
1689,99116,3.0,5.0,"If you're a religion major, you probably already love the guy.  Otherwise, do your best to avoid him.  There's no question that he really knows what he's talking about - it's just that half the class doesn't.  Loves to use big words, is sometimes unconfident.  A nice guy, just not always interesting"
1690,99116,4.5,4.0,"Amazing insight; great discussion; excellent texts- be prepared to work your arse off, and love doing it!"
1691,99116,5.0,4.0,The Plankster transforms your world.  Brings Judaism to life!
1692,357170,4.0,4.0,"Gives great lectures and recommends interesting reads. TOUGH GRADER - Will pick apart your paper (SO DONT WRITE A PAPER LAST MINUTE) however she has a clear grading criteria and highly encourages you to meet with her during the writing process. Extremely accessible, accommodating, and understanding of life gives extensions. Lovely person."
1693,357170,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Cho is very smart. I wasn't a huge fan of medical anthropology because I don't think the material we covered was very useful. The biggest takeaway in the class for me was the introduction to the serenity house volunteer opportunity. Save time and your GPA and just google the serenity house, she is a very tough grader."
1694,357170,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Cho is very clear about what she expects from you. Although you are graded by only a few papers/tests throughout the semester, she is very accessible and helpful outside of class and will give you honest feedback about your ideas and help give you direction in papers. Her class is lecture-based, and it's to your benefit to go to office hours."
1695,357170,4.0,4.0,"She's a tough grader on papers, but her lectures are great and tests are a bit easier. I looked forward going to her class and genuinely enjoy the readings that are assigned."
1696,357170,4.5,3.0,Cho is very clear in lectures and tells you exaclty what you need to study for the test and what she expects. Excessive reading but only for extra knowledge and background (ie she tests on the lectures not readings). Harsh grader though. Really wants you to justify your conclusions. Easy to talk to and available to help in office hours.
1697,357170,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Cho is a really smart who is easy to follow and clear. Her expectations are clearly defined, a little picky, but easy to communicate with. Sometimes she is very personable, but really determined to get through material. The material itself is a lot to know but she makes it easy to understand."
1698,357170,3.0,4.0,Cho blazes through information in lectures and expects you to learn a lot of memorization facts. Class is not mandatory but all her tests and essays are based off of class notes. I would not recommend taking this class if you don't have to for the major. She is an extremely tough grader and her multiple choice tests are formatted to trick you.
1699,357170,5.0,3.0,"Lectures are critical for passing the class. The readings assigned usually do not appear on the tests, only lecture notes are. Cho is very informative and is willing to you help you with anything. She is very nice and keeps the class interesting with group experiments occasionally. She is a very tough grader when it comes to essays. Expect 3 tests."
1700,357170,4.5,3.0,"Yes, she is a tough grader on the essays. I'm not going to deny that, but she is also very interesting, knowledgable and I thought her class was a great way to start my college career."
1701,357170,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Cho really knows what she's talking about and she expects you to as well. I took her class as a non-major distribution requirement, so I struggled for this reason. There are very few grades and participation doesn't matter, but show up to class for the lecture notes."
1702,357170,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Cho really knows what she's talking about and she expects you to as well. I took her class as a non-major distribution requirement and struggled for this reason. There are very few grades and participation doesn't matter, but show up for the lecture notes."
1703,357170,4.5,3.0,"I took Med Anthro and it was a really good class. You had to do 20 hours of out of class service, and the classes were all discussion based and super interesting. She is a great teacher, grades hard but fair and is decently helpful during office hours."
1704,357170,4.5,2.0,"I love this professor. She is quite frank and to-the-point but not in a bad way (it can be off-putting for some). Her tests are super easy if you study, attend classes, and take good notes. Books are supplemental and are not needed to ace test. However, essays are not solely based on class content and require adequate outside research and detail."
1705,357170,5.0,3.0,"She is one of my favorite professors at Davidson. Her lectures are very interesting and necessary to pass all her exams. Her essays require you to write clear and persuasive arguments backed by substantial data. She is a hard grader, but very willing to help in her office hours."
1706,357170,4.5,3.0,I think people are intimidated by her frankness. She tells it like it is. Class discussions are interesting and fulfilling. The material often raised a lot of emotion by the end of class. There are only 3 essays and a final presentation. Do all the readings and you will speak and write with confidence. Homework was actually enjoyable. I recommend.
1707,357170,2.0,3.0,"I did not come to Davidson to take a class such as this one. While the material piqued my interest, Dr. Cho is a poor lecturer. She tries to make rather simple material more complex at the cost of explaining things clearly. Her essay topics were very interesting to me, but her grading is very hasty and very arbitrary."
1708,357170,4.0,4.0,"Go in for office hours, especially regarding essays. She will help you if you go in. On her tests, she only uses the notes, never ANY of the textbook readings. When I tried to incorporate textbook readings in my answers, she marked me down and told me to use her notes instead. I enjoyed the material, it was very interesting. Straightforward lady."
1709,357170,4.0,4.0,"She is a really good professor, most of the time. Her tests are really easy if you study well, but she is an extremely harsh paper grader. Go see her multiple times for each paper and follow her guidelines or you will receive a bad grade. You don't really need to do the readings for this class. Overall, good class if you're interested in forensics."
1710,357170,3.0,4.0,"Cho is an interesting professor who is constant in her methods of teaching class. She explains things well, but it seems sometimes oversimplified, especially on essay prompts, which are too broad to give specific answers to in her page caps. She then grades the papers very harshly. Go in for help at least 3x a paper to maybe understand the prompt."
1711,357170,5.0,4.0,"I have taken Dr. Cho for 340 & 373. She is my major advisor, and I couldn't ask for a better professor. She is insanely helpful and spells out exactly what she wants from you. She is also more than willing to meet with you and offer guidance. Because she is so clear about what she wants, she can be very particular about the grading. Best professor."
1712,357170,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Cho's lectures are interesting and easy to follow.  However, at times she glosses over subjects or seems to oversimplify.  Her tests are very easy if you study, but papers are interesting.  She has a very unique grading style so you may get some poor grades.  If you learn her system, you will do fine, just remember not to use it on other profs."
1713,357170,4.5,4.0,"One of my favorite classes at Davidson. Dr. Cho is an incredible lecturer, despite what is said here; she's also always willing to help you. I had no background in anthro, and I did fine. She is very demanding, but it is within reason; if you strictly follow her guidelines on essay-writing, and if you study enough for her tests, you'll do fine."
1714,357170,1.5,4.0,"I took nothing away from lectures. Unclear in her expectations for papers and this showed in the grades. Tests were entirely from inclass material but asked for obscure details. Somehow, this class made me uninterested in forensic sciences."
1715,357170,3.5,3.0,Very nice professor who grades fairly. Tests and papers very do-able. Class keeps your interest if you like evolutionary theory. Covers culture to some extent but a large focus on biological/skeletal structures of apes and fossil evidence.
1716,357170,1.5,3.0,"DO NOT take forensic anthro.  It was moderately interesting, but the tests are incomprehensible and written at a middle-school level.  As for the paper, don't expect any comments as to why she gave you a certain grade."
1717,357170,1.5,3.0,Tests are poorly written with unclear questions and Cho seems to have only a superficial knowledge of the subjects she teaches.
1718,357170,3.5,4.0,I think that she believes that A's are only for the word A-nthropology. Lots of work to get even a B.  This is a pretty dry  subject that she tries to inject  some interest  into  to get her students attention which is a tough thing to do.  Very bright and expects her students to be likewise.
1719,357170,5.0,3.0,"Really knows her stuff, kind and helpful in office hours.  You must work for your grade, though.  If you put in the effort and show interest, she will reward you.  Fascinating class!"
1720,357170,5.0,3.0,"She's clear and organized, but don't be fooled by her somewhat easy-going attitude in class. She's a tough grader, especially on papers, but if you pay attention to what she's picky about for your next paper, you'll be fine. She's straightforward and consistent, and a fair grader. She's really helpful during office hours as well."
1721,357170,1.0,3.0,"She's a pleasant enough person, but class is utterly inane, and utterly unworthy of Davidson.  Mindnumbing and repetitive.  It's back to middle school, minus the part about the teacher being reasonable or right.  One of my worst choices at this school."
1722,357170,5.0,2.0,very easy class. Dr cho is a really good teach if you go and talk to her. Test are not that bad either (if you like the topics of the class)...
1723,357170,5.0,4.0,"If you show interest in the subject and take time to visit or stay after class with questions about the material or to ask for help in, for example, narrowing down a paper topic, she'll be very helpful and you'll get a lot out of the class. It's a 2-way street. She's a great professor and it's a great class, but you have to put in the effort."
1724,357170,4.0,2.0,knows what she is talking about. real nice if you talk to her
1725,357170,2.0,5.0,Terrible Class. Textbooks were useless. He lectures were useless. She would ask the most random and obscure things on tests and graded essays with a mangled iron fist. Do NOT take!!!
1726,357170,1.5,3.0,"Run! Run away...fast! Like the bidepal australopithecines, run like you've never run before. It's like returning to high school. But worse. Save yourself! Lectures are amazingly boring, and test prep is awful. Material made me want to die, as did her dreadful PowerPoints and movies. To sum up: R-U-N"
1727,357170,3.0,3.0,"This class is ridiculous... Dr. Cho's lectures are so middle school, and yet somehow the tests are nearly impossible; you need to memorize very large amounts of info and terms.  Take it pass-fail if you know what's good for you."
1728,357170,1.0,4.0,No Comments
1729,357170,1.5,1.0,"I don't know what planet that other rater is from, but Dr. Cho's tests were some of the easiest I've had a davidson, just memorize a couple of facts and you're set.  This was a verrry easy course, despite the fact that her lectures were useless."
1730,357170,3.5,4.0,"teacher is nice/subject is awful,expects you to know insane amnts of info for the tests. ex:all these primates, and what they eat, whether they have tails or not, where they live, theire scientific names, just basically EVERYTHing in notes: EVERYTHING!"
1731,475969,5.0,4.0,"Merrill is a really tough grader! Super kind, lovely, interesting, and interested in the subject. Doesnt mess around with citations though. Despite never getting the grade I wanted in her classes (always B+ never A), I have taken 3 classes with her because of how awesome she is. "
1732,475969,5.0,3.0,"Annie is one of the best professors I've ever had. Especially during Covid, she is incredibly caring, organized, and aware of our lives as students during a global pandemic. There is no busy work, and all assignments are intended to help us learn. This class was rare in that students loved to participate, and it was an amazing environment."
1733,475969,4.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I've ever had. She genuinely cares about all of her students and loves when you come to office hours. She's quirky and interesting but incredibly brilliant. I've heard people complain that you have to agree with her to do well. She has high expectations for her students, but they are clearly defined for all assignments. "
1734,475969,5.0,4.0,"An amazing professor, an amazing woman! The English Language course is incredibly interesting. And it's NON-STOP fun!"
1735,475969,5.0,4.0,"Environmental Lit. with Ingram was one of my favorite classes at Davidson. Loved it, loved her. Interesting course material. Tough but fair grader. Take this class if you have even a semblance of interest."
1736,475969,4.5,4.0,"Great professor. Really intense reading expectations but classes always flew by. I loved Env. Lit, and would suggest it to anyone interested in reading some quality books."
1737,475969,4.0,3.0,"I've never had her for class, but she's super nice and chili pepper status."
1738,475969,2.0,5.0,Avoid this class. Its a ridiculous amount of work and the team teaching idea makes it confusing rather than interesting. Its my least favorite class that I've taken at Davidson. I thought I might pursue Env. Studies but now I don't think I will.
1739,475969,3.0,4.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! This is possibly the worst class that Davidson offers. There are three professors that teach this class so the lectures can be all over the place. The workload is absurd and the grading is subjective. I thought I was interested in taking in Enviro. Studies until I took this. Ingram can be helpful but also very rude at times.
1740,475969,3.5,4.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I don't care if Ingram is quirky or cute or whatever. The expectations are outrageous for a 100-level class and the team teaching was all over the place. It also felt like she and the two other teachers teaching this were sort of laughing at students at times. Ingram herself is a good lecturer and helpful i guess.
1741,475969,5.0,3.0,Amazing Woman. Take her. Horrible class. Avoid it at all costs.
1742,475969,5.0,4.0,"Always interesting and energizing. Be prepared to work a lot but for her teaching, definitely worth it! Very helpful outside of class as well."
1743,475969,5.0,3.0,"Energetic and fun, she makes this class a blast!  I highly recommend!"
1744,475969,4.5,2.0,"Annie is very good at making the material interesting and, often, entertaining.  Her many pleasant personality quirks and eccentricities made it fun to go to class.  Her grading of both papers and tests is fair and clear.  She is always eager to provide help outside of class if you desire it."
1745,475969,2.0,5.0,"Assigned a RIDICULOUS amt. of reading. To postpone grading any papers, she assigned presentations throughout the semester and expected us to suddenly produce a 20-pg. paper betwn. the last 2 class mtngs. I could've used at least SOME clear guidance and proactive HELP prior to that, esp. b/c it was 40% of our grade. A real absence of help from her."

1747,475969,5.0,3.0,"only a brilliant and entertaining woman like annie could make american lit interesting to me. she succeeded, of course. she's amazing."
1748,475969,5.0,3.0,"I was an English Major and Annie rocked, I had her for a number of classes and she was always a tough grade, but fair.  Your hard work was always noted.  Highly recommend!"
1749,2431814,5.0,3.0,"A wonderful person and an energetic, engaging teacher. Class was lecture heavy and I don't listen well, but the readings offered good opportunities to learn and were carefully selected to suit both the class topic and the advances in genomics. Highly recommend the class and her as a professor."
1750,2431814,5.0,3.0,"Dr. T-S is kind, enthusiastic, and a strong lecturer. The tests are intimidating, but her grading is generous, and there are plenty of opportunities to raise your average. She also curves significantly. Couldnt recommend her enough."
1751,2431814,5.0,3.0,"I am glad to take my intro bio class with a professor who is so passionate at 8:30 class, makes hard content easy to help people understand, and a professor dedicating quality office hours to students. Hands down, hope will go back to her!"
1752,392009,4.0,4.0,Great professor but tough grader. Expects a lot and is willing to help you get there.
1753,392009,4.5,5.0,"Expects brilliance. Pushes you to max if you don't let comments/grades discourage you. Picky. Cocky. Rarely gives compliments, but when you get one, you really earned it. Provides tips on writing you'll keep for lifetime. Writing papers (65%) is whole class. No readings! Still lots of analytical thinking. Ask for help even when he it's not offered."
1754,392009,3.5,4.0,"Lectures were always interesting and I always left feeling inspired and deeply enlightened about American literature. So while Dr. Nelson is a great teacher, he's not a good professor. Very unapproachable, impersonal, can be rude, comments on papers are not very helpful, and he is an incredibly tough grader. I'd be wary about taking him again."
1755,392009,3.5,3.0,"Nelson is brilliant, sassy, and honestly I wish I had taken a class with him sooner. I wish I could hear his lectures every day. Take this class and you'll learn more about American Lit than you ever thought you wanted to know. "
1756,392009,2.5,5.0,While I won''t deny that I think my writing improved from taking this course I would never recommend a Nelson class to anyone.  He''s very pretentious and he addresses his classes with such an air of superiority as if we are simply lucky that he''s letting us in on his insights about literature and the English language.  I would avoid at all costs
1757,392009,3.5,5.0,"While this class was beneficial in polishing my writing techniques, it could have been executed better.  Dr. Nelson was clear in providing his guidelines, but expects excellence.  This ""excellence"" is quite a stretch.  He does grade on improvement, so that is beneficial, but you don't know where you stand until the end of the semester."
1758,392009,3.0,4.0,"You have to be a certain type of personality to both enjoy Nelson's teaching style and to connect with/appreciate him as an individual. He totally intimidated me for the first month, but I came out of his class feeling very glad that I took on the challenge. If you won't be willing to refine your writing style and skills, do not take his class."
1759,392009,4.0,4.0,"280 with Nelson is the best class I've ever taken at Davidson. People think he's scary, but he's not; you just have to actually speak up and he'll notice you fine. LECTURES ARE AMAZING, challenged my ideas on life, not just on literature. Do yourself a favor, and take a Nelson class."
1760,392009,2.0,5.0,"AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS. He is the meanest, most arrogant professor I've ever had. He is not approachable. When you do talk to him, you will walk away feeling like the dumbest person alive. He is incredibly condescending and rude. His criticism is often unnecessarily CRUEL and unhelpful. He should be teaching grad students, NOT undergraduates."
1761,392009,4.0,5.0,Very Very tough if you are not an english major.  Do not take this guy lightly.  He definitely helps you write for the reader.  If writing is not your strength DO NOT take his class.  Otherwise he will improve your writing dramatically. BE ORIGINAL and interesting!
1762,392009,3.5,4.0,"Taking one of his classes will definitely improve your writing. His lectures are never dry but its unclear as to whether his theories on the lit are brilliant or bull... great if your prepared for a challenge, but otherwise I would take Kuzmanovich for American lit and take Nelson for a class in his field - short fiction"
1763,392009,3.5,5.0,"Very tough grader.  If you're not an English major, but want to take this course, you should not take it with him. That said, in spite of the B or B- I will take from this class, I would take it again if I could. I love Nelson's lectures and had the best time at his house when he had our class over for refreshments and gave us Japanese Maple seeds."
1764,392009,5.0,5.0,"Oustanding professor!  He was very tough, but he made the material so interesting.  He greatly improved my writing and he always cared--deeply--for students.  He made a lasting, positive impression."
1765,392009,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Nelson was delightful. His blistering criticism was always specific and helpful, and he is one of the few Davidson profs who actually gives you useful advice for after you graduate. He has a rep for being mean, but he was always kind and truthful with me. And he remembered my name afterwards!"
1766,392009,1.0,4.0,"Nelson may be a &quot;brilliant&quot; author; this does not make him a good professor. Nor an &quot;OK&quot; one. His classroom persona/schtick/call it what you will, precludes his engagement with material and students. His classes exude what appears to be a lot of knowledge, but you'll leave class everyday emptyhanded- because everything Nelson does is about Nelson."
1767,392009,1.0,5.0,"While obviously brillant by any standards, Nelson should not be teaching freshman composition. Lectures were not helpful and he was never clear about what he wanted in a paper, although he likes classical litterature more then modern stuff. The class was the bane of my existence this year."
1768,392009,4.5,5.0,"Pretty good class.  Nelson is an amazing professor with a sense of humor.  Too bad I can't pull out a decent grade, but it's worth it.  Not all of the class time is spent on the lit which isn't a bad thing.  Wish there was more discussion, though."
1769,392009,2.5,4.0,"Has a very high opinion of himself, likes to read out his own stories and talks about his life A LOT. There's never a clear definition of what he wants as a paper, and he's a tough grader. I was bored all the time."
1770,392009,3.5,5.0,"He can be pretty intimidating, but just let him know that you aren't scared and he'll love you.  He's still a tough grader though."
1771,392009,3.5,5.0,"Brilliant to be sure, but very set in his own opinions.  Rough grader--never quite sure what he was looking for.  Will give you a unique outlook on literature though.  Tries to be really intimidating."
1772,392009,5.0,4.0,"One of best professors at Davidson! Do yourself the favor, and take one (or more) of his classes. Great guy. Comes off as pretentious but in an endearing way. Intelligent and well-spoken. Nelsonisms abound, trust me. Inspiring every class and makes me want to learn more every time. Love him too much"
1773,392009,4.5,5.0,No Comments
1774,1397581,5.0,3.0,He is a great professor - passionate about the topics he teaches and really wants you to understand the material and ask questions. He was also always accessible outside the classroom and very friendly.
1775,1397581,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Mossige is the best professor I have had at Davidson, and we are truly losing  valuable member of the community. He has a contagious teaching spirit that shows through his lectures. He is engaging, funny and a fair grader. He truly loves what he teaches, and it defintely shows. The polisci dep't will forever have a gaping hole without him"
1776,1397581,5.0,3.0,"Very helpful, very smart, high energy professor. He's invested in the material and will appreciate it if you are as well. The pace of the class is frenetic and if you are a timid commenter you may have trouble get a word in. Still, good readings, interesting class. Dag is the man."
1777,1397581,4.5,3.0,"I give a lot of credit to Dr. Mossige - even in an intro class, he assigns political science texts instead of watered-down versions. Don't be intimidated; he does a great job of explaining them. Great sense of humor both in class and out. Tests and papers are challenging, but he's very open to meeting with students and helpful with any questions."
1778,1397581,4.0,2.0,I took comparative politics with Dag and absolutely loved him. His class is very interactive and kept me awake at 9:30 on a Monday morning. the tests are based on discussions in class; there are no surprises. He's a genuinely great professor and a wonderful person. He's very understanding.
1779,1397581,5.0,3.0,"My favorite teacher at Davidson. Classes are kept engaging and interesting, especially with his particular brand of Norwegian humor. The absolute most helpful teacher outside of class. A brilliant professor that you should take"
1780,1397581,4.5,3.0,He is really passionate about what he teaches. His reviews are long but he is lenient with due dates and is always willing to help. He takes attendance but understands how busy students' schedules are. The material he presents in relevant and useful. If you take good notes and pay good attention the reviews should be pretty easy.
1781,1397581,4.5,4.0,"His reviews are take home and are exhausting. But if you pay attention in class, do the readings, and study a bit before hand, you can easily pull off a B/B+. Classes are entirely lecture based but he finds interesting photos and video clips to show the class. He is incredibly funny and his love for Latin America is infectious."
1782,1645390,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Good was extremely thorough and organized. She outlines what she wants and when she wants it. I did find her tests extremely hard and very nitpicky of the material. If you take good notes, study them and you'll be fine. I wish I took better notes in the beginning because I would have done better on her tests."
1783,1645390,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Good is very knowledgeable and presents information very clearly. Class is mainly lecture based, but it goes by super fast and is really interesting. Quizzes are pretty difficult; you definitely need to study extensively to do well. But they are not unreasonable. She is very kind -- she cares about her students and makes herself accessible."
1784,1645390,5.0,4.0,Dr. Good is my favorite professor! She is super nice and helpful. Her lecture is super interesting and she is very organized. She is great at communicating with students and is always willing to help.
1785,1645390,5.0,3.0,Clear way of teaching -- broke down concepts into a very understandable way. Appreciated that she shared the slides that she showed in class. Tests are based on material learned in class. Inclusive and aware as a professor. Reading the textbook is helpful but not rlly necessary since she teaches everything you need to know in class. Cool prof
1786,1645390,5.0,3.0,Dr. Good is an amazing professor! Lecture is super interesting and engaging. She is also super helpful in office hour. I really like her class and she is very supportive.
1787,1645390,5.0,4.0,"Super cool professor, I would definitely take any of her classes again. Still says hi to me in the hallways which other professors don't always do!"
1788,1645390,5.0,4.0,Professor Good is easily the most down to earth professor Ive taken at Davidson. The class is the opposite of intimidating and is very engaging. 10/10 would take any of her classes again
1789,1645390,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Good is an amazing caring person. She clearly loves her subject and her excitement is contagious. She wants all students to enjoy their studies and care about their success. She is very understanding and will gladly help students. The class was a good amount of work, but thats going to be the same no matter the professor."
1790,1645390,4.0,3.0,"I love Dr. Good.  Overall, she is very enthusiastic about social psychology, intelligent, and clearly enjoys teaching. I appreciate the amount of discussion in her classes. The only criticism I've heard is some students think she is arbitrary in grading papers; I disagree. Tests are straight forward. Take any of her classes, especially her seminar."
1791,1645390,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Good is an awesome professor. She's passionate about teaching her students, she likes what she does and she will always be there for them in a tough situation. Would totally recommend taking a class with her!"
1792,1645390,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Good's lectures were very clear and engaging. She usually includes YouTube videos in her powerpoints and uses in-class demonstrations to help us understand the material better. Her exams were difficult, and I had to put in a lot of hours to do well in her class. However, it was so worth it -- I learned the most in her class this semester."
1793,1645390,5.0,3.0,Very interesting course. Dr. Good is extremely helpful and relatable. The material is interesting and she is passionate about the topic. Her exams are not difficult but you will lose little points if you don't pay attention. Conducting your own research is a great experience is helpful but the final paper is a lot of work.
1794,1645390,5.0,2.0,Dr. Good is young and that makes it very easy to relate to. She really tries to make her lectures interesting and applicable to what you are doing in the class. What she lectures you on is on exactly what you will use for your Research project as well as lab assignments she gives you. Pay attention in class and go talk to her and you will do well.
1795,498511,5.0,4.0,"I love Paul Miller. He is the most encouraging, kind, and thoughtful professor that you could ask for. So helpful and honest in office hours, and always willing to advise on any concern or issue. Also taught me a lot about film and life."
1796,498511,4.5,3.0,"Great professor, extremely helpful during office hours. Went to his house to borrow Despicable Me after only one week of class. Absolutely wonderful for an introductory course."
1797,498511,4.5,2.0,Fun and interesting professor who is always willing to help you out in office hours.
1798,498511,4.0,2.0,"Helpful when you meet with him outside of class for essay help.  Pretty clear what your grade in the class is going to be after the first essay.  Lectures are generally pretty interesting, but don't take at 8:15."
1799,498511,4.5,2.0,"Absolutely and completely fantastic professor. If you ever need anything, go talk to him during office hours. Truly enjoys the classes he teaches, and will remember you and your work many semesters later. Has a laid back attitude and due dates are ALWAYS subject to change, which is difficult for the more Type-A crowd."
1800,498511,4.5,4.0,I pretty enjoy his writing class even though English is my second language. His workshop helps me lot in my personal writing work.
1801,498511,4.0,4.0,"Exposes students to good material, gives good pointers although sometimes its hard to know how to incorporate them. Class was relaxed, attendance mandatory but several classes were just for group workshops (i.e. you only had to go one day that week). Approachable and likeable."
1802,498511,2.5,2.0,"Dr. Miller was obviously interested in the subject(US Tech), but the class was incredibly boring and it did not improve my writing at all. His grading system left students wondering what their grade was for the entire semester. Overall, a wasted W course and I would not recommend it for incoming freshmen."
1803,498511,5.0,3.0,"great Prof, gives plenty of help outside of class, is fun because he ties in technology with all his classes using film, computers, etc. he does grade kind of tough - it's easy to get a B in his class and nearly impossible to get an A, however, I've had him for 2 classes and will probably take him again for a third,"
1804,498511,3.5,2.0,"He is an interesting professor, does a lot to make you think on your own but is also very helpful.  He is especially fun to talk to outside of class, really into film and science-writing stuff."
1805,498511,2.5,2.0,Not a good professor for this class. I didn't learn ANYTHING.
1806,498511,4.5,3.0,"Nice guy, very positive, very personable.  Does the &quot;portfolio grading&quot; thing, which some people like and others don't - takes a laid-back approach to the class, but I still feel like I grew a lot in my writing."
1807,498511,3.0,2.0,not very interesting
1808,498511,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher, very enthusiastic, very helpful if you ever need it, just go see him during office hours."

1810,277328,2.0,4.0,"I took BIO 112 with Stanback. Stanback is very friendly and accessible outside of class, but the course is very lecture heavy and these lectures tend to be boring and disengaging. He goes on a lot of tangents about birds and does a poor job making test expectations clear. Get ready to take notes as fast as humanly possible"
1811,277328,3.0,4.0,"Stanback himself is nice, but class consisted only of lectures, and those lectures were mostly pictures of animals (usually birds) with very little written explanation and you were expected to write down everything that he would say (rather quickly) about the particular slide and spit that back out on the exams. Too much material in too short time."
1812,277328,4.0,5.0,"Super hard tests, very specific. Interesting lecturer but the tests are very difficult and ruin the class."
1813,277328,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Stanback has more in depth knowledge of a variety of taxa than most people have of a single species; however, this is the standard of memorization to which he holds his students. The class itself requires little effort outside of attending lecture, however, there were only two tests and the final was worth 40% of our final grade."
1814,277328,2.0,5.0,"His lectures are interesting. You will have to take intense notes. Also, he has a bird-fetish so he mentions birds on like every other powerpoint slide. He has very high standards in grading, especially with lab reports"
1815,277328,2.5,5.0,"Dr. Stanback knows A LOT about biology and you can tell in his lectures. However, he does trend to trail off on random tangents in class so when it comes to tests, I was never sure what we were expected to know and I found the tests to be subjective. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend his class. But one-on-ones are very helpful with him."
1816,277328,4.5,4.0,Tests weren't too bad if you study and look at the spots. The lab reports will be destroyed by the time he's done with him but do well on the pig practical and WWGS and you're set. Curved at end of course. I would recommend him!
1817,277328,5.0,3.0,He gives out plenty of extra credit so don't sweat it. The test might seem a bit hard but the hardest part of the class is the lab. Your lab will look like something out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
1818,277328,5.0,4.0,"lectures are interesting enough, but reviews are a b*tch"
1819,277328,4.5,4.0,"Stanback is awesome; he made an 830 T/Th class interesting. He's passionate, enthusiastic, and very entertaining. Tests were only hard if you did not study for them, although I can remember one or two questions that seemed a little random. Overall he's amazing and I'd def. recommend him. I hope to take another class with him!"
1820,277328,3.5,4.0,His test a very arbitrary and out of no where.  He is a really hard grader--just takes of 10 points with no explanation.
1821,277328,3.5,4.0,"Knowns his stuff, all his lectures are on power point. Overall a good prof but a superhard grader. He will destory your tests and lab reports"
1822,277328,4.5,2.0,"Tougher grader than some other bio professors, but not terrible.  Good lecturer."
1823,277328,4.5,4.0,No Comments
1824,277328,2.5,3.0,"Stanback does a good job of getting across what he needs to teach, but that's about it. He is a major spaz on the grading, so watch out for the dreaded red pen! Knows his stuff, but is too intense for my taste. Won't give you any slack in lab."
1825,2147153,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Jankovic is one of the worst Profs I have ever had. Class subject matter is painfully boring and uninteresting, she is also very bad at explaining key concepts. The class lesson plan is unorganized and two or three times a class she will say &quot;talk about the review questions&quot; and then leave for who knows where. BAD teacher, BORING class!!!!"
1826,2147153,4.0,2.0,"Dr. J is a great professor, especially for intro classes. She really wants all of her students to do their best, and is willing to let students resubmit all assignments for better grades. She loves asynchronous work, and really only requires attendance once per week. Also super helpful in office hours if you need clarifying."
1827,2147153,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Jankovic covered extremely interesting topics and knew the theories covered inside and out. Gave very good explanations, making difficult topics seem rather simple. Definitely a fair grader and easily accessible. One of my favorite professors at Davidson."
1828,2147153,3.0,2.0,"(The Ethical Diet WRI101) Dr. Jankovic will give you honest feedback about your writing, and peer-reviews are a big part of the class. The topics in class are very interesting and philosophy-based, so prepare to read philosophy and have debates about ethical decisions in eating. She is a fair grader but you have to try to do well."
1829,2147153,5.0,3.0,Absolutely loved her intro philosophy class! She is so funny and really good at explaining pretty complex theories. She does give pop quizzes but she goes over what will be on it before so it's super easy. Accessible during office hours and excited to talk to you.
1830,2147153,4.0,4.0,It's important to participate just so you understand the material. She talks fast but will slow down if you ask a question. You think you don't understand anything and then someone asks you what you're learning about and suddenly you can explain so much. Really interesting class.
1831,2147153,3.0,5.0,"For Philosophy of Language, which I think is her specialty, she's very enthusiastic about the readings she gives out and discusses. Philosophical readings about the nature of language mostly went over my head. She does her best to help out by offering office hours and opening the class to questions but its just difficult content to understand."
1832,2147153,5.0,2.0,Dr. Jankovic is bae! Writing is my weakness- still managed to get an A+. She is a fan of simple and clear writing.
1833,2147153,5.0,3.0,"She is my favorite professor that I have had so far at Davidson.  Really wants students to understand the material and succeed in class.  The assignments are usually only two papers, one in the middle of the semester and one as the final.  There are quizzes on the reading once or twice a week but not too strenuous.   I really recommend her classes"
1834,2147153,4.0,3.0,"Sweet/funny/passionate/outgoing. Talks too fast. Has accent, but just ask her to clarify/restate an idea and she's more than willing. Lots of class discussion that was confusing with many people talking and often being incorrect yet uncorrected. Just pay attention to what Dr. J says, and you'll do fine. Truly cares about learning over memorization."
1835,498513,2.0,5.0,"All lectures were online, which made it difficult, if not impossible, to ask questions. most of the tests were chem/bio heavy, so a tough one for the less scientifically minded. Nice guy, but felt that the structure was too fast-paced and didn't leave time for questions or review"
1836,498513,5.0,3.0,Dr. Smith’s Drugs and Behavior class is very fun! But be-warned that you will be listening to an hour or more of lectures online before every class. If you don’t learn well by videos then DON’T TAKE THIS CLASS. At the start of every class you have to take a quiz on Kahoot that is graded - EVERY SINGLE DAY. Class itself is interactive and fun.
1837,498513,1.0,5.0,"I respect Dr. Smith but cant deny-- hes patronizing + rude. His teaching style is to interrupt + shame you when you're wrong. Told a class they dont have an excuse to be absent since he was present after a surgery. He can be a HARSH grader, especially on lab reports. I always stayed up studying/crying for his class, not worth it!!"
1838,498513,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Smith is very knowledgeable and the class is somewhat engaging. However, do not take this course if you want to take PSY101 as an elective. He is very difficult to work with and will make no accommodations for his students. The tests are mostly multiple choice and are comprised of obscure questions. Worst academic experience by far at Davidson."
1839,498513,4.0,4.0,Dr. Smith was definitely tough but a truly brilliant professor that knows so much about what he was a teacher. He made the tough material simple to understand through analogies and examples. Great distribution of papers and tests (quizzes he calls them) and the textbook was a great resource. Tests were very difficult but papers were graded fairly.
1840,498513,3.0,4.0,I took this prof for psych 101 and failed. the tests are based on the lectures and a few questions based off of the chapter readings. however we will not tell you what you need to know from the chapter or not. no homework ever but the tests weigh a lot. I suggest office hours and reading every chapter necessary. wanted to be a psych major :(
1841,498513,2.0,4.0,"If you're looking for an easy, non-major 101 class just to learn something interesting and get a good grade, this isn't it. All MC tests based on rote memorization, often times of obscure facts. Least favorite class/professor I've had at Davidson. Quite honestly a waste of time for non-psych major upperclassmen. Take it with another prof."
1842,498513,2.0,5.0,I do not recommend this class.
1843,498513,4.0,5.0,"This class was really interesting, and I thought Dr. Smith did a really good job of teaching it. He's funny, he gives clear lectures and the papers were very fair. My only problem was his tests. You're expected to know a load of facts and if you missed one detail in his lecture you're screwed! I studied A LOT and only managed to salvage a C."
1844,498513,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Smith gives clear-cut and interesting lectures. He's a funny guy and makes an already interesting subject lively and relatable. Tests are mostly multiple choice with a few short answers. If you keep up with the reading, a grade in the A range is certainly attainable."
1845,498513,4.0,4.0,"Smith gives wonderful lectures that are coherent and interesting. He presents studies and examples in a way that is interesting but fast-paced. He doesn't always give you the help you need in office hours, but he will clarify things at the end of class. The tests are fairly hard, but it's mostly because of the excessive reading and all the details."
1846,498513,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Smith teaches things well, but his tests are too difficult. You REALLY have to study in order to do well on the tests; the test average is usually around 80. The course content is not hard, but there is a lot of it, and the nitty-gritty details are important. He is good-spirited, mildly funny, helpful, and a tough grader. I'd give him a B."
1847,498513,3.5,3.0,"The best way to do well is if you carefully read every chapter and memorize all the vocab well before the test (no last-minute cramming). Pretty clear lecturer, but only some of his lecture material appears on tests; most of it is from the book. Take good notes, read, and don't put off studying! Overall, pretty good professor."
1848,498513,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Smith is awesome.  You just have to figure out how to succeed on his tests-it took me awhile, but I got it.  Memorize notes and all the lists/vocab from the textbook.  I love his lectures and he's actually hilarious.  I felt a bit cheated that we didn't get to do projects like Dr. Boyd's class, but Smith still made me want to be a psych major."
1849,498513,3.5,2.0,Dr. Smith is a goof. I loved this and class and him. His lectures are entertaining and tests are easy as long as you take good notes in class and study the vocab from the book.
1850,498513,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Smith is a phenomenal lecturer, so you'll never get bored in his class. He is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and very clear about what he expects from you in the course. His tests are really straight forward and manageable... if you don't put studying for them off until the night before. Decent B class... Hard A class."
1851,498513,3.5,3.0,love him. tests are almost entirely multiple choice so if you study a little and read your notes you'll do okay.
1852,498513,4.0,4.0,"What a fabulous class and a great teacher.  Behavioral pharm is fascinating (both the material and the experiments) and Dr. Smith is the most energetic and enthusiastic professor I had at Davidson.  He will hammer APA format into your head, which sucks while it's going on, but is SO worth the effort, especially if you plan to write a thesis."
1853,498513,3.5,3.0,"Smith's lectures entertain and never fail to amuse.  If you're lucky, he'll pretend to be a rat or a monkey in a psychological experiment.  Interesting intro course- the tests require a lot of memorization, though...you can't wing your way through them!"
1854,498513,4.0,2.0,"I liked Smith a lot. He keeps lectures very interesting... dare i say a fun class&#63; An easy B+, slightly harder A"
1855,498513,5.0,3.0,"Extremely well organized, makes every class interesting (including the walking around with an actual human brain). Can't put into words how much he's helped me: class and research with him, networking, and his efforts for my thesis have changed me from not knowing what to do with my life, to having a career and going to grad school. Great guy."
1856,498513,5.0,4.0,i have taken all of his classes and he is amazing!  i love his mannerisms and his tests are insanely fair and manageable.  im sad that he doesnt teach more classes
1857,498513,5.0,4.0,"I graduated a few years ago, and have since enrolled in another university's program.  I GUARANTEE that you will never find a better professor than Dr Smith.  I took every class he taught and enjoyed one.  You can tell he genuinely loves what he does and is glad to be there, and that is something I've learned is hard to find at other schools."
1858,498513,5.0,4.0,I have enjoyed all the classes that hes taught.  Really funny mannerisms when he's acting out a rat in a skinner box.  Really Fair and amazing prof!
1859,498513,4.5,2.0,"Taken 3 classes from Smith. Extremly well organized, definitely does make lectures very interesting and lively."
1860,498513,4.0,3.0,"I'm actually excited to go to his class in the morning! He does a great job of entertaining the class while still getting the material across. He's lots of fun, and the class is really interesting. I highly suggest it!"
1861,498513,5.0,3.0,Very clear and organized.  Finds a way to make even the most mundane topics entertaining.  A definite thumbs up!
1862,498513,4.5,3.0,"Entertaining guy, does a great job coming up with accessible examples of what he's talking about.  Tests are fairly middle-of-the-road."
1863,498513,3.0,2.0,No Comments
1864,498513,4.5,2.0,Smith has a way of presenting the information in a very understandable and interesting way.  He's entertaining and fun to listen to.  He knows what he's talking about. My favorite professor so far.
1865,875349,5.0,5.0,"Mrs. Lawing is a wonderful and kind teacher. She has a golden heart. Some classmates did not practice and gave a poor review, but those of us dedicated to our studies found a kind and blessed mentor. If you are willing to dedicate yourself, she will provide extra teaching for free. One classmate even flew her to Dubai for his wedding! We love her!"
1866,875349,1.5,3.0,"I am shocked to see that Mrs. Lawing is still teaching. My beef with her was due to many things, but chiefly her immaturity. After I switched to the infinitely preferable Dr. Cooper, her formerly enthusiastic responses to my performance became almost libelous-suggesting I finished pieces in different keys than written, etc. It even affected juries!"
1867,875349,4.5,3.0,"Keyboard proficiency.  Required for music majors.  Mrs. Lawing can be stern but that is all show.  Once you're in her office it's like instant Zen.  She may be &quot;unconventional&quot; in some prespectives, but that's what makes learning with her such an experience.  Practice is of course expected."
1868,875349,2.5,3.0,No Comments
1869,639848,1.0,3.0,"This professor is extremely inconsiderate, cold calls, does not make an effort to know your name, and is very disorganized. He doesn't value your opinion in class and there are no trigger warnings on the syllabus. I would not recommend him, because he is misleading and frustrating to work with. "
1870,639848,3.0,2.0,"Pena is a very interesting professor. His lectures were simultaneously fascinating and confusing-often going all over the place. I don't feel as if my Spanish really improved from this course, but we did talk about compelling topics. The class was not hard, but he either likes you or he does not. If you add to the class discussion, he'll like you"
1871,639848,4.0,3.0,"Sr. Pena is definitely a character. He makes class pretty fun by being goofy to the point of raunchy at points, but you can tell he enjoys teaching and enjoys getting to know students. He does talk pretty quickly though, and he has a very weird way of cold calling students -- not sure if he ever knew everyone's names. If you love Spanish, take him!"
1872,639848,2.0,3.0,"Subpar professor. Disorganized, big rambler, and unclear about assignments. Maybe its just the fact that 270 is a boring class, but I found his teaching style to be uninspiring and his class the worst part of my week."
1873,639848,4.5,2.0,"A really great professor, who will definitely boost your understanding of the language. He can be a bit intimidating at first, but he truly cares about the success of his students. Tough grader, but definitely fair. I would recommend him to anyone interested in the language."
1874,639848,3.5,3.0,"Senor Pena is one my favorite professors. He truly cares about his students. Almost every class is a mix of lecture and discussion. You watch a lot of spanish movies. He is funny and entertaining in class. You don't feel like you're learning in doing the reading but his lectures offer deeper meaning. Overall, great class that I would recommend!!"
1875,639848,1.5,3.0,"Has a very disorganized and confusing teaching style, the hardest part of this class was simply understanding what was going on. Very disrespectful, has obvious favorites in class. I would recommend avoiding this professor if you need clarity and respect in the classroom, otherwise, go for it."
1876,639848,1.0,4.0,"Pena is  the worst professor I've had at Davidson. He is inconsiderate, disrespectful, disorganized, and unforgiving. He has never learned our names and does not provide any feedback or grades on assignments. Instead of calling on students when they raise their hands and want to answer, he aggressively points at any other person in the class."
1877,639848,2.5,2.0,"Dr. Pena is very nice though sometimes hard to approach.  Its difficult to understand what he is saying at first but it eventually gets easier. However, understanding what he means is very difficult. Tries to use blackboard but often forgets that he forgot to post assignments. Stressful class for this reason."
1878,639848,3.5,1.0,"Luis rocks.  I can always count on him to make me smile.  Sure, sometimes the lectures can be a little haphazard, but he is still one of Davidson's gems.  He truly cares about his students; go talk to him in is office and he'll talk to you for an hour.  He is also a very easy grader.  Love this professor!"
1879,639848,3.0,3.0,He's great! He always kept class discussion interesting. Great sense of humor.
1880,639848,2.0,3.0,"Do not recommend this class to anyone who needs clarity. Pena's lectures are unorganized and impossible to follow. He writes frantically all over the board, drawing arrows to, circling and underlining irrelevant information. Tests are a completely random combination of IDs and essays and he takes forever to grade them. I was miserable in this class"
1881,639848,2.0,3.0,very hard to understand in class due to his stutter and very fast spanglish.  He doesn't finish his thoughts and writes incomprehensibly all over the board and it is impossible to follow.  He is rude when you get the wrong answer in class.  I e-mailed him four times to get help with my paper and stalked his office and he was never available to talk
1882,639848,3.5,2.0,"This guy is one of my favorite personalities here. He's really funny, enthusiastic and jokes constantly in his spanish-spanglish hybrid lingo. Very excited about his subject, and full of insight. Once you get used to his speech and his style, it's fun. Not heavy readings though, easy to get through. Or easy to read quickly before class!"
1883,639848,3.5,2.0,"VERY fun and interesting professor. He likes to talk about important life issues, making it more than just a language course. The class was lots of reading and work, but not too hard if you're willing to make the effort. Overall, I think he's a great asset to Davidson."
1884,639848,3.5,3.0,"Amazing prof. Intelligent, really gets you interested in the material. He speaks really fast Spanglish that is hard to get used to at first. Really great guy; i went for help with a paper and we ended up talking for an hour and a half about my life at Davidson. Grading is pretty lenient as long as you can communicate your points and support them."
1885,639848,2.5,2.0,"his classes are not stressful. This is my second with him and if you just tell him what he wants to hear on tests/papers, you'll be fine. He is always unclear about big assignments/tests. ASK HIM TWICE. Other than that, he's helpful outside of class, and funny in class, but not on purpose. enjoy his spanglish, it's great."
1886,639848,4.0,2.0,"If you have him for 201 and you've taken Spanish throughout high school, he's fairly easy. His tests are thorough but not overly difficult. In lower level classes, he doesn't use student's names but instead points at them to answer. Despite his quirks, he's a nice man and a pretty good prof."
1887,639848,3.0,2.0,"He was very confusing in class---very disorganized and hard to follow his lectures. However, good to meet with outside of class, very intelligent and helpful. However, i would not recommend taking a class with him at this level, he switches from spanish to english a lot and often will not even finish his own thoughts."
1888,639848,3.5,4.0,"Very intelligent and knows what he is talking about, made me interested in spanish lit. again.  His style of forcing students to answer his questions made me stay awake, which was a plus."
1889,639848,2.5,3.0,"This guy's intense.  Good grammar prof. but a terrible literature prof.  He asks questions which make no sense.  I'm in a class with VERY fluent people and noone knows what he wants or is talking about.  I'd recommend him for anything lower than 260, but that's it."
1890,639848,3.5,3.0,"He's a cool guy, I really enjoyed his class.  It's kind of funny how he slips back and forth from spanish to english back to spanish at a frenetic pace.  We read alot of really interesting books (El Gringo Viejo, El Beso de la Mujer Arana) and he made lectures interesting, rarely, if ever boring.  I'd take him again, probably my favorite Sp prof."
1891,639848,5.0,3.0,"i love profesor. he's passionate and well-versed, and it shows.  his tests are thorough, but always fair. he takes a genuine interest in students' performance and is at his best during office hours. here's to luis!!"
1892,2171760,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Deckard and Power and Politics have permanently altered my world view, for the better. She is an amazing scholar and an even more amazing human. Her lectures are incredibly impassioned; there was never a day I didn't want to go to class. I don't care what your major is- take a class with Dr. Deckard. You will not regret it."
1893,2171760,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Deckard can captivate a space. Lectures were thorough, and she took her times explaining concepts of political sociology in different ways with examples of personal experience that really helped solidify what she meant to say. Power &amp; Politics was a course about concepts you may have thought of, but had not put a name to. Makes you reconsider."
1894,2171760,5.0,3.0,This class completely changed my perspective on society and how and why it's structured the way it is. The most enlightening class I've taken at Davidson. The only negative I can think of is that she does tend to push her views on students when they should think for themselves and come to certain realizations on their own. Highly recommend her
1895,2171760,5.0,4.0,She's literally the best.
1896,2171760,5.0,4.0,"I was only in this class because I needed to be. It was really, really great though. Deckard keeps a lot of things going at the same time, lots of optional activities, big semi-mandatory (everyone goes) overnight trip that let us work on real work for a real non-profit. She is also really popular, and she should be, she is excellent."
1897,2171760,5.0,4.0,"If you don't take a class with Dr. Deckard, you're doing it wrong. She truly cares about the subject matter she teaches and about her students not just as students but as people. She gives awesome lectures; my class was 8:15 and I was never upset about getting up for it. She's also a great  advisor, mentor, and just generally an amazing person."
1898,2171760,5.0,4.0,This class is changing my life.
1899,1735545,5.0,2.0,"Brad is awesome funny, kind, caring, invested in the subject and loves teaching. He is not an intense dude- so you really get out what you put in. His teaching style revolves around your desire to learn, he will not force you. Your grade will reflect how badly you want it though. My only criticism is that he is so chill, but still a rough grader."
1900,1735545,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Johnson really works for students. He talks about his students' research all the time, is super knowledgeable about all things soil, and loves PPTs/draws tons of diagrams. Kinda messy, really laid-back. Expects a lot from students b/c he knows they can deliver. Pretty upfront about expectations and problems. Moves due dates all the time"
1901,1735545,3.5,3.0,"Hard to have a team taught class, but he does it ok. The class had too many assignments to be done well, perhaps a casualty of too many cooks in the kitchen. Still, he has a calm presence and a genuine interest in geology  w/ less interest in other env disciplines . He is a deceptively hard grader for someone with such a chill personality."
1902,1735545,4.0,3.0,"New professor with upside. I took the class to fill my lab, no prior interest. Left with no added interest, but not a bad class. Some boring labs, but not terrible. Actually the first three are terrible but after that not so much. People took issue with his powerpoints, which need some cleaning, but hard to teach geo w/o pictures. Nice, chill dude."
1903,2261883,2.0,5.0,"She's knowledgable about human anatomy but this class is chaotic. We haven't gotten a single grade back with 5 weeks left. Her review questions are ridiculous covering topics we were told not to worry about and are insanely specific. The lab is a complete waste of time, we get lectured for 3 hrs, dissection was a 2hr lecture with 20 min hands-on."
1904,2261883,1.0,5.0,MY GOD is she an awful professor. Her questions on tests come completely out of left field and her study guides and advice on how to study does NOT help. She also never follows through on what she says she's going to and literally gives incorrect info about tests. She never uploads/grades/does anything on time but expects us to know insane detail
1905,2261883,4.0,3.0,Course material was very interesting. The group work we did in class helped me understand the concepts better. She was always available whenever I asked to meet for office hours. A caring professor.
1906,2261883,5.0,3.0,"She is a very helpful professor. Dr. Mamoon actually came in to work with me one Saturday, when the college is normally closed. Overall I really enjoyed her class. The work load may seem a bit much at some times, however, if you work hard she will reward you in the end."
1907,2261883,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Mamoon is a nice and caring professor. However, her class is quite disorganized and it can feel like assignments are being handed out without warning. The material was some sociology and biology that tended to appear on the MCAT, but it was poorly delivered to students. Not recommended for anyone who has already taken introductory bio courses."
1908,2261883,3.0,3.0,She is a helpful and kind professor. This course was interesting and practical though a bit disorganized. The assignments were fair.
1909,2261883,1.0,3.0,"She is such a sweet lady, which is why it is hard to write this, but I left this class learning virtually nothing. Tests were filled with questions on material we never went over. Lectures were boring and mostly consisted of confusing concept maps. Overall a terrible experience and my least favorite class I've ever taken at Davidson."
1910,2261883,1.0,3.0,"She's a nice woman, but honestly an AWFUL professor. She taught in a scattered way with no clear lesson plan. The syllabus was a joke, as it was disorganized and lacked any dates for the major assignments. She gave pop quizzes on readings from previous weeks and expects perfect retention of information that she herself struggles to recall."
1911,2261883,1.0,5.0,"Don't take this class unless you have a very good understanding of genetics and biochem. There are no pre-reqs but you WILL need to know this and it's extremely difficult if (like me) you don't. She's extremely disorganized and hard to follow. There is a lot of busy work and daily homework. She's super nice and willing to meet, but it doesn't help."
1912,1155973,3.0,4.0,"Harsh grader - if it isn't his interpretation, it's wrong. Response prompts 2 are broad but he expects immense detail so don't mention something without fully unpacking it/that you dont fully get. Disorganized but flexible with his syllabus and VERY ACCOMMODATING (FREE GIVES EXTENSIONS). Values participation but picks apart your comments"
1913,1155973,1.0,4.0,"Samson is the worst professor at Davidson in my opinion. He doesn't teach material, only injects his frequently out-there opinions. Make sure never to disagree with those opinions, though, because if you do you're destined for a disappointing grade. His assignments are never clear and essay prompts will be Immediately recognized as idiotic."
1914,1155973,4.5,3.0,"PLEASE DON'T GRADUATE FROM DAVIDSON UNTIL YOU'VE TAKEN A CLASS WITH DR.SAMSON. Amazing professor, values discussion, passionate about his subject, sweet and helpful outside of class. Arguably the best learning experience I've had so far at Davidson, and that's from a science-person with no prior background in (or major relevant to) Anthropology."
1915,1155973,5.0,4.0,"Probably one of the best professors I've had. Not the easiest grader, and he'll push you to learn, but you'll improve vastly because of it. Doing the reading is pretty essential if you want to excel in class, because he values participation. Go to his office - he'll take a personal interest in you. Deadlines can flex - all around favorite professor"
1916,1155973,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors at Davidson. Fair grader, super nice guy, cares deeply about his subject matter but doesn't assume that he knows everything there is to know.  I highly recommend taking a class with him."
1917,1155973,4.5,2.0,"Wonderful professor. Really sweet and caring. His paper grading can me a little on the harsh side, but he's still worth taking. Very knowledgeable and interesting. One of the nicest and best professors that I have had yet. Highly recommended."
1918,1155973,4.0,3.0,"I absolutely adore this professor.  He's absolutely hilarious and his accent is so endearing.  His lectures are a little spastic, which works for me but not for some others.  Make sure to write down everything he writes on the board (which isn't much) because that's what'll be on the test.  If you talk in class, he'll adore you.  Take this class!!!"
1919,615323,5.0,4.0,"Sr. Hernandez is one of the most incredible professors I have ever had. He is brilliant and funny and makes the class enjoyable. I have learned so much and while it is not an easy course, it has been well worth my while. He is awesome."
1920,615323,4.0,4.0,"HC is brilliant and will always surprise you with a plethora of knowledge. Most of it is for fun, but ANYTHING he writes on the board is VERY important. His tests are either do-able or hard. It just depends. I would definitely recommend HC because he's a great prof. and has an awesome sense of humor."
1921,615323,5.0,2.0,my favorite professor thus far
1922,615323,4.5,2.0,"Great guy, it's ok if you dont speak good spanish cause he don't speak good english. though we got behind in the class, its cause he was helping us understand everything. funny guy, in a cuban sort of way. one of the best spanish classes i've had"
1923,615323,4.5,3.0,"Tough class, great guy though."
1924,615323,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Hernandez is stellar. Funny and very sociable; enjoys poking fun at students, feels like a good buddy, and laughs often. Really wise and observant. Pretty accepting of new ideas. Lots of class discussion. He's clear on main points, grades fairly, and is helpful during office hours."
1925,175003,4.0,3.0,"Professor Willis is super caring and was really understanding during what was an unusual semester. There were some weeks where we had multiple large assignments due and some weeks where we had very little to do, so sometimes can be a bit of a heavy load. Overall, a passionate teacher who you can learn well from if you put in the work."
1926,175003,5.0,2.0,"Profesora Willis is great. She is super enthusiastic about the subject and has a lot of positive energy. She also gives really helpful feedback on papers; my writing improved so much in this course. It's super easy to tell she takes a genuine interest in her students. She's caring and wants her students to do well. She expects a lot, but is fair."
1927,175003,5.0,3.0,Had her at a high level. Very understanding and flexible with students. There was a lot of work but nothing out of the ordinary for a high-level class. Seemed to be a fairly easy grader.
1928,175003,3.5,4.0,"She is passionate about her teaching and cares about the students but she really has no concept of what is too much when it comes to homework. The class was probably good for me, but beware that this is a time-consuming commitment. Not a huge fan of the class but it may have just been the style of 270"
1929,175003,4.5,3.0,"She genuinely wants to help her students and is very dedicated to her job. There is a lot of work, but this is a higher level Spanish class."
1930,175003,1.5,4.0,"Willis, although a deceptively warm and inviting person, assigns more homework than many of my professors combined. She expects far too much of us in terms of outside work, and is extremely cold and useless during office hours."
1931,175003,4.0,2.0,"I adored class with Profe Willis. She is great, really high energy and engaging. The conversation level in class is pretty low and I didn't get a lot out of that, but writing and rewriting the papers really helped my Spanish so much. A lot of busy work tho."
1932,175003,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Willis is an amazing spanish teacher. She is so willing to meet outside of class, and genuinely cares about each of her students' success. Although she assigns too much busy work, she is awesome and SO so understanding and thoughtful toward each student. She's the bomb dot com."
1933,175003,4.5,3.0,"Prfa. Willis is an amazing professor. She is always more than willing to help you. Her love of Spanish is apparent and she made me love Spanish again; enough to major in it (now my advisor)! If you want an energetic class, she's the professor you want. She gives a lot of work, but you gain so much. I learned a lot! Overall, a GREAT professor! :)"
1934,175003,4.0,3.0,If you understand spanish pretty well going into the class you will be fine. She doesn't spend really any time on grammar. Was always energetic in class and very helpful when needed.
1935,175003,4.0,3.0,"I really liked her as a professor. Sometimes she can assign a lot of work and you might not discuss in class what you spent time preparing, but my speaking/listening skills improved a lot . she's a fair grader and you have a lot of grades, which I liked since if you do poorly on one assignment it balances out nicely. She really wants you to do well"
1936,175003,4.5,2.0,"I really liked Dr. Willis. My speaking skills improved greatly in her class, although I think we should have done more listening exercises. Tests were fair and she always gave us a good idea of what to expect."
1937,175003,3.0,3.0,"Willis' classes can be very random and unplanned at times. She does make sure the class gets through all the material, but sometimes only does it by assigning a ton of work and letting you know that you'll have a test on a ton of stuff you haven't studied yet."
1938,175003,4.5,2.0,"I truly loved having Sra Willis as a professor. She's really nice, her tests aren't too hard, and the workload of the class is really manageable. I really improved my Spanish too, I highly recommend her."
1939,175003,4.0,2.0,"I thought Willis was a great teacher especially considering I didn't really enjoy Spanish in high school. She is always very energetic and I could tell she's passionate about what she does. She is tough when it comes to grammar but she doesn't always dock points for it. Overall, I would definitely recommend her class!"
1940,175003,3.5,4.0,"Very energetic and passionate about Spanish...lots of group work and projects.  Never really collects homework, but expects you to do it.  This class really helped me improve my Spanish-speaking ability and my comfort level with the language."
1941,175003,2.0,4.0,Consistently unorganized and unprepared for her lectures. Not a Davidson caliber prof.
1942,175003,4.5,4.0,"I personally don't understand why Willis has so many negative ratings. I found her to be a fabulous person and teacher. You will work a lot, but in return your speaking and writing skills will improve. Take her class. Bonus: her child is adorable."
1943,175003,2.5,3.0,"WAY TOO MUCH WRITING.  All of her assignments involve several proofreads, and she's not always clear about what she wants for a paper.  One word: comprobante (the bane of my existence).  It doesn't mean that, but that's what it was.  She's very picky when grading papers, get ready for lots and lots of marks all over."
1944,175003,1.0,2.0,Bad teacher and a very false person.
1945,175003,1.5,4.0,"While the class itself was difficult, Dr. Willis was receptive and  helpful during office hours."
1946,175003,4.0,4.0,"Hard Teacher, but nice"
1947,175003,5.0,2.0,"Ok, the honor code thing. The 1st semester she taught here the AT did not do her job and no one told her until the last week of class when they couldn't do anything about it. Dr. Willis considered it a total lack of respect for the honor code. So get over it cause you shouldn't be cheating anyway"
1948,175003,3.5,3.0,"Classes are fast-paced and mentally exhausting. Not because material is hard but because half of the battle is figuring out what you're doing. She can be moody/catty at times, but you just deal with it. A fair grader, she'll try to give you every point you earn. Nice as person if on her good side."
1949,175003,5.0,3.0,"Very nice and quick to answer questions and explain away any misconceptions.  Just remember not to fight her, for you will lose."
1950,175003,5.0,3.0,"Willis is hard, but very fair.  I recommend her for anything!"
1951,175003,3.5,3.0,"I generally like Prfa. Willis and I think she's knowledgable & competent.  She's very interested in making her classes FUN and ENGAGING for the students.  Occasionally, moments of unprofessionalism do surface.  I think, generally, that she does a good job"
1952,175003,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Willis shows little respect for the Honor Code by seemingly assuming that her students violate it at every turn in the road.  A bad apple who, thank God, doesn't spoil the whole bunch."
1953,175003,1.0,4.0,Elementary school mentality.  The class always jumps around with many 3-4 minute exercises which become exhausting.
1954,175003,1.0,4.0,should not be teaching at this school or anywhere...
1955,175003,2.0,4.0,terrible teacher
1956,175003,5.0,2.0,"Willis can be a bit intense and scary at times, but she is a great Spanish teacher who tries to make class as interesting as possible.  I really learned a lot from her!"
1957,175003,3.0,2.0,"i agree with the honor code ignorance!!  the class is good, as a person - she is not my favorite."
1958,175003,1.0,1.0,This teacher is the most annoying person on earth. She is the most boring person on earth as well. She shouldn't be teaching here.
1959,175003,3.0,4.0,"Has a poor attitidue, critical, and judgemental.  Does not understand the Honor Code and still in a  high school teacher  mind-set."
1960,2513831,5.0,4.0,"I love professor Crandall! She is extremely passionate about what she teaches and it shows! Lots of reading, but very relevant to class discussions and featured on tests. Super approachable and kind, wish she was a full prof because I would've asked her to be my advisor! Would highly recommend!"
1961,2513831,5.0,4.0,"Probably the best professor at Davidson. Very demanding in terms of work. You gotta show up and you gotta do the work. But, if you do that, she is so accommodating with extensions/deadlines and takes a ""life first"" approach--something quite uncommon among Davidson professors. She will work you to death,but you learn so much and her class is awesome"
1962,2513831,5.0,3.0,"Best class I've taken by far! Dr. Crandall is so knowledgable and passionate about what she teaches. There is significant work, but most of it revolves around the final project which is where you choose a specific country and dive into a report. Please take Dr. Crandall, you won't regret it!"
1963,2513831,5.0,3.0,"Really cares about having productive discussions about the readings during class. Lots of assigned readings, but very interesting topics that we learned about. Encourages students to share their perspectives on the readings. Fair grader. Tests aren't too hard and are based on the material we learned in class. Cool and engaging prof!"
1964,2513831,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Crandall is an engaging lecturer who cares about what her students think. The class is lecture-based but she expects people to contribute, which makes reading the material necessary. The tests are long but not that hard, and the papers are not graded harshly. Homeworks are grade boosters. Definitely worth taking."
1965,1479594,3.0,4.0,"Hodge is not the best lecturer for a science course as he tends to give a lot of ""physics history"" but he's a fair grader and curves nicely at the end. His office hours aren't great time-wise, but if you can make them he's super helpful. Definitely one of the easier physics profs. Very good at explaining in lab but lots of physlet hw problems!"
1966,1479594,4.5,3.0,Prof. Hodge is a great. He explains complicated physics concepts so clearly that you'd learn even without trying! Fair grader and willing to help anyone who doesn't understand. you will learn physics with him!
1967,1479594,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Hodge is a decent professor, but not a very likable person. His lectures felt like he was trying to sell me something, and he's a pretty tough grader on labs."
1968,1153966,1.0,5.0,"If you are going to take this class, you should seriously reconsider. During a 1 on 1 meeting with Kelly I was laughed at due to my lack of typing ability. Also during this meeting I was asked this question. &quot;How did you even get into Davidson?&quot; Overall, my point is he teaches good stuff but is not the greatest of people to be learning from."
1969,1153966,1.0,2.0,Advocate for reverse racism; extremely proud
1970,1153966,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Kelly loves the material he teaches, and it shows. You have to work for your grades, but his policy is definitely meeting people halfway. Not an easy class, but a worthwhile one. Would take more classes with him."
1971,1153966,4.5,4.0,"Amazing professor. Crystal clear about what he expects but more than willing to help you when you don't understand something. Reviews are long and tedious but graded fairly.  If you already have a course with a heavy workload, he's probably not a good choice for the semester. Took his class as a first semester freshman and don't regret it."
1972,1153966,5.0,5.0,"This is the most liberating and influential class I have taken EVER. I learned and gained so much from the course (rather unexpectedly). He is hilarious, very helpful, and extremely moody. No curves. He doesn't care if you are failing. Work was enjoyable. Tests were painful. DO NOT take any of this man's classes as a 1st yr. If you do, be strong."
1973,1153966,5.0,4.0,"I took his 300 level class as a first semester freshman (do not recommend) and barely passed. He taught me how to think and write the way that has helped me excel at Davidson. He is by no means easy, but he is helpful and hilarious. Do all readings, work hard, tell him about your goals because he can help you achieve them. Best professor I've had."
1974,1153966,4.5,5.0,"Hands down, my favorite course. While it was extremely challenging, I left the class more prepared to really &quot;think&quot; and tackle even more societal ills. My writing, too, became even more stronger. He doesn't play when it comes to his reviews so you should do all the readings and talk to him during office hours regularly. Plus, he's just hilarious."
1975,1153966,5.0,5.0,"What started out as a filler quickly became one of the most intriguing (and demanding) classes I have taken at Davidson. Dr. Kelly is the perfect example of a great, challenging professor. Well organized, very helpful, and loves what he does. But, he knows what he wants from his students so you must deliver. Grades fairly, but be ready to work."
1976,1153966,4.0,4.0,"Very interesting, very engaging and very Honest. He's a tough grader, but fair. I'm glad I took this class, even though I struggled in his class, and did some serious damage to my G.P.A"
1977,1078193,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Fackler prepared me so well as she whipped me into shape for college writing. She's a tough grader who requires high participation. You must do your reading, as she will cold call you. She cares deeply about her students and gives extremely detailed feedback which is very helpful!"
1978,1078193,4.0,4.0,"Super sweet professor, very respectful and everyone loves her! Unfortunately, my Gesture class was insanely difficult and I could not get a good grade no matter how hard I tried. She really does care about what she teaches though, and she'll help if you ask."
1979,1078193,5.0,4.0,"Seriously the best!! Cannot sing Fackler's praises higher. Kind of a hard grader and you def have to do the readings, but mostly enjoyable"
1980,1078193,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Fackler is my favorite professor at Davidson, hands down. I usually dread seminars, but ""Gossip"" is incredible. She's a great person to talk to outside of class and she genuinely cares about her students. I highly recommend her to everyone, though if you're not an English major it'll be very tough. "
1981,1078193,2.5,5.0,"I felt that class discussion was geared toward her favorite students and discussion was only encouraged when student input was exactly what Dr. Fackler wanted to hear. She may appear friendly and personable, but Dr. Fackler lacks professionalism. I will definitely not be taking any more classes with this professor."
1982,1078193,5.0,4.0,"Hands down, Davidson's best professor. Brilliant scholar and passionate with a genuine love for her students and literature. Expects rigorous, graduate-level thinking and writing from students. But, at the end, you will leave her class a better student with new perspectives and fond memories. Her seminars are must-takes!"
1983,1078193,4.5,4.0,"I had &quot;thinking girls,thinking boys&quot; with Dr. Fackler as my writing class.  Her reading selections and class discussions were great! The prompts for papers were clear and she was more than willing to answer any questions.  She doesn't give many As on papers, but you still come out of the class feeling like you learned something. Great overall!"
1984,1078193,5.0,4.0,"One of my favorite professors so far at Davidson.  She is extremely knowledgeable and very witty.  Lectures are interesting and discussions are compelling.  I had to work a lot, but it was manageable.  You will definitely leave her class feeling like you have accomplished something. Plus, she's hilarious and very stylish."
1985,1078193,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic professor! She rarely gives out A's but when you recieve one you know you really deserved it! Her tests are fair as well.  Her lectures are fascinating and her class is well structured. Dr. Fackler is a pleasant person to be around, she is always friendly to students. I highly reccomend her class!"
1986,1078193,3.5,5.0,"This prof wants you to do the best that you possibly can with what you know, which means she expects polished essays and intelligent comments on the reading. Be prepared to learn a lot!"
1987,1078193,1.5,5.0,She made me not like english anymore
1988,1078193,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Fackler's teaching approach is effective and her grading fair (if somewhat deflated). You will have to work for your grade, but you can be proud that you 100% earned your grade.  Fackler is hilarious, always willing to help, and great to talk to outside of class. I highly recommend her class to anyone wishing to write with purpose"
1989,1078193,4.5,4.0,"Professor Fackler's interest in the class was apparent throughout the semester.  The lectures never bored and everyone seemed generally eager to participate.  Fackler forces you to think on your own, but that's a good thing in my book!  Go see her in office hours: she offers helpful and friendly advice on papers and assignments."
1990,1078193,4.5,5.0,"Her classes are worthwhile and she is available after hours to help.  She may seem difficult but she has a genuine desire to help her students succeed, for example catering assignments to the class's skills and offering extensions.  Take all of her classes."
1991,1078193,4.0,5.0,"Wasn't sure if I would like the course, but came out of it very pleased.  Interesting material, and Fackler knows how to teach writing, often from the professional, rather than academic, writer's standpoint."
1992,54203,1.0,4.0,"Reads power points to you in class. The most boring thing ever and he steam rolls so you can't ask questions. When you go for help, he reads the book to you. If you are bad at memorization this is not for you."
1993,54203,3.0,1.0,"Dr. Ruth is easy and he is very clear in class, but he often goes off on tangents and later goes through material really fast bc he is behind. He also doesn't answer emails and is hard to go to for help."
1994,54203,5.0,1.0,SUCH a great class. He's always looking for ways to put what we've learned into context of current events. He also has a lot of great insight because  of all of his experience. Lectures are pretty easy to follow and tests are directly from the book just don't try to write his slides down.... follow along in the book!
1995,54203,1.5,2.0,"To do well in the class, all you have to do is read the parts of the book mentioned in the lectures.  Seriously, that's all that's on the test.  No discussions, nothing like that.  Spends way too much time talking about his homeland security stuff."
1996,54203,1.0,1.0,"what a worthless waste of my life.  i cannot believe that i have devoted three hours a week for an entire semester to this wretched man and his stupid class.  i mean, is it really so much to ask to maybe cover some of the subject matter&#63;"
1997,54203,1.0,2.0,didn't teach a thing related to the subject matter and is a psycho who carries his badge in his pocket so he can arrest people. not worth your time.
1998,54203,4.0,2.0,Truly enthusiastic about the subject matter.
1999,54203,5.0,1.0,He is the best teacher I have ever had
2000,54203,1.0,2.0,what a joke and what an embarrassment to the college ... don't waste your time
2001,54203,3.5,2.0,I had him for 219 and 212 and he is not a hard teacher.  You just have to read for his class and he shows news clippings most of the time.
2002,54203,2.5,1.0,"class is boring but at times interesting, watch videos all the time"
2003,54206,5.0,4.0,Dr. Maiz-Pena is an amazing professor and is incredibly caring. I learned more in this semester-long class than I did in 4 years in high school because she is engaging and makes sure everyone can keep up. She met with me many times to go over topics that I was falling behind on. She is enthusiastic about her job and truly cares about her students.
2004,54206,5.0,2.0,"Ma&iacute;z-Pe&ntilde;a is a gem of the Hispanic Studies department. She is super enthusiastic about her students' success, and never shames anyone for making a mistake. This provides an environment were you can improve your Spanish with confidence. Lots of tedious homework, though, and most of the course books were never used. Easy grader if you try hard."
2005,54206,5.0,3.0,"Maiz-Pena is one of the most caring people I have ever met. She was truly my biggest advocate and cheerleader and wanted to make sure I was comfortable and successful. Very fair with grading, her view is that class is supposed to give you a space to make mistakes with language and she doesn't believe in penalizing you for that. Take maiz pena!"
2006,54206,5.0,4.0,"Maiz-Pena is Davidson's best asset. She works hard, and understands that her class is not the only thing in students' lives. Your relationship with this gem of a woman continues after the class ends. Whether over coffee, lunch, or a quick email, she will leave you feeling like you are the best person she has ever met. She's genuine in all she does."
2007,54206,2.5,3.0,"She is a very passionate woman about her areas of interest! Very nice, helpful and humble professor. She never devalues anyone's comment or work, and always gives good feedback and tries to focus on the positives in students' work. The only thing is she is not very organized and sometimes I was confused about what was due when and what was expected"
2008,54206,3.5,3.0,She is a wonderful woman. Very enthusiastic and loves her students. Really cares about the learning and her students. Average tests and workload. 
2009,54206,4.0,3.0,"Maiz-Pena is incredible! She's upbeat, outgoing, and loves teaching. She also loves creative writing assignments. She makes everyone feel very welcome. I feel spoiled just by having her as a teacher! Take a class with her if you can."
2010,54206,3.5,3.0,She is by far the nicest professor. She really cares about her students and is more focused on the learning rather than the grades. That being said grading is rather harsh but helpful. Class is repetitive but you can't help but love this woman.
2011,54206,5.0,2.0,"She is literally the best professor I have had at Davidson so far. If you show sincere interest in the course she will love you! The one test we had was not difficult and the papers we did all semester were based on expression and creativity, which was great! Take this class! I hope to take more from her. WOW"
2012,54206,4.5,2.0,"One of the nicest teachers I have ever had the pleasure of having.  She cared for her students and individually asked us how were doing every class.  At first thrown off by her high energy and loud personality but loved it by the end of the first week.  Truly amazing teacher, would have her as a teacher again."
2013,54206,5.0,3.0,"Passionate, sincere, and caring. Makes learning fun and you want to excel because you respect her teaching."
2014,54206,3.5,2.0,"She is overflowing with enthusiasm and kindness. While some activities may seem pointless or silly, overall the class provides valuable opportunities to improve your speaking through discussion. One test= based on creativity. There are several projects with vague guidelines, but as long as you put forth an effort she will praise you excessively."
2015,54206,4.5,2.0,"She is the most wonderful professor, she is very patient and will try to help you at all times. She knows some students might feel intimidated when speaking in spanish so she tries to encourage you to speak. Her class is very creative, the writing part comes from watching movies and write a creative story, you make up the stories."
2016,54206,4.0,3.0,Maiz-Peña is lovely. She makes everyone feel comfortable in the conversation class brings in chocolate. One day I came in to class thirty minutes late and she acted like it never happened. Sometimes I found her essay critiquing to be confusing. Assignments are never dull and very creative however! Take her class if possible. :)
2017,54206,5.0,2.0,The nicest lady in the world.  She gives sort of a lot of work but it's helpful and if you do it she'll really appreciate it and that shows in your grade which a lot of is based on improvement.  Definitely take her if you have a chance
2018,54206,5.0,2.0,"So nice and sweet and wants to make sure you're doing well. Participate all the time. Many times in one class. Even if you're saying something really dumb, she'll love it and call you brilliant."
2019,54206,4.5,1.0,"Nicest Lady ever. Visit during office hours to show you are really trying and your grades will go up. Also, visit her office before tests and she will tell you exactly what is on them. Very nice lady and I learned a lot from her. Very patient which is exactly what I needed. Participate in class and she will love you forever."
2020,54206,4.0,2.0,"Maiz-Pena is one of the nicest, most caring teachers at Davidson.  If you have the opportunity to take a class with her, take it!  She loves her classes and you will love her!  Get ready to enjoy a bellisisisisisimo class!"
2021,54206,5.0,2.0,"I LOVE MAIZ-PENA!! she cooked for our class! plus, she's genuinely sweet and passionate about her teaching and those who have been disadvantaged."
2022,54206,5.0,2.0,"Hola Hola Hola! An effervescent personality, she is a pleasure to be around. Her passion for the language and teaching at large is evident in every energetic action she makes, which happens to be every action. Cares about your success. Highly recommended."
2023,54206,5.0,4.0,"She is absolutely amazing and makes it her personal responsibility to make sure you are doing well, both physically, mentally and academically.  Her passion for literature and teaching exudes through everything she does.  A very high energy professor, so be aware that she will prance up and down the rows.  I highly recommend taking her!"
2024,54206,5.0,1.0,"Truly a caring and compassionate teacher.  Restored my interest in the Spanish language and in my Spanish abilities.  She grades on &quot;how you are doing&quot; not on a fixed scale; so if you improve over the course, so will your grades, dramatically."
2025,54206,3.0,3.0,She is not bad indeed. A nice person to hang out with. One can learn a lot of Spanish from her. The only problem is that she is not always well-organized. And I would not try to oversimplify her personality like many students tend to do. She is not as simple as she may seem.
2026,54206,5.0,3.0,oohh i love senora!!! she's by far my favorite professor at davidson--and i LOVE her supportive nature--you can make a completely ridiculous comment and she'll see what you MEANT to say.. and see the beauty in your attempt! ooh she's amazing..
2027,54206,2.0,2.0,"La profesora Maiz-Peña is one of the most loved teachers at Davidson.  Like many Literature/language people, she has an agenda.  In order to do well, you should in every essay say that Latin Americans have suffered a lot, especially women.  I can actually speak almost perfect Spanish, but got an A-."
2028,54206,5.0,3.0,"Well, I've never actually HAD her as a teacher (prolly won't), but I KNOW her, and I think she's got an infectiously wonderful personality.  Always on the move - brilliant - another one of the department's ALL*STARS; just stay away from LUIS!"
2029,54206,5.0,2.0,I loved her.  She is soooo great.  She really helps you in her class.

2031,54206,4.5,1.0,"this class was real easy, she is a great teacher, learn alot but isn't too hard"
2032,54207,5.0,4.0,"I really like Dr. Paradise. He's very nice and tries to be helpful whenever he can. The content was difficult for me, but he made it a bit easier. There is a quiz every week, and those are alright if you study and go to class. There are also research papers which are more difficult and sometimes confusing. Beware of cold calling. "
2033,54207,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Paradise was a really great professor. There were a LOT of readings for the class, but the content generally stayed relevant and interesting. The class was essentially just reviewing information from the reading. There were quizzes due before every class and 3-4 major papers on top of two longer lab reports. Overall, really enjoyed the class!"
2034,54207,4.0,3.0,"The post below me pretty much sums the class up -- practice tests and sending in those lab reports early really helped my grade. Dr. Paradise is one of the biggest &quot;dads&quot; that I've met at Davidson, and he is really passionate about biology which helped get me through BIO114 (so boring). Would recommend if you like dry humor"
2035,54207,3.0,4.0,"Write down all the ""take-home messages"" from each chapter. Paradise randomly calls on people so make sure you read every single day. He is a subjective grader but if you do the practice tests and look at his answer keys, you should do fine on the reviews. I highly recommend sending him lab report drafts a week before its official deadline."
2036,54207,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Paradise is a harsh grader. He does, however, grade on very specific rubrics. I don't recommend ecology for people who are not visual learners as almost all of the tools he requires you to use to learn are visual. Class was slow."
2037,54207,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Paradise was a very chill professor. He's approachable and provides a light atmosphere in the class. If you don't understand something, ask questions and speak up as he is not always clear in lectures. The best way to do well on his exams is to type out what he says in class (everyone uses laptops in the class, powerpoints are all online). "
2038,54207,3.5,3.0,"Really nice guy, very understanding if you're having problems outside of class that are interfering with your performance. That being said, he is a VERY picky grader and grades lab reports and papers harshly and looks for very specific wording on tests. Sometimes it's difficult to figure out what he's looking for. He is helpful outside of class."
2039,54207,3.0,3.0,"He is a super picky grader. It is sometimes difficult to do as well as you would like on tests, labs, or essays. He is a great guy though and he really cares about the class and the material. And he's a bit shy too. The class is very interesting. It's a lot of work and I found the independent projects to be interesting, enjoyable and manageable."
2040,54207,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Paradise really cares about the class. Unfortunately, I found him kind of confusing. Office hours helped, but sometimes he struggled to explain the material. His tests/labs weren't difficult but he's a picky grader, sometimes it's hard to do as well as you'd like. Overall, he tries to make his lectures interesting. You have to have him for 114."
2041,54207,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Paradise knows about the stuff he likes: bugs and ecology. Otherwise, he's always confusing and his lectures are dry. He is also a very picky exam and lab grader without being very specific about what he wants. Thus, not a very fair grader. In this team taught course, I preferred Campbell and did better on his exams."
2042,54207,3.5,1.0,"This class was interesting at times. other times boring. His quizes contain majority stuff from lecture and there are no tests. There are 3 esays, 2 labreports, and 2 presentations. He is a surprisinly harsh lab report and essay grader but it is manageable. I recommend this class if you have a tough schedule. This class is really laidback."
2043,54207,3.5,3.0,"Paradise can be boring at times in lectures but does mean well. Grades lab reports really harshly. Take him for upper levels bios and he gets way more into it. If you go to office hours and send him drafts, he helps you succeed in the class but you do have to be motivated."
2044,54207,3.0,2.0,"Just re-structured this Organisms, Evolution, and Ecology 112 intro course to integrating concepts 114 intro course. Class is average, nothing great but nothing horrible. Only critique is that his test questions are sometimes confusing. He has a sense of humor once he gets over his shyness and he is really laidback. If nothing else, it's tolerable."
2045,54207,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Paradise loves to teach from PowerPoint, and he makes his lectures available on his webpage so you can print the slides off and take notes in class. All assignments are turned in and returned with comments via email. He is tremendously helpful outside of class if you stop by his office. Students may also email him a draft for helpful comments."
2046,54207,2.0,4.0,by far the worst professor I've had at Davidson. so so boring and his tests are impossible to do well on. If you forget to mention a seemingly minor detail you can easily lose like 5% because everything is worth so much on his tests. hated this class. wait to take it with a different professor. really.
2047,54207,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Paradise is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the topics he knows most about, most of which are not covered in BIO 112. His specialty is entomology and he loves ecology, but he doesn't seem to have a commanding grasp of much of the course material. That said, he is friendly, approachable, and will give great feedback for writing assignments."
2048,54207,2.0,1.0,"This class was INCREDIBLY BORING. Lectures are straight from the power point, and somedays he doesn't even seem prepared for class. If you aren't interested in environmental Bio take Stanback."
2049,54207,5.0,2.0,"Loved this class. He is a pretty fair grader. He grades test pretty hard, but it's not too bad. Class goes by rather quickly and even if you fall asleep or not pay attention, all lecture notes are posted on shirley. A MUST TAKE!!"
2050,54207,2.5,1.0,Easy class but he really doesn't need to grade the tests as hard as he does. Somewhat inconsistent as he grades papers easily.
2051,54207,4.5,1.0,No Comments
2052,54207,5.0,3.0,"I've now taken three classes and i absolutely love this man.  He is rediculously enthusiastic about everything that he does.  He loves his subject, and he cares tremendously for his students.  He's very approachable and giving of his time and energy."
2053,54207,4.0,2.0,"Assuming the only people who take this class are science majors, this class is fairly easy and straight-forward.  Dr. Paradise sometimes gets off-track during lectures, but these tangents are usually interesting and bio-related.  Also, the information you need for tests is available on Shirley in his powerpoints.  A very cool and friendly professor"
2054,54207,1.0,3.0,"Class is boring, completely unhelpful, and unclear. Rather than being straightforward, he goes off on tangents answering random questions. Tests aren't hard, but grading is unfair."

2057,54207,1.5,3.0,"Lectures unclear, doesn't explain things well"
2058,54207,2.5,3.0,he is tough to follow sometimes.  Note very clear in lectures.Tests are tough
2059,54209,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fox is my favorite professor at Davidson! She is so kind and makes her students feel like her friends. Her class is so engaging; you will learn a lot. She is somewhat of a tough grader, but she is fair and wants her students to do well. Definitely consider taking a class of hers if you can!"
2060,54209,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fox is amazing and does not deserve a lot of the bad reviews. She is super caring and one of the smartest teachers I have ever had. She's a super fun person and will make class fun and entertaining. Highly recommend a class with her!
2061,54209,2.0,3.0,"For someone who specializes in disabilities, Fox sure doesn't have a lot of sympathy for those of us that have them. She doesn't allow her students to struggle and becomes condescending, patronizing, &amp; borderline heartless when they do. Stay away if you struggle with with chronic illnesses, disabilities, mental disorders, family problems, etc."
2062,54209,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fox is easily one of the most knowledgeable professors at Davidson. She is engaging in the classroom and offers insightful feedback on papers. Significant amount of reading, though, and it is difficult. But do the reading and participate in class and you'll be fine."
2063,54209,1.0,4.0,"If you take a course with Dr. Fox, you have to have some focus and interest in disability studies, because a good bit of the work and discussion comes at the topics from the lens of a disabilities studies scholars. If this is your interest, she'll be a great fit, if not, avoid her courses."
2064,54209,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fox is a fantastic professor! She is great at facilitating productive and insightful classroom discussion and offers plenty of help in office hours on any and all assignments. She also gives clear grading criteria and is a very fair grader. You won't regret taking a class with her!
2065,54209,4.0,3.0,"Liked her a lot. Very passionate about the class and disability. If interested in the subject, I would definitely reccomend"
2066,54209,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Fox is fantastic! She encourages exploration, thought, and creativity and is funny, engaging, and really smart.   She clearly cares deeply about her students and field.   I can't say enough good things about her and her class! Take one with her before you graduate! (But be prepared to read!)"
2067,54209,4.5,2.0,"Professor Fox's Reading Violence ENG 110 course is great, and highly interesting. Classes are mainly centered around class discussion, so reading your materials is a must, and be prepared to speak in every class. It is extremely hard to get an A on any assignments, but her papers and midterm/final are super easy."
2068,54209,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fox is one of the most genuinely interested teachers I have ever had at Davidson. She is a stickler about attendance but is incredibly engaging and insightful. I recommend her to every and all students interested or not in english. 110 is a good non-majors course.
2069,54209,4.5,3.0,I LOVE Dr. Fox. Her class was thoroughly interesting with great discussion with her encouraging any and every opinion you have. She is also a great person outside of class. I would take this class again in a heartbeat.
2070,54209,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Fox is very passionate about disability rights and that comes through in this class. Sometimes it was hard to follow the text or her lectures to the extent she expected, but she was always willing to help. She's fun in class, as long as she likes you- but she can be a bit bitter, don't get on her bad side. Pretty tough grader on papers."
2071,54209,3.0,3.0,"Don't expect to get an A in this class without working hard. Know how to use your commas. She gives you paper topics 1-2wks in advance so you have plenty of time to see her in office hours to get help. Her midterm and final are extremely easy, if you pay attention in class you'll do well on them. Bring your book to class everyday and be on time."
2072,54209,5.0,4.0,"Be prepared to be pushed, but also be prepared to come out a much better student than your were before taking her class. Every student should have the honor of taking class with Dr. Fox before they graduate. She is easily one of Davidson's best professors."
2073,54209,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fox is a WONDERFUL professor. I took both upper-level classes she was teaching this semester just because she was the professor, not because I was interested in the subjects. Spending the semester in both of her classes (one is Contemporary Theater and the other is Disability and Literature) has helped me to understand and gain respect for both"
2074,54209,5.0,3.0,"Very fair grader. Really cares about students, ask for help and she will give you so much advice."
2075,54209,2.5,4.0,"Very picky about stupid things, like underlining titles and stapling papers. Loves to talk about Women, Gays, and Disabled, but not much else. Hard class, it was too early in the morning for me to deal with her."
2076,54209,5.0,4.0,"I took Modern Drama and Modern Literature--Both were electives, and they were my two favorite classes at Davidson. Do not be late to her class! She's enthusiastic, entertaining, opinionated,exceptionally intelligent  and passionate. I enjoyed attending class-and great projects were assigned."
2077,54209,1.0,5.0,"incredibly moody.  felt personally targeted.  team taught class--they ganged up and were really mean, not helpful, and graded unfairly."
2078,54209,5.0,3.0,Very knowledgable about her field of study. I feel like this class should almost be renamed &quot;Modern Drama about Women's Oppression&quot;... there's a lot of focus on women's rights (though that is not at all a bad thing). Don't be a second late to her class or she'll kill you. Otherwise AMAZING.
2079,54209,4.5,3.0,GREAT TEACHER!
2080,54209,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Fox is a great prof. I'm not sure about upper level courses, but for ENG 110 she was great. Course's focus is reading violence, and it was very interesting. Just say a few things in class and you're set. I thought I hated literature, but not anymore."
2081,54209,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fox is knowledgeable, sweet, and FUN! There's never a boring class. I noticed mood swings in an earlier course, but I think that was just getting-tenure-stress. She has tenure now. I don't think you have to agree with her opinions--perhaps these are just folks who don't even want their opinions challenged&#63; She REALLY helped my writing as well."
2082,54209,4.5,4.0,"I love her class! She's very picky with assignments and a tough grader, but she is endlessly helpful and class discussions are great!"
2083,54209,3.0,2.0,"To be in her class to walk upon eggshells. Her mood swings are so strong that you can tell exactly where she is in her menstral cycle. Her expectations of your behavior do not align with her own behavior. Unless you are very good at brown-nosing, prepare to be frustrated and silent."
2084,54209,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Fox gives the oringinal impression of being a good professor, sadly she is a big disappointment. She has extensive knowledge about gender and disability, but her knowledge ends there. I was encouraged to repeat her ideas and comments rather than think for myself. I suggest avoiding her classes."
2085,54209,2.0,3.0,"Fox is extremely opinionated, and she believes that no other opinion aside from her own warrants even being brought up.  I wouldn't recommend this class unless you want to be told what to think and not be able to express your own ideas or opinions."
2086,54209,5.0,5.0,A brilliant professor.  The best course I had at Davidson.  (and she's really cool)
2087,54209,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING class. Dr. Fox is fascinating, entertaining, supportive, helpful, caring, understanding, and incredibly enthusiasthic."
2088,54209,4.0,4.0,FASCINATING class discussion. Be rofwarned: Fox is anal--and a tought grader!
2089,54209,1.5,4.0,No Comments
2090,54213,3.0,4.0,"Awesome professor and a gem of a guy, but definitely a weird grader. He has a specific type of writing in mind that can be difficult to emulate, and it's unclear how he wants it. Engaging during lectures and easy to get to know. Not hard to get a B, but nearly impossible to get an A. His WRI101 class was engaging and he's a good person to know."
2091,54213,4.0,3.0,"Great guy and relatively easy workload, just a bit vague with assignments as well as feedback on assignments. I still dont know the real reasons why I got the grades I got on my essays in his course. I would take him again for sure despite his occasionally frustrating tendencies."
2092,54213,1.0,4.0,Was not very fair on how he graded work because he gave us little to no instruction on all assignments.
2093,54213,5.0,4.0,One of the greatest professors I've ever had. You MUST take a class with Dr. Snyder before you graduate. It's a necessity.
2094,54213,3.0,3.0,"Greg's aight. As a Writing 101 teacher, he focused a lot more on religion than writing. This made for some fun discussion days, but also for some paper grades that came out of nowhere - he's pretty specific about what he wants but doesn't usually tell you. I'd take him again for a religion class."
2095,54213,4.0,4.0,"Snyder is awesome! He's  passionate about his subject and class is laid back(but he makes you work for hw and papers). Any random class ideas will actually be considered. Our class hand carved bamboo pens and transcribed the gospel of mark onto papyrus... then dressed in togas and read our codex in the DCPC chapel! Strange, fun AND educational!"
2096,54213,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Snyder was a wonderful discussion leader. He had great insights and was always there to guide the conversation, but for the most part he let us do the talking. You have to work to do well on the papers, but that's Davidson. He was by far the best discussion leader for Hum 150 my year. :)"
2097,54213,4.0,2.0,"Great discussion leader.  He keeps discussion on topic but allows for a great deal of freedom.  His grading is fair and relatively easy.  It's easy to get a B on a paper but much harder to get an A.  If you go for help, he is helpful but most students don't.  Very relaxed class.  Participation is key."
2098,54213,3.0,3.0,"Pretty much agree with comments below.  Expects a lot from your essays, tests are medium-to-almost-tough (though he does always say they're easy).  As a word of advice, he likes to hear you repeat his opinions, and he agrees with the readings 99% of the time.  The class is well worth taking, but not a must-take."
2099,54213,2.5,2.0,"He will come across as very chill laidback &easygoing, then he'll hand you a test & say something like &quot;this is sooo easy, I really slacked on you guys...&quot; all the while he'll present his charming reassuring smile, downplaying the need to study. DONT B FOOLLED. H/E, he is 2cool4skool & he lectures with the manerisms of a male model. 1.5 thumbsUp =)"
2100,54213,1.5,5.0,"He's nice but a tough grader. He should not be leading a discussion group such as in hums. He tries to make it interesting, but most in class discussions are just disorganized."
2101,54213,4.5,3.0,"Snyder is great! Our Hums group was so much fun.  He is a tough grader, but submits really interesting ideas for discussion and gave good lectures.  His sense of humor is fantastic.  We went to his house, ate Brick House pizza, and watched Troy...awesome."
2102,54213,3.0,2.0,"Nice guy...really knowns/loves his stuff. Interesting class at times...sometimes discussions were slow and prof would get off topic. Overall though, a relatively easy A-"
2103,54213,5.0,2.0,Awesome professor!  Especially good if you have a previous interest in the material.  Get to know him outside class.
2104,54213,2.5,3.0,"Just doesn't know how to run a class of freshmen-- doesn't focus discussion toward key elements of text, nor teach critical analysis skills, nor encourage all members of class to speak. Seems to think lack of direction is encouragement for students to explore their own ideas when really just demonstrates aimlessness and shallow content of class."
2105,54213,4.0,3.0,Great! extremely nice and willing to help
2106,54213,5.0,3.0,Brilliant and greak lectures. Goes off on very interesting asides from time to time.
2107,54213,3.5,3.0,"Fantastic.  A little lost in his own thought sometimes, but it's probably just because he's a genius.  Has a reputation for being very difficult, but it seems to me that his bark is worse than his bite."
2108,54213,2.5,4.0,"Snide and thinks lowly of his students (or at least those in Humanities). I was not impressed with his lectures, and he is not very precise in his speech, though he has tremendous expectations for your writing (i.e. written expression)."
2109,54213,4.0,4.0,"Very good overall, lecture style is different, but makes for an enjoyable class. Very knowledgible, and articulate.  Can get sidetracked, but i definitely reccommend the class.  excellent professor."
2110,54213,4.0,4.0,Certainly a difficult grader but he's approachable for help any time.
2111,54213,1.5,5.0,he's really hard and revels in his students' pain. stay away from his classes.
2112,54213,2.0,5.0,No Comments
2113,54213,2.0,4.0,"Meetings with the professor do infinitely more harm than good.  Bias against Catholic Church (along with Christianity on the whole, perhaps&#63;) incessantly creeps through in his lectures.  Class discussion is somewhat inhibited by the professor's inability to understand differing perspectives."
2114,54213,4.0,3.0,"the guy used to be an astrophysicist. period. of course he'll grade brutally, he's used to rocket science."
2115,54213,3.0,5.0,"Very nice, good guy.  Very tough grader though; it seems like even when you understand something very well, you still lose loads of points on it."
2116,54213,5.0,5.0,Best lecturer I have ever had.
2117,54213,5.0,5.0,"Great guy - really funny, really smart.  He's a really hard grader but definitely worth it!"
2118,54213,5.0,5.0,"great teacher, fascinating lectures, relaxing atmosphere, tough grader"
2119,54213,2.0,5.0,"Stay away!  He gives you a false sense of hope, but then gives you a kick in the butt."
2120,1782726,4.0,2.0,"Look, she's hot, she's nice, and she's endlessly fascinating. Never really needed her help on papers, but she offers it if you visit her office hours. Professor LOVES to talk and expects you to participate in discussion. Best syllabus I've ever seen."
2121,1782726,5.0,2.0,She's perfect that's it that's the whole story TAKE A CLASS WITH HER IF YOU LOVE YOURSELF
2122,1782726,5.0,2.0,"She's the best. Great class to take for historical thought credit, or any credit at that. Her lectures and engaging and she genuinely cares about her students. "
2123,1782726,5.0,1.0,Amazing teacher. Would recommend her for any student. You will learn a lot and will enjoy doing so. Classes aren't too hard and are actually pretty enjoyable.
2124,1782726,5.0,2.0,"Professor Erman is a great... Not too much work, she would rather you actually read and learn then memorize which is nice.  Helpful in office hours! Definitely recommended for non-Russian majors."
2125,54214,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lom is one of my favorite professors. She is always available during office hours or outside of class. She genuinely cares about her students. Although she can have high expectations, she always communicates how she grades and gives her students a clear understanding of what they need to do to be successful in her class. Highly recommend. "
2126,54214,5.0,3.0,"I wish I could take all of the Dr. Lom classes. She is phenomenal! She uses innovative teaching methods, which are such a nice change from boring, long, unengaging lectures given by other professors. She likes to have fun in class, likes to keep you accountable for your work, and her class is suited for all learning styles. Favorite class taken! "
2127,54214,3.5,3.0,"VERY picky for essays. Very straightforward teacher; if you read, you'll do well. But you HAVE to keep up with the reading for the daily quizzes. It takes a while to get the hang of the lab presentations and papers, but this class does a good job of preparing you for other science classes down the road."
2128,54214,4.0,4.0,"I don't really like Lom's teaching style; she reminds me of an elementary school teacher. Hated her during lecture; liked her okay enough during lab. For Bio 111, Wessner's probably a better bet."
2129,54214,4.0,4.0,"Easy to understand and fully explains concepts, esp. if you're having trouble with them.  She draws a LOT of pictures, which is helpful for a lot of us.  Fair grader, but you MUST study in order to do well on her tests.  Group lab reports, not too bad, and labs aren't too interesting but are easy enough. I'd recommend."
2130,54214,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lom is a great professor and one of the best I have had thus far.  While she is very hard, she cares about her students, and does a great job explaining the material."
2131,54214,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lom has been the best professor that I have had thus far at Davidson.  She is extremely prepared, knowledgeable, and helpful.  She can find a way to explain anything that you do not understand.  Her tests can be tough, but, if you keep up with the material, you should be just fine."
2132,54214,5.0,3.0,An excellent teacher! Here tests are straight forward and although she assigns a lot of reading it is not necessary to do well in her class.
2133,54214,5.0,4.0,Dr. Lom is awesome! She's super nice and explains things very well.  The class is tough but Dr. Lom is very fair and student oriented. I highly recommend getting her as a teacher.
2134,54214,5.0,2.0,"Very prepared, interested in material, helpful after class- put the work into this course and it's worth it."
2135,54214,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lom is very demanding, but she's also clear on what she demands, so if you're willing to put in the time you can get a good grade in her courses.  (The tests will be impossible if you haven't paid attention in class however)"
2136,54214,3.5,4.0,No Comments
2137,54214,4.5,4.0,"Extremely long hard tests but a great teacher.  Interesting lectures, but very tough grading.  Lab presentations and reports will boost grades.  Once you get used to her tests, you will do much better. Don't give up hope!"
2138,54214,5.0,2.0,"Great lecturer, prepares well for tests, makes things understandable"
2139,54215,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Stasack is very straightforward and honest about what she expects out of her students.  As long as you work hard and show her that you are doing your very best, the class will be very rewarding.  She is very knowledgeable in her field and is a fantastic instructor."
2140,54215,1.0,4.0,"As someone with a good amount of music experience (music minor &amp; have taken many music courses), I didn't have a good experience taking this class. Be ready to regurgitate what the textbook &amp; prof say right back during tests. Stasack is incredibly picky with test responses &amp; not afraid to give failing grades. Nice enough person, just difficult prof"
2141,54215,1.0,4.0,"She's sweet, but totally irrational in her grading. She's also very good at explaining things in huge circles that never really reach the point. Tangents are a specialty and the syllabus is particularly vague. I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
2142,54215,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Stasack is a very interesting and knowledgeable person, but if you do not interpret every detail of the music and cultures exactly as she does, it will be very hard to do well. If you need to take her class do your very best to make everything you produce a carbon copy of her lectures, and don't go to office hours if you don't have an A."
2143,54215,1.0,4.0,"World music would seem like a go to 100 level course for credit, but Dr. Stasack takes what should be an introductory course and turns it into hell for anyone who has a different idea than her. Be ready to be quized on material not covered in lectures, and for office hours to be more about your inadequacy than getting help."
2144,54215,2.0,3.0,She tries to be nice but simply doesn't understand that some students are not music majors or minors. Kinda donkey move to not explain basic concepts in more detail. Would not recommend though is friendly outside class. Lectures can be very dry.
2145,54215,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Stasack is so specific about everything. If you don't do everything the exact way she wants, you will get a bad grade. Office hours are not helpful at all if you need help, she will just make sure you know that you don't know anything. Do not take."
2146,54215,1.0,5.0,"Do NOT take this course if you are not extremely passionate about world music. Stasack is nice, but grades like a maniac and asks for A LOT on the exams. This class was definitely one of my most difficult courses at Davidson.  Only take this class if you're ready to put in a lot of work."
2147,54215,4.0,4.0,Best teacher I have had.
2148,54215,4.0,4.0,"If you take World Music with little to no musical experience, (insert South Park meme) you're going to have a bad time. HOWEVER, I've had Prof. Stasack for both a composition class and World Music and have enjoyed both. She expects a lot, but she readily provides help outside of class. She loves what she does and the material she teaches."
2149,54215,4.0,2.0,"She changed the format of the class so that as long as you read, you can make a pretty high grade. The tests are hard if you don't like to memorize. Otherwise she tells you what will be on it. She is flexible and willing to work with you on the final project to make it fun and interesting."
2150,54215,1.0,3.0,"Professor Stasack was no help at all. At first she seems easy and very clear about what she wants, but once it comes to the tests that changes. Her grading is all opinion and she is very specific about how she wants answers. It is almost impossible to do well on her tests. Avoid if you can. "
2151,54215,3.5,2.0,"Pretty interesting and fun class if you like music. Most of the stuff on tests is straight from the text and she gives handouts with notes in class most of the time, though she is very picky and arbitrary with her grading sometimes. Grades the final project and paper super easily."
2152,54215,3.5,3.0,Such a nice teacher! Made class entertaining and sometimes gave hints in office hours. Could do fairly well on tests simply by reading the textbook. Class was pure memorization but there was a ton of information to memorize.
2153,54215,1.0,5.0,"AVOID HER!! WORLD MUSICS IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME. Undoubtedly the worst teacher I've had at Davidson. While she can be entertaining in class, her grading is irrational and arbitrary. She is useless outside of class in office hours (I talked with her for 1:30 and gathered nothing). I actually decided I couldn't minor because of her class."
2154,54215,3.0,3.0,"MUS261 with Dr. Stasack is great if you are truly willing to put hard, honest work to it. It certainly led me out of my comfort zone. Stasack's comments as I was composing my final piece were often more hurtful than clear - but that's what pushed me to evaluate my own work and ultimately make something I couldn't be more satisfied about."
2155,54215,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Stasack is a wonderful professor. Though she can be a bit quirky, she is passionate about what she is teaching and is incredibly knowledgeable. She has lived, studied, and played music everywhere around the globe, and if you demonstrate legitimate interest in the material she will go the extra mile to make sure you get the most out of the class"
2156,54215,1.0,4.0,"She's nice to a few favorite students, but in most cases she's unhelpful, mean, and even downright nasty.  Inconsistent grader.  She regularly butchers the English language, and half the time doesn't know what she's talking about.  Stay away."
2157,54215,3.5,3.0,"Interesting and eccentric course but very detail-heavy, and the lack of graded assignments will throw you under the bus if you do badly on any of them. Lectures can get dry at times, and she's a little arrogant about her musical abilities, but a very novel subject for most people."
2158,54215,1.5,2.0,"Essentially a waste of time. Even though I did pretty well, each lecture was so extraordinarily drawn out. She is very unhelpful in informing you what she wants, and frequently throws curve balls. Your musical background doesn't really matter that much. She's also incredibly condescending, and she seems unable to speak in a succinct manner."
2159,54215,3.0,1.0,"Dr. Stasack is incredibly easy in world music if you have any musical background at all.  I almost never studied and got an A.  Even if you don't &quot;know&quot; and answer, you can always get substantial partial credit.  She is also extremely enthusiastic.  However, she if f&$£ing nuts and sometimes gets lost in her own lectures, but I love her."
2160,54215,4.0,3.0,Her passion for music shows but you need to STUDY!!!
2161,54215,3.5,5.0,"Definitely study for World Music, I underestimated it. It can be tough. But Stasack is a great teacher, her passion for the subject is visible. Talk to her outside of class, she's a cool person."
2162,54215,3.0,4.0,"Took World Music. Not as horrible as most people think. She's extremely helpful in office hours, you just have to ignore her weird quirks. I genuinely like her and would definitely take more classes with her if I were interested in music."
2163,54215,1.5,5.0,"One of the very worst classes I have ever taken anywhere.   This woman is arrogant, mean, and totally unhelpful.  She openly plays favorites. She should not be teaching here."
2164,54215,1.0,2.0,With out a doubt one of the worst classes I ever took.  Good grief this woman sucks.
2165,54215,3.0,4.0,"I took World Music.  Biggest mistake of my college career so far.  The class sucks, really boring and difficult.  I thought it'd be nice to knock out two requirements with one class but not worth it.. Avoid this class."
2166,54215,4.5,4.0,She was really passionate and explained material really thoroughly.  Her energy was contagious and she was extremely invested teaching the material.  Tests are not bad if you study... she prepares you well.  Just be sure to remember details that she says are important.
2167,54215,4.5,4.0,Dr. Stasack is an extremely good composition professor.  For the first few weeks she gives us a foundation in the material and then lets us apply that knowledge to a piece.  She is particularly good at critiquing.  She gives enough direction without being heavy handed or overly critical.  If one really engages with the material it is a great class.
2168,54215,1.0,5.0,Pay CLOSE attention to ALL comments about this professor and absolutely DO NOT take this class.  Lecture class with two tests worth 70% of your grade as well as extremely difficult &quot;listening quizzes.&quot;  People with musical experience had EXTREME difficulty.  Everyone says to steer clear.  Unquestionably one of THE HARDEST classes at Davidson.
2169,54215,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS under any circumstances.  This is NOT an intro level class (and is by no means taught or graded as such), and is nearly impossible if you do not have significant talent and prior experience with an instrument.  Lecture is abstract and confusing, tests are very difficult, did not find &quot;help&quot; outside of class helpful at all."
2170,54215,1.0,4.0,"Worst professor at Davidson by a strong degree. Extremely &quot;favoritist&quot; in grading, evidenced by differential points given to people who visit her to complain about her grades and HIGHLY judgmental. Totally unclear, and does the impossible by turning a fascinating subject into chinese water torture. Sum: Difficult, mean, terrible, worst teacher ever"
2171,54215,4.5,4.0,"I strongly recommend Prof. Stasack's composition track which includes 261, 361, and 263.  She first opens you up to your musical context and then lets you go in your own direction creatively.  The only thing you can do wrong is miss your deadlines.  She really tries and succeeds at objective grading."
2172,54215,1.5,4.0,To repeat what everyone else has said: awful class! Dr. Stasack expects too much for a 100 level and takes herself and her class TOO seriously. The class is boring AND hard.
2173,54215,2.5,3.0,"This class isn't as horrible as everyone makes it out to be.  You'll do fine if you work hard and actually listen to the music and do the readings.  As long as you don't clash with her and stay on her good side, you should be fine.  Don't take this class if you're looking for a no-work-required 'A'.  The material's interesting if you want it to be."
2174,54215,2.0,4.0,"I took World Musics, and it was ridiculous.  I have an extensive music background, but still found myself unsure of what she was talking about on tests.  Also, only 2 tests worth 40% each is really tough.  Especially when the questions dont make sense.  Dont take her. You have been warned..."
2175,54215,1.0,5.0,"Horrible, uninteresting class. Don't get me started on the professor; arrogant and self involved; does'nt care about her students at all. Unaproachable and uncelar."
2176,54215,1.0,5.0,"Everything she teaches is ambiguous and unclear. She commonly contradicts herself. The music isn’t bad, she is. Do yourself a favor and don’t take this class."
2177,54215,1.0,4.0,"Do not take her. Most lecture I've ever had (coupled with pointless mandatory attendance). Cannot give a straight answer. Speaks in pompous, abstract terms that sound academic to her but are meaningless-then tests you on them. Dull. Often incorrect. Destroyed my interest in a major/minor in music."
2178,54215,1.0,4.0,"Let me predicate with: my grade in this class is fine, and I was offered music scholarships for college. Now: this is absolutely the worst class I have ever taken. She is an embarassment to the faculty and the institution. Grading is borderline academic fraud, teaching is haphazard and inaccurate."
2179,54215,1.0,5.0,"Her class is aweful, and she is not aproachable at all... she is out there to get you and her only purpose is to fail you"
2180,54215,1.5,5.0,awful. absolutely terrible. very unclear on what she wants.  says no prior music knowledge is necessary but expects students in a basic music survey class to have the knowledge and ear of a music major. don't ever take her or this class under any circumstances!
2181,54215,1.5,5.0,"Ridiculously hard class.  Expects you to know way more than what she says.  Says no music knowledge is needed, but she really means you should be able to read music and pick apart a random music sample like its your job.  Avoid at all costs."
2182,54215,2.0,4.0,"Run, run away! Worst class I ever had at Davidson.  Went to her office several times begging for help...none was given."
2183,54215,1.0,4.0,"What a horrible lady.  She demands students to connectwith her a level that few can, and for this we are severely penalized.  She needs to take into consideration what class she is teaching.  NEVER EVER take this lady!!!  We're not all ethnomusicologists."
2184,54215,1.0,4.0,Arbitrary and intimidating.  Not approachable at all.  Doesn't care if you learn.  Makes music unenjoyable.
2185,54215,5.0,2.0,"Strange but in a good way!!! I loved her class, very interesting!!"
2186,54215,4.5,3.0,"Stasack is great. She may be a little quirky, but is a great teacher"
2187,734162,4.0,1.0,"No tests, which was great.  It's very easy to do well if you do exactly what she asks.  Enjoyed the material a lot."
2188,734162,1.0,5.0,horrible
2189,734162,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Ault clearly is incredibly knowledgable about her area of expertise -- child development.  The tests were tough, though, and I felt that she expected us to read her mind as to exactly what she wanted the answers to be."
2190,734162,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ault is a wonderful professor. She's difficult, and can be intimidating-but she is very interested in what she teaches and really wants her students to be as interested in the material as she is."
2191,734162,3.5,2.0,"Child DEV: very nice, but monotone. though its the only A..minus ive gotten at davidson. If you give her a rough draft, shell correct everything on it and if you fix it you will make an A. I reccomend it. Though, it does require outside work going to the day care and monitoring things about kids"
2192,734162,4.0,3.0,"I love kids so I loved the class. A lot of my friends didn't, though. Grades sometimes seemed arbitrary, but she really wants her students to do well and gives lots of extra help on papers."
2193,734162,4.0,4.0,"Ault's class was not easy at all! But, in the end, I learned a lot and her grading was fair.  Just be prepared to work hard."
2194,734165,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Baker is a nice lady. Complaints: you have to try to pay attention in class, and half the time she just has  each student read a little from the book, so everybody tunes out when they aren't reading aloud. Also, the tests are hard. Really hard. But a major group project counts for 14 of the grade, and she grades that liberally."
2195,734165,5.0,3.0,"Professor Baker is fantastic! Such a cute, sweet lady who cares so much about her students. She grades the speeches pretty easily, but be ware, the tests are challenging!"
2196,734165,3.0,4.0,"Tests actually were pretty hard, but she is a great lady!"
2197,734165,4.5,3.0,"Sweetest old lady in the world, always willing to help.  That said, her tests are pretty hard and she grades them strictly.  Overall, very worthwhile class, take it if you are able."
2198,734165,4.5,3.0,"A pertinent class to take to brush up on your communication skills to gain confidence with public speaking. Tests are NOT easy, require much studying and prep. Speeches aren't bad, but class is not as easy as was said to be...Prof. Baker is super friendly though and has a positive vibe."
2199,734165,5.0,1.0,Ms. Baker: &quot;It's so beautiful today that I think we will have to end class early&quot;  -- After watching a 20 minute movie in our 1:15 long class we were instructed to leave and try to spend the rest of the day outside.
2200,734165,5.0,1.0,"Baker is the sweetest and most helpful teacher at Davidson. Yeah, the class is a big of a joke, but is honestly helpful for anyone for later life. If you read the chapters and prepare even a little bit for the speeches you'll do great. The class is worth it though just to hang out with this sweet little lady."
2201,734165,5.0,1.0,"OMG, her class is such a joke.  My only &quot;A&quot; at Davidson College ever! And I'm a senior!"
2202,734167,5.0,3.0,"He's an amazing lecturer and very engaging (even when the class shifted online). He gives broad essay prompts, but gives good feedback. There's no textbook - almost all readings are primary sources he provides. He did a great job explaining Middle Eastern history, and I feel that I have learned a lot in his class! I would recommend this class."
2203,734167,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor at Davidson, and I don't even really like history. He's a very talented lecturer, and his readings and essay prompts were interesting. He encourages participation in class, but he made that very easy to do. I strongly recommend him to anyone considering taking a class of his."
2204,734167,4.0,3.0,"If you do all the reading, you will do well. He gives great lectures, but they're fast and cover a lot of content which makes the final pretty hard. A lot of the grade is based on papers which he grades toughly, but they're interesting prompts. Great class discussions."
2205,734167,5.0,3.0,"Incredibly talented lecturer. One of the most knowledgable professors at Davidson in his field (middle eastern history), where he has published award winning books. He's always in his office willing to help you with papers, and gives clear and concise advice. I've taken two classes with Dr. Berkey, and hope to take more in the future."
2206,734167,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Berkey is a really incredible lecturer who is always available to help you with your work. Stay on top of your note taking, and you will almost certainly do well. This was the class I looked forward to during the week; if I could take it again, I would."
2207,734167,5.0,3.0,"Great guy. Discussions are interesting, he knows about tons of stuff, whether it's history or music-related, and he's a fair grader on papers. I'd definitely take a class of his again."
2208,734167,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Berkey was funny and energetic even at 8:30 in the morning. Very very knowledgeable and obviously loved sharing that knowledge. The few papers we had were short and manageable, and there was no end-of-semester final so the class was very doable."
2209,734167,4.0,4.0,"Incredibly knowledgeable but intimidating. Don't let his expertise get in the way of your experimenting w/ giving insights into subjects you may not know lots about. Lectures are clear/inspiring and open your mind to age-old conflicts that are still relevant today. Easy to talk in class if you do reading, and Dr. B encourages participation (20%)."
2210,734167,2.5,4.0,"A nice guy and this class is definitely interesting. There's a lot of material covered, however, and he really isn't very clear with what he wants for his assignments/papers so it's kind of random. Take it if you are really interested in the middle east/Islam, and if your gpa isn't the most important thing to you."
2211,734167,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Berkey is the best professor I've had at Davidson. His lectures were engaging and funny even at 8:30 am. He gave great and extensive feedback on papers, and his test were very fair. I definitely recommend taking this class, I learned so much, and was eager for every lecture!"
2212,734167,4.5,4.0,"Engaging lectures, Berkey knows his stuff and presents it well."
2213,734167,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Berkey was so knowledgeable about everything we covered. It was a lot of material and could have been confusing, but Dr. Berkey made it attainable and interesting (even at 8:15). A great class and a wonderful professor."
2214,734167,4.0,3.0,"Berkey is one of my favorite professors coming into Davidson. He is very passionate, energetic, and engaging. He knows how to get a discussion moving, and he gives the best lectures. He is a tough- yet fair- grader. Made Hums awesome!"
2215,734167,4.5,3.0,"Berkey is one of my favorite professors coming into Davidson. He is very passionate, energetic, and engaging. He never fails to get a discussion moving, and he gives the best lectures. He is a tough- yet fair- grader. Made Hums one of my favorite classes!"
2216,734167,2.5,4.0,"Berkey thinks he's way too cool. Everybody in HUMs agreed that while he seemed nice at first, he's actually quite a tool. He bluntly reminded our class that he would read our end-of-the-semester teacher comments, but wouldn't change jack about his teaching style. It was a lovely middle-finger to the class."
2217,734167,1.5,4.0,He tends to be a harsh grader and even harsher if you disagree with him. Tread carefully on essay topics.
2218,734167,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Berkey is an interesting teacher, and keeps class interesting, and discussions flowing. However, he's a tough grader for essays and does expect a lot. He does help on papers during office hours, but mostly by giving ideas that can be taken multiple ways -- they aren't clear cut answers. Reading load for this class was also excessive."
2219,734167,3.5,3.0,"He is a great discussion leader and keeps class lively. He's an interesting person and is very open to hearing differing opinions. However, he's a tough grader and his office hours are often fruitless to attend because his comments are incredibly cryptic."
2220,734167,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Berkey was the perfect Humanities discussion leader. He knew when to let us have at each other on ideas, when to step in and direct debates, when to offer pertinent information, etc. His lectures are the most useful in 150. He is a tough grader  but it becomes clear what he wants after a few . Talking outside of class is not often helpful"
2221,734167,5.0,4.0,"Took HIS175 and HIS176 with him. Berkey is without question my favorite professor at Davidson. Yes he is cocky and intimidating, but he's got the goods to back it up - he knows his stuff. his lectures are captivating and he is actually really funny and has a great sense of humor. he is sweet, understanding, and very cool. Hes also mad hot."
2222,734167,3.5,2.0,"Dr. Berkey is pretty interesting and fairly entertaining. He is a fantastic discussion leader! He grades papers by his own opinions, which can sometimes be annoying. Overall a good experience for a writing class."
2223,734167,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Berkey is extremely smart, and his lectures reflect his knowledge. Lectures are interesting - I've never had a problem staying awake in his class. I definitely recommend this class to anyone looking to fufill their cultural diversity or history major requirements. Very interesting material!"
2224,734167,3.5,4.0,"Berkey is easygoing in class, and likes to joke around, but he  isn't afraid to be tough either, especially when grading. I can see what others mean about the ego, but it doesn't really get in the way of learning. It does help to be on his good side, so to speak, but in general, he's a good prof, and  knows what he's talking about."
2225,734167,2.5,4.0,"His lectures are generally good, but he is not a good Humanities discussion leader. He is extremely arrogant and his ego can't take any challenges from students. He isn't much help outside of class, either. I would strongly recommend dropping Humanities if you have him."
2226,734167,2.5,4.0,he has an ego and is intimidating.  not a big fan.
2227,734167,5.0,3.0,Very good discussion leader! I have not run into such enjoyable discussion since his class.
2228,734167,3.5,4.0,"Berkey is a very smart guy, as he is pretty young and already a full professor.  He can be pretty intimidating and comes off as cocky, which doesn't help.  However, if you want to learn a lot and don't mind reading a lot, it's a great class.  Really encourages discussion also.  WARNING!!!  He has a limp handshake"
2229,734167,4.5,3.0,Berkey is an awesome professor.  He is very opinionated but lectures in a way that doesn't force his own viewpoints on you.  He knows what he is talking about and you will learn so much from his class.  He can be arrogant at times but you overlook that due to his awesomeness.
2230,734167,5.0,3.0,"wow. Knows his stuff, very clear, great at connecting broader themes and ideas and articulating them well. Too bad he goes on leave fall 2006."
2231,734167,4.0,3.0,Dr.Berkey really challenged me grow in my writing.  He is also great at facilitating class discussions likes to spark debate which makes for a very interesting class.
2232,734167,5.0,4.0,One of the best - by far.
2233,734167,5.0,3.0,Berkey is a smart guy who knows what he is talking about.  He is easy to understand and I believe one of the better teachers I have had.
2234,734167,4.5,3.0,This guy is an awesome professor.
2235,734167,4.0,4.0,No Comments
2236,734167,4.0,3.0,"Great guy, but sometimes hard to approach out of class. Some people say his ego gets in the way, but i have not experienced that."
2237,132055,3.5,2.0,"Humans and other animals is a simple, straightforward class. If you read, participate, and write well you will get an A. Solid, no addendum A. Dr. Poland is a very kind woman who will discuss problems you have with the course or otherwise. She is even open to what her assignments will be. GPA booster and Dr. Poland is a fantastic human. "
2238,132055,1.0,1.0,"If you want to learn, avoid Polland. It was the one class where you would be getting more value out of doing ANYTHING other than try to listen to lecture or discussion in class. Polland could not facilitate basic discussions in class, and would slaughter any blooming conversations with confusing tangents that no one was talking about or understood."
2239,132055,2.5,1.0,"One of the easier writing classes, but I didn't learn much.  Dr. Poland is super nice, though, and the class banquet was pretty cool.  Good class to boost GPA, not good to boost actual knowledge."
2240,132055,3.5,1.0,she was sweet and a pretty easy grader. The class was interesting at times
2241,132055,1.0,4.0,Dr. Poland was hands down the worst professor I have ever had.  She was completely unhelpful and showed no interest in her students.  She is definitely not Davidson quality.  I would not recommend a class with Dr. Poland to ANYONE.
2242,132055,1.0,4.0,"Though Dr. Poland is a very nice and considerate professor, Religion 248 was a complete waste of my time. I didn't know what she was expecting half of the time. There was a discrepancy between the premise of the course and the actual material. For one assignment, she complained about the books used, when she recommended them! Also,she's spacy."
2243,132055,3.5,1.0,laidback and quirky professor. Participate and think outside the box and you'll do fine
2244,132055,2.5,2.0,"Dr. Poland may have a reputation as being a bit spacey at times, but she is a genuinely nice lady.  Not a hard grader, but some of the readings for this class were confusing.  A lot of people take this thinking it will be an easy A, but this isn't so.  Maybe we'll just call it an easy B..."
2245,132055,3.0,2.0,"She is a very friendly lady and she's really good at spawning class discussion, but I didn't learn much from her, nor did I feel her class was college-level."
2246,132055,2.0,3.0,spacey but not the easy A.
2247,132055,4.5,2.0,"Ahh, Dr. Poland.  She is sweet and quirky; you just want to bake her a chocolate cake.  Oh, she likes to talk about her dogs too."
2248,132055,4.5,2.0,"Spacy but very fair, clear and approachable. The readings were totally manageable, she graded very fairly (almost always very easy). Lectures were boring at times because of the depth of the arguments... yet she works very hard at making theology a whole lot easier to understand. Loves animals too."
2249,132055,5.0,2.0,Dr Poland is great.  she is enthusiastic and is so helpful.  She is willing to sit and chat anytime and she really wants for her students to be as excited as she is.  her classes are not super hard.  a fair grader.  don't skip class though.
2250,132055,4.5,2.0,"She's facetious at times, and plays the fool, but is really good, and kinda sexy"
2251,734171,5.0,2.0,Had a great time in his course (even if it was a bit boring). Took it to get my math requirement out of the way. He is very knowledgeable and caring. Funny guy.
2252,734171,4.0,4.0,"I liked Bivens. He was a very fair professor in every aspect-grading, tests and homework. He is probably the ""lightest"" of the math 112 professors, so I would recommend him. His tests are average, and he is a very nice man. Go to office hours if you need them!!"
2253,734171,4.0,3.0,Bivens is a good lecturer who is very clear and makes sure everyone understands the material before moving on. This class was rather slow paced and the test were more difficult than I expected. Not unreasonable just required remembering everything talked about or read. Easily one of the best math professors.
2254,734171,4.0,2.0,"Funny man who is caring and smart. Easy homework, kind of difficult test. This class was interesting material but a lot of group work."
2255,734171,5.0,1.0,Awesome professor who really likes what he teaches. Very clear in explaining class material and also very helpful outside class. Challenging homework but grades fairly. Made my tuesday thursday 8:15 classes so much fun. Must take again.
2256,734171,3.5,3.0,I am not a math person but Bivens is a great person to take calc 1 from . He elucidates identities with proofs and they become clearer. He is available during office hours and is extremely kind.  
2257,734171,5.0,3.0,Don't mistaken Bivens for a super easy person. He's tough but not as tough as other professors. Bivens is super helpful in and out of class. I've gone to him multiple times for homework help and he'd sit down with me and go through the problems. I also went to him for advice on preparing for his tests and guess what? I aced the following test :)
2258,734171,4.5,2.0,Dr. Bivens is a very clear but boring teacher. He's a really nice guy and very helpful if you go to office hours. The class and tests are very fair and are easy if you take good notes and do the homework.
2259,734171,2.0,5.0,"This was the hardest class I have ever taken at Davidson. And Bivens, though he's very nice, was really unhelpful and I felt like I was drowning all semester."
2260,734171,3.0,3.0,"Class was boring, but the tests weren't too hard. He uses a textbook he wrote so he sometimes had difficulty explaining concepts other ways."
2261,734171,4.5,3.0,Easy to follow. Test are take home and hard but not impossible. Class can sometimes be dry
2262,734171,5.0,1.0,Great professor. You will probably lose a lot of points on Pledged homework but that's because the student grader was harsh. Go see him for extra points and explanation as to what you did wrong. He is much fairer at grading. Tests are very easy if math is your thing. I always over studied and always received a decent grade.
2263,734171,3.5,3.0,"He is the nicest guy, always cheerful and trying to make the class exciting. Tests are take-home and are pretty difficult. Not impossible to do well in, you just have to study. Class is a bit boring and you have to do the homework to understand the material"
2264,734171,5.0,3.0,Dry.  Worth taking the class so you have a set time to nap.  He is very nice and he wrote the book so he knows what he is doing.
2265,734171,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, very passionate about his work. He's always willing to help and loves when students come in."
2266,734171,5.0,3.0,"He is a great, patient, amazing teacher."
2267,734171,4.5,2.0,i love dr. bivens!! great prof. easy class if you have a good math background.
2268,734171,4.0,4.0,Good teacher.  Does a good job of addressing questions with patience.
2269,734172,3.5,3.0,Dr. Case is an outstanding professor who leads discussion well and is a fantastic person and trip leader. Her Study and Treatment of Disease in Zambia course is incredible. Every premed student should apply for the Davidson in Mwandi program - a month in sub-Saharan Africa and then a follow-up seminar make for an unbelievable experience.
2270,734172,5.0,3.0,Fantastic!
2271,734172,4.5,2.0,"best class i've ever taken here. so interesting. time flew by. no tests, no text books. just 2 medium length papers. SO knowledgeable"
2272,734172,3.0,4.0,"A ton of material, presented in a very disorganized fashion, makes you learn in a very oblique, inefficient manner. A very nice woman who knows what's interesting and important and teaches to it. Very poor test constructor (mainly bad wording) Psych majors, be warned: this class is 100% bio (she even confused classical/operant conditioning)."
2273,734172,3.5,3.0,The class was very interesting... but there was so much information being taught that it was overbearing at times... also a major part of the class is the students presenting information that they learned and her questioning them on it... that portion of the class was very boring... the test are extremely long expects detail
2274,734172,4.5,3.0,"I took her for a W course, and she's a really cool lady.  Head of the Bio Dep't too."
2275,734180,2.5,3.0,"Really did not enjoy this class. While she is a perfectly nice professor, I found the material to be rather irrelevant and uninteresting.  Probably one of the biggest regrets of my Davidson career is taking this class."
2276,734180,3.5,4.0,"I loved this class. As a white student, I felt extremely comfortable and respected, even as a minority. Do the readings and come to class ready to contribute quickly and confidently. Dr. Fairley is hilarious, easy-going, liberal, and a hard, hard grader until the end of the semester, at which point, if you worked hard, she will reward you."
2277,734180,2.0,3.0,"I could not stand this class.  As a white student, I felt extremely uncomfortable and disadvantaged.  She cannot spell and writes random, not helpful words on the board, test questions were arbitrary and graded arbitrarily, and you could just tell she didn't care about anything anymore.  Also, what is so exciting out the window&#63;&#63;"
2278,734180,4.0,3.0,"She is GREAT, everything comes from the book or articles so while lessons are helpful just know the readings. Participating will help you specially during fish bowl(circle in which students go in the middle and make a comment,not obligatory). Test are not too hard as long as you have studied and payed attention to the things she saids.She is a COOL"
2279,734180,4.0,4.0,"I took her Social Mov'ts course on Semester at Sea. She's a tough teacher, and she expects you to hold up on your end and do your work. Her exams are challenging, yet fair. But the class was totally worth it. She is always willing to help and wants her students to succeed. I would take it again in a heart beat."
2280,734180,4.5,3.0,Love her!
2281,734180,3.5,4.0,"dont take this class unless you are really interested in the topic. I took it because i heard it was easy, but its not an easy A class by any means. she is really passionate about the class, but if you arent you will be very bored in class."
2282,734180,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Fairley is a trip!  Even if you don't take one of her classes, go meet this woman!  As a professor: She grades harshly at times, as do all Davidson professors.  Both lecture and reading are important on tests.  For the project, focus on making a paper out of it rather than the intricacies of your interviewee."
2283,734180,3.5,3.0,I agree that sometimes her lectures aren't very organized so note taking can be a challenge but tests comes straight from the book.  she is a fair grader and is always willing to work with her students.
2284,734180,3.5,2.0,"she's a professional storyteller- so your notes are more like story than a chronological, logical lecture.  but she's a great person.  plus, her lectures come straight from the books."
2285,734181,4.0,3.0,"Even-keeled and doesn't make you feel dumb for not having prior knowledge on a topic. Doesn't give straight answers- wants you to think for yourself. She has some guiding notes, but class is based on class discussions. No tests, just essays, and all the information you need has been discussed in class. Sometimes takes a long time to return papers."
2286,734181,2.0,4.0,"Dense readings but every class is simply her explaining the readings; absolutely no constructive discussion whatsoever (in a philosophy class!) Takes an eternity to grade papers, so if you didn't do well on the first essay (25% of your grade) and you've already started your second, be prepared to get bad grades on both! Very picky with writing."
2287,734181,3.0,3.0,"Weekly/bi-weekly reading response papers, 3 take home papers; lots of dense reading but she explains it well in class. The lectures can get a bit boring at times but Professor Griffith does a good job of answering questions. She's very approachable and it's really helpful to talk to her during office hours."
2288,734181,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Griffith is great. There's a lot of reading, but it's philosophy, so that's expected. Class discussions are really interesting, and she balances lecture time and discussion time well. Her exams are graded very fairly. If you demonstrate that you understand the material, and provide thoughtful insights, you get full credit. 100% recommend."
2289,734181,5.0,2.0,"I have really enjoyed class under Griffith so far. Her lectures are fairly insightful, she's very mellow, and her class is very manageable even if you arent especially fond of reading. As her strength rests in discussion, Griffiths classes probably depend on the students somewhat, since smart and interested students make for better conversations."
2290,734181,4.0,2.0,"Interesting class if you're actually interested in the subject. I found readings fascinating and class discussions taught me to think in a more abstract manner, which ultimately helps you in just about any class at Davidson. Prof Griffith really tries to get the class engaged, so ask questions and try to answer her questions. Can be a great class."
2291,734181,5.0,3.0,"Griffith is great. She chooses extremely interesting topics and likes to allow students to run discussions. She does not give many little assignments (which I thought was nice) and I never felt overwhelmed by work. Her grading may seem a little arbitrary, but I found that people who worked hard in class generally did well."
2292,734181,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Griffith is great in that she cares a lot about her students; she's not only an incredibly nice teacher but just a wonderful human being in general. Personally not being too fond of philosophy, I found the writing assignments to be difficult and my grade reflected that. However, the discussions are fun and she's a joy to be taught by."
2293,734181,4.0,2.0,"Cares about her students. Everything is take home/papers, and she gives you a total of 72 hours of extensions on papers! Not super work heavy but you will still learn a lot. Fair grader, but you need good philosophy, not just well-written pieces. If you aren't used to writing philosophy, it might take more work to produce a strong paper."
2294,734181,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Griffith was really nice, but timid.  The students in my class would get into off -topic religious arguments that didn't really accomplish anything and she did not seem to have the nerve to tell them to move on.  Papers and tests were turned back late, but she does explain things fairly well."
2295,734181,2.5,4.0,"Dr. Griffith's class was one long lecture - even though discussion based. She wanted to explain but was insufficient and when she asked a question in class and someone answered she didn't really know what to say (very likely answers: ""Uhm, Idk"" or ""I haven't really though about that""). Also her grading criteria are very vague and confusing."
2296,734181,4.0,3.0,I've taken her for many classes. She is nice and her classes aren't very work heavy. But I would recommend meeting with her in office hours a lot because she can be a tough grader and wants specific things. Lectures can be boring but the subject matter is very interesting. I would take Existentialism with her if you need one class. 
2297,734181,4.0,3.0,I've taken her for many classes. She is nice and her classes aren't very work heavy. But I would recommend meeting with her in office hours a lot because she can be a tough grader and wants specific things. Lectures can be boring. 
2298,734181,3.5,4.0,"Griffith is a very nice person but she takes FOREVER to grade papers and exam and I mean, she gave us back our midterms 2 weeks before the final and we didn't get our paper that was due a month before the final even during finals week. Her grading is questionable. Doesn't put a lot of comments so you wonder where the deductions came from."
2299,734181,5.0,5.0,"I had her for several classes.  She is an extremely hard grader and you need to go to class and discuss stuff.  But she's really nice and once you get used to the grading, you can do very well.  I loved every class I had with her because she was so enthusiastic and nice."
2300,734181,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher I've ever had in my education career. She performed very poorly in class discussions and lectures. She graded difficultly without explaining at all what she wanted. Office hours were useless. Also, never have I met someone with less personality. Avoid her at all costs she is a pain and a dent in the GPA."
2301,734181,3.5,1.0,"While somewhat timid and not always clear, Dr. Griffith is a sincere, genuinely sweet individual. Sometimes her grading seems somewhat arbitrary and she takes a while to return assignments. Make sure you take good notes on readings and lectures to cite in your tests (three open-note/book, take-home, not cumulative) and DO the readings. Easy enough!"
2302,734181,3.0,3.0,"nice lady, though very quiet and uncertain.  Knows her stuff, but her lectures are dry and boring.  Easy b or b+ but anything else if  extremely hard to come by (told us the first day of class she doesnt give A's-guess what; she doesnt)"
2303,734181,2.5,3.0,"Dr. Griffith is a very nice woman, but her role as Humanities discussion leader was the definition of mediocre. She is soft-spoken and neither made substantive contribution to the class nor channeled healthy class discussion. Considering her low-key class environment, she graded pretty hard. Her lectures were informative, but few."
2304,734181,4.5,2.0,"Best class at Davidson thus far. I'm not a strong writer but still managed to do well in this class. Subject material very interesting. Lectures did get somewhat repetitive, but that repetitiveness actually makes it so that the concepts are easy to understand. Be patient and you'll get a good grade. Highly recommended."
2305,734181,1.0,3.0,"She was boring and I fell asleep almost every day.  She wasn't clear and didn't help me at all when I visited her.  I had a paper to do and she said it was really good, but then gave me a C+."
2306,734181,5.0,3.0,"She is a great prof for introductory philosophy, very helpful and explains concepts in great detail.  As long as you go to class and take notes, you will have no trouble at all.  She is very nice and grades fairly.  I recommend this class for those with no previous philosophy experience."
2307,734181,3.0,3.0,"She's very nice, almost too nice.  If you go see her, she won't look you in the eye if she disagrees (kinda irritating).  It was an 8:30 T/TH, which didn't help.  Class discussions were as lively as you might expect that early.  I didn't think her grading matched her personality in the classroom, so it was a bit harsher than expected."
2308,734181,5.0,1.0,"very easy class, she even cut some stuff out of the syllabus which was nice. she does a great job explaining stuff."
2309,734182,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Hay was a wonderful professor. Yes, her class was difficult and yes it required a lot of effort (guess what, its biochem), but she always made an effort to make sure the class understood as a whole. She will be missed!"
2310,734182,2.5,3.0,"Dr. Hay made learning about plants a little more interesting than I imagined. It's not as easy as it looks, but if you need help, she is willing to be there if you ask."
2311,734182,2.5,5.0,"This class is ridiculous!  DO NOT TAKE IT!  She is way too hard, asks obscure questions on tests that we mentioned once in class, and then mocked our class for not doing well on the quizzes.  Her questions don't try to test your knowledge, they try to confuse you...  If you need to get your lab science out of the way, don't take this class."
2312,734182,3.5,3.0,"Hard to make botany that interesting- but Dr. Hay does try, frequently brings things to pass around the classroom. VERY picky grader, some answers on tests are expected to be unreasonably detailed. Easy short papers boost your grade. Lab is boring but simple."
2313,734182,2.0,4.0,"not that biochem is that hard, but she just makes everything so boring."
2314,734182,4.0,5.0,"This course is no joke!  Tests are hard (what did you expect&#63;) and require lots of detailed learning.  Most of it is memorization of biochemical cycles -- a prelude to medical school for those going in that direction, and probably nearly as difficult.  Labs are easier, but your lab reports need to be journal quality."

2316,734184,4.0,2.0,"Fun, chill class where you basically watch a movie once a week and analyze it. Learn about different film techniques to build on our vocabulary and ability to analyze. Such a sweetheart!"
2317,734184,5.0,3.0,The most caring and kind-hearted professor you'll ever meet. She genuinely cares for her students and creates a safe environment for meaningful dialogue. She's extremely well-versed in the course she was teaching and only wish I could take more classes with her.
2318,734184,5.0,3.0,Holy mother of God I love this woman. Please take a class with her she is so nice and knowledgable. I wish I were taking German so I could take another class with her. Intro to film is great and pretty easy.
2319,734184,5.0,4.0,"Dr. McCarthy is extremely intelligent and cordial. In her class, we learned how to analyze the technical aspects of film with great detail. Everything you learn will influence how you see film in the future. Beware: this class is not an easy A."
2320,734184,5.0,3.0,"Prof. McCarthy is fantastic. She knows so much about film I couldn't believe she was primarily a German professor. She is extremely likable and sweet, and though she grades pretty tough, she is reasonable regarding work load. The movies were fun and engaging and she made class breeze by. If you need an art credit or like film at all, take this!!"
2321,734184,5.0,1.0,"Prof McCarthy is an awesome professor. She makes german very simple and fun to learn. She's very understanding, gives a lot of extra credits, and helps to tailor grading to benefit her students. TAKE HER CLASS!!"
2322,734184,5.0,1.0,"The best professor i've had so far in Davidson. So awesome, understanding and extremely helpful. Class is easy and she gives a lot of extra credits. Definitely take!!"
2323,734184,5.0,4.0,Even if you have no interest in German or film...try to find time to fit this lady in!  She will change your world.
2324,734184,4.0,2.0,"Nice and pretty spunky. Reigns over a fairly relaxed environment but still gets the class going. Vocab almost every day with grammar work most nights. She is what I imagined a college professor would look like. Some didn't like her, but that's more because they didn't want to be there. If you like German, she's a very reasonable, good professor."
2325,734184,4.0,2.0,"Dr. McCarthy is fantastic!  She really cares about her students, and most of the films she chooses for class are worthwhile.  Her interpretations of these films are sometimes a bit strange and unlikely, but she's a fantastic teacher who truly listens to students' opinions, even those that differ from her own. Not easy to find a prof who does that!"
2326,734184,3.5,2.0,"It's kind of creepy how involved in our personal lives she tried to be, but otherwise she's really sweet. Lots of hard grammar on the tests when all we did in class was chat. Also lots of extra credit opportunities."
2327,734184,5.0,2.0,"truly seemed passionate about what she teaches.  she offered her own original insight into the books or movies we were working on and encouraged us to create our own prompts for writing assignments.  if you put in enough effort and go to see her for help, the class is pretty easy and interesting (especially compared to some other W-courses)"

2329,734185,3.0,3.0,"The class wasnt that bad; if you pay attention to the lectures, youll pass the essays. Though he can be slightly confusing, hes very accommodating &amp; accessible outside of class. Readings werent necessarily mandatory. If youre only taking for credit/not into philosophy, the class might be boring. Hes a tough grader, but I found it rewarding."
2330,734185,3.0,1.0,Easiest class I had all semester. Reading is all of the homework and not needed at all. Take good notes and papers will be manageable. Grade is a few completion assignments and 3 papers. Gives weak feedback and has no set office hours.
2331,734185,2.0,3.0,"Ethics was full of extremely dull, boring lectures. However, the readings are not mandatory so I had little work. The papers are difficult though so it's important to pay attention and take notes."
2332,734185,2.0,3.0,This class was incredibly boring. The prof just went on and on and on and I felt like I never really learned anything. He was also a super tough grader with no instruction. Would not reccomend.
2333,734185,1.0,3.0,"Taking McKeever's class was the worst decision of my life. The subject was not interesting, the lecture's weren't engaging, and the grades he gave me were unfair and not reflective of the effort and time I put in. DO NOT TAKE"
2334,734185,3.0,2.0,"Wasn't that bad. Easy A-, minimal homework (1-2 hours a week at most), just listen to the lectures and the tests are fine. No surprises"
2335,734185,3.0,2.0,"Despite his reputation, Dr. McKeever's Writing 101 isn't actually that bad. There's a lot of tedious reading but he is helpful in class and office hours. There aren't that many assignments and although the lectures are long, he makes them bearable."
2336,734185,1.0,5.0,Didn't like
2337,734185,3.0,2.0,A very caring professor.
2338,734185,2.0,2.0,"McKeever is a super unclear and boring lecturer. However, he is a really nice guy and great in office hours. Go to class to pass, go to office hours to actually learn the material. Can be a bit unclear on grading expectations but it is pretty easy to do well."
2339,734185,3.0,3.0,"Dr. McKeever is a great person, but not a great discussion leader. In a seminar format, this presents an obvious problem. Discussions were loaded with content, but not much clarity, and often ended in awkward silence. I seemed to be one of only a few people who didn't hate the class."
2340,734185,2.5,3.0,"Dr. McKeever is a great person, but not so much a discussion leader. In the case of a seminar, this creates a problem. Discussions often seemed to go in circles and end up in awkward pauses."
2341,734185,2.0,3.0,"I signed up for a writing 101 class. It ended up being a philosophy class. The material was dry and writing the papers was like pulling teeth. He may be good for a philosophy class, but would not take him for writing and do not plan on taking a class of his again. "
2342,734185,1.5,2.0,Very scattered during lectures and unhelpful.  Did not have to attend class to get a decent grade.
2343,734185,2.0,4.0,Env Ethics was moderately interesting but his tests were so hard. He was looking for vague yet really specifically vague answers. His explanations of the questions didn't help either.
2344,734185,1.0,5.0,I took his writing class and it was literally the worst class I have ever taken! He is boring and a ridiculously negative grader.  The worst part is he never actually helps you improve the things he marked off for. And forget asking him questions because you'll confuse him! AVOID HIM!!!
2345,734185,2.0,2.0,The class material was either ridiculously confusing or very interesting. Dr. McKeever seemed to have a real passion for the material but was a dull lecturer and went off on too many tangents. The tests were pretty easy but all in all the class was pretty mediocre.
2346,734185,1.5,3.0,"Very boring. I could find myself looking at The professor and realizing I had been distracted for like 10 minutes. The class is usually just going over the readings, many awkward silences, and a test/paper due every now and then. Office hours are not helpful and the material seems kind of pointless. I'd say avoid."
2347,734185,2.5,2.0,"I took his Luck and Chance class as well.  He's a very nice person and has a good attitude.  That being said, however, discussions ALWAYS fell flat. He asks questions to an awkward silence.  I didn't do anything in this class besides write the papers.  The material was complex and extremely dull.  The class wasn't great, but I like him as a person."
2348,734185,1.0,4.0,"Luck and Chance was potentially the worst class I've ever taken in my career as a student... Painful is how I would describe it.  I've learned nothing about writing, he never completes his ideas and the subject material is so random that its irrelevant to luck and chance. He's also a very negative grader/commentor on papers. Don't take it."
2349,734185,1.5,3.0,took his Luck and Chance class....just plain terrible. DONT TAKE HIM. plus he wears pants that are WAY. TOO. TIGHT. not cool. He cant finish sentences and thoughts worth a crap.
2350,734185,1.0,4.0,"I do not recommend taking Dr. McKeever's class. His lectures were incredibly dull, and even though I paid attention and did all the reading, it didn't seem to pay off when it came to tests and papers. I was frustrated throughout the semester about his somewhat random grading system."
2351,734185,2.0,4.0,"I took this class to fulfill my philosophy requirement, and I absolutely regret it.  The lectures were very, very boring and difficult to follow. The grading was seemingly random. Though I worked very hard in this class, my efforts rarely paid off."
2352,734185,4.5,2.0,"He's very nice and friendly, but boy oh boy are his lectures boring. He explains things well though, and is not a tough grader. All the take home tests he gave were open note, open book in the Ethics class. :) I wouldn't take this again because of boredom, but it's not terribly hard or even reading intensive (readings for every other class)."
2353,734185,2.5,2.0,"Very easy class! Grades fairly and his reviews are mostly take home. Class discussions were very boring, but overall and easy course."
2354,734185,4.0,4.0,"Good at leading discussions.  Really, really, really nice guy, and very understanding."
2355,734185,2.0,3.0,"He is a nice enough person, but a useless professor.  He is unclear and the order of his lectures is nonsensical.  His explanations tend to be rambling and indirect.  &quot;Explicit&quot; is not in his vocabulary.  Avoid him like the plague.  If you are a philosophy genius and don't need much help or explanations, he probably wouldn't be too bad."
2356,734185,1.5,4.0,"Dr. McKeever is definitely among the most boring professors I've had.  He is also not very helpful at all.  His office hours are infrequent and he gives only brief and sometimes indirect answers to questions.  His grading makes very little sense.  I got an A on one paper on which I worked very hard, but a D on another which I thought was better."
2357,734185,4.0,3.0,"Pretty nice guy. Discussions in the class were honestly kinda dumb, but I enjoyed them. If you want a pretty good grade, you have to put some effort into the writing."
2358,734185,2.5,5.0,So boring. He's incredibly nice but grades terribly hard. Not very helpful during office hours (of which he has only a few). The course itself is frustrating and he definitely does not help make it any better. I don't recommend taking this course to anyone.
2359,734185,2.5,4.0,"Nice professor, but the readings are very boring unless you're incredibly into philosophy. Not a great idea for an intro-level class. The lectures are rather dry, not a lot of class discussion, and a hard grader."
2360,734185,1.5,4.0,"Class=semi-interesting. Rambles and stutters. Gives the grade you get on 1st paper on all subsequent papers. When I questioned a grade and asked how to improve, he was dumbfounded and did'nt have any suggestions. Slightly a push-over. A frustrating but good intentioned man. Should not be a teacher. Few office hours. Don't recommend but don't avoid"
2361,734185,3.0,4.0,"Time stops in this man's class.  The book is very interesting, but he is not.  Very hard grader.  By the third week everyone was sitting in the back of the class."
2362,734185,4.0,2.0,"The professor has more experience teaching ethics (PHI 215) than he does political philosophy (220), and it shows. He would often ramble when presenting key arguments, objections, etc., without writing anything on the board, and would thereby under-emphasize important material. But he is improving and is more than willing to provide outside help."
2363,734185,4.0,2.0,A straightforward class. Professor knows his field (ethics) well and is friendly and easy-going.
2364,734185,2.5,2.0,"Kind of a push-over; draws really good stick figures sometimes.  If you demonstrate that you have done the reading at least once a week, you will get on his good side and grades will come easily."
2365,734186,4.5,2.0,"GREAT PROFESSOR! He is knowledgeable about international politics and could talk about it all day. Be sure to keep up on the news (NY Times, Economist). Tests were fair. One of Davidson's best!"
2366,734186,4.5,4.0,"He is my new favorite professor.  I adored this class and learned constantly.  He's fun to chat with and will talk to you for hours.  Really interesting material, and he's a fair grader.  One of the few Davidson professors who will curve bad grades hehe"
2367,734186,4.0,4.0,"Ortmayer is PHENOMENAL! yes, the reading is intense. yes, he isnt the fastest grader in the world. but everything works out! lectures are FUN and interesting...this man knows everything and is a GREAT resource. talk to him outside of class about absolutely anything. the midterm is everything!!"
2368,734186,4.0,3.0,"At first I was overwhelmed because I had no idea what he was asking of us, but over the weeks I got used to his unique style and came to love his class.  He's a very smart man who can teach you a lot.  Don't be intimidated by his unique style- it will all sort out in the end.  TAKE HIS CLASS!"
2369,734186,3.5,2.0,"Politics in film, new class at Davidson Spring 07. Has a lot of kinks to work out. Not much work throughout semester, but SO MUCH AT THE END. Fairly easy grader, but takes FOREVER to get your stuff back.  Lectures interesting but unfocused.  Knows a lot, but easily loses track.  Don't worry about the #...anyone can take this class, even non-majors."
2370,734186,2.5,2.0,"Interesting speaker, though he rambles like no other. It's always on topic but rarely very focused. He seems like a nice guy, though he isn't entirely welcoming to students to come speak with him. I've never talked to him outside of class but probably should have. Reading is ridiculous, lots. Gotta keep up with the new too...big deal for him."
2371,734186,4.0,3.0,"If you like getting papers back fairly quickly or a firm structure, don't take his class.  We got our midterms back the day before reading day.  That said, he's very congenial and knows what he's talking about, and isn't afraid to have a little fun with the class."
2372,734186,3.0,3.0,No Comments
2373,734186,3.0,3.0,"Ortmayer really knows his stuff but has problems focusing in class. we got our first graded paper back the LAST days of class! and the amnt of reading is ridiculous. Go see him outside of class tho, ull b amazed! hes funny and extremely interesting! ask him about his time at yale with bush."

2375,734190,4.0,3.0,she's awesome and I didn't even like art before I took this class.
2376,734190,3.0,5.0,This was a very difficult class. Read that again. The analysis that was expected of students was not fair. Serebrennikov is a quiet and kind of terrifying lady. She always looks like she's silently judging you.
2377,734190,2.0,4.0,"The topic of the class is very interesting and Dr. Serebrennikov is very knowledgeable. That being said, the class is very very difficult, especially for non-majors. There is lots of reading and memorization and a 14 page paper at the end, in addition to a cumulative final. Would not recommend taking this class just to meet a requirement."
2378,734190,2.0,4.0,"I would not recommend this class for a non art history major. The topic of gender was very interesting, but the class is very hard. There is 14 page essay at the end of the semester + final (includes another in-class essay). Plus, every test consists on memorizing about 90 paintings and it is reading heavy. Also, her tone of voice is very low."
2379,734190,3.0,5.0,"If you're not an art history major, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. There's a 14 page paper due at the end of the course AND a cumulative final. I'm terrified to speak to her outside class and she speaks so quietly and monotone that you expend all your energy trying to hear her instead of learning the material. Cool topic, not a good class. BEWARE ART222!!"
2380,734190,5.0,4.0,"Incredible professor. Opened me to a whole new world via art history. She is always prepared for class and does a great job. Yes, you have to study for her tests which includes memorizing dates and names, but it's well worth it."
2381,734190,4.0,4.0,A very knowledgeable and passionate professor. She loves teaching art history and you can easily tell by the way she gives her lectures. You will need to work very hard for an A.
2382,734190,3.5,4.0,"A lot of info to memorize. Like, a lot a lot. Loved being in the classroom and listening to her lectures, wanted to die when it came down to studying tests. Start studying early if you want at least a B. Took as a first semester freshman and it was pretty discouraging as far as expectations for an easy art credit goes."
2383,734190,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Serebrennikov provided a great overview on gender & art. Art classes can be tough due to large quantities of info, but she is super clear in lecture and grades reviews fairly. I would definitely recommend taking this class."
2384,734190,4.5,3.0,"Great class, fair grader."
2385,734190,4.0,4.0,This was my favorite class my first semester at Davidson. She is extremely knowledgeable and I loved listening to her lectures. Be sure to pay close attention to exactly what she says in class and you won't even need to look at the text book! She was more than happy to meet outside of class to discuss papers and made an effort to get to know me!
2386,734190,5.0,5.0,Phenominal teacher!
2387,734190,4.5,3.0,AMAZING CLASS!!Learned A LOT. Very interesting and the lectures were never boring.  She knows A LOT about this subject and may seem intimidating but is helpful if you ask. DO THE READING. She will know if you don't b/c the class is small and you will get asked questions. Grades very fairly and expects hard work. MY FAVORITE class at Davidson.
2388,734190,2.5,5.0,"RUN FOR YOU LIFE!!!!! seriously unless you want to be an art major and you absolutely love reading about art and its history and all its little intricate details, do not take her class. she is so freaking intimidating and hardcore and assigns an INSANE amount of reading in the textbook. i legit wanted to die. i also fell asleep in her class a lot."
2389,734190,3.5,4.0,"Nina is tough, so don't think you can get away with anything.  She is very fair with the slides she chooses for tests as well as grading.  She is not very approachable, so be professional when you meet with her.  ALWAYS confirm appointments and be punctual and prepared."
2390,734190,3.0,4.0,"&quot;intimidating&quot; doesn't begin to describe her.  but she definitely knows her stuff.  be sure to drink coffee before class: her monotone voice, comfy vac chairs, and a dark room is a recipe for sleep."
2391,734190,3.5,4.0,She seems a bit wacky sometimes but out of the millions of slides there was only one image she hadnt seen live. shes tough tho. expect to put in long hrs for Bs and dont try getting away without knowing ur stuff. u will learn A LOT!! but shell warn u herself not to take her class just to fulfill the requirement
2392,734192,2.5,2.0,"Ping is the man. His class is very interesting. All you do is watch movies and read books about detectives. I only read 2 of the 15 &quot;required books&quot; and I got a B+. Only grades you have are two papers: a midterm and final, neither of which pertain to the novels. Great class to take for a GPA booster."
2393,734192,2.5,3.0,"I took his Martial arts/heroism class and have mixed feelings about it. He tries hard as a prof, but his class to me was a jumble of completely random information with no organization. He has a slight stutter when he teaches which can make it hard to focus. I have absolutely no clue how I got the grade I did b/c I understood nothing in his class."
2394,734192,5.0,3.0,"Class is easy I guess. We only had one midterm so I'm not sure what to say about his grading. Lots of reading, but if you space it out it's manageable. Pretty lax class, he is very flexible but you should know your stuff for tests (since there are only two)."
2395,734192,4.0,3.0,"He's ridiculously helpful, and even if class time isn't utilized to it's full potential all the time, he goes way out of the way to make himself available.  By far the most flexible professor I've had at Davidson.  He deserves a lot of credit for teaching so much language, when it's really not his specialization."
2396,734192,4.0,4.0,No Comments
2397,734192,4.5,2.0,"very helpful, and an expert on chinese religion. language classes are taught very logically, but flexibly. he makes it as easy as possible to do well and learn if you're really interested. as for heroism in film and fiction, it's not just watching movies. there's a lot of reading that you MUST do. but it's a fun class that's not too hard."
2398,734192,5.0,1.0,"very clear about class expectations.  accomodates to students schedules and workloads- you can negotiate test dates, oral tests, homework assignments, etc... he wants everyone to do well- as long as you are interested in the class, you should do fine."
2399,734194,3.0,2.0,"Really cool prof, took my first French class with her. Surprisingly very funny and creative!"
2400,734194,4.5,3.0,I love Dr. Slawy-Sutton. Very caring and extremely helpful during office hours. Not the easiest in the French Dept. but highly recommended.
2401,734194,3.0,3.0,"Phew. Nasty shock after Jacobus's 103 in terms of grading. Not quite as stimulating, either. And I don't feel like I got to speak as much French. But she is a very nice woman, she's French so obviously she knows her stuff, she mixes up the activities to keep things interesting, and if you do the prescribed work, you will make an A. Give it your all"
2402,734194,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Slawy-Sutton is a great professor and extremely clear and helpful.  She has high expectations for work and doesn't give away grades, but is always willing to help and grades fairly."
2403,734194,5.0,3.0,Sweetest professor ever.  Kind of acts like a kindergarten teacher but she's really a good professor.  I only had her for 101 my freshman year and she remembered me for all four years.
2404,734194,4.5,4.0,"Slawy-Sutton is one of the nicest professors I've had yet. She is extremely helpful and really wants you to understand the material. She is always available for help outside of class- take advantage of her help! Her class is a bit tough, make sure you study. But, she is a GREAT professor and is actually French so she knows what she's doin! :)"
2405,734194,4.0,2.0,"She's quite nice- just don't miss too many classes and forget being able to tell what's due by what's on the syllabus. Be prepared to work on things you will never look over and be surprised at things you apparently should have done. But overall, a good class, never boring, interactive, she shows you videos and songs that keep things fresh and new."
2406,734194,4.5,2.0,No Comments
2407,734195,4.0,5.0,"If I could, I would give the easiness on this course a negative 6. I took the class partially out of interest, but mostly to satisfy my Fine Arts, and it was an absolute chore to prepare for tests. He also grades in incredibly nitpicky fashion. If you aren't already well versed in music/prepared to invest yourself heavily in the course, skip this."
2408,734195,4.5,4.0,"As with any Davidson class, you need to devote lots of time to this one -- and not 2 days before the test!  Listening is by far the hardest section on each test, so devote more time to that than memorization of other stuff.  Ray is very approachable and will always answer questions.  Get to know him if you haven't already."
2409,734195,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sprague is one of the best professors I've ever had.  He is an incredible lecturer and his class is fascinating.  It is memorization-heavy for the reviews, but the classes are worth it.  My favorite class this semester, by far."
2410,734195,4.5,3.0,"Ray's lectures are really fascinating because he is so excited about his field and also because he integrates musical examples into every class. A bit quirky and eccentric, but it's endearing rather than irritating. His tests tend to be pretty difficult, especialy if you don't study. Do the required listenings early and memorize them!"
2411,648181,5.0,3.0,"He is a great teacher who genuinely cares about his students. The most interesting course I ever took at Davidson was his Vietnam course. He loves it when students show interest and is delighted to help them learn more. Papers are graded lightly, tests are more difficult."
2412,648181,5.0,2.0,Dr. Levering loves working with students.  He is such a lovely man and is always willing to help.  Not a difficult grader. Allows for a lot of class discussion.  Good for non-history majors and history majors alike.
2413,648181,2.5,4.0,"I took this class because I wanted a stronger background in US History. From the text, I got that. He's a nice guy, but his lectures are scattered and dull, he uses a very much dated edition of the text, and he takes pride in giving very little partial credit on the tests.  I studied the text for 12-24 hours to prepare for tests...to make low B's."
2414,648181,5.0,4.0,"His lectures range from uninteresting to painful, but he allows for tons of class discussion and guest speakers. He is also an adorable man, a fair grader, is almost always available, and a lightning fast grader. Highly recommended."
2415,648181,4.0,3.0,"He's a really nice guy, lectures get boring but he tries to mix things up sometimes with debates and small group discussions.  Relatively little work for a history class, only had 1 paper.  He's helpful outside of class too.  Doesn't grade too hard either.  Good class."
2416,648181,4.5,2.0,"A kind man who really wants his students to succeed.  GREAT introductory course for freshmen, eases you into college level history."
2417,648181,4.0,3.0,"Not the best lecturer, but the discussion sections are helpful, and he loves working with students."
2418,648181,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Levering is a great guy.  The 60s class is really interesting, but be ready to read, write, and research alot!  You will become very familiar with the library's resources, but your hard work will pay off in the end."
2419,648181,3.5,2.0,"Dr. Levering has a pretty old-fashioned approach, but he is a great resource if you take advantage of it. Small group periods made this class enjoyable, don't miss them."
2420,648181,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Levering is really knowledgeable, but the lectures are very broad. Basically all of the learning comes from the readings. He puts a lot of pressure on students to participate, so if you're the talkative kind you'll do great in his class. Overall, Levering is a really nice man and a pretty good teacher."
2421,648181,4.5,4.0,"I second the Vietnam class.  If you want to take an upper level HIS course-take this one.  You have Vietnam Veterans speak to you weekly, assignments aren't bad, and the texts are ultra-interesting!"
2422,648181,5.0,3.0,Vietnam class is one of the best classes you can take at Davidson. Place it first on Web tree.
2423,734197,1.0,5.0,"Taking this class was the worst decision I ever made. The content is incredibly confusing, and he is not helpful in making it any easier to understand. In office hours, he comes across as judgmental and intimidating. It always felt embarrassing to ask questions. He doesn't offer extra credit &amp; even has a question on a test he said most people miss."
2424,734197,5.0,3.0,"Studtmann is spectacular. His classes are engaging and the homework load is relatively light. While he is a harsh grader on papers, he allows for revision which he grades much more favorably and replaces the original grade. I liked his class bc while he still did help us better formulate our writing, he also taught it like a PHIL class"
2425,734197,4.0,5.0,"As a person Studman is awesome- chill, funny, engaging. As a professor, he is a bit scary. The class was very interesting but the papers were very nervewracking. He is a hard grader and is upfront about it, but the class really can go either way depending on what you choose to write about."
2426,734197,3.0,4.0,"I took his Sex, Love, and Friendship course. Low stress 80% of the time but he definitely makes you work for your grade on the two argumentative analysis papers. He emphasizes the revision process and thus has you turn in both papers twice, once before revisions and once after. I have honestly never put as much thought into a paper until this class"
2427,734197,4.0,2.0,"The man is a chiller. &quot;Who here liked smoking cigarettes the first time they smoked?&quot; (One person raises their hand) &quot;You, my friend, were born to smoke.&quot; He's pretty light on hwabout 7 pages between classes. Needless to say, Studtmann doesn't give a. I love it."
2428,734197,4.0,3.0,"Anarchism and Statism is an interesting class: the readings are relevant to class content, and they are fun. HOWEVER, the class discussion can be really deviating from the discussion if you focus too much on a detail--which does happen, but sometimes the professor has a hard time to find the way back. Good class but can be extremely disorganized."
2429,734197,5.0,2.0,It has been said before and will be said again: Studtmann is the man. He cares more about getting students to think for themselves than a traditional academic curriculum usually entails. He explains concepts well and has great knowledge on the subjects that he teaches. If you want to learn and be minimally stressed about grades he's your guy.
2430,734197,5.0,2.0,"Overall great guy. He is very causal, but still receives a lot of respect. I will definitely take more of his classes. He is in his office a lot, and his office hours are great. The homework isn't mandatory, but is a must for passing. The subject material is difficult, but I feel he makes it as easy as anyone could. "
2431,734197,3.0,1.0,Studtmann is a chiller. Knows his stuff and doesn't try to screw you over. Lectures are basic outlines of the readings which he puts online. Tests aren't bad at all. And he's always willing to cancel class for a nice day.
2432,734197,4.0,2.0,"He is clear, helpful and overall a great teacher."
2433,734197,1.5,4.0,"Apparently he used to be great...well, not anymore.  Metaphysics was actually painful, not because the information was boring, but because he didn't want to be there and neither did anyone else (attendance was always low).  Also, his notes still say that Bush is president.  He does not show up to his own ""office hours"" or expect to help anyone."
2434,734197,2.5,2.0,"Took his Sex, Love, & Friendship writing course. Studtmann provided a laid-back, stress-free atmosphere even when we had papers to write. Generous with allowing students to re-write papers for better grades. Learned interesting topics (all relating to sex, no love & friendship) about which he tried to facilitate discussion."
2435,734197,2.0,2.0,He's apparently lost his passion for teaching. The reviews will cover exactly what is discussed in class and require little critical thinking. his class is very lecture oriented and there is little room for student discussion. He goes off topic often and he seems constantly disappointed with students' levels of understanding.
2436,734197,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Studtmann is brilliant and seems genuinely interested in everything. I have had him in 4 classes (I'm a major) and have loved all of them. He isn't easy, but is very helpful if you just ask.  I make it a point to go to his office hours as regularly as I can whether or not I actually need help because he is so interesting to talk to. Take him."
2437,734197,5.0,5.0,Studtmann is an excellent teacher who is engaging and quite witty. He explains things thoroughly and uses entertaining examples. Not only is he stimulating as a professor but he is also stimulating as a person. Let his name speak for itself.
2438,734197,2.5,4.0,"Studtmann is not the easiest, but he makes his class as interesting as possible. You don't have to go to class every day, but when you don't go you miss more that you might need for his somewhat brutal tests."
2439,734197,3.5,2.0,"I had him for Sex, Love and Friendship. I'd really recommend the class. It's really easy - not much work and very interesting because you just talk about sex issues the whole time. You write a paper every couple weeks and have peer responses. (during peer responses you only have to go to class one day that week)and then you can always redo a paper"
2440,734197,4.5,4.0,"I had him for Philosophy of Mathematics, which I would not recommend for non-majors (unless you're a math major).  This was the best class I've ever taken, and he was fabulous."
2441,734197,5.0,4.0,"This was a hard class but he was very helpful.  Attendance isn't required but if you go every day, you'll do better.  Go to office hours because he works really hard to help you understand everything."
2442,734197,5.0,3.0,"Fabulous professor, highly recommende"
2443,734197,4.5,3.0,"I think he is an amazing, warm, engaging, wonderful teacher.  He brings life to his subject and can be quite funny."
2444,734197,5.0,3.0,I met this Professor in Christchurch New Zealand and although he was not one of my own lecturers I must have been one of the lucky ones who got to see his engaging side.  He taught me well on many philosophical matters and initiated a true passion within for philosophy.  It is a shame that his humour is kept hidden in class.
2445,734197,3.5,3.0,"I took both PHI 200 and PHI 216 with Dr. Studtmann.  He is off-putting to many students, because his lectures are not engaging.  However, although he is not great in front of a lot of people, he is wonderful one-on-one.  Go to his office hours.  Talk to him and you'll find him a warm, funny guy and he'll be able to explain the material completely."
2446,734197,3.5,3.0,"I have taken two classes with him - he isn't the most exciting professor, but I liked him. The only grades come from the tests, which I found easy as long as I did the reading. If you arent into philosophy as it is you probably won't like him all that much tho"
2447,734197,1.5,4.0,No Comments
2448,734197,1.0,4.0,attendance is unnecessary: notes are taken/read straight from blackboard.  and forget about asking for help if you're confused; that's pretty much useless.  there are only two words to describe him: STRANGE and AWKWARD
2449,734200,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Vaz's seminar classes are really well organized and executed. You get exactly what the syllabus says you will get, with the addition of her removing things to cut down on your workload. She always gives great feedback on papers and is very accessible to meet with. She is the only professor I have actually enjoyed online classes with."
2450,734200,4.0,4.0,She is by far my favorite professor at Davidson! I HATED English coming to college and she made this my favorite class of the semester. We wrote two papers and read a reasonable amount every day before class. Classes were facilitated discussions and they were very enjoyable. Take her class if you love to talk or participate.
2451,734200,5.0,4.0,"I've taken two classes with her, and both are discussion based. She is a very good facilitator of discussion and really enjoys individuality (new ideas). She is also very fun and likes cracking jokes in class. She is very accessible and will reply to your email even at 10pm. She is a bit of tough grader, though."
2452,734200,5.0,3.0,"This is my first class with Professor Vaz, but she is really amazing. She is really kind and very accessible out of class. She is really helpful with papers and is just a fun person to talk to in general. Classes are discussion based with some fun jokes. I highly recommend her !"
2453,734200,4.0,3.0,"Prof Vaz is so funny. She loves to tease everyone in a light-hearted way and when students play along and return the light jabs. Every class is a close reading of a text you read before class. The readings are pretty long, and you can get away with only reading parts of them, but they show up on reviews. Notes during class are needed to do well."
2454,734200,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Vaz was incredibly kind and insightful.  Brit Lit was very much discussion based, and always interesting.  She is a bit of a tough grader though, and I found the tests quite difficult."
2455,734200,4.0,5.0,"I liked my lit and medicine class with Vaz, but I found some of the texts that we read were very dry, and sometimes unrelated to the course topic. Vaz is a really nice professor. Her tests were hard but not if you studied and read the texts. She is a tough grader on papers, and it can be unclear what she expects all the time."
2456,734200,5.0,4.0,"I'm not a huge English fan, but OHV made English somewhat enjoyable for me. She was very helpful in office hours (USE THEM) and always wanted to help with papers. Her tests are very tough, but overall it's a manageable class."
2457,734200,4.5,4.0,"OV is a quirky but super friendly and really wants to get to know you! I never received an A from her but she grades fairly, and I learned a lot. I took Writing Medicine with her, and the class was discussion-based.  She was sincere and helpful in office hours and also very welcome to write you a recommendation letter. Highly recommend!"
2458,734200,4.5,2.0,"OVH is the best. Literature in Medicine was one of my all time favorite classes at Davidson, and though she is more methodical about an English class and less abstract than some might expect, she uses really interesting articles and texts. Her tests are hard, but she's truly worth getting to know!"
2459,734200,5.0,3.0,Class was entertaining and she is very helpful. Fair grader. I would recommend taking her class if you have the chance.
2460,734200,4.5,3.0,"She has been my favorite professor! She makes class fun and interesting while still teaching us. She is a tough grader, but I feel like I have developed into a better writer!"
2461,734200,3.0,5.0,Teaches English like a Math class. Tests are awful. Knowledgeable.
2462,734200,5.0,2.0,"OVH is one of the best and nicest professors at Davidson.  I took Literature and Medicine, and it was one of my favorite classes at Davidson. As many have said, definitely go to office hours.  It will greatly help you and improve your grade. Recommended for major and non-majors alike! Fair grader."
2463,734200,5.0,4.0,"OVH will change the way you see the world, and the way you see yourself. She grades critically, but if you want to gorge your intellectual appetite, OVH is the best chef in town. Generous and genuine, hilarious and down to earth, she's the treasure of the English department who can magically transform cringe-worthy subjects into rare delicacies."
2464,734200,4.0,4.0,"Before joining this class, I was genuinely interested in the course material (Med and Lit). OVH has consistently dealt out C's and low B's in the class. It's true that her lectures are good, but smart people are getting horrible grades. Please do not take this class and make the same mistake I did."
2465,734200,5.0,2.0,"One of the nicest professors at Davidson, and she knows how to keep a class interesting, even for non-majors.  You MUST visit her during office hours in order to do well, though.  I highly recommend her Literature and Medicine course."
2466,734200,4.5,4.0,"She is an adorable, fun, intelligent professor! It's true that she can be an extremely tough grader, so you can't slack at all. Definitely visit her during office hours- not only does she expect you to, it will help you immensely. She is very bright and fun during lectures so it's easy to stay focused, even though the material was a bit boring."
2467,734200,5.0,3.0,"I LOVED this class (Med Ethics & Tech W).  OVH is by far my favorite professor!  She initially comes off as tough and grades her first assignment critically, but over time, you get the sense she is loosening a bit and giving you credit.  My writing improved significantly by following her guidelines.  Delightful sense of humor.  So sweet!"
2468,734200,5.0,3.0,"Definitely my favorite class! Vaz-Hooper is an excellent teacher, very funny and silly! The discussions were great, and the reading material was interesting. If you're thinking about being an English major and Vaz-Hooper is teaching 220, take it! The class cemented my intentions of becoming an English major."
2469,734200,4.5,5.0,"She is an extremely tough grader but you will learn how to write better in her class. If you get stuck in her class don't worry. Go to her office hours and you will be fine. It took me half the semester to realize that, but once i did I started pulling off much better grades. All-in-all, she is a TOUGH grader but you WILL learn."
2470,734200,3.5,5.0,"I am NOT an English major. just took the class for fun. Lecture and discussion was interesting and quite funny at times, but she grades VERY HARD on tests and papers. I received some of my worst grades ever in this class. If you aren't an english major PASS/FAIL!!!!!!"
2471,734200,4.0,5.0,"Extremely friendly and pleasant.  Class is fun and enjoyable, usually because of her strange but amusing comments (one of her favorites is, &quot;What was I talking about&#63; I must be **** from the fruit juice I had before class.) VERY tough grader on papers, not quite so bad on tests."
2472,734200,4.0,4.0,"the class itself was great, and a lot of fun. she's a great person, really. however, the topics for essays are nuts.  and forget about getting constructive criticism on papers: you know what you did right, but not necessarily how to improve.  her nutty comments made the class itself fun, though."
2473,734200,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING! take her class! discussions were great and she is so helpful. go talk to her about essay ideas BEFORE writing, she'll help you with all the essentials!! she'll even take u out for lunch. plus shes really considerate about other work & handing in stuff later...IF u talk to her before. warning: come to class ON time!!"
2474,1451001,5.0,2.0,"Waymer is totally down to earth and really approaches material and discussion appropriately.  Reviews/journals were manageable.  Very interested in students' well-being and personal and intellectual growth.  I learned a lot about myself and others in this class, and recommend it.  Also, he's fun to look at."
2475,2518020,2.0,2.0,"Professor Boyd was the kindest teacher ever who made sure every kid in her class, even if it was a 40 person lecture intro class, was valued individually. Although her lectures were usually pretty boring, she, herself was extremely understanding. Sometimes, the test questions were poorly worded. She's a very good person and easy grader."
2476,1887245,5.0,3.0,"Annie is a wonderful lecturer. She varies her lectures with lots of fun class activities. She brings her class to dog sometimes and also hosts classes outside if the weather is good. She is very funny and respected. Tests match up pretty well to the lectures, but you will need to read the text if you want an A. Lots of lab hours are required."
2477,1887245,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor- made me develop an interest in theater..  Would absolutely take her again
2478,1887245,4.0,3.0,This class is well suited to spontaneous personalities. Lots of opportunities for creative stage work.
2479,1887245,3.0,2.0,"BEWARE: lab hours are required. A lot of them, which is something I had no idea about when signing up. But Annie is super sweet and great, but a hard grader on papers."
2480,1887245,4.0,3.0,"Wadman is young, friendly, and energetic. She gives pretty good lectures, hosts class outside, makes you go to performances, and brings her dog to some classes. Her teaching style is varied and cool. Lectures are informative. Office hours are pretty good, for the most part. The tests are fairly easy, but you have to read a lot and do many lab hours"
2481,1887245,5.0,2.0,"Annie Wadman is the best. One of my favorite teachers at Davidson. Yes, she's not a professor so you call her ""Annie."" She makes the class very interesting and she's always cracking jokes. She's very picky on tests and papers and can be unfair on grading, but I always looked forward to her classes :)"
2482,1887245,4.0,4.0,"Annie is pretty cool. She is good at explaining things, so if you do the reading, pay attention for her class, and study for tests then you'll get A's. Some of her policies are a little unfair, like requiring you to do lab hours but not giving you much opportunity to actually do all of them. She grades harshly, but she's widely available for help."
2483,642067,5.0,3.0,Great professor! Best professor I have had in the ECON dept. Very approachable and he really wants to help everyone who needs it. 329 was also an interesting class topic and he really knew what he was talking about. Highly recommend taking any classes with him. Have fun on sabbatical Professor!
2484,642067,5.0,3.0,"I will take any class Fred Smith teaches. He is an incredible teacher who is attentive to different learning styles, the mental health of his students, and the content he teaches. I have never had a better teacher. He is the best!"
2485,642067,5.0,3.0,"This is the second class I have taken with Dr. Smith, and I cannot wait to take more! He is truly the most caring professor I have ever had or heard about. He takes extraordinary emphasis added care to make sure his students have the opportunity to truly learn the material. His reputation seems too good to be true, but he well deserves it."
2486,642067,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Smith is such a nice professor! Don't get me wrong, it's a super hard class, especially with the reviews... I think as long as you take notes and understand the concepts you should be fine. The lectures help somewhat, but I think reading (which wasn't necessary) should help fill in any gaps that arise during class."
2487,642067,5.0,3.0,Dr. Smith is the best professor I have had at Davidson in my experience. He is very accommodating and a great lecture. It is definitely worth being attentive in class and going to office hours.
2488,642067,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Smith is the best professor I've at Davidson. If you are thinking about taking him, do it. He's so clear in his explanations of course materials, and if you ever need help, he will adjust his schedule to make time for you in office hours. He really does care about his students, and is just an all-around great person."
2489,642067,5.0,3.0,He is one of the best people and economics professors I have ever had.
2490,642067,5.0,3.0,"One of the best econ electives I've taken at Davidson. Prof. Smith teaches sports economics in an incredibly intuitive and insightful manner. The class is all project- and paper-based, which makes for a non-stressful workload and plenty of time to think about interesting questions."
2491,642067,5.0,3.0,"Hands down the best professor I've ever had. Incredibly smart, kind, and invested in his students. He holds extra office hours almost every week so that all of his students can receive help if needed. Would 100% take him as many times as possible during my time at Davidson."
2492,642067,5.0,4.0,"Fred Smith is one of the best teachers I've had. His lectures are very interesting because he incorporates current events. He also uses a &quot;free market&quot; approach to class so you can essentially learn however you want. I didn't open the textbook a single time, and I did quite well, but I'm sure that you could have learned through it."
2493,642067,4.0,5.0,"I love Fred and don't know of anyone who dislikes him. Solid lecturer and it's easy to take notes in his class. However, the class is DIFFICULTquizzes are easy (but only 15% of grade) but the tests+final are kind of ridiculous even if you are well prepared. Always responds to emails quickly but due to big class size office hours are always packed"
2494,642067,5.0,4.0,"Best professor at Davidson hands down. He is in every way the ideal professor, he explains concepts very well, makes himself very accessible, gives great feedback, tries to get to know his students personally, and stops frequently throughout the lecture to ask for questions. But Econ 101 is one of the hardest classes I've taken still."
2495,642067,5.0,3.0,"Prof Smith is one of the best professors I've had at Davidson so far. He really cares about his students, explains topics very clearly, and stops multiple times for questions. Even in a class as basic as ECO101, he managed to bring current and historic events into lectures and in an unbiased manner. Tests and quizzes are fair. Highly recommend him."
2496,642067,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Smith is just everything one would hope to have from a professor clear, helpful, available, encouraging. I almost failed micro I'm pretty sure and I'm saying this. Excellent professor, values diversity of opinions, shares stories, questions always accepted. Very memorable, thoughtful, caring professor super glad I met here."
2497,642067,5.0,4.0,"Really great economics professor. Very organized and straightforward. Pretty much everything you would want from a professor, plus he throws in some enjoyable class discussions that make micro theory a bit less dry."
2498,642067,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Smith is absolutely amazing, he is always so encouraging and gives students time to ask questions. If you have the option to take one of Dr. Smith's classes, definitely do it! Even though attendance isn't mandatory, you'll genuinely want to go to class for great lectures and an amazing professor."
2499,642067,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Honestly an Econ major now because of him.
2500,642067,5.0,2.0,Best professor I have had at Davidson. Cares very deeply about his students and is very clear in explaining difficult concepts. Made Micro one of the best classes I have taken here.
2501,642067,5.0,3.0,Dr. Smith is a great professor. His lectures are super helpful and very understandable. His assignments are a good way to revise concepts. He is not very easy but he is not too hard. I love the class.
2502,642067,5.0,3.0,"Humble. Caring. Catering. Fair. Dr. Smith's ratings speak for themselves. He is the best professor/teacher I've had in life not because of his superior intellect in econ (which is quite evident) but due to his ability to sympathize with students, tailor course to their needs, and emphasize how learning is ultimate goal of education. Please take'em."
2503,642067,5.0,1.0,Best professor I've ever had
2504,642067,5.0,3.0,Smith is an amazing professor take his classes!
2505,642067,5.0,2.0,"The most helpful, sincere, and invested professor I have had at Davidson.  Dr. Smith wants his students to understand economics and goes to great lengths to help inside and outside of class.  He often stays more than an hour after his official office hours end in order to answer questions."
2506,642067,5.0,3.0,Could not have asked for a better 101 professor.  Would absolutely take another class with him.
2507,642067,5.0,4.0,"Hands down, the BEST econ teacher in the department. Cares about each and every student and is the best at explaining all the complicated micro concepts. A solid 10/10. Please don't confuse being amazingly competent to being easy. He is NOT. If you blow his class off by not attending or not doing the quizzes you will suffer."
2508,642067,5.0,3.0,"A nice, understanding guy who knows how to teach incredibly well."
2509,642067,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Smith's lecturing abilities are unparalleled. He speaks at the perfect speed, stops frequently for questions, allots the right amount of time for lectures, and is extremely clear. He also makes himself available outside of class more often than he would ever need to. Every class reminds me why I came to Davidson."
2510,642067,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, don't need to read because he practically teaches the book in class. Attendance is always optional but highly recommended. If you don't like take home tests and optional problem sets, don't take this class."
2511,642067,5.0,4.0,Best Prof I have had at Davidson. Dr. Smith makes me want to learn again and really does everything he can to help you find success. Would really advise ANYONE to TAKE HIS CLASS! Will be a great decision!
2512,642067,5.0,3.0,Excellent teacher! He is thoughtful and clear and always willing to help. He consistently points out ways to apply the information that he teaches in the real world.
2513,642067,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Smith is the BEST professor I've had. He is extremely clear and articulate. He is also very patient- no bad questions in his mind. He is also ALWAYS available to students. Genuinely cares about each person in his class, yet is extremely fair. The class isn't &quot;easy&quot; but if you do the problem sets and go in for extra help, you can do well."
2514,642067,5.0,3.0,Dr. Smith is my favorite teacher at Davidson! He is so clear in his teaching. Works examples in class so you can be successful on your own. He is ALWAYS available. 100% recommended.
2515,642067,5.0,4.0,"One of my favorite professors and one of the best at Davidson.  Dr. Smith works hard to make the material relevant to current events, holds flexible office hours and comes in late at night to hold review sessions with his students."
2516,642067,5.0,3.0,Incredible man.  Extremely caring and understanding.  I'm so glad I took Econ 101 so that I was able to have him as a professor.
2517,642067,5.0,3.0,BEST TEACHER AT DAVIDSON BY FAR. REALLY BRINGS MATERIAL TO LIFE AND MAKES CLASSES INTERESTING. DON'T TAKE 101 WITH ANYONE ELSE.
2518,642067,5.0,3.0,"No one at Davidson or in the world at large will care about your success as much as Dr. Smith. It is his mission to make himself as clear, available, and helpful to each of his students as humanly possible. Excellent lecturer who incorporates pertinent classroom conversations. Has a true passion for the subject and the student. Highly recommended"
2519,642067,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Smith is incredible - he explains everything so well and has an incredible patience level.  He really is invested in the students...he WANTS people to do well...and is very flexible with quizzes/tests.  His teaching style is great - he always makes sure everyone is on track... if you take econ 101, you HAVE to have Smith!"
2520,642067,5.0,3.0,"ECO 202 is not designed to be an easy class, but as long as you do the work, it's not too bad.  Dr. Smith is ALWAYS VERY willing to help and explain things over and over.  He is very good at explaining things in class and making sure everyone understands."
2521,642067,5.0,3.0,"His test are not easy, but are very managebale if you go to class and help sessions. Favorite prof so ever, he will do anything to help you succeed, he cares about how you do not only in class but in the real world as well"
2522,642067,4.5,3.0,He is a very good teacher. He covers everything he tests you on in his class lectures and quizes. If you keep up with the work it is not hard to do well.
2523,2645021,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bastani is a fantastic professor and helped me develop a lot of skills. She always made herself accessible and, as long as you had open communication with her, she was willing to work extensively to help you accomplish your goals. I was very intimidated by this class going in and it was very difficult throughout, but it was extremely rewarding."
2524,2645021,4.0,4.0,Dr. Bastani did really well for her first semester here at Davidson. She seemed a bit unfamiliar with some material but I'm sure she will improve. The tests and homework are reasonable but be prepared to learn most of the content on your own or with her occasional pre-lecture videos and then apply equations in class
2525,2645021,5.0,4.0,Really excellent professor. Very willing to accommodate and she explains challenging concepts in really amazing ways. I know it's only her first semester AND it's during a pandemic which makes her excellent teaching of this course even more over the top. Highly recommend.
2526,594981,4.0,3.0,"Metaphysics was the perfect introductory philosophy course. The weekly readings are essential, the pacing of the coursework is perfect, it never felt rushed or too slow. I loved his style of lectures. Your grade is comprised of weekly slack posts and 2 essays, if you do the work, show up to class, and attend Office Hours, you should be good to go."
2527,594981,4.0,3.0,"Pop quizzes for sure, make sure to do the readings and understand them. Not a lot of readings but sometimes can be very long. The usual, a little more on the easy side. If you're good at philosophy etc, then should be an easy A. Lecture-heavy, but easy to listen to. Sometimes boring."
2528,594981,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Robb's class can be a bit dry at times, his lectures can be a bit long and ""rambly"". The source material is personally interesting (if you like science take this course) but you really have to generate your own excitement and enthusiasm. He is also a tough grader."
2529,594981,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Robb is extremely smart and knows probably everything there is to know about philosophy. Lectures are usually good but occasionally vague, but he usually has decent examples to illustrate concepts. Office hours kinda suck, so better pay attention in class. You will get an A or B if you read the assigned chapters and study lecture notes."
2530,594981,4.5,3.0,"Professor Robb is great. HUM150 has no tests and no final exams which was really nice, but pop quizzes on the readings were tough. I would definitely take him again."
2531,594981,3.5,4.0,"Robb is pretty friendly but also pretty awkward. He is kinda helpful in office hours but also sometimes dodges the question and goes off on some tangent. He gives pretty clear and cogent lectures, but those can also be tangential. The tests are not super hard, but he grades them pretty harshly and expects you to do a lot of reading and writing."
2532,594981,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Robb is a really cool guy and he makes difficult material easy to understand. The work load is pretty manageable and he's a fair grader on tests and papers. Participation is important for your grade but also it helps in your understanding of the material. The more work you put in, the more you'll get out of it."
2533,594981,5.0,3.0,"Robb is a fantastic professor- very clear, concise, and brilliant. Can be boring and lectures a lot though so if you are looking for a participation heavy class, he's not for you. But, he is a fair grader and does take effort and participation into account when grading. Probably the best philosophy prof at Davidson too. Would recommend."
2534,594981,5.0,3.0,Dr. Robb probably has the best lectures at Davidson. You need to take good notes because about 90% of his tests come from things you've talked about specifically in class. As long as you pay attention you should do fine. He does take attendance though which is kind of odd.
2535,594981,3.5,3.0,"Robb is pretty cool. You learn a LOT in his class, and his way of explaining things is lucid and helpful. He isn't quite as strong in office hours or when answering questions, so definitely pay attention during class. He is a fair grader (not true for every teacher at Davidson) and is friendly if you don't get on his bad side. Overall, not bad."
2536,594981,5.0,4.0,"Tough to get an A out of him, but not that difficult to get a solid B. He's very intelligent and his sense of humor, while not for everyone, really helps liven a lecture on a dull topic. Plan to take courses with him again."
2537,594981,4.5,4.0,"I took his WRI 101 Scientific Image class and absolutely loved it! We covered difficult topics, such as dualism/physicalism, free-will, morality, and meaning of life, but he taught them with much clarity. As long as you write papers in the style he wants, you can consistently get B+ to A-. There's not as much workload/reading as in other classes."
2538,594981,4.5,5.0,"Hard grader, but you can do well if you're a good note-taker and you go to office hours and study hard.  He's a great guy, but he comes across as really awkward.  Don't be fooled by him talking to the windows...he really cares about teaching and his students."
2539,594981,4.0,4.0,"No Syllabus, you need to go to class to get the next days homework.He's the Philosophy chair for good reason, he's probably the smartest person at davidson, If you dont learn in his class you arent thinking hard enough. I dont think he talks down to students or anything of the sort, he's just sorta socially awkward just because he's a genius"
2540,594981,1.0,5.0,"never made eye contact with his students, NEVER. i'd never take his class again. tests were impossible"
2541,594981,2.0,4.0,A legend in his own mind. Does his students a favor by talking..down to them. A relative of Marie Antoinette perhaps&#63;
2542,594981,1.0,4.0,"Not friendly, nor helpful, nor understanding. He's a smart guy, though."
2543,594981,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Robb is a really good professor.  He was very good at explaining all the new, strange philosophical ideas covered in class.  A hard grader, but it's possible to do well if you pay attention to class and really think about the concepts and questions on tests.  I would take a class with Dr. Robb again."
2544,594981,3.5,2.0,"Great class! Excellent delivery of information if you follow his lecture and notes. He is keen on exact wording, so be sure to know your notes before a test."
2545,594981,5.0,3.0,"D. Robb was one of my favorite professors at Davidson.  Every day of lecture was thrilling, and I was NOT a philosophy major.  I took 3 of Dr. Robb's classes.  He is also extremely approachable and willing to help.  His office door is always open, and he's always willing to take as much time as necessary to explain or discuss anything he teaches."
2546,594981,4.5,4.0,d. robb ****ing rocks...albeit really awkwardly.
2547,594981,3.5,4.0,"May God have mercy on your soul if you land in his section.  Unapproachable, unsociable, and unnecessarily difficult.  His one saving grace is his ability to explain complicated philosophical concepts."
2548,594981,4.0,4.0,"Clear, precise, and rigorous. Patient in addressing questions, remarks, and objections. To do well on his tests, take very detailed notes in lecture, type them up so as to re-process the information, and, on the tests, reproduce the terms, arguments, etc. exactly as he presented them in lecture. Analytic philosophy requires exact precision."
2549,594981,4.5,4.0,"Robb is the clearest, most precise, and most rigorous philosophy professor at Davidson. He is especially good at lecturing on difficult, abstract material (like topics from epistemology), because he presents things as clearly and simply as possible, without sacrificing accuracy. He is also patient in addressing questions, remarks, and objections. N"
2550,594981,2.0,5.0,He has no heart.  Yelled at me for not paying attention but he himself talks to the window rathern than class.  I really hope he won't get tenured again.
2551,594981,1.0,3.0,"MOST BORING MAN ALIVE. I could not keep my eyes open in class. He is SO dull, and yet he thinks he's funny, so he'll chuckle at his own lame jokes. I do NOT recommend taking this class, unless you're insanely interested in philosophy."
2552,594981,4.0,5.0,"A true Davidson professor in the sense that everything seems really easy, but it's not.  Will grade you on everything, and you will not even do well on a &quot;BS&quot; grade like participation.  I regret taking this class everyday, and would advise others not to, unless you are majoring in philosophy."
2553,594981,2.5,4.0,"For non-philosophy majors, this class can be very difficult.  The subject matter is very complicated, and he expects a lot of you.  You will not get an &quot;A&quot; on a test even if you got everything right.  Not very friendly; will ignore your presence outside of class.  Take at own risk!"
2554,54311,3.0,5.0,"Striplin is a great, fun person. However, this class requires a lot of dedication/time. The exams are incredibly hard, with questions on it that were not taught or covered in class, be ready to teach yourself a lot of it. He gives lots of partial credit and if you complete all the homework (there is A LOT) and the labs, you will get a good grade. "
2555,54311,5.0,3.0,"This class goes over a lot of material in a little amount of time. Would definitely recommend taking if you're premed or a chem major, even if you have credit for AP chem (I did). Striplin is dedicated to helping all students, but you have to make an effort to go see him in office hours. Learned a lot, but fair warning: There is A LOT of homework!!"
2556,54311,4.0,4.0,"The cons: The tests are quite difficult, the homework could be excessive, and lectures weren't really helpful.
The pros: Dr. Striplin is such a kind and caring professor and he can explain well in office hours. He curves A LOT and will work with you to get you the grade you want. He wants you to learn and will see the work you put in."
2557,54311,4.0,2.0,V enthusiastic about teaching ! I really appreciate the knowledge he shared with the class and the positive energy that he brought to the classroom everyday. He's a bit unorganized though but this was for baby chem and he's a super chill guy. Recommend for science credit. Reasonable grader. Lectures could be long but it's worth it
2558,54311,4.0,5.0,"PChem in general is just a hard class no matter your professor, but Dr. Striplin teaches it with lots of humor and sympathy. There are three reviews total and there's no homework ever due really, just derivations which are more like take home quizzes (very easy). He tries very hard to make sure everyone gets an A in the class and curves tests ALOT."
2559,54311,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Striplin is the epitome of a good chemistry professor: smart, witty, empathetic, and adept at explaining complex concepts in a way everyone can understand. Although he's a very busy man, he makes time for his students and always encourages questions. He cares about you, your success, and your understanding of chemistry. 15/10 would recommend!"
2560,54311,4.0,4.0,"115 was basically an online course and it takes a bit of time to get into a routine with MasteringChem. Dr. Striplin lectures heavily in class and does a few examples. However, to truly understand the material or do homework problems, office hours is a must! 115 is a collaborative struggle, but you have many resources to help you get through it."
2561,54311,4.5,5.0,"Fantastic professor. The class and material are extremely difficult, but Dr. Striplin does a good job explaining things in class. If you don't understand during class he's the most helpful professor I've ever met with during office hours. He wants his students to do well. Be prepared to pour your life into the class, though. Do all of the homework."
2562,54311,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Striplin is an incredible professor - one of Davidson's best. His tests are difficult and especially tough to finish in the time allotted, but he's a fantastic lecturer and hilariously entertaining in lab. He's hard to get ahold of by email but extremely helpful outside of class. Dr. S made what would be a rough course into one of my favorites."
2563,54311,4.5,5.0,"Great professor. His classes are not easy, and you will spend a massive amount of time studying; but he does what he can to make the material reachable."
2564,54311,4.0,3.0,great prof. hilarious. kept lectures interesting. great stories.
2565,54311,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Striplin is adorable and I love his awkward jokes!  But let's be honest, p-chem isn't exactly a cakewalk..."
2566,54311,3.0,4.0,"Very entertaining and friendly, but not my favorite professor.  I think that some people click with him, and others don't.  He certainly knows his stuff but doesn't do a great job of conveying it clearly."
2567,54311,2.5,5.0,Great personality. Not always too helpful... Great stories though!!
2568,54311,4.5,4.0,Tough but fun!
2569,54311,4.0,5.0,"Really great guy, really fun in class, but p-chem is just a b----!"
2570,54311,3.5,2.0,"This guy is an incredible man, sometimes a little confusing though!"
2571,54311,4.0,2.0,He is wonderful.  He has so much fun in class. Chem for jocks!
2572,594984,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Sutton is one of my favorite professors.  He is a Davidson grad, so he knows what Davidson is all about.  No surprises on tests.  Always willing to help.  Highly recommend!"
2573,594984,5.0,2.0,"Sutton is so nice, he genuinely wants everyone to do well. The class is very text/workbook focused, which I liked. We watched and discussed movies, which limited some of the awkward silences I'd had in previous french classes. Sutton is very clear about what is going to be on the tests, and you only have four short one page papers. Oral final."
2574,594984,5.0,5.0,"In my oopinion, the best French professor.  He's a hard grader but he's the nicest man alive.  It wasn't my favorite class, but he was a great professor!"
2575,594984,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely amazing professor! He's a sweetheart and goes above and beyond to make you understand the material and is always willing to meet outside class- goes straight from the textbook- no surprises, really enjoyable class"
2576,594984,4.5,4.0,"Great professor; hilarious class!  He let us talk about whatever we wanted, and joke around, as long as it was appropriate and in French.  I have never looked forward to going to a class more than Sutton's.  Final isn't bad (just an oral), and generally a fair grader and great professor.  I highly recommend him!"
2577,594984,4.5,3.0,"Prof Sutton is amazing. I should not have been placed in this level and the fact that he was so nice kept me from hating French forever, now I'm considering taking more French courses. He relies heavily on the text, plan on writing a lot, and speaking , too. You can't be a wallflower. He is genuinely interested in who you are and your success."
2578,594984,5.0,3.0,he really wants you to learn and love french and makes it easier for you to do so
2579,594984,4.5,3.0,"Homer is great! He is very amiable and speaks clear French in class. Class is pretty routine, but grades are fair and tests are fine if you pay attention to the book. He wants you to succeed."
2580,594984,5.0,1.0,"French was torture for me, but Prof. Sutton made it feel like paradise on a silk pillow.  Perhaps the most patient, and helpful individual I've met thus far at Davidson.  His assurance and aid turned what could have been a disasterous semester into what I'd consider success.  The class isn't difficult depending on your level, but never unbearable."
2581,594984,5.0,3.0,"Homer Sutton is an example of a Davidson professor; challenging, but also very approachable.  Sutton, a Davidson grad, knows all about Davidson, and teaches his classes accordingly.  He's amazing and funny, and really helps you to learn more.  Tough grader at times."
2582,54313,3.0,2.0,Lectures were very unengaging and provided a lot of extra info not on the exam. There was a clear outline given for the exams so we knew what to expect. Not hard to do well if you follow the guidelines he sets. I enjoyed the readings and the listenings which were a big (and easy) chunk of the grade.
2583,54313,2.0,3.0,"If you do the readings and go to class you will do fine. It was mostly memorization and I learned a lot. Lots of required listening, but good classical music. Personally, I found him difficult to work with, and it felt like we were butting heads when I tried to talk about my grades with him. The class will be much easier if you are a musician."
2584,54313,2.0,3.0,"His classes are pretty boring, consisting of dull lectures and bad jokes. Attendance and daily homework is optional (thankfully) but there are graded-for-accuracy assignments every week worth 50% of your grade. Easy A if you put effort into those assignments."
2585,54313,3.0,3.0,"Really lecture heavy which gets pretty dull for 15 weeks, nothing ever changes the pace. But he knows his stuff and the material is pretty interesting if you like Spanish and music, so that worked out well for me. Listening tests are easy if you can memorize well, midterm and final were hard because we never reviewed any of the material."
2586,54313,4.0,4.0,"This is a hard theory class and sometimes he can make it more complicated than it is, but I would really recommend it for those who enjoy music and arranging. There are NO tests or quizzes; the only grades are basically homework every week, some aural exercises, and the final. YOU CAN RE-DO THE HOMEWORK TOO FOR FULL CREDIT! Office hours are key."
2587,54313,4.0,2.0,"Mauro's class is based heavily on his lectures. While they can be interesting however, they do not have much to do with the homework. The class is definitely something that might not be found in every music department. Definitely give it a try if interested, it is not a gpa killer and is cool for those who both love, and dont know much of music."
2588,54313,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Botelho was a good teacher but his lectures were very, very dull. The textbook readings were dull too. I also didn't learn much theory beyond the basic information most musicians already know."
2589,54313,1.5,3.0,"Generally unpleasant to work with, and his lectures are unexciting at best. Condescending, with an inexplicable disdain for his students. Not recommended unless you really love music theory in its most banal and pretentious form."
2590,54313,3.5,4.0,"I thought this course was hard, but other people didn't have any trouble with it at all. Botelho was pretty neutral as a professor, but as a person he's pretty chill. I'd say take his Brazilian music class over MUS101 if you just want the fine art credit."
2591,54313,2.5,4.0,We were tested on two areas of knowledge--the music itself and the history of Brazil & its musicians. The former was tested through listening reviews that were incredibly hard if you don't have a solid musical background. Then the other reviews were the opposite: absurdly easy and boring. Readings were unnecessary to do & the lectures were boring.
2592,54313,4.0,4.0,"Worst, most boring music class you could take. Lectures are entirely biographies of musicians... extremely useless, even for the tests. Listening tests are HARD, others you can do well on just by memorizing the terms. Doesn't care about attendance or participation. Bad humor. Don't take it! You wont learn anythi besides the lives of random musicia"
2593,54313,2.0,5.0,"&quot;Berates students, picks favorites, very patronizing and disdains non-music students.&quot;  Completely True. This professor is condescending and completely unclear in class and has extraordinarily high expectations. Avoid if possible."
2594,54313,3.5,4.0,Very sharp.
2595,54313,4.5,5.0,"The Music Theory Track includes 201, 202, and 303.  These courses pretty much took over my life -- I wish I could have given them more time.  If you do anything VISIT MAURO IN HIS OFFICE HOURS!!!  This is almost as important as attending class.  Having him look over your work will do wonders for not only your learning, but also for your grade!"
2596,54313,4.5,5.0,"He's fun, if your idea of fun is having your work covered in red ink. Very tough, even critical, but very good."
2597,54313,4.5,3.0,Easy if you have a musical background.
2598,54313,1.5,4.0,"Berates students, picks favorites, very patronizing and disdains non-music students."
2599,54313,3.0,3.0,"Unlike most students, I did not find him particularly funny.  I did well in the class only because I had music experience, but I learned a pretty good bit.  Would recommend to someone who knows something about music already."
2600,54313,5.0,2.0,"An incredible class - one of the best I've taken at Davidson.  Dr. Botelho has an amazing sense of humor, and really knows his stuff.  Highly recommended."
2601,54313,2.0,2.0,He kind of reads straight from his notes in lectures but he has powerpoint presentations every day which is very helpful. The class is very easy except for the 4 listening tests (You have to be able to recognize a bunch of weird Latin American songs). And you don't have to do the reading to get an A
2602,54313,4.5,4.0,"Great guy - the class is tough, yes, but he's quite hilarious, and he'll certainly help you through tough spots."
2603,54313,1.5,4.0,Way too hard.  Don't take it.
2604,54313,4.0,4.0,"Tough course for those without theory experience, even musicians.  Great professor.  Funny, understanding, helpful - be sure to drop by during office hours.  One of my favorite classes.  You'll learn a ton."
2605,54313,4.0,3.0,A lot more work than I anticipated.
2606,54313,4.5,2.0,Amazing class.  Great overview of Brazilian music from the late 1500s to today.  He's got an amazing sense of humor too.
2607,54313,2.0,3.0,He's kindof scary.
2608,54313,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor.  Absolutely hilarious dry humor, knows his stuff COLD, and actually gets inspired by the banalities of music theory.  Loved it."
2609,54313,1.0,4.0,He was a jerk.  His lectures were useless. Worst professor I've ever had.
2610,54313,3.0,4.0,No Comments
2611,54313,3.5,3.0,"He is really funny, but the class is kinda hard."
2612,54313,2.0,4.0,No Comments
2613,54313,5.0,2.0,"Really cool teacher. Not too hard, either."
2614,54313,5.0,3.0,"Hilarious, helpful, 2 take home reviews and a final"
2615,54313,4.0,3.0,Its a hard class but not that bad.  Assignments due every monday
2616,594986,3.0,4.0,"Dr.Thornberry knows her material; however, her lectures are often unclear, and she can be hard to follow.I felt her grading was a bit arbitrary, and there were not clear guidelines as to her expectations. Overall, I suggest to only take this class if you have a true interest in con law - the material was interesting, but the class itself was not."
2617,594986,3.5,2.0,"This was a fun class, a lot of work, and freaquent essays but the subject matter, if you are interested, is taught very well.  Dr Thornberry is very helpful and approachable outside of the classroom.  She knows her stuff but leaves assertions open for debate when you disagree.  Good Prof!"
2618,594986,2.5,4.0,"One of the most disappointing classes I've taken. Dr. Thornberry is VERY unclear about assignments; she will give different answers to the same question and change assignments at the last minute. She's a nice person and is very interested in the subject but if you like a prof. to be straightforward and consistent, I do not recommend her."
2619,594986,3.0,4.0,"Professsor thornberry is a very interesting professor. Civil liberties is a class worth taking, although you need to be willing to put in a substantial amount of work. She is difficult, but fair, most of the time."
2620,594986,2.5,3.0,"I think she's suppose to be a lot better for other classes, but she made stats much harder than it should have been.  Her lectures were muddled at best.  Majors- take Sellers for stats."
2621,594986,4.5,3.0,"The embodiment of a Davidson professor; challenging, but helpful, nice, and approachable.  Her class is tough, and she expects a lot out of you.  She really cares about her students, in and out of the classroom."
2622,1307702,3.5,4.0,"Not true. Herb is a great guy...his classes just require a lot of work. He does not only like abstract paintings. His own favorite famous paintings are very realistic. He doesn't like work that comes easily to you. He likes to see you struggle, fight with the painting, and ultimately win. If you work hard, and not the night before, you'll be great!"
2623,1307702,2.0,5.0,"Basic Painting was my WORST NIGHTMARE! Herb is an ABSRACT artist and basically hates all other forms of art. if you are a realistic artist, stay away from his classes!! Herb offers you little to no help at all and merely 'suggests' a few things you could do.. if you don't do what he says, you'll struggle. horrible professor"
2624,2124866,1.0,4.0,Her class were extremely disorganized. She held us anywhere from 5-15 minutes over class time each 50 minute MWF class period. I was late to other things but she would continue to cold call on people past class time and I did not want to upset her by signing off or not answering. She was rude and not helpful and often would go on tangents in class.
2625,2124866,2.0,2.0,"She is the most unorganized teacher I ever had in my life. Lectures made it the most fun class I had all semester, time rarely drags in her class. Didn't learn much Spanish all semester although she made somewhat of an effort to teach it. 30+ minutes of homework daily. Would not recommend but I needed it for foreign lang requirement and you may too"
2626,2124866,5.0,3.0,"Boy is she polarizing. However, she is an absolute gem to this college and is so dedicated to helping her students. She is definitely not organized, and her lectures are so so but her energy and willingness to help makes the class so enjoyable. There is pretty heavy textbook use but she's so funny and quite good at what she does. Highly recommend."
2627,2124866,5.0,4.0,"Profe is a fantastic teacher! She is super energetic and it is easy to tell she has a passion for language and teaching. Most of the work is done outside of class and during class you mostly work on conversation and grammar skills. She is tough and expects a lot, but if you work hard, she definitely notices and rewards you for it."
2628,2124866,2.0,1.0,"Great lady, super energetic and is passionate but is not a good teacher. Super unorganized, doesn't really teach during class, she's all over the place. LOTS of homework but pretty easy class if you put the work in."
2629,2124866,4.0,2.0,She has a very unorthodox teaching style but once you get into the class and if you participate you'll see how she cares about her students. Got a LOT of workbook homework and we didn't always discuss it in class. I somehow still got better in Spanish even though the lectures were so unorthodox and sort of disorganized. Wants students to do well.
2630,2124866,5.0,3.0,"In 102, she assigns a lot more homework and her class is much more intense to prepare you for 201. I would avoid her for 102. However, in 201 she is exponentially better, nicer, funnier, and makes class extremely enjoyable. Going to 201 was a joy, 102 a chore. Take 201 with her, not 102, if possible. She's really cares about improving your skills."
2631,2124866,1.0,4.0,"Worst professor I've had so far. Her classes are no different than taking a course on Rosetta Stone, repeating words like a parrot without actually building out true language skills. She does not prepare you for 200+ level courses and is unfit to teach at this level as demonstrated by her lack of PhD. A true embarrassment to Davidson College."
2632,2124866,1.0,4.0,She was pretty awful. Very unorganized and gives a lot of homework that she checks everyday. Really tough grader.
2633,2124866,5.0,4.0,"I loved her! She definitely makes you work for your grade, but she truly cares about her students. Definitely go to office hours!! She is so helpful outside of class with anything you need! I have learned a ton from this class and feel very prepared to take 260. A lot of bookwork, but otherwise loved the class!"
2634,2124866,5.0,4.0,"She is the best Spanish professor I have ever had. I learned a lot from her, and she cares very much about students. She encourages you to push yourself, and makes it clear that making mistakes is expected and okay. She sometimes goes very fast during class, but office hours are very useful. Make sure to pay attention to deadlines."
2635,2124866,4.0,4.0,"She has a lot of wisdom and knowledge, and she likes to be real with the students. I would argue that she is not a hard grader, but you need to work for it. There IS a ton of homework, and it can be tedious, but it helps to solidify your Spanish ability in the end. I'd recommend taking her if you're serious about becoming a better Spanish speaker."
2636,2124866,2.0,4.0,"Insane level of homework. Not only that, you have to go on a scavenger hunt in multiple places online to figure out what you are supposed to do. Class is not the most helpful, as she just prefers to talk in Spanish instead of teaching us the pertinent grammar concepts. I have never had to do more busy work in my life."
2637,2124866,2.5,5.0,"The amount of homework assigned was ridiculous, even for Davidson. The tests were nearly impossible. She has a thick accent so when she does (rarely) switch to English, it is tough to understand. Goes extremely fast, and is never organized. The class had no structure, she jumps from one thing to the next and back again. Would not take again. 4/10"
2638,474180,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, and hilarious too! You have to put in work outside of class, but that should be expected with organic chemistry. Tests had little room for partial credit, but they were fair. Dr. Carroll does love to go off on tangents, but they were entertaining. I learned a lot from lab as well."
2639,474180,4.0,3.0,I honestly don't understand all the bad reviews. He's sometimes tangential with his lectures but is always accessible outside of class and genuinely wants you to succeed. Only problem is tests are 65% of the grade and they're short with little room for partial credit so getting one question wrong does hurt you a decent amount. Decent jokes too.
2640,474180,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Carroll was extremely willing to help students whenever they needed it, and he was always accessible and helpful during office hours. He did go on some tangents in lectures, but tests were pretty straightforward and if you take time to read the textbook and do the eLMs, you will do well in the class and learn the material. He's also hilarious!"
2641,474180,5.0,3.0,"Genuinely don't get all the Felix slander. Lectures were clear, textbook was great, eLMs were generally helpful. He also gave generous practice tests and the exams themselves were pretty straightforward too. He's got a dry sense of humor and many dad jokes, which I found amusing. &quot;Puts people down to feel better about himself&quot;--objectively untrue."
2642,474180,1.0,3.0,"Just the worst, honestly. Gives minimal amount of information regarding assignments and his expectations. Terribly boring lectures that aren't even worth paying attention to. Uses his own textbook which is painfully dry and not worth reading. Rude to students, doesn't care about them, and just puts people down to feel better about himself. Awful"
2643,474180,2.0,4.0,"Concepts are harder, not super helpful even in office hours, so prepare to understand via peers or textbook readings/online. Decent amount of work for a 200-level. Doesn't teach ANY of the labs that will be used in CHE 350; must prepare yourself for CHE350. Dad jokes; pretty good ones though."
2644,474180,2.5,3.0,"Dr. Carroll can be unclear at times as to what information is important to know for reviews. He gives practice reviews, which is useful, but his reviews often include only a small portion of what he covers in class.  Lab work can be tedious at times but the labs themselves are interesting. Grades fairly leniently, but isn't great with MCAT prep."
2645,474180,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Carroll is extremely knowledgable. He teaches the material fairly well, but gives nearly no guidance about what is important and what is just him off on a tangent, so tests are difficult to prepare for. Take notes, READ, and you can do fairly well in this class though it is not easy. I know people who have gotten As and who have failed hard."
2646,474180,3.5,1.0,"Easy A. You show up, take notes during lecture, read the book and you are golden. His lectures are crystal clear and he often includes funny anecdotesrandom facts that he later puts on the test. Lab is a breeze, basically no hw. But it's not very good preparation for Dr. Snyders Orgo 2 class, so that's the drawback."
2647,474180,3.5,5.0,"While this was the hardest class I've ever taken in my life, Dr.Carroll tries to help you as much as possible. His sense of humor is impeccable and he tries to make lectures enjoyable, although they're memorized! Tests are BRUTAL but he curves at the end of the semester! :)"
2648,474180,1.0,5.0,"One of my hardest class. He teaches based FULLY on PowerPoints which annoy me. He's slightly helpful in office hours but he's very intimidating. Very dry, sarcastic jokes throughout class, and he expects his students to know as much as he does. He also tells students to basically never go out and study organic chem 3 hours a night. Ended with a B.."
2649,474180,3.0,4.0,"Everyone told me to avoid him at all costs, but you do realize that you'll need to read AND understand the text while doing most of the text practice problems. I ended the class with an A- because did the problems and spent time everyday on the material. He grades labs easy, so it can boost your grade. He's not easy, but definitely do-able.Fretnot"
2650,474180,3.0,3.0,"Uses powerpoints. I taught myself out of the book. Powerpoints are more for ""reinforcing"" rather than learning. He won't go out of his way to help you. The tests aren't too tough if you do the problems & the reading. He lets you do revisions for a couple of the tests & earn points back. His unhelpful nature doesn't help make the class easier."
2651,474180,2.0,5.0,"So far, the worst professor I've had at Davidson.  You can read the entire book and still have no clue what he'll test you on. He teaches using powerpoints he has memorized.  If you need to take this class avoid him at all costs. However, besides all this he is nice man."
2652,474180,1.5,5.0,Honestly the worst professor I have had during my time at Davidson. Avoid at all costs.
2653,474180,3.5,4.0,No Comment.
2654,474180,3.5,4.0,"I enjoyed Dr. Carroll's class...but in order to you have to like his dry sense of humor. His lectures are pointless unless you read the book and take good notes in class, his lectures emphasize what in the book you need to ignore (which is very little). I thought his tests were fair, just do the practice problems in the textbook and it'll work out."
2655,474180,2.5,4.0,"Without a doubt the worst professor I have encountered during my Davidson career. I taught myself the entire course using the amazing textbook. Dr. Carroll is nice and has a very dry sense of humor, but teaching through a PowerPoint=fail."
2656,474180,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Carroll's class is brutal. I have never worked so hard for a B-. You are responsible for every topic covered in class and in the textbook, however minor the details may seem. He will meet with you if you set up an appointment, but he's not what I'd call a student's professor. In an extremely tough course, he doesn't go out of his way to help."
2657,474180,2.0,5.0,Don't take his Organic Chemistry class.
2658,474180,3.5,4.0,"Lectures off of powerpoint most of the time. He has a very dry sense of humor (funny if you are into that). He warns you on the first day that his class will be alot of work, and it was. Tests are difficult, but he allows corrections. You really do need to study 3 hours daily if you want an A."
2659,474180,2.0,4.0,"Nice guy, but very dry sense of humor.  Very hard tests, but will usu. let you correct them. Powerpoint lectures were very fast and often not very helpful."
2660,474180,2.0,4.0,"Give me a break. i heard he curved bigtime, but ended up with my test average (B+) which I had KILLED myself for...so the supposed huge curve was nonexistent for me. his lectures were awful, especially when compared to dr. schuh and what i hear of stevens and brown..."
2661,474180,3.5,3.0,"Demanding, very picky about small things, but fair."
2662,474180,3.5,4.0,Carroll knows his stuff but the class is difficult.
2663,474180,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Carroll is a great professor, but his tests are difficult, and he is not veru accessible outside of class."

2666,474180,4.5,3.0,"An absolutely adorable man, in that 'slightly-distant-but-secretly-wanting-a-big-ol-bear-hug' kind of way.  He likes to throw little jokes into his lectures to keep you smiling, and truly wants to help students learn the material."
2667,474180,3.5,2.0,"A bit strange and has a very dry sense of humor.  Obviously knows his stuff very well but awkward to talk to and not the best at conveying his knowledge.  Generally a decent professor, but I prefer Dr. Stevens for organic."
2668,2628680,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Pollet is great! She's caring, always there to help, and her lectures are well organised. The textbook was information heavy with a lot of reading, but she did a great job of honing into the concepts that were important for the exam. For lab, her feedback was always detailed and helpful. Overall, amazing professor and class!"
2669,2628680,5.0,4.0,"From the first day of class, she was available to her students. Although the textbook was bad, her lectures were helpful and very clear. Imbedded quizzes are open note but difficult. Exams were fair and lab was duable. Although all of it was online the class was by far my favorite of the semester."
2670,2628680,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Pollet was a really great bio prof, especially for it being her first semester teaching. Shes very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the material. Its not an easy class, but I definitely recommend taking Bio113 with her."
2671,2628680,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Pollet is amazing! You have to take 113 with her. She's extremely caring, great at explaining things, offers tons of help outside of class, and is a very fair grader. Definitely one of the best teachers I've ever had and it's her first semester ever teaching. She made an online class at 8:15 very enjoyable."
2672,265293,3.5,3.0,"Intro to lit with him was filled with long lectures (he really likes to lecture). He gets very into his lectures as he is a theatre person so watch out for that. Grades things fairly, gives decent feedback and is clear about what he wants us to turn in. I just wish he would let the students talk more and be engaged. "
2673,265293,4.5,2.0,"A really great professor. Kind, funny, great at explaining and very patient. I liked him a lot. If you're worried about turning things in and need an extension, he's really generous with granting those if you explain what's going on. Doesn't make things unnecessarily difficult. I recommend."
2674,265293,5.0,2.0,"I adore this man. Very interesting, easily understood, vibrant personality. One of those teachers that reminds you why you came to Davidson in the first place."
2675,265293,2.5,2.0,"He means well, and is a nice man, but the class is unbearably dull.  Excessive use of bad workbooks. I feel like I didn't really learn much..I definitely improved my writing, but I didn't add much to my knowledge. It's easy to get a B/B+, however."
2676,265293,4.5,3.0,"Really nice, really funny. One of my favorite professors."
2677,265293,3.0,3.0,"Seems like he is easy, but don't be fooled.  Overall, a nice guy and very funny at times, he sometimes acts like he has no idea what he is doing.  Sometimes, you feel that although you're being tested on a lot of things, you're not really learning anything.  Your grade, IMO, depends on your motivation."
2678,265293,5.0,1.0,Very clear explanations and funny.
2679,265293,5.0,1.0,"He was always animated and fun wile teaching, I never fell asleep.  Most of the work isn't terribly hard and he's always willing to help."
2680,265293,4.5,2.0,"Hilarious professor. Class is conducted almost entirely in french (even 101). Can get boring: very regimented(tests, workbook turn-ins, quizzes, oral tests at never-changing intervals). Does way more than Davidson than almost any other professor. Certainly the best prof in the department for those looking to get their language req. out of the way."
2681,265293,4.5,1.0,"He's the coolest, funniest professor I've ever had.  This class is easy, he's a fair grader AND he lets you re-write your papers for an equal grade.  The best part of this class was the emphasis placed on the movies we were required to watch.  Excellent class and even better prof."
2682,265293,4.5,1.0,"Buckley is a riot!  His course is really easy, and he's a nice guy to boot.  The writing assignments aren't necessarily easy in themselves, but he's an easy grader.  His use of film in class was also great - I learned so much about film from him.  Overall, it's an easy, fun class with a great prof."
2683,265293,4.5,2.0,"Fun guy and easy class.  A lot of writing, but it's a writing class, so it's expected.  A fair amount of reading, but it knocks out your literature requirement for the core.  I'm a horrible writer, yet I always get a &quot;B&quot; on my papers, which says something about how he grades."
2684,265293,4.0,2.0,"Take this w-class!  The reading is very light as is the writing.  Buckley is a little strange, but extremely funny.  There have been times that the whole class has been crying we were laughing so hard!  Nice guy...except he thinks a ghost haunts his house, seriously, ask him about it."
2685,265293,5.0,3.0,"Amazing, funny, wonderful!"
2686,265293,3.5,3.0,"hes not too hard, class can be kind of boring but he is really nice and pretty funny"
2687,2632782,5.0,1.0,"Absolutely LOVE Dr. Flaherty. Extremely accessible for office hours and very nice teacher. Her directions are SO clear, and she teaches psych 101 in a way that helps everyone learn and that is not too hard. Only two reviews are a midterm and a final, both (with studying) were very fair and straightforward. Highly recommend "
2688,2632782,5.0,3.0,"Awesome class, and she made me more excited about having kids! Very straightforward -- read the textbook for homework, then she does a lecture with slides and also class activities to collaborate with other students while also engaging with the material. Very positive and understanding prof. Class was never boring and love the way she taught!"
2689,2632782,5.0,2.0,"The kindest professor at Davidson College. She is so clear with instructions, flexible, and she never overworks her students. She is also very passionate about her teaching. I have never felt bored or stressed in her class. She truly trusts her students and wants them to succeed. Great way to start my freshman year."
2690,1875026,5.0,3.0,"He is a good professor and he is an easy grader as long as you put in a lot of work. The rubric for each drawing requires 7 hours of drawing outside of class, which is always necessary to get an A. If you put in the work after class, it will be an easy A."
2691,1875026,4.0,3.0,"Great professor, really understanding and is somewhat an easy grader if he sees the effort."
2692,1875026,4.0,2.0,"Tyler is great! He is really nice and funny, and is very passionate about his work and wants you to do well. Tyler is adamant about letting ideas evolving before you start a project, and is really helpful with problem-solving and learning proper techniques. He's an easy grader if you put in effort to try new things and take risks."
2693,1875026,4.0,4.0,"A large part of the drawing class used models, so be prepared to draw people. Good balance of teaching observation skills and designcompositional elements. Helpful when it comes to suggesting sources for projects. He almost likes to approach projects as research papers; he really encourages thoughtful consideration of materials and composition."
2694,281683,5.0,5.0,"Great class. So much work though. He's really nice and promotes a great classroom discussion. Very knowledgable and interesting to talk to. That being said, it is so much work. We read 6 full length books and his papers average about 14 pages in length. If that's scary, maybe don't take it. However if you want to push yourself and learn take it."
2695,281683,3.0,4.0,"VERY knowledgeable. Also expects a lot. This class was very reading/writing heavy, and you have to manage your time because he'll give you 2 weeks to read a book and write a book report with no mini deadlines. That being said, go to office hours!! He will tell you exactly how to write the papers. Take his classes if you're interested in the subject"
2696,281683,4.0,3.0,"Great to listen lecture, but sometimes it just feels like high school"
2697,281683,4.0,3.0,"Aldridge is a passionate teacher and intellectual. He clearly knows history very well and conveys it in an engaging and witty way during class lectures. 4 for helpfulness because he gives sorta vague feedback but responds to emails immediately. He is pretty clear and will make you like history. The tests are easy, but the reading can be excessive."
2698,281683,3.5,3.0,"He is a nice man who is witty and full of energy. He is extremely intellectual and knows a ton about history. 4 for helpfulness because he will respond to your email within an hour with insightful responses. 3 for clarity, because he provides good lectures but his tests don't match his lectures. Also essays are vague. Easy tests but tons of reading"
2699,281683,3.5,3.0,"Aldridge is a very passionate teacher who is very much an intellectual. He is friendy and witty and has a bold voice. There are not many tests, and the tests are easy. The essays are vaguely stated, but he clarifies what he wants in class. Required reading is heavy. The essays are graded in a nit-picky but acceptable way. Office hours are ok."
2700,281683,3.5,1.0,"Aldridge's essays and tests are vague but not hard to do well on. Take this class if you are looking to get an easy history credit, and learn a lot about the United States. Aldridge really knows his stuff and is willing to meet during office hours to make essays less vague. His passion is about the civil rights movement, so lectures are great."
2701,281683,4.0,1.0,"His midterms and exams are simple but his essay prompts can be vague. However, if you attend his office hours he will help you focus your thesis, and he's a helpful man overall. He knows his stuff"
2702,281683,3.5,2.0,"Dr. Aldridge is a very interesting and smart man, nyuh. Lectures are from memory, goes through class on an interesting ramble. Lots of videos and other material, nyuh. Not too hard but no joke either. He's fairly helpful but it's hard to assess how much he actually listens to you. Allergic to eye contact, nyuh? (You'll understand the nyuhs...)"
2703,281683,3.5,2.0,"A pretty easy professor, the papers and tests aren't difficult, as long as you read.  Pretty good lecturer, can get annoying at times (if you take him you'll know why)"
2704,281683,4.5,2.0,Fairly easy class. He basically went over the readings from the night before. Follow his study guides for tests and you'll do fine. Papers weren't too difficult to do well on.
2705,281683,3.0,2.0,"This professor was really really boring. Am not quite sure how you can get away with teaching high school history in a 300-level class at Davidson, but he's doing it. It's not hard, but it sure isn't interesting."
2706,281683,3.0,3.0,Basically covered the textbook all over again in his lectures. His tests were easy if you followed his study guides. His essays were impossible to do well on. He is pretty good teacher if you're interested in history and is lenient if you show interest in his class.
2707,281683,4.0,2.0,"as far as davidson prof´s go, aldridge is pretty easy.  I recommend taking his class."
2708,281683,3.0,2.0,"He really knows his stuff, and I liked his lectures. However, he wasn't really helpful when I needed help with founding sources for my research paper."

2712,281683,4.5,2.0,Tests are easy to ACE but he is very reluctant to give A's on papers.
2713,2331755,5.0,3.0,"Garry Bertholf is great! The class was super interesting and mostly discussion-based, which I really benefitted from. Very knowledgeable and engaging, and really helpful in office hours. Would highly recommend!"
2714,1596526,4.5,2.0,Very helpful during office hours. Is very generous with grading. Don't put pressure on students to talk in class. Very understanding. Class is quite interesting
2715,1596526,3.0,3.0,"He's a really smart professor. You have to learn his format of writing papers, and you'll definitely get good grades. Doesn't put students on the spot in class, so that's good. You can get away without doing readings. Is very generous on participation grades."
2716,1596526,4.5,3.0,"Great professor, super interested in the works he teaches."
2717,1596526,3.0,3.0,Professor Luter is a friendly guy but is very focused on what he finds interesting. I had him for Telling About the South and the class readings were redundant and the films were nauseating- daily 2 page responses and the discussions are based on readings.DONT TAKE!
2718,1596526,5.0,1.0,Really nice professor and interesting material. Definitely worth taking.
2719,1823858,5.0,3.0,Dr. Ramanujan is a very caring professor. I am so happy that I took this course with him.
2720,1823858,5.0,3.0,Put in 9 hours a week to start learning how to code. I took this class when it was online and it was self paced which also made it difficult. I learned pretty efficiently though. Very available during office hours which helped me learn the material a lot. Great at teaching concepts and breaking it down for you. Really wants you to succeed.
2721,1823858,5.0,2.0,I took csc 121 online but his videos were very useful and in office hours he was extremely helpful if you had questions. Id take a class with him again for sure.
2722,1823858,5.0,3.0,Best Professor
2723,1823858,5.0,4.0,"Dr. R has some of the best lecturing abilities at Davidson. He exceeds at understanding students' questions and helping them to understand his answer, where other professors might answer a different question, or offer a vague answer. He assigned all work to partner pairs, but he gave me an extension when my partner didn't show up."
2724,1823858,5.0,4.0,Dr. R is one of the best teachers. He really cares about his students and makes good use of office hours. His class is hard but he is very clear about what he wants: weekly quizzes and weekly homeworks with a course final. The course is hard but Dr.R is very helpful and very thorough in his lectures. About 10 hours total spent on quiz and HW weekly
2725,1823858,1.0,5.0,"I tried to comment on this earlier but maybe it got deleted- look, this guy is a terrible teacher, a crazy hard grader, and expects way way way too much. Avoid if you are not experienced in computer science. Office hour help is very vague and unhelpful"
2726,1823858,5.0,4.0,Dr. R is an amazing teacher! He cares about his students so much and his lecture is always inspiring and fun. He explains every concepts very well and in a very clear way. Davidson should have more professors like him. Yes his office hour is very packed but I think he is always really accessible to students. Tests are ok but homework is hard.
2727,1823858,4.0,5.0,"His office hours are always packed, so it's hard to reach him for questions. The lectures are really good, but the homework assignments are long and graded harshly. The exams are moderately difficult, and there is a grade deflation so if you get an 80% in the class you get a C+. Don't take if programming doesn't come naturally to you."
2728,1823858,4.5,4.0,"He is an extremely good teacher in class, but his office hours are usually pretty packed so it's hard to reach him for questions. He makes a lot of jokes and gets students to like him. The exams are fairly difficult, but even more frustrating are the homework assignments (programs) which take many hours and are graded harshly. Overall, be careful."
2729,1823858,5.0,4.0,Dr. R is one of the best professors I've had at Davidson. Take 108!!
2730,1823858,3.5,5.0,"Dr. R is a great teacher but if computer science doesn't come naturally to you, be prepared to dedicate majority of your time to this class. The homework is very lengthy and tough and the tests are fairy difficult too. He is very available for office hours which saved some of my homework grades. G"
2731,1823858,4.5,4.0," Ramanujan is a well-respected and witty teacher, and his lectures are engaging and informative. The homework is lengthy and difficult, and office hours are fairly available but sometimes he flakes out on them. Exams are pretty middle-of-the-road, but homework is graded very harshly, so make sure you ask questions and don't make mistakes."
2732,1823858,4.5,3.0,"R is a good teacher, continuously cracking jokes and trying to reach out to his students. He is young and knowledgeable and provides good lectures, but he is a nit-picky grader and assigns long programs. He answers questions pretty well in class and is pretty good in office hours, of which he has many. Overall, he is well-respected and witty."
2733,1823858,5.0,4.0,Dr. R is one of the best professors at Davidson. Just be prepared to give your soul to computer science for a semester if programming doesn't come naturally to you. Saying the HW was tough is an understatement.
2734,1823858,5.0,3.0,Dr. R is an incredibly gifted educator. He takes concepts that could be very intimidating and breaks them down for students in ways that make them seem easy. He does so so seamlessly that I think a lot of students don't even realize what a service he is doing for them. He makes me want to go back to freshman year and be a comp sci major.
2735,1823858,5.0,3.0,"Dr. R is an outstanding professor. I highly recommend taking him for computer science. He is one of the most available professors at Davidson, and is always willing to help."
2736,2671739,5.0,3.0,"This was an incredible class. Professor Neuman takes a very discussion-based approach, most class time was spent talking about what we read for homework. It's a fair amount of reading, but it's worth it. She is so insightful and makes it clear she's interested in hearing student perspectives."
2737,2051198,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor. He is very helpful if go to him. Helped me in both my Russian and GSS studies. The readings are great and discussions were amazing. By far my favorite professor. I got a whole new understanding of queer culture in Russia and of Russia in general.
2738,2051198,5.0,3.0,Lead really interesting discussions and made the class engaging. I learned just as much about how to have good discourse as I did about Russia/GSS studies. Made class fun and built a community-one of my favorite professors!
2739,2051198,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor. He selects great texts and can draw on so many fields of study. Really helpful in office hours and genuinely cares about his students. I got a totally new perspective on Russia from his class too.
2740,2051198,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Utkin is absolutely incredible. He was very dedicated to the class and passionate about the material.  You are expected to read a decent amount, but the work is fair, he grades quickly and fairly, and he provides very useful feedback on writing. There aren't too many papers, but I feel like I learned a lot. I recommend any class he is teaching."
2741,117900,3.0,4.0,Have since taken BIO208 and am retaking 111. Her 111 class has since changed to problem sets instead of reviews and I had her during reviews which was difficult. Oversimplifies concepts in class but expects detailed/demonstrated knowledge in responses. Accessible outside of class and redeeming quality is she's EXTREMELY ACCOMMODATING. Okay advisor
2742,117900,5.0,3.0,Dr. Bernd cared so much about her students learning the material. She was so helpful and quirky. I really enjoyed her lectures. The grades could vary so much. I think she modeled her grading a lot on the amount of growth from a last assignment. I somehow got Fs on some pretty big projects but still ended with an A so there is cushion.
2743,117900,5.0,5.0,"Wonderful person. Seriously, she is amazing and a great professor and is willing to explain anything you don't understand. However, she is an extremely tough grader; be specific in all your answers, if you are not sure email her immediately, with good questions showing that you are trying. Overall, work HARD for her and she will help you through."
2744,117900,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bernd was the best professor I couldve asked for for BIO111! Her lectures could be tedious if you felt comfortable with homework, but she cares tremendously for all of her students and was the most accessible professor ever! Participate and demonstrate engagement and you will succeed. Highly recommend BIO111 with Dr. Bernd!"
2745,117900,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bernd is the kind of woman you wish was your mom. She gives off such positive energy all the time and really cares about her students. She even shortened the course load for us because she though we looked tired. She is a pretty harsh grader however, and if you didn't take AP/IB bio in high school this class is very hard. Overall, amazing woman"
2746,117900,5.0,4.0,"Hilarious and scarily up-to-date in meme culture. In terms of the class, she assigns lots of reading. If you understand the readings and use the lectures to cement your knowledge, you will do great in her class. If you cut the readings short or don't do all the work, this class can get pretty tough. Pretty tough grader on difficult tests as well."
2747,117900,5.0,5.0,"Nice lady. I mean really, she's a wonderful woman. The class is hard as hell though."
2748,117900,5.0,5.0,"Bernd is a great choice if you're ok with a B or C on your transcript. The reading assignments are no joke (but manageable), and the tests are overwhelmingly difficult and fairly long. Fairly harsh grader. However, she is funny, incredibly friendly, very helpful in office hours, and usually a great lecturer. Proceed cautiously but eagerly!"
2749,117900,5.0,5.0,"She is pretty helpful in office hours and gives very good lectures, summarizing material in a way that uses helpful diagrams and real-world examples. But I have mixed feelings about this professor, because the exams were so overwhelmingly difficult that Bio 111 did not feel like a biology course to me. Very good, but also unreasonably difficult."
2750,117900,4.0,2.0,"I'm not sure why so many people say she's tough. I took Cell Biology and Signaling with her and thought it was pretty straight forward. She gives tons of homework (though not a lot of reading) that feels like busy work, but otherwise, tests are easy, and she grades fairly. I didn't feel like I learned a lot, but her class was fine!"
2751,117900,4.5,5.0,I would rather have this teacher because she more on to you. I need a hard pushing teacher that will help you .
2752,117900,4.5,5.0,"Best professor I've had, worked extremely hard but reaped the rewards so it was worth it! READ! Keep up with the notes, do the study questions, GO TO HER OFFICE, and do the practice tests. If you turn them into her she will mock grade it and give you extremely helpful advice on them. You stand a chance of getting an A, if you don't it will be worst"
2753,117900,4.5,3.0,"She is the best professor here at Davidson. Tests are not hard because she basically gives you all the hints you could possibly need. Take this class. Great way to start at Davidson. One word of caution, read read read."
2754,117900,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Bernd is a wonderful teacher. She makes topics very clear by explaining the basics and the fundamental importance of ideas. She is lively and funny and makes classes very entertaining. Yes, her tests are difficult, but if you attend class and stay on top of the readings, you will do fine. Definitely take class from her!"
2755,117900,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher I have had at Davidson. If you take this class, you basically have to teach everything to yourself. She plays major favorites, and if she doesn't think you are majoring in Biology, she will not give you a good grade. Do not take her if you want to make a good grade."
2756,117900,2.5,5.0,"Dr. Bernd is useful in office hours, but many of her lectures are pointless and she treats college students like middle schoolers. Her tests are not always straight forward and to get a good grade on it you have to say exactly what Dr. Bernd thinks (which isn't always what the study guide says). Not worth my time, made me lose interest in Biology."
2757,117900,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Bernd is the coolest. She is a great person and is very fun to be around. Her lectures and labs are exciting, clear, and informative. She hold office hours multiple times a week and is always happy to help with any topic. However, BEWARE. Dr. Bernd is a ridiculously tough grader and will teach you how to bend over, drop trou, and take it."
2758,117900,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Bernd is a wonderful professor; her lectures are crazy and interesting; she is super enthusiastic whether during 8:15 lab or afternoon office hours.  She is extremely kind and goes out of her way to make you feel welcome in her class.  That being said, Dr. Bernd is one of the hardest graders I have ever experienced in my life.  Tread carefully."
2759,117900,3.5,2.0,"She is really nice, funny, and enthusiastic. It makes you want to pay attention in class. However, she does make occasional random comments that throw you off. Oh, and she LOVES analogies, likes comparing anything biology-related to the real world."
2760,117900,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Bernd is an amazing professor. She obviously loves teaching and is extremely helpful. Go to her office weekly and participate in class. She is a very tough grader and her tests are difficult. Occasionally you may come across a question on the test not discussed in class, but is found in the book. Be sure to complete all reading assignments."
2761,117900,3.0,4.0,"She is really nice. I am not a huge fan of her class or Bio 111 in general. If you have not taken AP Bio, you are at a disadvantage. I never did figure out what was required to get good grades on tests. The Study Guide provides most of the material for the course, but it's difficult to discern what's important between the text and the SG/lectures."
2762,117900,3.5,2.0,"I thought the class was fairly easy, though others disagreed with me.  Her lectures were sometimes a bit disorganized, but overall pretty good.  As long as you are willing to do all the reading, you shouldn't have any problems."
2763,117900,1.5,5.0,DO NOT TAKE INTRO TO FORENSIC SCIENCE! It wasted all of my time and I failed the class because it is graded so hard. There are multiple assignments every week. this class was awful
2764,117900,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bernd is a great teacher. You will learn a lot from her, but she is one of the toughest graders that I have had at Davidson."
2765,117900,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bernd is one of the best professors I have had at Davidson (and I am a senior bio major).  She is extremely passionate and VERY helpful if you need it.  She is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, but she is one of those professors who makes you want to do well.  TAKE CELL BIO!!!"

2772,117901,3.0,4.0,"I really struggled in this class to learn the content and tests are ridiculously hard if you miss class or don't read the textbook before class. I learned too late the best way to succeed is to have two notebooks, one for class notes and practice problems and one for textbook notes. GO TO AT's FOR HELP AND DO THE HW WITH THEM!"
2773,117901,4.0,4.0,"If you took AP/IB chem, this class isn't that bad. He is very very picky when it comes to labs and homeworks (will take out points for the smallest things). He is a genius and really knows what he's doing, and he's sweet in and out of the classroom. Thew reviews are kinda hard, but he post past reviews that help a lot. Super sweet but kinda boring"
2774,117901,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Blauch is a really nice professor and great lecturer. He explains the material really well and the homework problems correlate to what we'll see on the tests. The tests are challenging, but doable. He also is a very lenient grader! I highly recommend for CHE115"
2775,117901,5.0,4.0,"Professor Blauch is extremely accessible outside class and explains concepts very clearly. Also, he is not a tough grader (he's sometimes picky about details such as significant numbers, but he gives generous partial credits to answers with incorrect final results)."
2776,117901,5.0,4.0,Loved this class! The material was difficult but his lectures did a great job explaining concepts. He really knows his stuff and I felt like I learned a lot. You have to work hard but it's worth it. I would definitely take another class with him!
2777,117901,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Blauch is a good lecturer but he can definitely drag on, because his classes are so lecture heavy. In addition, he's insanely smart which means he definitely expects a lot from his students (often more than they can provide). However, he is helpful and accessible when you ask him questions/set up appointments."
2778,117901,4.0,5.0,"He's brilliant and a great lecturer, but his expectations are borderline unreasonable"
2779,117901,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Blauch's lectures consist mainly of doing problems instead of teaching concepts. There also seemed to be a big disconnect in those problems taught in class, the problems on the homework, and the problems on the test. Consistency in these problems would have made the class much more understandable. His outside help was rarely helpful."
2780,117901,1.0,4.0,"He's a very nice man, however his lectures are completely unrelated the homework. And while the homework is helpful for understanding the concepts, his tests are incredibly difficult."
2781,117901,3.0,3.0,"Blauch is an absolute genius and a super sweet guy. That being said, I never understood a single lecture he gave - and I read before class and participate. He expects you to be on the next level ish and the labs and hw are beyond hard. Srsly invest in an answer key and buddy up with the smartest premed. Office hours are ok. The final made me cry"
2782,117901,1.0,3.0,"He may be the worst lecturer at Davidson.  His work on the board is usually irrelevant and have nothing to do with the topics we are covering in the homework and tests.  While this causes the material on the tests to be hard, he is generally pretty liberal about giving out partial credit, and OWL homework is pretty easy when the site works."
2783,117901,4.0,4.0,He is very lecture based and not discussion based at all...it made me want to sleep in every class.4
2784,117901,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Blauch is difficult and can come across as harsh and strict. His lectures are often confusing, but he can explains concepts very well in office hours. Tests are hard but fair. Lab is very relevant to class material."
2785,117901,4.5,4.0,Extremely helpful and willing to take lots of time to make sure that you understand a subject. Teaching style works great for this class.
2786,117901,1.0,5.0,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2787,117901,4.5,4.0,"Gets a bad rap for being too hard, but he's the man for upper level classes.  Perhaps the smartest person I've ever met, he really knows his stuff and is great in experimental chemistry."
2788,117901,1.0,5.0,BOOOO
2789,117901,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Blauch knows his stuff, though sometimes forgets that 121 is not all chem majors who know their stuff too.  however, i think that the math basis for 121 is what most students really don't like, not the professor.  you just gotta do the work."
2790,117901,2.5,5.0,"Dr. Blauch is a very intelligent man, but unfortunately he expects all of his students to be at the same level he is, and as such getting help can be very frustrating if you don't understand something immediately."

2792,117901,3.5,5.0,Good teacher...very intelligent
2793,1760397,2.0,1.0,"Humes was the worst class I've taken, but not because of Boyer. His unit was amazing, but his organization of Humes needs to be changed. Plus, the other professors in the class were extremely disrespectful towards students with different opinions than themselves. Boyer himself is helpful, but I would never recommend this class to anyone. "
2794,1760397,2.0,4.0,Do not take humes. He graded purely through ranking us (I assume because it was never clear). He did not answer any of my emails and did not communicate criteria for assignments clearly. At no point during this class did I feel sure that I was doing the work correctly because he provided so little instruction or show he cared about students at all.
2795,1760397,4.0,3.0,"Professor Boyer is smart, and the course is interesting. I take other courses with a more exclusive focus, but this course still provides many useful information although sometimes we went through concepts too rapidly without discussing them more in detail."
2796,1760397,2.0,3.0,"He is a disorganized instructor, assigning a lot of work. He asks a lot from his students, but he doesn't make his expectations clear enough. Definitely a tough grader without clearly stating his grading criteria."
2797,1760397,4.0,3.0,"Boyer is kind of a jerk, but kinda nice and so smart. The man reads 8-10 hours per day. He's super witty and the smartest man I've ever met. He forces you to think. I signed up for his &quot;Spanish&quot; class, and entered into a Spanish + Philosophy + Linguistics + history + Literature class. If want an adventure, take his class. You won't regret it."
2798,1760397,4.0,4.0,"Dr Boyer always keeps the seminar based class interesting. His interpretations of texts are very insightful, but he goes off on tangents and can be unpredictable. Grades are based on two essays, participation, a midterm, and a final. His exams are difficult, and he takes a very long time to give grades back"
2799,1760397,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Boyer doesn't assign much homework in 260. His classes are interesting but he goes off topic to rant... a lot. He's laid back but maybe a bit disorganized. Overall, I really liked him as a person and thought the class was interesting. He does take forever to turn back grades and 45% of the semester grade was due in the last week... not cool"
2800,1760397,3.0,4.0,"Condescending. Gratingly sarcastic. On the quizzes/tests, he puts the concepts that either a) you have talked about the least in class or b) are the most confusing, just to trip you up. He makes everyone so tense that my classmates and I dread going, and it seems he like takes joy in our pain. You will learn a lot, but at a high emotional cost."
2801,1760397,4.0,4.0,"Truly one of the best instructors I've had. He expects a lot from his students and makes you think. Through his dynamic and passionate discussions, my Spanish improved tremendously without it feeling like a chore. That said, you will work hard for this class with reading and writing assignments. He gives great feedback and wants you to succeed."
2802,1760397,4.5,4.0,"Patricio is the most phenomenal professor, individual, and scholar that I have come across thus far.He will challenge you, but your Spanish WILL improve, but what's more, your scope of what ""academia"" entails will expand exponentially. Highly highly recommended."
2803,1760397,4.0,3.0,Patricio is one of the smartest people I have ever met. He's a great lecturer and his sense of humor makes class fun. But he can be unclear in his expectations and he's pretty disorganized. He expects you to  grasp the material at a deep level that really challenged me and made me think. Overall I would definitely recommend taking a class with him!
2804,1760397,4.5,3.0,"Professor Boyer is great!  His class if very interesting and got me hooked on Spanish.  Class participation and lots of reading are definitely required, but overall the workload wasn't too bad.  His sense of humor is fabulous.  He really pushes you, so don't take this class if you just want to get your language requirement out of the way."
2805,1760397,4.0,3.0,"Some people are annoyed by his sarcastic personality, but I adore Professor Boyer and his sense of humor.  The workload is not too bad, but class participation is a must.  His 260 is the best preparation for 270, so definitely take it with him if you plan to continue Spanish.  Highly recommended!"
2806,1760397,3.0,3.0,He challenges you. It is difficult to understand during the beginning of the class but my spanish improved a lot because of being challenged. If you participate you will be fine. If you don't talk to him and figure out a way for you to participate. His final was kind of difficult but papers are not bad if you put the effort
2807,1760397,3.0,3.0,"Brilliant man not meant for those with a weak tongue in the spanish language. Easy grader, writing and class discussion regurgitation on paper. Difficulty lies in understanding the class discussion fully. Class slightly recommended."
2808,117902,1.0,4.0,"Very Questionable grading. Won't give full feedback, extremely necessary to visit in office hours."
2809,117902,4.0,4.0,This class was awesome. Dr. Hales was super tough but she loves what she does and wants to help as many students as possible. The workload wasn't bad at all. Would definitely recommend if you're passionate about science.
2810,117902,3.0,4.0,"A very intelligent, caring professor. However, Dr. Hales is a very, very tough grader. Very hard to earn full marks on anything. She always is willing to help outside of class, but you definitely need to have a grasp on concepts yourself."
2811,117902,5.0,4.0,There was a lot of reading to prepare for each class. There were specific answers she was looking for on exams and marked off if you didn't arrive at the answer. Overall I learned a lot and would recommend for premeds.
2812,117902,4.0,4.0,Incredibly intelligent teacher that really cares for her students. She's very dedicated to what she teaches and goes into lots of detail on whichever topic she covers. Although she teaches a lot of content all you have to do is show some care too and take good notes and not be afraid to ask her questions. She's more than willing to help.
2813,117902,5.0,5.0,Very intelligent. If you put the effort in she'll respond to that. Her tests are short answer and make up a good portion of the class. She provides you with a study guide/lab manual for the class which was invaluable in studying for the tests. If you like bio and are thinking pre-med this class won't kill you
2814,117902,3.0,5.0,"Hales was a very picky and tough grader. The class average for exams and lab reports was frequently in the 60-70% range (for the final exam, which was worth 20% of the grade, the class average was 67%). That being said, she is fairly clear during lecture in explaining processes, but you really have to know your stuff."
2815,117902,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Hales is an amazing professor. She truly cares about helping her students succeed and is definitely passionate about her teaching--You can tell she truly knows her stuff. With that being said, Hales is an extremely difficult professor--test questions are all essay based. Don't take her if you are not prepared to work."
2816,117902,4.5,4.0,Hales is awesome. You learn so much. Textbook is helpful but not needed bcuz lecture is quite in-depth. There is a diverse arrangement of assignments - means there is a TON of work for the class but test alone will not determine your final grade. You can fail a test and still leave with a B. She curves. A great lecturer and is very helpful.
2817,117902,4.5,4.0,"This class was awesome! She has the burden of cramming so much genetics in such a short time so class can move fast. Book is really just supplementary, for your own pleasure. Test ?s are from lecture. Still, she teaches to teach rather than to test. You will never memorize useless facts. The class was meaningful. I highly recommend her class"
2818,117902,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Hales is the best! She is hard and expects a lot from you, but she is fantastic in lecture and brilliant at explaining concepts. She is a tough grader and her tests are all long answer, but she is fair and really wants you to do well. I can't wait to take another class with her! You will learn so much about bio; more detail than any other prof"
2819,117902,3.0,4.0,Extremely difficult. All of her tests are simply essays...other bio professors aren't like this. Do not take Dr. Hales for 111 unless you are a terrific writer and no other teacher is teaching it that semester
2820,117902,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Hales is amazing.  She is not the most entertaining or funny, but she is brilliant. She also obviously loves teaching and puts a tremendous amount of effort into helping students.  She is hard, but gives students all the tools they need to succeed in her class."
2821,117902,5.0,5.0,"Very sweet and helpful outside of class, and her lectures are straightforward to understand. Not the most animated, but really knows and cares about what she teaches."
2822,117902,5.0,2.0,"This class was amazing! I had absolutely no interest in the material at the beginning, and I ended up loving it! Dr. Hales is a talented scientist and teacher...you can tell that she really enjoys what she's doing. If you know the study guide, tests aren't too bad. Super nice, helpful and understandable. Take her class...she's amazing!!!"
2823,117902,5.0,4.0,"GREAT TEACHER! Best teacher i have had at davidson. You can really tell that she loves teaching and biology. For me, this class confirmed that biology is what i should major in.  I never was bored in lecture! However, be prepared to work hard, and go see her in office hours if you dont understand something, she likes to see  that you are trying."
2824,117902,1.0,5.0,She is a very boring lecturer. The lab was inopportune to say the least.
2825,117902,5.0,4.0,"This is a GIFTED professor. If science is your interest, then Dr. Hales will help you see and understand scientific thinking. You will discover the value of hard work. She didn't win a teaching award by accident. I think that her passion for teaching really shows. And, she can even make genetics interesting."
2826,117902,5.0,5.0,"Very hard, but really nice and you'll learn lots."
2827,117902,3.0,4.0,"Picky as in wants you to write a novel for every question. If you aren't very verbose, you might have a hard time getting an A on a test - no matter how much you know. Lab is really time consuming!! Not a fun class."

2829,117902,3.5,4.0,Tough grader but great class. I am a prospective Bio major and this is the kinda class you want to let you know if you can 'handle' the major or not.  I'd say its worth it.
2830,117902,4.0,4.0,She can be pretty picky and demanding.
2831,117902,4.5,4.0,Dr. Hales is a brilliant & caring bio prof.  ALWAYS available & willing to assist her students.  A+
2832,117902,4.0,4.0,"Students complain about her being a picky grader, but it's really just her insisting on students being well-prepared, knowledgeable, and articulate.  Dr. Hales knows her stuff, and after you take a class with her, you will too!"
2833,117902,5.0,4.0,"She teaches very fast, and is a very picky grader.  She teaches better when you go to her office and talk to her one on one.  After I went to her ofice my grades started to increase."

2837,117905,5.0,2.0,"Barnes's seminar on ""Everyday Life"" in Early Modern Europe was a great experience.  He expects a lot of his students, but he is always more than ready to help and is always encouraging.  Lots of high-level readings that inspire great discussions with his help."
2838,117905,2.5,4.0,"This professor was nice and helpful during office hours, but he was not a very good lecturer, and he confused me so much! He would say things that didn't match up with the book or a previous lecture, and he always made awkward jokes in class. I loved the topic of the class, and thought he was a nice man, but I just didn't enjoy his class. "
2839,117905,4.0,3.0,"Barnes is a great lecturer, really interesting. He's also great in office hours, definitely go for help on papers, just to go over material. His quizzes are very detailed, it's really hard to do well on those. But, he must curve and makes a bigger deal out of your papers than the quizzes. You'll need to do the reading, but lectures come from book."
2840,117905,4.5,2.0,"Barnes is awesome. Gives good lectures and knows his stuff.  Class is mostly lecture based, but discussion is encouraged. Workload is relatively light but tests and quizzes are very specific.  Office hours are very helpful - he will even give you books off his own shelf for research. Plus, he wants to get to know you. Great guy, great class."
2841,117905,3.5,4.0,"Started the semester with mildly awkward lectures but he got much better. His reading quizzes are very specific and he wants you to hone in on major and minor details, so be prepared to memorize names, dates, and favorite grocery stores. He is very nice and willing to help. Wants discussion in class, so ask questions. Lots of reading. He 's sweaty."
2842,117905,4.5,3.0,"This is the second course I've taken from Barnes.   He seems to have mellowed some, but he is still quite passionate and interesting.   If you like history, you'll like his classes."
2843,117905,4.0,4.0,"Barnes is a pretty passionate, fun teacher and you can tell he enjoys teaching. His magic and witchcraft course was very interesting, but the papers were really hard. He wants you to do well, but was often really critical on each paper. Unlike me, if you are good writer and do the reading then you will succeed in the class"
2844,117905,3.0,2.0,"Professor Barnes is incredibly nice and wants you to succeed. However, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I'm serious. He is not at all a dynamic lecturer, and ran out of material before the class was over. For one homework assignment, he made his students workshop his unpublished article. Nice guy, but an academic, not a teacher. I did not learn anything."
2845,117905,5.0,2.0,"Very helpful.  He wants you to succeed.  He can be tough, but is always fair."
2846,117905,5.0,2.0,Really good prof.
2847,117905,5.0,5.0,Average grades on the 3 tests we had were in the 50s or 60s. He curves near the end but not enough to help unless in top half of the class. Would not recommend unless willing to work your butt off and dedicate the majority of your time to this class.
2848,117905,3.5,4.0,"Had him for Early Modern Europe. The title is deceiving it covers the 1500s to the 1800s. Very boring lecturer. Tons of reading each week. Tests are very hard, memorize primary sources and all details including minute dates, publishers, and quotes.  Only a paper every Thursday per week.  Class=Ok if really interested.  If you are not=awful"
2849,117905,3.5,4.0,"Getting an A is close to impossible, his lectures are just like the readings, nothing new or really interesting. Grades tough and midterm and finals are hard. He is always ready and willing to help though."
2850,117905,3.5,4.0,"Very passionate about what he does. Don't take him for an 8:30. Grading scale was 4 papers, one final and one quiz. And weekly reading assignments. Not too bad but the final was killer"
2851,117905,4.5,3.0,"didnt really know what to expect from the class, but learned a lot and ended up loving it. almost took it pass/fail and ended up with an a-. recommend taking anything with barnes"
2852,117905,4.0,3.0,"Though his lectures can be a bit boring, I'd recommend taking a class.  He's smart and willing to talk about papers and assignments and offer help.  Not a tough grader either, which is good.  He did make me very interested in early modern Europe, so that's got to count for something"
2853,117905,3.0,3.0,"Avoid taking. Lecture is merely a repetition of the text, research projects tend to be limited and boring.  He doesn't seem to have his lectures thoroughly planned, and thus key material is left out."
2854,117905,4.5,4.0,"Good professor. Really wants his students to do well, so he'll read over papers and helps tons in office hours. Is not an expert on Medieval Europe and is very open about that, but I still learned a lot."
2855,117905,2.5,5.0,"I was excited about the topic, but warned not to take Barnes...but of course I didn't listen.  Big mistake!  He has unrealistic expectations.  He expects you to remember insignificant, little details from the readings (average score on 1st reading &quot;quiz&quot; was 50%). Lectures unstimulating.  Structure of class = wierd for a 300 level."
2856,117905,4.5,3.0,"very hard-working, nice"
2857,117905,4.0,3.0,A really nice guy. His lectures are a little bit dry sometimes.
2858,117905,3.0,3.0,Class was pretty interesting. Barnes was enthusiastic and helpful (office hours were pretty good) but very disorganized.
2859,117905,5.0,4.0,"awesome teacher.  very enthusiastic about the subject.  definitely demanding, but in a good way -- not unrealistic."

2861,117905,4.5,4.0,"Loved his class. Learned a lot and became a better writer. Entertaining speaker and good lecturer, even better as the course went on. Comments on papers were thorough and thoughtful. Readings can be exhausting, more writing than you'd find in similar classes and writing assignments were demanding. Office hours proved really useful."

2864,117907,4.0,3.0,One of my favorite professors this semester in my freshman year. He was a sweet man and probably one of the most beloved professors on campus. He was a joy to be around and was extremely helpful to the point that I went to see him almost every day during the week. He will be dearly missed. RIP Dr. Whitton
2865,117907,4.0,3.0,"One of the ultimate Davidson professors.  One of the coolest people you will ever meet, tells awesome stories on a near-daily basis, and knows his stuff.  Phenomenal office hours and really cares about his students.  You need to take at least one of his classes before you graduate."
2866,117907,4.0,4.0,"Calculus was really difficult for me, but I took advantage of Whitton's excellent office hours and managed to get a B+.  He is an extremely nice and understanding guy and will do everything possible in office hours to make you understand. Lectures are a bit rushed.  Chicken dinner is a highlight of my life."
2867,117907,2.0,2.0,"Dr. Whitton is a very nice man, but not a good teacher. His lecture consist of rushing through &quot;interesting&quot; proofs that have nothing to do with his tests or homeworks. However is you do the homework the tests are not bad. His semesterly fried chicken dinners are amazing."
2868,117907,4.0,3.0,"I love Dr. Whitton! I've never been good at math, but he made me feel brilliant. i didn't care about the subject, but since he cared, I listened. The class isn't hard; do the hw and go to his office hrs as much as you can, esp. before reviews, and you'll be fine. He doesn't want ppl to fail. Also, his chicken dinners are fun and nice to go to."
2869,117907,5.0,2.0,"I LOVE THIS MAN! Kind, Helpful, and Entertaining. I will be attending every one of his semesterly fried chicken dinners till I graduate! Take the class if for no other reason than for the chicken!"
2870,117907,3.0,4.0,"Friendly man, yet a bit forgetful. Called me the wrong name all semester. Mostly helpful, yet moves very quickly through the material."
2871,117907,4.5,3.0,"I am a terrible math student, but was lucky enough to get Dr Whitton in his first stint teaching Exploring Mathematical Ideas. He is wonderful--always willing to see you during office hours to help, always with a smile. He truly wants his students to do well. If the material goes over your head, he will explain until you get it. Highly rec'd."
2872,117907,5.0,2.0,He is the best math teacher I have ever had.  I learned everything I needed to know from his lectures.  He's a nice guy too.
2873,117907,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Whitton is one of the smartest and most accomodating profs I've ever had.  He is ALWAYS available at office hours. However, his intelligence often meant that he sped through material, leaving much of the class including myself totally confused. This is a very hard class, and the only way I learned the material was by seeing him in office hours."
2874,117907,5.0,3.0,"If you like math and dry humor, Whitton is THE man.  Has hilarious little stories that he will tell two or three times per semester, always very laid back and personable.  Covers everything you need to know for reviews in the lecture... you'll never find yourself staring down a concept you've never seen before on one of his tests.  Wonderful prof."
2875,117907,5.0,3.0,I am no Einstein but this man made me like Calc. If you ar willing to work and you run into a wall...run to Dr.Whitton. He can make this subject sooo understandable. The name of the game is teaching; and he is a heck of teacher. Thanks for curing my &quot;calcuphobia.&quot;
2876,117907,4.5,3.0,"My favorite professor at Davidson, hands down. The kind of guy you want to invite to parties because you love him and he loves you. It's a lovefest and you'll learn a lot."
2877,117907,4.5,2.0,"He's awesome! His anecdotes are hilarious! Additionally, his office hours are in the union, and he's so helpful."
2878,117907,5.0,3.0,GREAT GUY!  The most office hours of anyone I've ever met.  I love Dr.Whitton and you will too!
2879,117907,5.0,3.0,best math teacher there is at davidson. just an awesome guy
2880,117907,4.0,3.0,"Awww, the cutest man ever! Even though his lectures are a little vague, he tells some pretty amusing stories and he's just such a nice guy.  A big sports fan so you'll see him at events."
2881,117907,4.5,4.0,Awesome professor.  Very nice outside of class and helpful during office hours.
2882,117907,4.5,3.0,"Dr. W is the man.  He is a super nice guy and cares about every student he teaches.  He is VERY smart, which sometimes makes him hard to understand when he is explaining things.  If you go see him, he will not let you leave until you understand the material."
2883,117907,5.0,3.0,"Dr Whitton rocks.  Simply put.  He's friendly, and really cool.  He really loves math, which makes it easier."
2884,117907,5.0,2.0,"Thorough teacher, interested in making sure everybody understands the reasoning behind the process"
2885,117907,4.0,2.0,Not much homework for a math course. Tests are hard but always scaled.
2886,117907,4.5,2.0,"As long as you do the homework, you can pretty much sleep through Dr. Whitton's courses.  Not that you'd want to, because he's a very entertaining lecturer, but since he teaches at 8:30 often, you don't always have a choice."
2887,117907,2.0,3.0,"nice guy, teaching is vague and just not understandable."
2888,117907,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2889,492693,4.0,4.0,Very nice guy and professor. You can tell he really likes what he does and enjoys history. He lectured a little but he will call on you so be ready to participate. We had a couple projects to analyze primary sources but he wasnt a terribly tough grader. B- to B+ was the general range so an A might be tough but a good grade shouldnt be.
2890,492693,5.0,3.0,"Really knows his stuff. Great teacher, cool guy. Through readings and in class conversation you really learn. Not much work except reading. A few projects take a bit of time. You learn a lot, not too much work, and he's not a terribly difficult grader."
2891,492693,3.0,4.0,"On one hand, Dr Guasco's lectures were often dull and 40% of testing was focused on memorization, but if you are good with remembering which people said what, you'll excel that part. Papers were interesting, but he took a long time to grade them. On the other hand, he is really helpful and cares about his students. I'd give 5 to his personality."
2892,492693,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Great lecturer. Funny and kinda awkward, but not in an intimidating or mean way. Not too hard either."
2893,492693,5.0,4.0,"Guasco loved the material and finding new ways of looking at trite stories. Some of the reading and writing assignments were intensive, but he'd break them up with weeks of practically no homework. Paying attention to details and participating in class were really important. Would take again"
2894,492693,4.5,3.0,"Guasco was fantastic. Learning is lecture based, and readings are minimal. If you pay attention in class and do your papers the right way, a good grade is not hard to come by."
2895,492693,4.5,4.0,Guasco really pushes you to think critically and teaches you how to examine history from unique perspectives. You really establish your own opinion on a topic after writing a paper. Great lecturer and really likes class discussion. I wish I could get more out of him at office hours regarding prompts but he does gear you in the right direction.
2896,492693,4.5,2.0,"Guasco gives you the opportunity to succeed in his class. He offered to read your assignments a week before they were due and assign a provisional &quot;grade&quot; to them along with helpful suggestions. He was always willing to meet after class, but beware, he will penalize you for not participating or for using your cell phone during class."
2897,492693,4.5,4.0,"What a great guy! Guasco's lectures are interesting, and he is incredibly knowledgeable. His paper topics are imaginative and I found the assigned reading enjoyable. He is also very funny. Plus he's got that cool history nerd vibe going."
2898,492693,4.0,3.0,"Don't be fooled by his seemingly laid-back attitude- Guasco is demanding!  However, if you put the effort in, he tends to reward you with a decent grade.  Knowledgeable and approachable."
2899,492693,4.0,5.0,His lectures are interesting and he is very helpful if you go to his office hours. class participation is a MUST! especially in the discussions after quizzes. personally I found him to be slightly arrogant
2900,492693,4.5,3.0,"He is a very smart guy who wants to get you thinking, especially in this class. A critical paper grader. Definitely fits as a liberal arts teacher- Wants you to participate in class, and very helpful outside of class."
2901,492693,5.0,3.0,Very entertaining.
2902,492693,5.0,3.0,Most of the reviews of Guasco are laughable. The only reason he doesn't get better scores is because he isn't a rubber stamp 'A.' You learn more in his classes than in most and he is a better lecturer than most but all people care about in these reviews are grades.
2903,492693,3.5,4.0,"The piracy course wasn't exactly what I expected - the whole first half was devoted to studying historiography and methodology. He definetly knows his stuff and can sniff out BS. class was a lot of discussion, and was interesting if I was well prepared. He was always willing to provide outside help, but had high expectations"
2904,492693,2.5,3.0,"Do not take this class. I expected it to be very interesting, but turned out to be extremely boring. Lots of reading and hard grader. He really does seem to hold grudges for no apparent reason. Sort of smug."
2905,492693,4.5,3.0,"Great guy...really into what he teaches, and is a very interesting lecturer.  His tests are deceptively hard though...and he's a tough grader on papers.  But his coolness makes up for it.  Don't miss class or be late though."
2906,492693,2.5,4.0,"Knows and enjoys his stuff, and he picks interesting texts.  Tests, though, were very difficult and little feedback was given on how to improve.  Also felt like he held grudges for past mistakes like being late or messing up when trying to participate."
2907,492693,3.5,3.0,"dr. guasco's a huge nerd.  he loves what he teaches but i found it hard to share that love.  reading was overwhelming, as were writing assignments.  i was expecting the topic (piracy) to be much more engaging than i found it to be.  wound up dreading the class..."
2908,492693,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Guasco is such a history nerd, and it's amazing; he is animated during lectures, and loves to find humor within history.  Speaking as someone who barely passed the AP U.S. exam, his tests/papers aren't bad at all!"
2909,2628766,1.0,2.0,"I think Dr. Munger is a genuinely nice person, but to be honest I don't even think she knew my name. She took forever to respond to emails if she even did respond at all. Her lectures are pretty boring and towards the end of the semester I started sleeping through them. Despite all this she's not a super tough grader, but I've never been more bored"
2910,2628766,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Munger picks a few studies to lecture on for each class. Make sure you pay attention to these studies and take notes. The course isn't super difficult, but her expectations are not clear and she doesn't return many grades until the end of the semester. However, it's very possible to get an A."
2911,2628766,1.0,3.0,Grading criteria unclear. Supposed to be a 101 class (no previous exposure to psych) but she taught as if she expected us to already know the content. She only went over experiments and graphs but not content for psych at all. The grading was unclear as were her explanations for assignments. I really hated her class. I do not recommend taking her.
2912,2628766,1.0,5.0,She is so dry and has a boring personality. Most of the time youll find yourself reading so many chapters and coming to class and her lectures to relate to anything you read. She grades you hard for no reason. I do not recommend this professor for anyone taking psychology for the first time.
2913,1207461,2.0,3.0,"This course does not have to be straight memorization, truly it doesn't. But for some mystical reason, it is. And your memorization better be nearly perfect, because Dr. Myers has an altered grading scale to avoid giving out too many A's."
2914,1207461,3.0,2.0,"Cool professor/very nice guy, but lectures aren't that engaging. The class is mostly memorization and you don't walk out feeling like a better scientist. But maybe that's just intro to biochemistry in general. Also the deflated grading scale isn't cool, just make the tests harder or something, no one should be in the B range with above a 90."
2915,1207461,4.0,3.0,The tests were fair and grades were too. Super helpful during office hours. Class was a little boring
2916,1207461,4.0,2.0,"If you have a good chem background from high school, you should be fine. Fair grader. Dull lectures. Easy tests. Lots of hw problems due on the test day so make sure you start early. Sends a personalized email if you do well on the final :)"
2917,1207461,5.0,2.0,"Very cool, quirky professor. Knows his stuff and is very clear in lecture. Homework is all due on test day so it's easy to put it off to the last minute. If you like chem or are naturally good at it, you can get a pretty solid A in his class"
2918,1207461,5.0,3.0,Simply a great teacher and very knowledgeable. Also very helpful during office hours. Highly recommended.
2919,1207461,5.0,2.0,"Very quiet and shy but knowledga ble and helpful outside of class. TAKE THE MOCK REVIEWS, they will be your best friend. He asks VERY similar questions on his tests and the final. If you don't understand something go to him for help. And make sure you read the textbook!"
2920,1207461,4.5,2.0,"Myers is so cool. He sometimes makes very corny jokes in class that are so random that you can't help but chuckle. He keeps the class simple & is always ready to help. He drops lowest test but seems to have no sympathy in class for those not reading the book. I heard Dr.Nutt makes you fall in love with chem.. Myers didnt, but did the job just fine"
2921,1207461,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Myers is a helpful man that wants you to succeed. Not a super interesting class if you're not into Chemistry, but it is possible to do very well. I recommend his class to anyone!"
2922,1207461,5.0,1.0,"Very helpful and friendly professor. Class is easy if you pay attention. Mock reviews are very useful. Overall, a great professor."
2923,1207461,5.0,1.0,"Very helpful and clear with what he wants the class to learn. Mock reviews help a lot. Very friendly. Overall, a great professor."
2924,1207461,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Myers is a really nice guy and passionate about his field, but I would hesitate recommending his biophysical chemistry course. Be warned: it is not biochemistry without a lab, but instead a much less useful overview of biophysical  techniques with precious few interesting topics thrown in. He's helpful outside of class, especially on homework."
2925,1207461,4.0,1.0,"I took Myers because I heard he was easy, not interesting. And this proved very much to be the case. He was very straightforward and tells you exactly what you need to know in a comprehensible way. Tests were very easy. Grading is very lenient and fair. And, he wasn't even as boring as I'd been expecting. Overall, great teacher."
2926,1207461,4.0,2.0,"Easy Easy Easy! Cares about the class, lectures are boring, but easy to follow and he really wants you to do well.  I took notes and paid attention and ended the class with an A...great if you're not into Chem"
2927,1207461,4.5,1.0,Dr. Myers is simply a great professor. If you do the practice problems for homework and complete the problem sets you will do great in his class. His problem sets are almost exactly like his tests. He's very helpful and nice.
2928,1207461,4.0,2.0,"Myers is a great professor. His tests are really easy if you study, and he's always willing to explain the subject matter until you understand it. Can't wait for Chem 115!"
2929,2057386,2.0,4.0,"Her lecture is confusing and unorganized. A lot of the times you will feel that you have to teach yourself the subject, which is not fun at all if you are new to data structure. On top of that, really tough assignments despite subpar lectures."
2930,2057386,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Peck is an overall decent professor. She isn't as good as some others in the CSC department in lecture, and she grades on the hard side. Although I'm competent in both python and java now, CSC121 & 221 bombed my GPA. My verdict: mediocre lectures, slightly better office hours, tough grading, super nice person. Would recommend another professor."
2931,2057386,4.0,3.0,Put in 9 hours a week to start learning how to code. I took this class when it was online and it was self paced which also made it difficult. I learned pretty efficiently though. Very available during office hours which helped me learn the material a lot. Ambiguous feedback at times which made it difficult to grasp concepts
2932,2057386,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Peck is an amazing professor! She's passionate about her work and is extremely helpful during office hours. Although she is a tough grader, Dr. Peck gives students good feedback and provides clear grading criteria for each assignment. Dr. Peck is a true gem in the computer science department!"
2933,2057386,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Peck is a great CS professor. She is a great lecturer and happy to help you outside of class. I took Virtual Reality Seminar and Data Structures with her, and I never had a bad expression with her teaching style and the grading criteria."
2934,2057386,4.0,4.0,"You have to be willing and ready to put in some work. Answers won't be spoonfed to you; you are expected to think for yourself and learn some stuff on your own if you really want to do well. She is very kind and approachable, as well"
2935,2057386,3.0,4.0,"Solid professor, but just as with most CS classes you are expected to learn the vast majority of things on your own."
2936,2057386,1.0,5.0,"Bad lecturer, really tough grader. Would not recommend to anyone"
2937,2057386,4.0,4.0,"Really great professor IMO. Comp Sci can be tough and she definitely doesn't make it any easier, but she's always available during office hours (which you'll need big time) and is super chill. Actually cares that you learn and improve over time and requires a lot of thinking and a do-it-yourself approach to the homeworks. Go to MSC too."
2938,2057386,2.0,4.0,"Peck may be a nice person, but I found her to be frustrating as a professor. She would go over very simple concepts in class, and then without any explanation, expect you to apply these very simple concepts to a much more difficult, more involved problem. She was hard to find for help, and the Math and Science center was more helpful than she was."
2939,2057386,4.5,3.0,She's always ready to help but be ready to work! :)
2940,2057386,2.0,4.0,"She is a hard grader. Sometimes the lecture is disorganized and she made mistakes in class sometimes. She is very nice and friendly outside of class but when it comes to grading, she is harsh. Office hour is ok because they are all in weird hours of the day."
2941,2057386,3.5,3.0,"She graded programs harshly, but there were a lot of example problems in class and by the end of the semester I was getting A's. The tests were not hard, just comprehensive. She wasn't always able to answer my questions in class, but office hours were fine. She was pretty clear and very friendly. Not a great teacher, but pretty solid."
2942,2393279,3.0,5.0,"While I enjoyed Dr. Bovino's accessible teach style, flexibility, and willingness to help, I did have a problem with his arrest. I think it was inappropriate for a professor working with relatively young people to have a ch!ld p0rn issue. I learned a lot but wouldn't take this class again with what we know today"
2943,2393279,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bovino is one of the best STEM professors I've had at Davidson. He's a fantastic lecturer, extremely helpful in office hours, and made a notoriously intimidating course very accessible. His tests are hard but fair. I highly recommend him."
2944,2393279,5.0,4.0,Dr. Bovino did an awesome job teaching Orgo II. Really fun to listen to and is always available to chat or discuss course content. Great grading tendency with the curve and makes class and lab about more than just the grade.
2945,2393279,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bovino is really fun in class and has a great sense of humor, so lectures are never too dull. His grading scale is forgiving because of the curve (but it's not easy) and he is ALWAYS in his office; his office hours are really helpful and he's very approachable. Definitely wish he would get offered tenure at Davidson because he'd do a great job."
2946,2393279,4.0,4.0,"Great in office hours, overall very good teacher. Tests are tough, but he curves using the same scale as Stevens. He'll prepare you well for future chem classes."
2947,2393279,4.0,4.0,Bovino is very helpful in office hour and is always available for extra help. Can be a tough grader
2948,2737343,5.0,3.0,Absolutely amazing overall. Such a wholesome and caring person who just wants you to do well and love learning. 
2949,2737343,5.0,3.0,"As a freshman, I took her class not knowing what to expect. I had known very little about ecology and she did everything she could do to help get me through the class. She is extremely nice and caring and prioritizes mental health over anything. I would highly recommend taking her!"
2950,2553032,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Williams was a so-so professor. He does offer a lot of extra credit opportunities, which is a bonus. He wasn't very approachable, and class time was used to complete worksheets (you watch lectures on your own time). Definitely a time consuming class (but, that is probably going to be any STEM class). Tests are hard, final is optional."
2951,2413774,1.0,1.0,This professor has a bad case of TDS. Classes aren't interesting because its always talking about her own problems. I feel like I'm the therapist listening to every single thing she wants to complain about. Wouldn't recommend this professor.
2952,2413774,5.0,3.0,"Prof. C is an amazing professor! She is super passionate in class, and that made me excited to learn. If you go into the class knowing it's reading heavy and are prepared for that, it's super fun. She also has a good sense of humor and is a professor who I felt like I could form a real connection with. Highly recommend! "
2953,2413774,4.0,2.0,Crowder-Meyer is a gem. POL 121 is lecture heavy but discussion days were really interesting. There is a lot of reading but all material in the readings is covered in lecture. Her grading criteria is really clear and reviews are straightforward if you pay attention and take notes.
2954,2641106,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Race is one of the nicest professors at Davidson. I'm honestly pretty bummed that she's not coming back to Davidson next year. If you just talk to her and ask for extra time, she'll give it to you. She's understanding and just absolutely wonderful! Class discussions were always interesting, and I learned a lot about Russian lit and culture!"
2955,2677987,4.0,2.0,"Understanding-wise, you get out what you put in, but grade-wise, you're nearly set. Attendance had no impact on your grade, and nearly all content on weekly HW and the 2 reviews was based in the textbook. Due dates are flexible if you communicate. If you're not a math person, I recommend this class - the content is easy to grasp without much work."
2956,2677987,5.0,3.0,Professor Troyka was an extremely kind and relaxed professor. He was understanding of student schedules and is very flexible with due dates if you give him advanced notice. He's also amazing at lectures. He has a way of engaging the class with a not so common topic. He's a little awkward but in a good way. I would definitely recommend his class!
2957,2677987,4.0,2.0,I am a freshman this year and had Justin for Math 108 and it was my easiest class. HW is 40% of the grade and the TWO reviews you have are only like 20%. If you need an easy math credit I recommend Math-108
2958,2677987,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed Dr. Troyka's class. While the content was fairly difficult, Dr. Troyka made it much easier to understand and accommodated many different learning styles in his lectures and explained things in multiple ways. He also made it a point to be accessible to students and was always willing to listen if a student didn't understand content."
2959,2677987,5.0,3.0,"Loved the class even though Math isn't my favorite subject. Dr. Troyka was super accessible and was very caring. The one downside is that the class was mostly in a &quot;flipped classroom,&quot; but this is only a personal preference. Dr. Troyka also loves math and the material covered in the class. Highly recommend Dr. Troyka!"
2960,1916134,5.0,4.0,"Love her! Not what I was expecting from a dance class, it was so much more! I learned a lot and am grateful for the hours of patience and guidance she gives in office hours. So passionate about what she teaches and helps us succeed in class thru her efforts"
2961,1916134,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Bory is a great professor if you love a challenge and are willing to work hard. She is a very critical grader on papers and has expectations that are difficult to meet. She is always willing to help outside of class, but when I tried to use her suggestions it didn't improve my grade. Dr. Bory is an interesting and caring, but tough professor."
2962,1916134,3.0,3.0,An average professor. I felt like she could have done a lot more with the class. Also was a tough grader on papers and how she graded your actual work in class (dancing) was unclear. Felt like she was trying to make sure everyone took her class seriously rather than focusing on the actual content. Overall an OK class and a nice break from a  desk.
2963,1916134,3.5,2.0,"Dr. Bory is so passionate about her subject, and it really shows!  She is so helpful during office hours and really wants her students to succeed.  Sometimes, however, her lectures can be confusing and sporadic or unclear.  Really good professor, though!  I highly recommend her."
2964,476393,4.5,2.0,"Extremely personable and nice. She is an expert in her field, this sometimes gets in the way as she discredits things in the book, which is confusing at times. Her tests are picky, but she is very generous on papers. I loved this class"
2965,476393,5.0,3.0,Dr. Turner is my favorite professor at Davidson and doesn't even teach my major! She is unbelievably helpful in class and in office hours.  Class is almost always interesting due to her interactive examples.  She is clearly an expert in her field and her extensive experience teaching has allowed her to really understand her students! Take the class
2966,476393,2.5,4.0,She cannot dismiss the smallest details and is extremely judgmental of the smallest things.
2967,476393,2.0,3.0,"Turner graded extremely hard on the tests, but not too hard on the speeches. She is very picky, and I was surprised at how much she excepted you to know for a 101 class and a class that does not even fill a requirement. She is useless in office hours. She will refer you back to the book or tell you to take better notes."
2968,476393,5.0,3.0,"Sweetest professor, she cares about all of her students and is so helpful. I definitely recommend this class. You will work hard and you do have to study for the tests but the hard work pays off. Taking this class is worth it even if you're not interested in the subject just so you can have a relationship with Dr. T. Great lady!"
2969,476393,4.5,3.0,Nice lady and really cares about her students.  I lost interest because we followed the book to the letter.  Wish she would move away from the text at times.  Speaking practice many times to forced and structured.  Didn't really allow for variation from typical form.
2970,476393,5.0,4.0,"Really helpful, pationate about her subject.  You gotta do the work - like any Davidson class, this one's not a free ride down easy street if you sit back and do nothing.  See her outside of class - she's great to talk to!"
2971,476393,4.5,3.0,"OK i understand everyone's reaction to her being a bit tough... but honestly, she's a really nice lady who wants her students to succeed. She REALLY encourages her students to talk to her outside of the classroom and is very accessible for help. Yes there's an austere side, but she very rarely exposes it. I DO suggest this class."
2972,476393,2.5,2.0,"She seems nice and well intentioned, but has can't get it through her head that she's not teaching the Davidson way.  She is teaching the text book, not using it as a guide for her own thing.  Welcome to Davidson, Dr. Turner.  Time to change."
2973,476393,1.0,4.0,Just not a good class.  Really think that it is not worth whole thing.  I dont understand what is into the professor.
2974,476393,1.0,2.0,No Comments
2975,476393,1.0,5.0,"Supposed to be and easy class but this b*t*ch makes it impossible.  her 3 reviews each have 6 full essays on them and they are impossible.  she cn't think for herself, and she is possibly the worst professor or teacher i have had in my entire life!!!"
2976,2675974,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bhandari has a great structure to her classes, and clearly prioritizes student success: she is there to help you understand material, not to make things hard. She is accommodating, helpful outside of class, and does a great job allowing for students to focus on their own interests through individual projects (especially important for stats!)"
2977,2675974,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Bhandari's class two semesters in a row because it she was just so refreshing and energized compared to most. She is new to the department (and to teaching) but truly cares and is always willing to give an extension if you have a good reason. Great with online class because she is young and tech-savvy. Highly recommend, esp in a pandemic"
2978,2473228,5.0,2.0,Very intelligent and kind professor. 
2979,2473228,5.0,2.0,Caring and well respected professor. I didn't like the online program that we used for lab but I feel she adapted well.
2980,2473228,5.0,3.0,"Both of the Kucheras are the best young professors in the department. Ive had Michelle for PHY200 and PHY320, and shes fantastic. Her office hours are super helpful - the only downside is that they get crowded sometimes. She gets sad, not mad, when people dont show up to class!"
2981,2553101,5.0,4.0,"Katie was such a wonderful professor for my first art class at Davidson! She really meets you wherever you are artistically, and is so caring. While it was my favorite class, it was also my hardest class with about 9 hours required each week to finish assignments, so it might not be the best choice if you're taking other intense courses."
2982,2553101,5.0,3.0,"Katie is one of the best professors I have ever had. She truly has the capacity to teach anyone how to paint, and as long as students are dedicated to the course, and are open to feedback, they will learn a great deal, and do well."
2983,2553101,5.0,4.0,Basic Painting. Vibrant and enthusiastic professor. Requires 9 hours/week outside of class to work on art (v flexible). Expects a lot of hard work from students. Intense course. Really loved this class though -- made learning painting really fun and personal. Helpful feedback which guided me on how to approach my artwork. Passionate abt art
2984,2553101,4.0,5.0,"Basic Painting. Required to spend at least 9 hours outside of class painting each week. Tough grader, even when you have put in all the work. She expects a lot out of her students. Do not take this class as an easy fourth class, this was definitely the hardest and most work-intensive class I took my semester."
2985,2553101,5.0,4.0,Drawing 101. Katie runs a very flexible class yet it has a very structured grading system. Basically she allows you to explore a plethora of different ways to draw but in order to get a good grade you need to follow her instructions. I really enjoyed the class because it allows so much personal creativity to take place!
2986,886031,4.0,4.0,"Crandall is very knowledgable but at times he forgets his students don't have the background knowledge that he does. His lectures can be hard to follow, and he does tend to ramble. Tons of reading, tons of homework. The hardest I've worked for my lowest grade. That being said, I learned so much in this class, and he's a very nice guy. Participate!"
2987,886031,4.0,3.0,"I took International Politics with Crandall last semester and absolutely loved it. I was scared going in because I heard he was tough, but the class ended up being one of my favorites at Davidson and I did well in the course. His lectures are energetic and he is passionate and humorous about the material. He makes an effort to get to know you."
2988,886031,5.0,3.0,"He is entertaining while giving lectures and extremely enthusiastic about the material. He assigned a ton of reading, but he went over them in class so skimming over longer chapters won't leave you far behind."
2989,886031,4.5,3.0,"Crandall is a great professor who is invested in helping his students reach their maximum potential.  Tough grader, but definitely saw improvement throughout the semester and grades reflected this.  Office hours are very helpful.  Would strongly recommend this class to anyone."
2990,886031,3.0,3.0,The promise of a seminar on a fascinating topic (US Grand Strategy) didn't quite deliver. Insufficient guidance on major papers. Grading is fair. Individual arguments encouraged. Mostly strong class discussion. Excellent syllabus.
2991,886031,2.0,3.0,Very hard grader. First assignment grading has everyone around same grade so nobody gets a good grade on first review followed by grading with extreme difficulty and putting entirely too much emphasis on theses. Interesting course work and good lectures but its the grade that matters in the end and it makes it not worth taking.
2992,886031,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor! Gives a ton of reading for hw but most can be understood through lectures. Always helpful during office hours or by email. Super friendly around campus (often biking). Worked under various government organizations including the Obama administration on foreign policy. I would recommend him to anyone.
2993,886031,4.5,4.0,Take his seminar! One of the best classes I've had at Davidson. He is a genuine professor who really wants you to think for yourself. While he is a self proclaimed 'absent minded professor' balance that out with the fact he recently took a two year sabbatical to run the Obama administration's Latin American foreign policy
2994,886031,3.5,5.0,"VERY passionate about what he teaches, absolutely amazing lectures. He doesn't announce assignments so read the syllabus. However, he is terribly cold and unhelpful in his office hours, doesn't give me any answers and only nods and stares. Wish he actually shared some advice one on one :("
2995,886031,2.5,5.0,"As a senior, Crandall was THE worst professor I've ever had at Davidson.  He is pro American policy and doesn't consider Latin American countries in his lecture, which are scattered and unprepared.  Multiple readings that you won't even be tested on or discuss."
2996,886031,2.0,5.0,One of the worst professors I have had. He knows the material but is unable to communicate. Lectures are scattered and lacking in clarity. It is hard to get anything out of them. Assignments are long and include 150 pages of journal articles per night. One of those Davidson profs who doesn't give A's unless your paper is &quot;publishable.&quot;
2997,886031,4.5,5.0,"Incredible teacher. knows his stuff. very hard grader, but worth it!"
2998,886031,2.5,5.0,"Dr. Crandall is really enthusiastic, excitable guy but with almost impossibly high standards. The reading he assigns is usually 100-150 pages a night, but all relevant. He's experienced in his field, but also very involved outside the college. I've heard some complaints that he seems too busy, or that teaching is not his main focus."
2999,886031,3.0,5.0,"He's super, super passionate about what he teaches, but you really have to do the work and do it on time. He want you to recount the readings in your papers, and show that you did them. Not interested in creativity. Also, very pro-American bias. Still, he's a cool cat."
3000,886031,4.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I've taken at Davidson. He's a tough grader, and he definitely has a political bent, but you'll learn a ton. He's also an entertaining and engaging lecturer."
3001,886031,3.5,4.0,"Realpolitik, my friends.  Realpolitik."
3002,886031,3.5,4.0,very good
3003,886031,3.0,3.0,"He'll get you addicted to Latin American politics with his enthusiasm. Very demanding when it comes to papers and reading. Don't be discouraged by his apparent inattentiveness and blank stares,he really does want to make you learn and love L.A. politics."
3004,886031,4.5,4.0,Enthusiastic.  Great motivator.
3005,886031,2.0,3.0,Crandall is an expert of the subject matter and cares about conveying his passion for knowledge to his students.
3006,886031,5.0,4.0,Such a passionate and knowledgeable prof.  Class discussions are alot of fun.  Can be kind of cold and intimidating sometimes though.
3007,886031,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Crandall knows a lot, but he always seems a little too busy working on his stuff to help you with yours."

3010,324901,2.0,2.0,"EXTREMELY disorganized, do not take this class if you can't stand disorganized professors. She's nice, and the actual class is not too difficult, but she frequently forgets to send out the homework until 11pm the night before its due. She gives either way too much homework or too little, and you have to participate in class to get a good grade. "
3011,324901,3.0,3.0,CONSISTENTLY SENDS THE HOMEWORK THE DAY BEFORE AT 10PM. Boring lectures but doesn't grade too harshly. Will explain her grading criteria if you challenge the grade and is very accessible outside of class. VALUES PARTICIPATION and cold calls people. 90% of class is taught in French. Horrible on Zoom but okay in person.
3012,324901,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Kruger is overall a pretty easy teacher. Her tests are exactly like the study guides. However, she gives a lot of homework problems every day and she tends to be very disorganized, when it comes to giving compositions back. Attending class is very important to do well in her class and going to AT meetings are 10% of your final grade."
3013,324901,4.0,4.0,"To start, I am terrible at speaking and understanding French. Terrible. But I ended her class with an 'A.' She worked with me during office hours, gave great feedback, and genuinely wanted me to succeed. I bombed a test once, and she let me redo it because she knew how hard I had been working. Don't get me wrong, though; it's a very difficult class"
3014,324901,5.0,2.0,"I absolutely loved having Dr. Kruger as a professor!! Seeing her enthusiasm, kindness, and sweet personality in class was always the highlight of my day. Her Quebec Through Film course was discussion-based, with three papers as assessments which she reviewed for us prior to the final draft. Light workload, interesting movies, great class. :)"
3015,324901,3.0,4.0,"Tests are extremely vocab and grammar heavy but the class is film-based, essentially expects you to self-study all materials for tests. Unless you are willing do dedicate a lot of time outside of class to learning the material you will not do well"
3016,324901,4.5,2.0,She's know her topic would always help even if your french is terrible !!!!
3017,324901,4.5,3.0,"I thought she was phenomenal. Her teaching style takes a while to get used to, the class is not structured at all. However, she always found a way to relate the discussion back to the material. Tests were very fair. She was always available and helpful."
3018,324901,5.0,4.0,"Fabulous professor.  She's very sarcastic, but very understanding and she lets you correct your essays.  I really enjoyed this class."
3019,324901,5.0,1.0,"Professor Kruger is the sweetest lady I've ever met!  She's exceptionally helpful, understanding and a good confidant.  She  teaches well (at least at the 101,102 and 201) level and keeps class interesting."
3020,324901,3.0,1.0,"This woman does not know how to teach literature. This is how she analyzes a 19th century book &quot;so what did the character on page 55 say&#63;&quot; and if you DO analyze a motif, symbol, or something interesting about a book, she'll get pissed off."
3021,324901,5.0,4.0,I really liked her-- she was very helpful and enthusiastic and pleasant.
3022,324901,4.5,4.0,One of the best professors I've ever had.  She is so nice and makes class fun.  Extremely intelligent too.
3023,324908,4.0,4.0,"hard professor, but makes you work and makes you learn"
3024,324908,1.0,5.0,sooo very bad.  going to class with him made me want to break down and cry.
3025,324908,1.0,4.0,"this man is without a doubt SATAN reincarnated into a cocky, condescending, rude man.  I would rather chop off my own foot than take another class from this &quot;man&quot;."
3026,324908,1.0,4.0,"What is it about French teachers&#63;  I had a mean one in high school, too.  And listen to David Sedaris' version of events on &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day.&quot;  Singerman was horrid - mean and sarcastic, and totally without help or compassion.  Just awful; I dreaded the class - he'd make fun of me and sweet-talk others.  Not inspiring."
3027,324908,3.0,4.0,extremely critical in an unkind way
3028,324908,1.0,3.0,Seriously he is a language party-pooper. Absolutely horrible. He has a huge ego and can never admit that he is not actually French.
3029,324908,3.0,4.0,"He is harsh to some students, but if you are on his good side, the class doesn't seem as hard. But if you can you should stay away from his class"
3030,324908,4.0,5.0,"Hard courses, but didn't grade too harshly.  Tends to focus on French culture.  Hard subject-matter, but very knowledgeable/intelligent &amp; tries best to help you understand.  Don't want to get on his bad side."
3031,324908,1.0,5.0,"He is the devil, and I hate him"
3032,324908,2.0,4.0,Ruined any confidence I had in the language and squashed any thoughts of ever taking another class within the department.
3033,324908,5.0,4.0,What an experience!  To have access to a published and respected scholor of literature and cinema!  His excellent French and willingness to work with students of all levels makes him the excellent teacher/mentor that he is.
3034,324908,4.0,3.0,"I liked him; he is very into all things French and is fair.  He could be a bit nicer, though."
3035,324908,1.5,3.0,"Intentionally intimidating, not willing to consider/listen to ideas other than his, ****.  Don't do it to yourself."
3036,324908,1.0,4.0,"Talks all in French, hard to learn and overall a bad course to take. Has potential if you get on his good side. Try to avoid, but if you get him it is not the worst thing."
3037,324908,2.5,3.0,"Not interesting course, a nice person, somewhat intimidating.  Would not recommend."
3038,2303288,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Cameron takes his job very seriously and will go out of his way to help with anything you need. Calc III is hard no matter who you have, but Dr. Cameron forces you to think outside the textbook and challenge yourself. His tests are always on the core material and graded fairly; he never will try to trick you."
3039,1553730,2.0,5.0,Hard to follow him in lectures.
3040,1553730,3.0,5.0,His lectures are very fast-paced
3041,1553730,5.0,4.0,"True gem. Held office hours for two consecutive weekends in their entirety. Spent more time than students doing econometrics, trained TAs for lab well, and made himself available as much as possible. Very intellectual but makes knowledge more accessible/understandable when prompted. Relates topics well to contemporary research too. Take good notes."
3042,1553730,5.0,4.0,Im not an econ major and Shyam has definitley been the best professor I have had at Davidson so far. He made economic of migration become my favorite class. I totally recommend his class for non-eco majors. Shyam is very very helpful at office hours and he walks you through everything you need to know to get an A. #LoveShyam
3043,1553730,5.0,4.0,Shyam rocks and he made macroeconomics my favorite class that I've taken at Davidson. He puts all of his notes online so printing those out is very helpful. He is super available outside of class and holds optional review sessions once a week to answer questions. The tests are not easy but if you go to office hours you can really learn the material
3044,1553730,4.5,3.0,Shyam is the man. He is the most available teacher outside of class at Davidson and loves helping students. Go to office hours a lot and you'll be fine.
3045,1553730,4.5,4.0,Great professor.  Extremely interested in what he teaches and always available outside of class.  The review sessions for tests are extremely helpful.  The material is tough and he moves VERY fast through lectures.
3046,1553730,3.5,3.0,"Really nice, helpful, smart guy.  Also flexible about assignments. Will answer questions inside and outside of class and does not hesitate to slow down to help students understand, though his lectures are a bit dull.  All class notes are online, so attendance is actually optional without causing any problems."
3047,1553730,5.0,4.0,He's really a very helpful teacher. He made Macro really interesting and easy for me.
3048,1553730,2.5,4.0,hard
3049,1944911,5.0,3.0,"I highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Ford. He's an amazing, interesting, and knowledgeable professor who genuinely cares about his students. He grades assignments very fairly, and the work load is reasonable."
3050,1944911,5.0,3.0,"Great professor all around. If you're serious about writing and know that you have talent he understands that and is very helpful in pushing your game to the next level. The in-class discussions almost never involved the texts, so don't bother reading the assigned pages that much. Excellent professor, though he'll be leaving Davidson soon."
3051,1944911,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ford genuinely cares about his students and their success. I was incredibly intimidated by his class at first, and struggled to understand the reading material or participate in class. However, he gives great feedback, is helpful in office hours, and even lets you turn in rewritten essays for a new grade. Very kind, great professor."
3052,1944911,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ford is one of the greatest professors to teach at Davidson! He is such a charming, passionate and friendly guy! He clearly loves what he does and cares about his students. He will do anything to help you if you're willing to ask. He makes the topic fun and gives students 2nd chances on papers! Take him while you can, this is his last year here"
3053,1944911,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ford is literally my favorite professor in the English department, possibly at Davidson.  He's the sweetest, most genuine guy, and he's full of hilarious anecdotes and bizarre facts.  Between his certified genius status and class in his spacious office every Friday instead of the usual classroom, I never dread going to his classes. Ever."
3054,1944911,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Ford is such a funny, quirky, great guy. Was not very interested in the readings he selected but I enjoyed the writing assignments and he was always available to help and give feedback. He was very hard at grading and was looking for specific things but always willing to work with you."
3055,1944911,5.0,2.0,Dr. Ford is a great guy. Will help you rework your papers and loves to discuss your topics.  Tries to help you write to your passions.  Possibly my favorite class I've taken at Davidson and definitely one of my favorite professors.
3056,1944911,4.5,3.0,Dr. Ford is very helpful and easy to approach. His initial feedback won't be very helpful but if you go and talk to him he will love to help. He also really nice to just talk to even if it is not about papers. He is also very understanding and will gladly give extensions. 
3057,1944911,4.5,2.0,"Fantastic Professor. Loves what he does. He gives really specific advice on what you should write your papers about and helps direct you to sources. Afterwards, he lets anyone revise their papers for better grades. Because of that option, hard work will easily translate into a good grade. "
3058,1944911,4.5,2.0,"A bit of a quirky guy but he's fantastic. Absolutely loves what he teaches which is fun to watch. Tests are fair, and he allows you to do revisions on any essay, so as long as you are willing to meet with him, grades shouldn't be a problem. Don't be scared by the Middle English either. He's always eager to help."
3059,1944911,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Ford is a really good professor. If you ever have any problems, you can always see him in office hours and he'll do his best to help you out. He tells you exactly what he wants to see in his papers and gives very specific feedback. It really helped me while revising my paper (yes, he lets you revise your paper for a better grade if you want)."
3060,1772880,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Leslie's worst flaw is organization - due dates change and the syllabus and moodle were directly copied from last year. A lot of textbook reading that's not super useful. He'll tell stories sometimes, which is fun, but COM101 with this guy is not a story you want to hear."
3061,1772880,3.0,3.0,Talent-wise Dr. Leslie has huge upside. He provides students with clear explanations when grading speeches and pushes his students to find their voice. The downside with Dr. Leslie is the organization. His assignments are sometimes out of place and due dates are unpredictable. Overall he is top tier with some baggage.
3062,1772880,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Leslie is one of the nicest professors I have ever taken. At times class could be a little boring, but overall Dr Leslie is helpful, flexible, and super nice and genuine. He was great to talk to outside of class, cared about students, and was very engaged in the material. Would definitely take again and recommend."
3063,1772880,1.0,4.0,"You will have a fun time in this class, but Dr. Leslie is a very bad professor who is lazy, unorganized, and not helpful at all.  He is also quite biased and fails to be professional in any sense of the word.  "
3064,1772880,2.0,2.0,"As a hopeful Communications concentrator, I was hoping to learn a lot from this class, but I feel as though I've barely learned anything. Dr. Leslie is very unorganized and always forgets to put things online for us and makes excuses about his schedule. It just seems as though he doesn't care about the class as much as he should."
3065,1772880,3.0,2.0,"Going into the class, The Right to Privacy, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, due to Dr. Leslie, I was terribly disappointed. Leslie is unclear about assignments, returns papers late and selectively, and is unorganized. Many students grew frustrated and complained to the department head."
3066,472406,4.0,3.0,"This religion-writing class was very interesting. B.V. makes you think harder and delve deeper into the topics. you may feel like you are writing many papers about the same thing for a while, but they are still very enlightening experiences and helpful. B.V. is always available outside of class, and is very kind. really nice guy"
3067,472406,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT take a W-course from this man. Not only is he disorganized and forgetful, the advice he gave me during meetings were contradicting the comments he gave me as I received my paper. He gives very few constructive feedback and grades subjectively. Don't bother: there are far better W courses to choose from. This was an unfortunate waste of time."
3068,472406,2.0,4.0,hes a joke. (in a bad way)
3069,472406,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor!  Beach-Verhey is one of my favorite professors at Davidson.  He is very personable and is really entertaining in class.  Very knowledgeable about what he teaches and explains things very well.  He is open to all ideas.  I really enjoyed going to his classes.
3070,472406,5.0,4.0,Best teacher at DC; cares about thes students and connects with them outside of classroom.
3071,472406,4.5,3.0,"Professor Beach-Verhey is a really sweet guy. He's very fair and helpful after class. He treats you like a colleague, learning from your ideas and insights just as much as you learn from his. I would definitely recommend taking a class from him!"
3072,472406,5.0,2.0,"I recommend this class to everyone I know.  He is a great guy and loves to help students do well.  The class is discussion based which is very interesting.  The three main topics that we discussed were homosexuality, the death penalty, and the just war on terror.  He presents the issues clearly and without bias.  Take this class.  trust me."
3073,472406,4.0,2.0,"He's a really nice guy, and a fair grader, although the tests are extremely easy (esp for Davidson.)  He does sometimes change the course title at the beginning of the year, so watch out for that.  He's clear, concise, intelligent, and an overall good and easy prof.  Doesn't stray from syllabus which is nice."
3074,472406,4.5,3.0,"Honestly, it's not the most interesting guy, but TBV is great.  Always in a bowtie, always has something interesting to say, always smiling.  He's not the hardest grader.  If you're looking to fulfill your religion core, take him."
3075,472406,5.0,3.0,Great professor- should be teaching full time. Definitely recommend.
3076,472406,3.5,3.0,"Good, entertaining professor. Can get a little off topic and can be somewhat obtuse."
3077,472406,5.0,1.0,"Real hottie...Looks good in Bow ties and knows it!!! But he would look good in a garbage bag... Great teacher, very intresting...Must Take."
3078,1944924,4.5,2.0,"She is readily available for help. She presents the material well, incorporating visual aids and videos. The material is easy to grasp if you read the textbook. Her lectures are interesting and not overwhelming with info. She has clear expectations. She makes an 8:15 fun! I'm so glad I had her for 101 and 241. Her classes convinced me to be a major"
3079,1944924,4.5,2.0,"I love Dr. Leyva! She is very passionate and knowledgeable about subjects. Her lectures are sometimes redundant but very easy to follow and understand. There is a lot of textbook reading, but her tests are fair, and she always provides good feed back on what she expects out of assignments. She is very helpful in office hours! I would take her again"
3080,1944924,2.5,4.0,"Dr. Leyva is a sweet woman but her lectures are power-point style with little class discussion, and zero time to  take a breath before new information is presented. I would characterize it as a grinding class with lots of mandatory reading and a very redundant class style. "
3081,1209700,5.0,2.0,Great class!
3082,1209700,5.0,5.0,"Hard grader; fantastic professor.  I got a C+ on my first paper (and it was actually pretty bad), and I worked really hard and she was very encouraging.  I ended up doing great on the second paper.  Very funny in class and very interested in the students."
3083,1209700,3.0,3.0,"She's awesome. Takes a personal interest in her students, very funny in class. Has high standards, but helps you work towards them. Encourages participation, don't take her if you don't want to work, but well worth it for good students."
3084,1994089,5.0,3.0,Super amazing prof
3085,1529194,4.0,2.0,"Great way to fulfill arts requirement, great teacher, engaging even for non-arts majors looking for an easy A class"
3086,1529194,5.0,3.0,"If you have an elevated level of interest in acting this class will be very helpful because you get individualized feedback on your work. You are not graded against the other members of the class, just yourself and your growth as an actor. Mark is an openly caring professor willing to accommodate you based on your needs."
3087,1529194,5.0,2.0,"The nicest man. He genuinely cares about each one of his students and wants them to succeed. 10/10 would take again. My volume and breath control has improved so much. If you put in actual effort, you'll get a good grade. TAKE THIS CLASS."
3088,1529194,4.0,3.0,"Sutch was a kind theater professor. He definitely cares about you as a person and tries to make sure that everyone is comfortable in class, because theater class often involves doing strange things that may be outside your comfort zone. It's not an easy class, but it doesn't have tons of reading or anything, rather it's intensive in participation."
3089,1529194,4.0,3.0,Mark is awesome for both experienced actors and theatre novices alike. 
3090,1529194,2.5,4.0,"Actually had to work very hard in this class, not an easy grader"
3091,1529194,4.5,2.0,Awesome professor!
3092,175475,4.5,4.0,"This has the reputation as the hardest 101 course for Econ at Davidson and after my experience with him this proves to be true. It is very tough but I would say his teaching style and consistency were amazing. You have to work for a good grade in this class, but very good choice if you want to continue with Econ down the road. "
3093,175475,4.5,4.0,"I expected econ 101 to be horrible and now I am considering a major. I plan on taking a class from Dr. Hess again. I appreciate that I could walk in to class and know what to expect- his lecture style is reliable, his acronyms intuitive and his quips infrequent, but worth gold . His tests are fair but challenging. His problem sets take time. "
3094,175475,4.5,4.0,"He goes through the material pretty quickly, but if you take good notes and copy everything that's on the board you'll do well on his problem sets. Study the problem sets and you'll do well on his tests. He's very helpful during office hours, sometimes even gives you the answers to his problem set questions. "
3095,175475,5.0,3.0,Most difficult Econ 101 professor at Davidson but the best if considering majoring in economics. His tests and problem sets are reasonable but not easy.  He is extremely helpful in office hours.  His jokes are surprisingly funny and always unexpected.
3096,175475,4.0,3.0,"Professor Hess is by far the most informed, most caring teacher I had my freshman year. Hess has the reputation of being the most difficult Econ 101 professor, and it's true. However he will always see you in office hours to help you with anything. Although his tests and problem sets are hard, I found this class very fulfilling! Take it!"
3097,175475,4.0,4.0,"Took this class to get the distribution requirement out of the way, ended up seriously considering majoring in econ. Probably not the easiest or funniest, but explains everything perfectly clear. Take good notes in class and you'll do fine on homework. Tests are harder than homework, but are fair. Take him if you are serious about econ."
3098,175475,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Hess is an excellent teacher. The lectures are sometimes fast-paced, but reading the chapter(s) before hearing the lecture on the topic helps. I found the course very time-consuming, but it was definitely worth investing the time. The reviews are hard, 60 minutes are barely enough to write down everything. Overall great course, great professor."
3099,175475,4.0,5.0,"This class is difficult, but paying attention to his crystal clear (although monotone) lectures with great notes will make it a lot easier."
3100,175475,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Hess moved quickly through his lectures, but if you do the assigned reading it is very manageable. He was always very willing to help when I went to see him. Very cool guy, one of my favorite professors so far. Very knowledgeable in the subject"
3101,175475,2.0,5.0,Dr. Hess essentially just copies his notes onto the board and then moves on in lectures while the entire class is confused. He grades tests extremely unfairly by measuring how well you can regurgitate WORD FOR WORD the 100+ assigned pages of his own textbook (bible) in 50 mins. He also gives you two graded problem sets/writing assignments a week.
3102,175475,2.0,5.0,"I agree 100% with what the person below said. (tough grader, not clear lecturer, etc.). His notes are very unorganized. Problem sets are done by yourself for grades and he never explains how to do any of it before hand.  He does care about his students, but he is very tough and not fun."
3103,175475,2.0,5.0,His class is incredibly hard and his problem sets are drudgery.The pace of his lectures is nonstop. Incredibly difficult grader. Not terribly understanding.
3104,175475,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Hess is great.  Econ 101 is super tough, but his class is set up really well.  He's the one you want if you're thinking about majoring in econ.  Take really good notes, be really specific on tests and problem sets, and you'll be fine.  Plus, he's a really cool guy."
3105,175475,4.5,4.0,"Econ can be tough.  Dr. Hess's lectures are well planned and he is extremely knowledgable.  Office hours are helpful.  He grades your problems sets, so you can see what you need to work on before the next review."
3106,175475,4.5,4.0,Great teacher and great guy.  He always tries to help and always welcomes questions.
3107,175475,4.0,4.0,very helpful if you put demonstrate effort! a very kind-hearted man.
3108,175475,4.0,5.0,"Tough Class but learned a lot. Course consists of in-class lectures, book reading, and problem sets. Often the reading and lectures cover different material, must study both to be prepared for the tests. Problem sets are directly like in-class examples. Demands a lot of time, but tests are fair. He has a funny, dry sense of humour! Love him!"
3109,175475,3.0,5.0,"Doing the reading before class definitely helps, it makes it easier to understand lectures (which can be hard to follow).  So nice and helpful outside of class.  Knows what he's talking about...I have learned so much in this class, it's one of the best I have taken so far."
3110,175475,3.0,3.0,"Solid. Fair. You need to do the reading to do well on tests, and you will get low scores on problem sets if you don't take down examples in class. There was only one class period where he had my attnention the whole time and it was material that wasn't on the exam, you can see he loves Econ, but he thinks  101 is drudgery."
3111,175475,5.0,5.0,Dr. Hess is the hardest professor in the Econ department but the one who will learn the most from by far
3112,175475,4.5,4.0,"Econ 101 is tough.  Learning econ takes (almost) daily commitment.  Simply doing the problem sets and the reading isn't enough.  You really have to understand the stuff.  Dr. Hess is shy, but he can explain something 100 different ways until you get it.  Wonderful teacher, and great out of class."
3113,175475,3.0,5.0,"Arguably the hardest course at Davidson when taught by Hess. Goes above and beyond the already ridiculous curriculum. That said, very personable outside of class, quite cold in class. Lecture oriented at 90 miles per hour. Ultra picky grader. Tests are difficult but fair...usually."
3114,175475,5.0,2.0,"Extremely easy class.  Everyone should take it with him.  Also very nice to talk to, outside of class."
3115,175475,3.5,4.0,"Warm hearted only outside class as he dislikes being asked questions in class because he wanted to finish the lecture. Problem sets are the worst, they take at least three sittings to complete and each sitting takes three hours. Exams are a fair test."
3116,175475,2.0,4.0,Dr. Hess is very impersonable and not overly nice.  He knows his stuff well but can be very confusing.
3117,175475,4.5,4.0,"He definately knows his stuff and is more than happy to help, you just have to find him."
3118,175475,1.0,5.0,"Hess can't even explain the law of supply and demand without confusing you.  He knows his stuff, but he has no clue how to convey it."
3119,175475,3.0,4.0,His problem sets are nothing like his tests which is really frustrating
3120,2174328,5.0,4.0,"Really interesting. History can be repetitive and rough but she nails it. She is passionate about what she does and the students are able to feed off of that. Talks to students outside of class too. Helps with papers and any needed assistance. She is a reasonable grader, but you need to put in the work"
3121,2174328,5.0,3.0,My classes with Dr. Stremlau have been some my favorites at Davidson so far. She is a fair grader and cares a lot about her students. It's hard to get into her classes so put them high on your WebTree
3122,2174328,5.0,4.0,Honestly such a wonder professor who also has chocolate for students in her office hours. She knows sooo much and loves to have long discussions with students about anything and everything.
3123,2174328,5.0,2.0,Definitely want to take a class with her again. It's not too hard to get an A and she offers extra credit.  Also super helpful at office hours. Learned a lot this semester.
3124,2174328,5.0,4.0,"Super fun and nice. Extra credit if you sing Hamilton in front of the class. Go to her if you aren't sure about an assignment. Overall a great professor, especially for a seminar class. Would have been easier if I went to her more often."
3125,2174328,4.0,2.0,Dr. Stremlau is an awesome teacher. She's a very fair grader and gives great feedback. Easy to do well in her class if you read and meet with her about assignments. Really fun to talk to and sometimes brings food to class!
3126,2174328,5.0,3.0,"One of the most knowledgable and caring professors (and human beings) I've ever met. She is incredibly passionate and cares a lot about her students. Be prepared to read... but everything is interesting. Knows a lot about history w/ specialties in US, women's, and Native American history"
3127,2334083,4.0,3.0,Dr. White is great. Tests are pretty difficult so be sure to study. Very accessible outside of class and very caring about her students. My favorite professor at Davidson
3128,2334083,4.0,2.0,"Nice professor, very straightforward class. Traditional teaching style. Tests were generally super easy, though there were always a few weird/poorly-phrased questions. There were a few projects, which felt like a waste of time, but they were graded easily, so cant complain."
3129,2334083,5.0,4.0,"Good professor, takes the time, if you meet her outside of class shell tell you what you need to know. Beware of vague assignment descriptions, and go see her if youre confused."
3130,2334083,5.0,3.0,Very accessible outside of class. Very open to feedback and genuinely cares. Easily frustrated/ticked off so be careful. Can be blunt
3131,2334083,5.0,2.0,"Dr. White is the best professor I've had at Davidson. Her lectures aligned with the readings, she was very clear in her directions for every assignment we had, she graded fairly, and was always quick with returning feedback. She was extremely accessible outside of class, and was very helpful during office hours. Her lectures were always awesome."
3132,2334083,5.0,2.0,"a simple and straight forward class. explains things really well and gives great examples. as long as you pay attention during class and read from the textbook, you're bound to do phenomenally in her class. fun projects and easy tests. highly recommend her class."
3133,2579854,4.0,2.0,Dr. Bullock is a super kind professor. She gives good feedback on assignments and it is easy to tell she wants her students to do well. The class discussions flowed well and were interesting. You'll learn a ton in public health with her.
3134,2579854,5.0,2.0,Dr. Bullock was great for public health. She's super nice and knowledgeable about the topic. She's a very fair grader and if you do all of the work and participate you will do well in her class.
3135,2723218,5.0,3.0,Worl is great. Discussion topics always make you think and are super relevant. She can be disorganized and takes a long time to get grades back but she makes up for it with awesome discussions in class. I've never been this engaged in a class before. Will take more classes with her!
3136,2723218,2.0,4.0,"Worl is the most unorganized professor I have had. She changed the syllabus many times through the semester, and did not grade anything until the last week or so of classes, so there was no ability to revise work though there was an option to according to the syllabus. Passive aggressive and unreliable. "
3137,2723218,5.0,4.0,"Homework assignments are often reading heavy and a lot of work. Gives out A's to most students, as long as you participate and submit work. Very kind and caring, will also help you find internships and job opportunities"
3138,2723218,5.0,3.0,"I actually loved ENV202 with Professor Worl. Discussions were engaging and made me think differently about environmental problems + she's a natural teacher. She's disorganized and could do a better job with spacing out assignments, but she's fair and gives a lot of extensions. She also helps you find great opportunities on and off campus. "
3139,2723218,4.0,3.0,"I've had multiple classes with her and have enjoyed all but her ENV 202 class. Lots of reading, and discussion based classes. You'll have one project that builds upon itself and takes up most of the last few weeks. Take her electives only - she isn't great at intro classes. Be aware that she works for some people and struggles with others."
3140,2723218,1.0,3.0,Professor is very unorganized. Often fails to meet her own deadlines for returning grades and her feedback is often contradictory. Classes were not particularly interesting and classes structure was always the same. Would not recommend taking this class or professor.
3141,1547670,1.0,3.0,Carl is not good at explaining what he is doing or what he wants us to do. Avoid if possible.
3142,1547670,2.0,2.0,"Confusing, bland and boring teacher. I wonder how he got to be here."
3143,703904,4.0,2.0,Professor Santamaria is very engaging and makes her class periods dynamic... that being said it feels as though you are teaching yourself a lot of the grammar concepts and vocabulary behind the scenes. Workload is manageable and your Spanish improves by the end. Definitely recommend to stick with her.
3144,703904,4.0,3.0,Santamaria is a super funny and understanding person. She gives a lot of homework but I found her to be understanding if it was turned in late. I found her to be a pretty easy grader. She is kind of disorganized and the homework assignments she gives don't follow the syllabus so if that bothers you then don't take her class.
3145,703904,3.0,4.0,"The 201 course at Davidson College is more difficult than the previous courses offered. Unfortunately, Sra. Santamaria does not cover the material being tested. She is extremely caring and makes the classes enjoyable."
3146,703904,4.0,3.0,"The class was not difficult and required very little effort. The assessments were relatively easy, but all the lessons within the course were self taught. Sra. Santamaria does not cover the material being tested. However, she is a great person that has entertaining classes."
3147,703904,2.0,2.0,Lost my final. Never replies to emails even if they are important- including the email I sent her with my final after she told me she lost my final TWO DAYS BEFORE GRADES CLOSED! emails a new syllabus every week... I learned nothing!
3148,703904,5.0,2.0,one of my favorite professors here. Understands how challenging the workload is and looks to accommodate students. Is funny and relatable in class
3149,703904,5.0,3.0,Best professor I have had at Davidson. Super funny and the class is very helpful in improving Spanish. Has an amazing sense of humor and easily accessible outside of class.
3150,703904,4.0,2.0,"Genuine, Funny, Caring, Understanding. Santamar&iacute;a is simply an amazing professor who cares about her students and their success. She will always be available to help when you need. Class is discussion based and is enjoyable. Some seem to drag on, but most days the conversation is lively and really encourages language development."
3151,703904,4.0,2.0,"Kind, helpful, humorous, outgoing professor. Accommodating to almost any problem you may have. Class highly discussion-based. Participation is essential (20%). Experimentation with language and demonstrated interest in subject matter is rewarded greatly on in-class essays (3). Previous Spanish experience helpful but class manageable without it."
3152,703904,5.0,3.0,"Santamaria is by far the best professor I have had at Davidson College. She is extremely helpful and is very passionate about what she teaches. She is always prepared, classes are always exciting and she is always available during office hours. Don't hesitate to pick Santamaria for Spanish, you won't regret it."
3153,703904,3.0,2.0,"Easy course. I only studied the night before each of the 5 ""redacciones""/tests. She was very easy going about the final paper and presentation. Basically, as long as you try to speak spanish in class she will give you a good grade. Very nice person with low expectations. A good spanish class especially if you don't intend to continue."
3154,703904,2.5,3.0,"Santamaria is a great and lively person, but her class is more textbook than actual teaching. There's a lot you'll end up doing on your own."
3155,703904,4.0,2.0,Lola is the beez-kneez. If you understand spanish whatsoever you can have private hilarious conversations with her since no one else really gets it. Also she's a flexible teacher and will help you get by if you email her. I would go as far as to say DO NOT TAKE SPANISH AT DAVIDSON WITHOUT LOLA
3156,703904,3.5,2.0,"Not a great teacher- class structure and assignments sometimes seemed pretty irrelevant and useless. 260 is alot about conversation, so there are partner discussions in class, but not graded. The essays are not about the text you read, rather a general theme/personal experience related to it.Easy grader, final research paper 10pgs! :("
3157,703904,5.0,4.0,"Lola is an incredible teacher, she was a excellent guide in my cadiz trip both as a friend and proffesionaly, i am very glad i took her class because i was extremely prepared for what i thought was going to be extremely difficult, and by the way she is very nice and makes sure you understand what you learned in her class."
3158,703904,3.5,2.0,"Relaxed teaching style is nice, however the broad focus of the class makes the discussions silly and actually makes the language harder to learn. It isn't too hard but some of the readings are difficult and the papers are really broad. I didn't learn a lot, but it wasn't terrible."
3159,703904,5.0,1.0,By far one of the best Spanish teachers I've ever had. She is so sweet and nice and loves when you are active in her class.
3160,703904,3.0,1.0,Lola is my favorite teacher at Davidson. She's really so nice and positive. I had her for 201 and took 260 largely because I thought I could get an A again- and I did. It's a good idea to be friendly with her and try to participate in class. You will make better grades if you make friends with her. She is lenient on paper grading if she likes you.
3161,703904,2.0,4.0,"If you have NO spanish experience, this class will be a real challenge. She moves along VERY QUICKLY. Tests are difficult and she is a tough grader. Our final paper was 4 pages in spanish. Very hard, but she is very nice."
3162,703904,2.0,3.0,"No! She doesn't teach very well at all, if you don't read ahead in the book (which is itself very poor) you will get confused quickly. She is very nice, but very disorganized. Don't take 101 with her - no prior Spanish experience will kill you."
3163,703904,3.5,2.0,"Santamaria is a really nice person but her class is kind of hard.  If you have taken spanish before it's not that bad.  She teaches staight out of the book which can make class really boring.  But if you go in and see her before a written assignment is due you much more likely to do better.  Overall, nice person and relatively easy class."
3164,703904,3.0,2.0,"Very nice teacher, no problems with her...but I hated her class.  I feel that everything we talked about came straight out of the book which made for some boring discussions."
3165,703904,3.0,1.0,No Comments
3166,703904,4.0,2.0,Good teacher.  Have to do a lot on your own.  Somewhat unclear on assignments.  But not too hard.
3167,703904,2.0,2.0,"Teaches straight out of the text book, which is very poor to begin with. I don't feel like I'm learning anything. A nice person, but look elsewhere in the department."
3168,374181,5.0,3.0,Really slows down pace of teaching so students can understand material. Keep up with optional homework to do well on all the take-home tests. Incorporates humor into every lecture and sometimes has days where you only have to take half a page of notes and instead learn about application of accounting to real world and Professor Baker's experiences.
3169,374181,5.0,2.0,He da best
3170,374181,5.0,4.0,Baker was such a joy. It is not necessary to go to class (no discussion or anything) but so entertaining. Beware because the first test is super easy and they get harder and harder!
3171,374181,5.0,2.0,"Wonderful professor! Lectures were engaging and clear, even to someone with no econ background. Tests were straightforward and easy if you did the practice problems. Would definitely recommend this class!"
3172,374181,5.0,1.0,One of the nicest professors at Davidson and no doubt the funniest guy in the Econ department. Such an amazing person to learn from and both his intro and intermediate accounting classes are so relevant to life after college. Definitely should take his classes. I wish he would teach more
3173,374181,4.5,1.0,"One of the easiest classes I've taken at Davidson, but Baker manages to make classes entertaining. He explains everything super clearly in class, the tests are take home and simple application of stuff from class, no trickery. I would definitely recommend the class, one of the few &quot;real world&quot; classes at Davidson."
3174,374181,4.0,4.0,He is my favorite teacher of all time! I like that he tells jokes like... what is one thing money can't buy&#63;     poverty.
3175,374181,4.5,3.0,This isn't Intro anymore. Intermediate Accounting is very fast paced. Must read and do practice problems to keep up.
3176,374181,5.0,3.0,i think he is the best teacher ever. He is so cool and helpful.
3177,374181,5.0,1.0,Probably one of the easiest classes I took at Davidson. Must take for the kicks. He is like the Daily Show with Jon Stewart in a decidedly southern way.
3178,374181,4.0,2.0,A fine American.
3179,374181,5.0,3.0,Great Accounting Teacher.  He actually still does private accounting.  Is very helpful and easy to talk to.  Enjoyable and interesting classes!
3180,2293158,5.0,3.0,"There are just some people who are born to teach, and Dr. Anstey is one of them. His teaching style involves working in groups, and at the end of class, he wraps up the material. He is a professor who is committed to office hours and often extends his time to be free for his students. Truly one of the best professors I have had at Davidson. "
3181,2293158,5.0,3.0,"Generational teacher. Kindest, most understanding teacher I've had. Best at Davidson."
3182,2293158,5.0,3.0,Dr. Anstey is an amazing teacher and I am so grateful I chose to take 115 with him. The course was fast-paced but he did an excellent job organizing the material and presenting it in a way that made it much easier to digest. Grading consists of four reviews and a cumulative multiple-choice final along with online problem sets for each chapter.
3183,2293158,5.0,3.0,"Chem 115 is a very fast-paced course, but Dr. Anstey does a great job keeping his lectures succinct and to the point. He is enthusiastic about teaching chemistry and encourages students to ask questions if they are confused. Alongside the office hours, he also holds evening sessions for test corrections, which are very helpful."
3184,2293158,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Anstey goes out of his way to help students, with a lot of help sessions outside of class, usually in the evening, which is convenient for busy students. The lectures are fast-paced because there is a lot of material to cover, but he explains concepts well. Dr. Anstey cares about all of his students' success and will go out of his way to help."
3185,2293158,3.0,4.0,"Anstey teaches really well when he elects to. great professor, but teaching style in inorganic is widely disliked. No textbook, minimal lecture (10 min per class). Class is almost exclusively spent doing group problems, which are supposed to guide you through the material. They do not. Go to office hrs and youll learn everything. he's really nice"
3186,2293158,4.0,4.0,"Inorganic was interesting. Labs were great; we always got out early and they were never too complicated, no pre-lab preparation necessary. There was no textbook, we just did group activities with some infrequent lectures. Office hours are a MUST (seriously can't stress that enough) but he's amazing to talk with. Would recommend to any Chem major."
3187,2293158,5.0,4.0,"He just started teaching here a year ago and I think he's doing a great job. Lectures were clear and easy to follow. I found the tests manageable, there's plenty of time to take them. I'd say you're at a disadvantage if you haven't taken AP chem, it goes at a brisk pace. Overall, a good class."
3188,2293158,5.0,4.0,Dr. Anstey is one of the best professor at Davidson! His Chem 115 class is indeed lecture-heavy and very fast-paced but Professor Anstey makes sure that none of his students are left out by opening his office hours open for his students to drop by and ask questions. His tests are hard but doable. 10/10 recommended.
3189,2293158,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Anstey does a great job of making his passion palpable for the students. Although the class is lecture heavy, he makes them as enjoyable as a Chemistry lectures can conceivably be (especially with his hilarious dry humor). He's readily available during office hours and a huge help when you don't understand something fully."
3190,1045926,4.0,1.0,"Loved Ottati! Just have to come to class, talk a little and you will get an A. Passionate about his field, though his lectures can be a little boring. Super nice guy, and would recommend his classes for a low-stress, interesting course."
3191,1045926,5.0,3.0,"Great guy. Easily my favorite professor in the school. He is cool, easy to talk to if you have any problems, and helps with anything that you are having a hard time with. Even invited people to his house."
3192,1045926,5.0,2.0,"I love Dr. Ottati! I took this class for fun, and loved it so much that I want to take more religion classes. He has so much experience in the field, but he doesn't make it too complicated for us. He posts lecture handouts with everything that you need to know. He cares really deeply for his students and will do anything to uplift us during class."
3193,1045926,4.0,1.0,"If you need an easy 4th class, this is it. Very few assignments, very little work outside of class required. You can put in minimal work and do well. Ottatis lectures were extremely dull for me, but I also did not care for the material. Graded on 2 straightforward quizzes, a couple response papers, and a final essay. Very helpful in office hours."
3194,1045926,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Ottati is a great professor. He is very passionate about what he teaches and loves to talk with students. He's a tough grader, but does his best to keep lectures interesting even though they are long."
3195,1045926,3.5,1.0,"Awesome professor, easy class. I never show up or do the reading and I have an A."
3196,1045926,4.5,2.0,"As long as you put some effort into the class and listen to his lectures, its a really fun class and worth taking"
3197,1045926,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Ottati is THE MAN. Relatively easy class work load wise, but awesome discussions. I had him for an 8:30 and I was always excited to go to class. He is very chill and helpful in office hours and wants you to do well. One of my favorite Davidson professors thus far. Take his class, you will not regret it."
3198,1045926,3.5,4.0,"Ottati is a classic Davidson professor (if such a thing exists). He cares about his students, invites everyone to his house, is weird in a good way, and knows a ton about what he's talking about. If you take his class, you will enjoy it. Simple as that."
3199,1045926,5.0,2.0,Ottati is a great professor and is very helpful. Only 3 major assignments. I would DEFINITELY recommend him. Extremely interesting class and awesome guy. He is very helpful in office hours and is super friendly. Take advantage of office hours! I did not find him to be that hard of a grader if you talk with him and demonstrate interest to do well.
3200,1045926,4.0,2.0,"Brottati gives some very funny lectures and will keep you entertained throughout the semester, whether he's talking about subject material or about random stuff like creaky floors in Chambers. HARDER GRADER THAN YOU'D THINK. Not that much work, 3 graded assignments so many were shafted. Still, this guy is great and really worth taking. Take it."
3201,1045926,4.0,4.0,"Beware! I heard this course would be easy, and it did appear so, however Ottati grades much harder than one might expect."
3202,1045926,3.5,4.0,The class is almost no work. If you stay on top of the few major assignments and do an excellent job on those (he does grade harder than you'd think) you can just sit back and enjoy a fairly interesting class. Beware the urge to backslide; I did and a class I should've killed got away from me a bit.
3203,1045926,4.5,3.0,"He's a great guy.  He's really laid back, but is a little harder grader than you'd think.  I'd still take his classes if you're looking to fulfill religion requirements though.  Not much work at all and he's pretty humorous."
3204,1045926,5.0,2.0,No Comments
3205,1045926,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, very casual with deadlines-- papers are due when you get them in (within reason of course). Flexible about class structure too. Good sense of humor, dry but keeps you awake. REALLY knowledgable guy- I'll definitely take another class."
3206,1738155,5.0,3.0,"In case you couldn't tell, she's the best. Only thing to be aware of: syllabus is hard to follow and she doesn't use Moodle. You will be completely fine if you just show up and put in the effort, though."
3207,1738155,5.0,2.0,"Nicest teacher Ive ever had . The literally only bad thing is there is no moodle page. Regardless, great teacher and even better person."
3208,1738155,5.0,3.0,"Hands down the best professor at Davidson College. An absolute must if you have any interest in Arabic, Farsi, or the Middle East region. I am an Arabic language minor solely because of Dr. Joubin. I have never learned more in any class on any subject."
3209,1738155,5.0,3.0,Just a good teacher. Nothing more to add.
3210,1738155,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Joubin's a great professor. Arabic used to be a independent study, but she started the department here at Davidson and recently received her tenure! She wants her students to do well and is always encouraging us to practice in our free time and come to office hours. She also provides a lot of bonus points (extra credit) on her quizzes. "
3211,1738155,5.0,2.0,"I always thought of Arabic as the impossible language but Dr. Joubin constantly ingrained arabic isn't hard into our minds. She changes the way people think about it and 101 was honestly one of my fav classes, not just bc of her teaching but also bc of the class dynamics. There are also lots of opportunities to get bonus points on her quizzes."
3212,1738155,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Joubin is the best language teacher I have ever had, hands down. She is engaging and clear, interesting and motivating, and knowledgeable and funny."
3213,1738155,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Joubin is a very relatable professor and very smart too. I personally love Arabic, and she challenged and pushed me to love the class. I struggled somewhat in the beginning, but in the end i learned a lot from this class. i really recommend this language course."
3214,1738155,5.0,3.0,"Loves what she does, and it's obvious as a student. Great to talk to outside of class, sets clear guidelines and expects students to keep up with them. I wasn't sure if I was going to like Arabic going into the class, but I will continue taking the language because of her."
3215,1738155,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Joubin is incredibly passionate and knowledgable. It is very important to keep up with the material because it adds up quickly, but overall great class."
3216,239023,4.0,3.0,He is a very kind and soft-spoken person. He is very knowledgeable and tries for everyone to understand the basics and the bigger picture in economics. Watching the lecture videos is important or you will be confused in class.
3217,239023,4.0,3.0,DO NOT GET THE TEXTBOOK. He is a genuinely great guy. Lectures can be boring a long. Class is straightforward in setup and taking notes will help a ton. I would recommend taking his class if given the chance
3218,239023,4.0,4.0,Knows his stuff and really cares about well being of students. Lectures can be a bit boring and especially having him fully online makes it worse. The tests are pretty difficult and are a huge part of your grade but if you study a lot it pays off because you have a very strong understanding of the eco101 concepts. Tough class but you learn a lot
3219,239023,4.0,3.0,"Great choice for my econ101. being online was difficult, but kumar is very understanding and helpful. he will listen to any feedback students have."
3220,239023,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Kumar is a very nice man, and he cares about his students. That being said, his lectures are often dry and unclear , so I had to learn on my own. Most importantly, the major grades are all 60% comprised of multiple choice questions that often address things you haven't learned in class. So, if you aren't good at guessing, maybe avoid this class"
3221,239023,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Kumar is the man. ECO101 wasn't a breeze with him, but I learned so much. He explains concepts beautifully and cares deeply for students. He keeps you entertained and laughing during class, and I could not recommend him highly enough! He inspired me to major in Economics and is so encouraging while pushing you to be the best you can be."
3222,239023,2.0,5.0,The final exam and reviews are totally different from what being taught in the class. It is likely to be disappointed because time you spend on learning material does not correlate with grade you get. His lecture makes you sleepy. His grading criteria are unclear for the writing section of the exam. He does not help you with homework in Office Hour
3223,239023,5.0,3.0,Kumar is super precise when going over topics. I've never seen anyone explain complex topics with such great clarity. He's one of the best human beings I've ever met. He cares about you (unless you really mess up). He's also not afraid of the occasional roast. ECO101 is a move.
3224,239023,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Kumar is easily the best professor of economics in Davidson. If you want to know something useful from economics he is the best professor you can learn from. But if you're taking this class just for fun this is not the class for you, at least not with Dr. Kumar. Besides that, he's the most lighthearted and generous professor you will ever meet."
3225,239023,4.0,5.0,"This was a tough class for me. I learned a lot from Kumar's clear lectures, but they were often very dull and tough to sit through. Tests were very hard, and the fact that there were only 2 and a final made everything high stakes. He was very accessible in office hours and always helped to lower my stress level. I left the class happy I took it."
3226,239023,4.0,4.0,"Highly rational and accomplished but light-hearted at the same time, Kumar is integral to economics at Davidson. While he could be more receptive to being corrected or active in prompting diagnostic questions of students to test understanding, he is still dedicated to teaching and reducing the stress levels of his students."
3227,239023,4.0,4.0,"A great, caring guy. Even though his tests are hard, he really is available to help you outside of class and gives assignments that help prepare you for the tests well so make sure you keep up with the assignments and you'll be fine! Reading is not mandatory, but definitely helpful to explain concepts. He definitely piqued my interest in econ."
3228,239023,4.0,4.0,Dr. Kumar is a great professor. He has good lectures and spends a lot of time working to be as helpful as possible to students. He gives some of the toughest tests in the Economics department but he also is a very generous grader. Really enjoyed my time spent in his class.
3229,239023,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kumar is the man, but his class is tough. ECO101 only has two tests and then a final, so you have to make them count. The tests are brutal, but they're fair and Professor Kumar is great about partial credit. I would take again for sure."
3230,239023,3.0,4.0,"Kumar is a great man, but his lectures are extremely boring. Class was too dry for me to enjoy it. Reasonable grader on tests."
3231,239023,4.0,5.0,"Professor Kumar is a great econ professor! His lectures are very clear and thorough, but his tests are very hard."
3232,239023,5.0,2.0,"Kumar has great handwriting, speaks very clearly which makes taking notes really easy and I learned a ton. Very helpful in office hours, the tests were half multiple choice and pretty straight forward. You also have group homework, which is awesome."
3233,239023,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Funny guy whose interesting lectures made a T-Th Econ class bearable. His tests were by no means easy, but sounded much fairer than a lot of other econ professors. Very helpful during office hours."
3234,239023,4.5,4.0,"Kumar is helpful, intelligent, and has a sense of humor. While his lectures were not always clear and the material often required a second or third read-through, he honestly does want his students to succeed. If you can, take a class from him- it's worth it."
3235,239023,4.0,4.0,"awesome professor, though very difficult.  explains material very well in class and has very organized lectures.  more than willing to go on tangents and is very willing to help students outside of class (which he does very well).  a great overall experience.  also, his second test is very, very hard"
3236,239023,3.0,2.0,"The class was based off of lengthy, dry lectures with little discussion or class interaction. Kumar knows a lot about macroeconomics but doesn't make it come alive for his students"
3237,239023,5.0,3.0,"I really learned a lot from Dr. Kumar, his class was fascinating.  One piece of advice, do not slack off for the second test for it is devilish and you will regret it if you do.  I would take another class from Dr. Kumar again, although I did hear he was the &quot;hardest&quot; professor in the economics department to get an &quot;A&quot; with, so caveat emptor."
3238,239023,5.0,3.0,The man's very helpful and explains stuff very clearly.  He also doesn't assign the frivolous assignments many other econ profs do.
3239,239023,5.0,3.0,LOVE the dude.  Very easy to work with/and an excellent teacher.
3240,239023,5.0,4.0,"kumar is one of the most amazing professors here at davidson, intelligent, conversational, understands how to TEACH while still being brilliant...  everyone should take a class from him, slightly difficult tests though"
3241,239023,5.0,4.0,Kumar is the reason why i have decided to major in econ.
3242,239023,5.0,4.0,"One of the best teachers at davidson.  Easy to talk with and chat; always really cares whats going on and one of the most level-headed economists I've ever met, has his head in the real world, not the clouds."
3243,239023,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Kumar is awesome.  An outstanding professor, a smart economist, and a great person.  His class will challenge you, and you will leave it having accomplished and learned more than you might ever expect."
3244,239023,5.0,4.0,"Not only is he a great teacher with a good sense of humor, but he has a realistic view of economics, and doesn't live in the fantasy world that a lot of other economic professors live in."
3245,239025,5.0,4.0,Incredibly knowledgable professor; gives great class lectures and is always available outside of class. One of the hidden gems for sure of the poli sci department
3246,239025,4.0,3.0,She really knows her stuff and you learn a lot in the class but she is a strange grader. Hard to know what she wants in papers. Does do a good job in teaching you to be a better writer.
3247,239025,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Rigger is an amazing lecturer who brings the class to life and creates a discussion-based environment. She can be a tough grader but she gives good feedback. Probably one of the best professors here at Davidson; I would recommend her to anyone who's especially interested in Asian studies, China particularly."
3248,239025,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Rigger's class has great discussions and she is knowledgeable and professional. There's a lot of reading and random, busy-work assignments. VERY HARSH GRADER, only giving solid A's to perfect papers. Many people pass-fail her class and the semester average was about a B/B-. With REALLY hard work, I pulled off an A- and don't know any solid A's"
3249,239025,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Rigger is truly a gem at Davidson College. Her knowledge regarding Taiwan-China relations is unparalleled and she is often asked to speak at think tanks and congressional committees. She assigns a lot of reading, but this cultivates a more thorough classroom discussion. I recommend taking a class with her."
3250,239025,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Rigger is absolutely incredible. Super helpful, a great lecturer, and really a master of her subject. Everyone should take a class with her while at Davidson."
3251,239025,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, really knows her stuff and is great at explaining it clearly. Uses lots of insightful & amusing analogies to explain issues. Not an easy grader, but a fair grader. Great at stimulating class discussion and creating an environment where you feel comfortable asking questions."
3252,239025,5.0,3.0,Brilliant - great at explaining concepts in creative and engaging ways that keep the class awake. Really good at including the class and making the info seem relevant. She really knows her subject matter as well.
3253,239025,2.0,5.0,"Very mixed feelings. Loved class, did not love the prof. Very well organized class and learned a lot, but professor shuts down students on questions and comments, which discouraged participation. Very few to no comments on all graded work...so points off seemed totally arbitrary. All tests short answer, which means hard to fail...or get an A."
3254,239025,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Rigger is an awesome professor. While her lectures can occasionally be dry, her knowledge of the subject is unmatched and her tests are pretty straightforward. She's always willing to meet with you out of class for any reason and is pretty flexible with dates and times. Definitely reccomended."
3255,239025,5.0,4.0,Incredbile.  Brilliant and funny as hell.  Always willing to help in any way she can.  Lectures and discussions were interesting and thought-provoking.  Great at making jokes and gentle teasing of students.  Friendly.  Would definitely take another class and I highly recommend her.
3256,239025,4.5,3.0,"A brilliant woman, and an enthusiastic teacher."
3257,239025,4.5,3.0,"also HUM 161 ..... great woman, knows her stuff... conversational lectures, difficult tests and i wasn't happy with her essay grading but i'd still recommend her classes to people just because she's interesting to know"
3258,239025,4.5,3.0,"Brilliant, a fun teacher, and very helpful.  Almost always happy to help, given the chance, take a class with her."
3259,239025,4.0,2.0,Very cool lady who loves what she does and is an expert in her field. Entertaining with her little quips and generally gives good lectures that facilitate class discussion.
3260,239025,3.5,2.0,Good teacher but she'll trick you if you don't watch out
3261,239025,1.5,1.0,Horrible.
3262,239026,2.5,3.0,Extremely knowledgeable but not an interesting lecturer; it was hard to distinguish the relevant material from his off-topic tangents. I learned more from the articles he posted on BB than from his lectures. Midterm/final heavy class. People who had interest in the subject seemed to enjoy it. DO NOT put case briefs off until the last minute!
3263,239026,4.0,4.0,"For ethics, he gets off topic a lot.  I can imagine he would be fabulous for medical ethics or anything to do with law.  Really knowledgeable about everything and a really nice guy."
3264,239026,5.0,3.0,"Perhaps the most helpful professor I've ever had. If you're interested in becoming either a doctor or lawyer, don't miss out on taking one of his classes."
3265,239026,5.0,4.0,"GREAT TEACHER! has a small ego, but it was kind of charming. hard work will get you a good grade, but he is a semi-tough grader. Really Really knows his stuff. Extremely kind and helpful. Start briefs and essays early on a save yourself a lot of stress."
3266,239026,3.0,2.0,"Great class if you're smart & good in philosophy, bad class if you aren't. After the first few weeks, he loses interest and his lectures get boring and rambling, though he forces himself to prop this up through interesting esssay topics he must teach. Opinionated in a good way. Incredibly smart, diverse, accomplished man."
3267,239026,4.5,1.0,"Dr. Stell was a great professor. Although he can ramble like no other and the law briefs can be painful (Just **** them and you will be fine), he is overall an easy grader and has had some interesting experiences as an ethicist. Great class for Pre-Law if you are planning to become a lawyer knows a lot about it and loves to talk about it."
3268,239026,4.0,3.0,This class was amazing!!!
3269,239026,5.0,2.0,He once got **** and shot at clay pigeons to see how alcohol effects your coordination.  When you leave one of his discussions the muscles in your brain are tired.  He is incredible...and doesn't bother you when your thesis is late.
3270,239026,4.5,3.0,"Had for normal ethics. Great if you love the grizzled cynical veteran type professor. Brilliant by any standard. Ignores syllabus entirely. Great debates in class (little lecture). Fair but volatile grader. Nice guy in person, though kind of odd. Will say anything. Loves to say his opinion. Takes great joy in opening young peoples' minds."
3271,239026,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Stell is great in one-on-one conversation.  Classes are awesome, but you can learn more in office hours with him than perhaps with any other professor.  Really listens to what you have to say, and really responds in a genuine and sincere way.  But for students who can't speak the English language, you learn a lot from talking to this guy."
3272,239026,4.5,2.0,"Accepts re-writes for papers.  Readings are very interesting, and the lectures are consistently amazing.  Grades papers based on an easy-to-learn system, which he gives you ahead of time.  Midterm and final emphasize you to think for yourself while drawing on course materials."
3273,239026,2.0,3.0,Dr Stell was never helpful during the multiple times I approached him.  He had a very pompous attitude and was rude.  Awful!
3274,239026,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Stell is a great professor.  While his lectures are sometimes a little unorganized, the discussion is always interesting and entertaining.  Dr. Stell has a great sense of humor, which is a plus.  Medical ethics is a great class, and is not too hard."
3275,239026,4.0,2.0,"Medical ethics is a great class, and Dr. Stell is a great professor.  We had a lot of reading to do, but it's a pretty easy class if you keep up with it.  Lecture is sometimes disorganized but always entertaining."
3276,239026,5.0,2.0,"Alexander Hamilton once remarked that &quot;He who stands for nothing, falls for anything.&quot;  Lance Stell stands proudly for ethics and honor.  He is the best professor I have ever had.  A wonderful professor and an outstanding philosopher."
3277,239026,4.5,2.0,"He's a libertarian, so you know he's cool.  Great sense of humor, considers lawyers to be &quot;moral terrorists.&quot;  He's more of a politics and law professor than philosophy, but his amount of knowledge on everything is astounding."
3278,239026,5.0,2.0,"Excellent professor.  Shows a real passion for his area of knowledge, and tries--and succeeds--in conveying that passion to students in the classroom and through assignments."
3279,552380,1.0,5.0,"Very inflexible during the pandemic, and graded very hard. If you don't have background in Shakespeare or are really good at reading it this is not an ideal class. I consistently would ask clarifying questions so I could contribute to discussion and I was often made to feel like I was dumb. The papers made sense but the tests seemed very arbitrary."
3280,552380,1.0,3.0,"Even though this was a senior-level course focused on writing, we usually didn't talk about the writing styles or the persuasiveness of the author's argument when we discussed readings. Lewis will go off on students for small mistakes (turning in something late) and won't budge on deadlines (ex. a 7000 word paper) even in a pandemic."
3281,552380,5.0,4.0,"ENG 301 made me a much better writer, a more careful reader, and introduced me to a lot of enjoyable and interesting works. Dr. Lewis gives very helpful feedback on her writing assignments, and I found her lectures engaging and oftentimes really fun. I'd highly recommend taking a course with her."
3282,552380,2.0,3.0,Most unpleasant experience I've had at Davidson. Her reactions to students being late or missing a class were absolutely absurd and unwarranted. Her feedback wasn't particularly helpful and grading was too subjective. A little out-of-touch with contemporary creative nonfiction writing.
3283,552380,4.0,3.0,"Sometimes harsh but always fair, dr. Lewis is engaging, extremely smart, and always entertaining. Anything you read on this page about charges of sexism is complete nonsense.  Take her class because she will definitely make you a much better writer and you'll probably end up with a good story or two."
3284,552380,5.0,3.0,"Do yourself a favor and take a class with Dr. Lewis before you graduate, especially if you're an English major. Probably my favorite professor here. Engaging, intelligent, funny, and caring. On top of that, taking her Creative Nonfiction class really improved my writing."
3285,552380,4.0,4.0,"She can be very intimidating, but is unbelievably intelligent, even by Davidson professor standards. Class was discussion based and always interesting."
3286,552380,3.0,4.0,very smart woman. stylish. i'm an english major but i wouldnt suggest taking this class to a non-major. bunch of old confusing stuff. talk in class! if you show you care she'll help with your grades. she let us count the second test and essay as more than it says on the syllabus if you did better on the second. reading every night. huge text book.
3287,552380,4.5,4.0,"Brilliant and kind, Dr. Lewis brings energy and expectations to every class.  You can learn so much from her, if you are receptive.  She is particular and demanding of her students, but she challenges you to improve and write at a higher level.  Take her courses if you are passionate about the material."
3288,552380,2.0,4.0,"While class discussion can be a very effective, engaging approach for studying literature, it was not suitable for the survey course this class is.  There is just too little time and she should lecture instead.  She tended to be patronizing and honestly seemed to have little interest in non-majors.  Too much time on Faerie Queen."
3289,552380,1.5,4.0,"She's passionate about her subject, but that's about it.  She has favorites, mostly girls, and loves to have students agree with her.  If you don't, look out.  I found her lectures to be weak.  Though she has enthusiasm for her subject and (especially!) her interpretations, there's not much to take away from them and she's not interested in debate."
3290,552380,2.0,5.0,"I wrote a poetic response to andrew marvell's &quot;to his coy mistress&quot;, 30 lines, tetrameter couplets, received a big fat F. She's been an english professor at Davidson for 29 years, I quoted the hamlet line &quot;it would cost thee a groaning to take off mine edge&quot; and she wrote a &#63; next to it. How can a PHD in Literature not catch that&#63;"
3291,552380,4.0,3.0,"DONT BE LATE. Prof. Lewis is amazing- she's funny and sweet. Workshops are extremely helpful, but make sure you don't keep making the same mistakes. Work hard on your papers and you'll do fin."
3292,552380,2.5,4.0,She was extremely opinionated.  Hard to interject.
3293,552380,4.5,3.0,"Have to disagree with sexism comment: I'm a guy and I got an A, and honestly I didn't feel like i was even contributing much until half way through semester. Really supportive and enthusiastic prof overall with a very good sense of humor. Have seen her lay into students who are not on her 'good side' but typically theres a reason"
3294,552380,1.5,3.0,A really unpleasant person.  Lewis is in no way innovative and pushes a lot of really outdated critical approaches.  She also uses the classroom largely as a platform to work out personal issues.  &quot;Class as therapy.&quot;
3295,552380,1.5,4.0,"I don't think I've had a meaner, more sarcastic prof with less compassion.  If you screw up once, you're blackballed and will not do well; if you play the game, raise your hand with bland comments and agreements, nod at her essay-like lectures, and turn in mediocre essays that agree with her hypotheses, you will do well."
3296,552380,4.0,3.0,tough but fair. great way to get that freshman requirement!
3297,552380,5.0,4.0,"she's very fair, and an attentive teacher of writing. leaves lots of comments on your papers--very helpful. has an intense love for the new yorker."
3298,552380,4.5,4.0,"She's tough but good.  The sexism thing is a joke--she doesn't hate guys (someone compensating for not being too bright&#63;).  She expects a lot, but if you perform, she's very generous.  Don't ever be late, though--she HATES that."
3299,552380,3.0,4.0,"Extremely boring class. I dread going every day. Dr. Lewis is a sweet lady, but it would take a goddess to make Brit. Lit. Middle Ages - 1660 actually seem interesting. She has a bit of a tendency to play favorites, and unless you happen to be one of those people, you may just want to sit in the back and take a nap."
3300,552380,2.0,4.0,"Most **** teacher I've ever had.  Consistently liked by female students, and consistently disliked by male students.  Largely because her average grade for male students is about c minus, while her average grade for females hovers in the B plus, a minus range.  Unbelievable.  Never experienced anything like it.  Sexism at an extreme.  Am I bitter&#63;  No.  Am I telling the truth&#63; Yes.  Take her if you're a girl.  You'll like her and do well."
3301,552380,3.5,4.0,"In some ways--amazing, in other ways--completely frightening.  Do NOT get on her bad side.  Very passionate, expects a LOT from students (even stuff other profs would give extra credit for)."
3302,552380,5.0,3.0,this is easily my favorite class of my college career. she's an incredible woman and gives inspired lectures..  a must-take if you're an english major!!
3303,552380,1.0,4.0,Unless you like copying the thoughts of your professor EXACTLY don't bother. She hates independent thought and any way but her own. BEWARE THE EYES OF LEWIS.
3304,552380,2.5,4.0,"She just didn't do it for me. She's clearly well-versed in everything she teaches, but she has a bad attitude towards the class a lot of the time, and generally seemed like she didn't want to be there. Take her if you can work hard under lots of pressure (maybe it's worth it; not for me)."
3305,552380,5.0,3.0,Dr. Lewis is the best teacher I ever had at Davidson.  She taught me how to write. I want to be her.
3306,552380,5.0,4.0,"Best teacher I ever had.  Really pushes you to do your best but makes it all worthwhile.  Learned more in one class with her than in a year without her.  Lectures are mindblowing, tests are very fair, papers are difficult but you will be a better writer.  TAKE HER IF YOU ARE AN ENGLISH MAJOR."
3307,353725,2.5,1.0,"I enjoyed the books we read, but I was one of the few who read. A little bit frustrating. I highly recommend just speaking with him after class."
3308,353725,2.5,1.0,"The readings are interesting, but a few people got by without reading any of them. The classes are usually boring, but can be fun on occasion when he goes off on random tangents. If you are looking for guidance on how to write or how to write better, avoid this course."
3309,353725,2.5,2.0,"If you don't want to do alot of work, this class is good. I never read the books and got B's on all my papers. And then I re-wrote all my papers and got A's. If you are genuinely interested, this class is also good. The man is brilliant and will hold a very stimulating conversation with you if you want. Would definitely recommend this class."
3310,353725,3.5,2.0,"Discussions depend highly on the students' participation. If you participate, the class is very worth-while. When students lag, so does class discussion.  What I appreciated most about McCulloh is how much he obviously cares about teaching and his students--something sadly rare and certainly valuable."
3311,353725,5.0,1.0,"dear freshmen, image of sci in lit. and film is THE BEST writing course to take. it was incredibly easy and you could rewrite every paper until you got an A on it"
3312,353725,2.5,1.0,"(Seminar on Sebald lit.)  The only course of my German major in which the prof spoke English.  Easy A. Doesn't challenge students much, but if you're interested in Sebald (modern)lit, he's your guy. Everyone I've talked to who had him for a language course learned nothing.  If you want to really learn German with an engaging prof, take Henke!!!"
3313,353725,1.0,1.0,"I wouldn't mind having him for an uncle or something, but man, you're on your own if you want to learn any German. Doesn't speak German in class; assigns workbook exercises not as practice but as busywork before tests. Is not a linear lecturer. Assigns reading but doesn't teach it well. Might be good at a higher level but try to avoid him for 101."
3314,353725,3.0,5.0,"Has a tendancy to veer off topic, but a very enjoyable teacher. Be ready to study on your own time more than usual, but also be prepared for a day of entertainment when you step into the class."
3315,353725,5.0,5.0,"This professor is an ****, which really is one of the reasons I like him so much because I, too, had days where I didn't feel like coming to class or doing the reading."
3316,353725,5.0,4.0,"Despite the other reviews on here, Dr. McCulloh is an outstanding teacher, who offers rigourous and enriching courses after the Introductory German level."
3317,353725,1.0,1.0,I did all my essays a week after classes ended. I got an A. I dont need to say anymore.
3318,353725,1.0,1.0,"I forgot more German than I learned. An easy A, but you won't learn German."
3319,353725,1.0,1.0,"Doesn't teach and sometimes doesn't know his stuff. Class is generally a waste of time. If you want to learn German, take someone else. He really shouldn't be teaching."
3320,353725,1.5,2.0,"Umm...doesn't actually teach, regularly comes to class unprepared, is really nice, but isn't fit to do what he's paid to do."
3321,177602,5.0,4.0,"Dr. T is a good professor and explains things clearly. Many people have a hard time engaging with stats and paying attention in class, which makes things more difficult. If you pay attention and take good notes, the material is not very hard. Dr. T is friendly and available for help, but he has high expectations of his students."
3322,177602,1.0,3.0,"had very hostile interaction with him, not helpful at all"
3323,177602,4.5,4.0,"Dr. T will challenge you to fully understand the material, not just repeat it from memory. However, he is very approachable and enjoys helping students individually if help is needed. Dr. T is also a great resource in general and very easy to talk to!! Highly recommend his classes."
3324,177602,4.5,5.0,"What a great stats teacher!  Dr. T is tough and expects you to understand the material, not just memorize it, but by the end of the class you will know statistics.  He is very clear and always willing to provide extra help if you need it."
3325,177602,4.0,4.0,"People say dr.t is hard and he is but he is a great professor who is willing to help. I am his 310 class right now and feel like I am learning a whole lot. He has a sarcastic sense of humor that some people can't appreciate, but I think he's pretty cool."
3326,177602,3.5,3.0,"Ehh...I like TD, but he has the characteristic of sliding into monotony with his lectures.  I learned a lot in the class, though, and TD did have a lot of helpful advice.  He probably wouldn't think much of this rating system, though :)"
3327,177602,3.5,5.0,"His courses will challenge you, even the stats wizz in my class almost failed his first test.  You have to work a ton of extra problems from the book if you want to have any shot in this course."
3328,177602,3.0,3.0,No Comments
3329,134611,4.0,2.0,"Flipped classroom style which I really enjoyed. Pre class quizzes were all easy, the homework were kinda confusing I would recommend going to office hours. Exams are opened notes and not too hard if you understood the homework/class problems. He talks a lot but is the sweetest "
3330,134611,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Stevens is amazing! It was a flipped classroom, which I thought I wouldn't like, but it ended up being one of my favorite aspects. We almost always got out early for labs, and lab expectations were clear. Tests were challenging, but definitely nothing we hadn't seen before, and he curves test grades. Definitely take a class with him."
3331,134611,5.0,5.0,"This Great Course will occupy myself all the Rest of my Life, I am 47 years old with Communications, Marketing, PR and Management backgrounds, I have many activities also as an editor. The One which can have a total mastering of all the sciences in this course can INVENT the Best DRUGS for ETERNAL LIFE"
3332,134611,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Stevens was a great professor for orgo. I thought that his lectures were very clear and easy to follow. We had 3 tests, and those comprised the majority of our grade. The 1st and 2nd test were fair, but the 3rd test was not. One thing that I wanted from Stevens was more practice. good professor &amp; would recommend for organic. His class was fair"
3333,134611,5.0,4.0,"Best prof I have ever had at Davidson! No busy work. Incredibly clear and succinct lecture style. Reviews were challenging, but fair and he does curve. Plus he is a genuinely caring and compassionate guy - his end of semester talk was one of the best parts of my year!!! He is so genuine and caring... and a chemistry genius!"
3334,134611,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Stevens is great! He makes organic chemistry very understandable, and is willing to help during office hours or if you set up an appointment. Lab is also fun and an easy way to boost your grade. The tests are hard but he does not try to trick you. Overall great chemistry professor"
3335,134611,5.0,4.0,Dr. Stevens is the best! By far one of my favorite professors. He's always helpful in office hours and he loves using the board to work out mechanisms so the students understand how certain products came from the reaction. Don't be afraid to ask questions while he's lecturing. He's also just an inspirational person in general and he LOVES chemistry
3336,134611,5.0,4.0,"I LOVE DR. STEVENS! Although he sometimes gets distracted telling us amusing stories, in reality is lectures are very clear, structured and easy to follow. He makes complex concepts accessible. i never thought I would look forward to orgo lectures! Laid back in lab and always helpful. Tests are tough tho- they expect you to go above and beyond!"
3337,134611,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Stevens is the shiznit.  He explains concepts very well and manages to keep the class relatively engaged.  Very laid back in lab, which is a huge plus.  Tests can be difficult, but it helps to work problems he assigns in the book."
3338,134611,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Stevens is one of the best professors I've ever had.  He's very smart, funny, and personable.  He is in his office a lot and is always willing to help.  The only problem I've had with him is that I often can't figure out what to study for tests."
3339,134611,4.0,5.0,"Knows his stuff well. Amusing lectures.  I always leave class with a story (messypants).  Tests are hard, but they are heavily curved.  All around good."
3340,134611,4.5,4.0,"One of the most entertaining lecturers I had at Davidson.  His tests are tough, but they cover exactly what he says they will, so if you prepare properly you'll do fine.  He also does a great job actually connecting the labs with what you cover in class."
3341,134611,3.0,3.0,"Lots of fun in Lab, but unclear and scattered during class."
3342,134611,3.0,3.0,A little scattered and disorganized but great personality!
3343,476627,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Keith is a great professor. Lectures and homework were manageable, classes were interesting, she includes some fun hands-on stuff, and she is a very understanding professor. Highly recommend her as a professor- and she is a great conductor!"
3344,476627,5.0,3.0,"I love her! She is such a sweet person and so enthusiastic about music, it makes you excited too. Her tests are difficult but an A is not too hard to get if you're ok with studying a lot. She puts effort into making her lectures engaging, and you will learn lots about music."
3345,476627,5.0,2.0,"I love Dr. Keith! She is so sweet and a great professor. If you have any sort of basic music knowledge, MUS 121 will be simple but fun for you. Dr. Keith is a really caring, accessible, and fun professor and I would definitely recommend her classes."
3346,476627,4.5,4.0,"Great human being overall her test are ... Difficult and crescendo in difficulty as the semester goes on but she is a great professor. WARNING: if you dislike french impressionism DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE, it may kill you. :("
3347,476627,4.5,3.0,"Great class, whether you are into music or just need a fine arts credit. Cham is always enthusiastic and fun."
3348,476627,3.5,2.0,"Seems still to be learning herself, but pleasant and cute in class."
3349,476627,5.0,4.0,"DCSO is a non-credit course, and I highly recommend it to anyone with string, percussion, or wind instrument experience!  Pro Chamra is an excellent conductor and always picks awesome repetoire that you'll probably never see again in your life.  Unless you plan on pursuing music professionally.  You can also always visit Pro C in her office!  Fun!"
3350,476627,5.0,3.0,Great lady
3351,476627,4.5,3.0,A charming person.  A plume in Davidson's cap.
3352,476627,1.0,3.0,--
3353,476627,5.0,3.0,"Energetic, nice, fun, and a great conductor! Obviously knows what's she doing, and she's 1 million times better than Crotts was. We're lucky to have her at Davidson!"
3354,476627,1.5,4.0,No Comments
3355,476627,3.5,2.0,"Hard grader, covers a lot of material of every test. You have to know almost every piece of music that was discussed in class. Really nice though and I think very interesting. Good class over-all."
3356,476627,3.0,5.0,No Comments
3357,476627,3.0,4.0,She didn't really didn't do much other then lecture the class.  She was unclear about what would be on her tests and she made me want to never take another music class at Davidson.But she does have some spunk and thats what helped keep me awake in class.
3358,1365465,4.5,4.0,"I've taken three classes with Dr. Taft, and her classes have been some of my favorites at Davidson.  She's a difficult grader, but is incredibly intelligent and does a great job explaining things. Probably one of my favorite professors at Davidson."
3359,1365465,3.5,3.0,"Taft is a bit intimidating at first, but she warms up throughout the semester. Come to class prepared and expect to get a solid B on a paper, usually no higher unless it is stellar. Office hours are somewhat helpful, as long as you come to her with specific questions. Very intelligible but sometimes too intellectual to a point of confusion!"
3360,1365465,3.5,4.0,"Very interesting class, you will learn a lot, but she is a very difficult grader, and expects a lot. In order to do well, you should have very liberal opinions, and always do the readings.  (There was a lot of reading, often 100 pages a week). 10 page midterm, 16 page final, 2-3 page papers due weekly. Attendance was absolutely mandatory."
3361,1365465,2.5,5.0,"She gives insightful information in the class, but beware: she holds very liberal views. She is a tough grader. Part of the reason is because she does not tell you what she expects. Basically just tells you, 'write a 2-3 page paper.'"
3362,1365465,4.0,3.0,had her for both Globalization & Social Change and 101 .. She is a very smart woman. She knows her stuff but is a tough grader. You will mostly get a B on a good paper. It's worth it; discussions are great and she's really nice. She makes even the toughest theories interesting!
3363,1365465,2.5,5.0,Yikes.
3364,1365465,4.5,4.0,"Teaches a very demanding 101 course...6 5-7 pg papers and a final paper of 10-14 pg. You also turn in daily responses (a paragraph) to the readings... However, her office hours are a life saver...I went to her office for every paper and did well. If you don't slack off, come to class, contribute, and visit her in her office, you will do well."
3365,1744354,4.0,3.0,"One of the more relaxed professors I've had! Still lots of reading, and class is very discussion based so I would advise being comfortable with participation. But if you put in the effort, it's an easy class. Interesting subject material. Dr. O'Geen is fun to talk with outside of class as well. Especially recommend him for Supreme Court classes. "
3366,1744354,5.0,3.0,"Dr. O'Geen is fantastic. Fair warning, he will assigned a TON of reading. That said, it is always relevant and interesting. For the most part he grades off the Mid-term and the Final, with a few short response papers and discussion leader activities. Certainly a fair grader. Overall, I LOVE Dr. O'Geen highly recommend."
3367,1744354,5.0,2.0,"Dr. O'Geen is an absolute gem. He loves his material, is passionate, is knowledgable, and makes his class laugh at 8 in the morning. The only problems I have with him are the speed at which he returns work (very slow) and the time that he likes to hold class (very early). Take his class."
3368,1744354,3.0,2.0,"Cares about well-being of students. Develops personal relationships with you if you take initiative to get to know him. In the classroom, however, Dr. O'Geen often sits back and does not voice his own arguments. Although he inserts humor into his classes, they sometimes lack the depth and analysis necessary for Davidson. Laid back grader though."
3369,1744354,5.0,3.0,Dr. O'Geen is one of my favorite professors on campus. He's very relaxed and open with his students in and out of the classroom. He doesn't assign a ton of assignments so count on the midterm and final to make up roughly 75% of your grade. Put in work and you'll do well in his class.
3370,1744354,3.5,2.0,"Great professor. Lectures are informative and effective, and he has a good sense of humor which helps. Reviews and papers are tough but fair. Isn't the most helpful in office hours, but in general I would highly recommend him as a professor."
3371,1744354,4.0,2.0,"Dr. O'Geen is an awesome professor. He is young so he can associate with students well. Any class dealing with the Supreme Court, Civil Liberties, or Con Law I would recommend. Just do your reading and go to class. He is very helpful, and a good grade is feasible if you put in the effort."
3372,1744354,5.0,2.0,"Dr. O'Geen is a young, funny, smart, and approachable professor.  His lectures are engaging and insightful. I've learned more in his classes than from any other davidson professor. Highly recommend taking as many of his classes as possible."
3373,1975782,3.0,4.0,Hard to understand and not very clear on what she wants when it comes to assignments. Weird time slots for due homework and papers. Slow lectures.
3374,1975782,4.0,1.0,"Dr. Petkova is very knowledgeable about her awareness of fashion theory and is very accessible outside class. She is not a very difficult grader, but her grading scale is a bit complicated sometimes; it is definitely imperative to know it before you start the class. Would recommend taking her!"
3375,1975782,3.5,3.0,GROUP PROJECTS! GROUP PROJECTS! GROUP PROJECTS! ESSAY!  Summary of course. If you like working with others this is the course for your. Just know your group won't change and she is a difficult grader. She loves to give out 89.5's. There are no tests and participation is key.  Overall it was an interesting course. More work than it seems at first.
3376,1975782,4.0,2.0,"I had a Dr. Petkova for ""Culture, Media & Society."" There is a scare-tactic amount of reading in the first couple of weeks, but it settles into a nicely-paced class. There are a lot of papers to write, but they are all reasonable and graded fairly. You'll read a lot and be expected to know what you read about. Group work is integral to the class."
3377,2719206,5.0,4.0,"He's the best professor at Davidson, hands down. He explains difficult topics well. If you don't get a concept, he's always available during office hours or after class. He understands his students and fosters a learning environment where you can ask any question and not feel inferior. He actually inspired me to be a Chem major! Recommend him 200%"
3378,2719206,5.0,3.0,Dr. El-Zaatari is an amazing professor and super funny! His office hours are great for asking questions. He's very approachable both there and in class. Tests are straight-forward and homework is all online (graded instantly). Getting the access code for the online textbook/homework is necessary but a traditional textbook is not. Greatly recommend!
3379,1760745,5.0,2.0,"Very straight forward teacher. He writes absolutely everything on the board, which is very helpful. Always available outside of class, go to him with any questions. Take good notes and do the homework, and you'll do well."
3380,1760745,3.0,4.0,I often found Dr. Peachey confusing and don't think he was very good at explaining things. You could also tell he was a new teacher and didn't know how hard or easy to make tests.
3381,1760745,4.5,3.0,Both a great teacher and a great guy. Often acts nerdy in class with many Monty Python references as well as extensive use of puns. Somehow makes math class enjoyable
3382,2379245,5.0,2.0,"Loved this professor so much I created an account to rate her. She is so knowledgeable and eager to teach as well as help students if they need it. She is very accessible outside of class if you need help. Class is lecture heavy, but she does switch things up with group discussions. She sometimes goes off on tangents, but they're interesting!"
3383,574963,5.0,4.0,"Prof Sanchez-Sanchez is like a big teddy bear. He cares for you so much and wants you to be the best both inside and outside of the classroom. He creates opportunities for you to get help and is very accessible. He is a fair grader, but makes you work hard to achieve it. Make sure to utilize all of the resources he provides (like office hours!)"
3384,574963,4.0,5.0,"He is a super sweet guy. He definitely cares about his students and really wants everyone to do well. He gives great feedback on essays and exams and is very accessible outside class. However, he is very tough. He definitely expects a lot, and you have to work for your grade. Definitely only take this class if you're interested in literature."
3385,574963,5.0,5.0,"He chooses violence in class let's make that clear. He pushes you to the brink of mental collapse but damn did my spanish get better. I respect the hell outta him. Iberian medieval lit isn't the most interesting topic but he makes it fun. Super helpful and though he's quite hard, he's very friendly and always willing to help. Definitely take him."
3386,574963,5.0,4.0,"Honestly the best professor I have ever had. Reflecting back now after doing my masters in a completely different field. Samuel Sanchez is incredible, a shame if you do not take a class with him when you get the chance."
3387,574963,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Sanchez is the best. He's hilarious, kind, and will give you great feedback in office hours. His class is really fun if you engage yourself and he is so nice! He rewards you when you work hard. Homework is reading short stories and you are graded on a few persuasive essays throughout the semester. I would definitely take him again."
3388,574963,5.0,2.0,I love Sanchez! He definitely cares about the students and makes jokes during class. I really enjoyed having him as my spanish prof and would definitely take another class with him.
3389,574963,5.0,3.0,"Sanchez is the man. Fun class, hilariously sarcastic guy, knows how to teach Spanish and pushes you to improve especially with speaking. By far one of the top Spanish professors at Davidson. Readings are generally pretty short and class discussions are chill. Would highly recommend taking his class."
3390,574963,5.0,3.0,"Sanchez y Sanchez is by far, one of the most amazing teachers I have ever had. He is energetic and funny, but also incredible intellectual and caring. He pushes you to think (in Spanish, of course) and has the ability to capture students' attention. He will make you fall in love with the language, even if you do not plan to pursue it."
3391,574963,4.5,4.0,"Great professor, engaging, and is very focused on students learning in his class! He is also very helpful in office hours and gives very clear directions for papers or tests, and also provides immaculate feedback for all students on any assignment. Also considers student opinions, and modifies workload if need be. A truly caring man, and helpful!"
3392,574963,4.5,3.0,Sanchez y Sanchez is an amazing professor. He was so helpful and he would push my analysis of texts further in class discussions. I looked forward to going to his class every day because I was never bored. He is an amazing person and is very approachable if you need help.  I would have him as a professor again.
3393,574963,5.0,2.0,"Sanchez y Sanchez gave great lectures that held attention and were interesting. He assigned a lot of reading and demanded much of his students but was readily available, encouraging, and willing to help."
3394,574963,5.0,4.0,"This professor is amazing! He is such a great lecturer! He keeps his students involved in his lecture, which I like because he doesn't just give us the answers, he makes us think out loud! He also is very helpful during office hours, and always willing to be emailed with questions. He is a true Davidson Gem!  "
3395,574963,4.5,3.0,"Sánchez y Sánchez is the best. Hands down best professor I've had at Davidson. He is extremely kind, brilliant, hilarious. He goes above and beyond to help his students. Go to office hours!!"
3396,574963,5.0,3.0,Definitely my favorite professor. While you definitely have to work in  his class he does everything he can to help you succeed. He is so nice and considerate; if you go to his office hours he will help you a lot. His tests and assignments are fair and he's not a very harsh grader. You can easily gain his approval if you speak a lot in class.
3397,574963,4.5,2.0,"Sanchez knows what he'a talking about. Great lecturer, although the class seemed to be more about literature than grammar. Tests are simple. If you work to understand the material and participate in class, he'll reward you. Wants his students to do well and will go out of his way to help you. One of my favorite profs @ Davidson!"
3398,574963,5.0,2.0,"Loved professor Sanchez. His class was very fun with interesting subjects and lectures. Participation is required, but easy. Tests are also not difficult. Concerned for all his students and wants them to do well. Always available to help and super understanding. Cared enough to send me back to my room to sleep when I showed up sick for class."
3399,574963,5.0,2.0,"He's incredibly interested in his students and always wants people to do well. You have to speak in class but really not much. he's very clear and class is always entertaining because he's always moving around and writing on the board. Tests aren't hard. On papers, just proofread and don't use the same vocab over and over again. such a nice guy!"
3400,574963,4.5,2.0,"He is incredibly nice and really wants to help you! You can get away with never doing the homework, and the homework isn't bad to begin with. He's funny and easy going and always willing to meet and help you. Tests are always the same and very basic. He hates when you repeat words in compostions but besides that, he's pretty easy and so adorable"
3401,574963,4.5,2.0,"He is incredibly nice and really wants to help you! You can get away with never doing the homework, and the homework isn't bad to begin with. He's funny and easy going and always willing to meet and help you. Tests are always the same and very basic. He hates when you repeat words in compostions but besides that, he's pretty easy and so adorable"
3402,574963,4.5,2.0,Sanchez-Sanchez is my favorite professor at davidson! he is hilarious and makes class really interesting. all his tests are the same so it is easy to study for them since you know exactly what will be on them. he is very picky on the compositions and hates it when you do not vary vocab!  wonderful professor- definitely recommend!
3403,574963,4.5,3.0,"Professor Sanchez was just what I need to take my Spanish speaking to the next level.  I have always been hesitant to speak in class, but through his encouraging I have become comfortable expressing myself in this foreign language.  I would recommend one of his classes to anyone."
3404,574963,4.5,3.0,Awesome teacher!! Makes class interesting and funny.  Isn't too hard and doesn't require much work outside of class. Likes class participation.
3405,574963,4.0,5.0,"I had a love /hate relationship with Sanchez. He is the hardest professor I have ever had, but very kind, funny and helpful. He really wants you to do well and works to establish a rapport with his students."
3406,574963,5.0,3.0,"I Love Sanchez y Sanchez.  He's extremely fair, makes class lectures interesting and is SO helpful.  He met me with me all the time just to let me practice my spanish speaking skills. Your spanish will definitely improve if you take this class, but it's not too ridiculously hard."
3407,574963,3.5,2.0,He is defintely an awesome teacher. He keeps class entertaining and is really helpful when you need him. He definitely helped improve my Spanish.
3408,574963,4.5,2.0,one of the best spanish teachers i've ever had.. willing to work with struggling students.... easy to understand
3409,574963,4.0,5.0,"Sanchez will either hate you or love you.  He decides based on your first test grade.  He will require time outside of class, but personally and verbally insults any efforts to improve.  If he loves you, you will most definitely love him.  If not, prepare yourself for hell.  He only requires help so you can't say he didn't provide it."
3410,574963,5.0,3.0,"intense, but a great professor and very enthusiastic.  he's very organized, and always ended class with a painting or song that related to the class.  he's a good guy."
3411,574963,4.5,3.0,"Professor Sanchez is always helpful, esp during office hours. Cares about students. Class is interesting, not dry, and goes by quickly. Conducts class entirely in Spanish. He's on the difficult side, but grades extremely fairly~ gives you every point, or half-point, or quarter-point he can! Highly recommend him for 201 or any other class!!!!!!!!!!!"
3412,574963,4.5,3.0,"Oh my god, this class is entitled Advanced Grammar and Composition, which sounds like death, and it was! However, Sanchez is a great guy and a good prof. He is always willing to help and is very accessible. I would take him again in a heart beat... but not this class."
3413,574963,4.5,3.0,"This professor really loves teaching, and it shows.  He's at his best when discussing Spanish literature, and has a way of guiding class discussion while allowing students to feel they've come to conclusions on their own."
3414,574963,4.5,4.0,Sanchez uses the Socratic method which keeps students awake and forces them to practice their Spanish.  Good at explaining things in Spanish but refuses to allow English questions so students often  don't ask when he speaks too fast in Spanish.  Tough grader
3415,1437173,4.5,2.0,An enthusiastic professor; never boring at all.
3416,1437173,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic class, I learned quite a bit about Opera, and she was always so engaging during lectures. Really fun to talk to, and very understanding about extended deadlines and such."
3417,1437173,4.5,1.0,"Chamra is amazing! She's so quirky and fun as a director and very understanding when I have interacted with her. She doesn't demand very high standards, but most everyone attends rehearsals and plays their best in the orchestra. Definitely participate in the orchestra for at least a semester if you're on the fence! :)"
3418,902669,5.0,4.0,"This class was amazing. It was a lovely introduction into Immunology. One of the best parts was learning how to read scientific papers. Not an easy class, but one that definitely will make you a better student and scientist if you put in the time. Going to office hours is HIGHLY recommended. Dr. S is always there to help and support!!!"
3419,902669,5.0,4.0,"Dr. S is incredibly dedicated to her students. Students are often intimidated and don't ask for help, which is a major error in her classes. Dr. S expects the very best (nothing will be handed to you) but if you put in the time, you will walk out of her classes a better student than when you walked in. Her classes teaches lifelong skills. "
3420,902669,3.0,4.0,"Dr. S really cares about her students, but it's tough love. She will make you work hard, and can be brutally honest. In the end, I think she was a fair teacher, but hard. It wasn't pleasant having her as one of my first teachers at Davidson but I think she prepared me well for a future in bio."
3421,902669,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Sarafova's class is hard, but also fair. The class is structured to both help you know important immunology concepts and push you to critically think these concepts in broad context. Tests and lab are hard, but FUN! If you are ready to work and make tuition money worth it, take it. If you work hard, you would not screw your grade."
3422,902669,5.0,4.0,Dr. Sarafova is a great professor. She teaches some of the hardest classes in biology in a way that is accessible and diverse. Many students get intimidated by her blunt personality in giving feedback and miss out on learning from her. Her office hours are endless and extremely flexible. She won't leave until you understand or you give up.
3423,902669,1.0,4.0,"Worst prof I have had in my 3 years at Davidson. Absolutely not an intro class- she assumes previous knowledge of biology and extensive understanding of chemistry and physics. She did not return assignments in time to learn from our mistakes, nor did she open these assignments by the times she had promised. Was not helpful inside or outside class."
3424,902669,4.0,3.0,"Old school, but I liked that. Straight-up lectures and reading, concepts are just knowing parts of cells and genes and how they work. Tests are a bit daunting, but doable. Would recommend."
3425,902669,5.0,4.0,"best professor I have taken at Davidson, hands down!"
3426,902669,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Sarafova is invested in her students. I failed her first test (took it the night before), but she was open to office hours and helped me work through it. Her tests are designed to make you think and I learned to give good scientific reasoning behind my answers. In the end, I got an A-. She loves what she teaches and will make you love it too. "
3427,902669,4.5,4.0,"I haven't met a professor as dedicated to her students as Dr. S. She is ALWAYS available when requested for good reason and will stay with you until you get things figured out, even if it means working into the little hours of the night. Students that get intimidated by her can blame themselves only as they have not cared to engage her meaningfully"
3428,902669,1.5,5.0,"Dr. Sarafova is interesting and fun OUTSIDE the classroom. In the class, however, she is confusing, unclear, condescending, and presumes extensive knowledge from you in bio and chem.  Her tests are ABSURDLY difficult, often causing you to feel utterly unprepared for them even after studying thoroughly.  If you want a decent GPA, AVOID this class!"
3429,902669,1.5,4.0,"Although she's an enjoyable person outside of class, she is an extremely difficult professor. This has been my least favorite class at Davidson. Sarafova is unorganized, assumes extensive knowledge about both biology and chemistry, and overall just doesn't do a good job of explaining material and preparing us for tests."
3430,902669,1.5,5.0,"One of the worst teachers I've ever had. Her tests were obscenely, ridiculously difficult, and the manner in which she presented lecture material was extremely confusing. I would NOT recommend her for ANY Biology class; she made me lose my passion for and interest in the subject."
3431,902669,1.5,5.0,"Do not take this professor for Bio 111. She was hard to understand in and out of class, seemed easily irritated by 'dumb' questions, and generally was not supportive or helpful during class and office hours. At one point I asked her for study tips for the upcoming test. She helpfully responded that ""some people just can't think scientifically."""
3432,902669,4.5,5.0,"Wonderful class! Very interesting content. Best Bio Lab at Davidson. Great professor to get to know outside of class. However, she is difficult and demands a lot of work AND time. Tests are ridiculously hard, but she teaches well. This is not an ego-booster class, but you will be far more prepared for grad/med school. Plus she curves, big time!"
3433,902669,4.5,5.0,"She really knows her stuff. I took her Immunology class in the fall and her seminarish class, Immunological dysfunction, in the Spring. She is hard, but if you actually want to learn biology take her class you'll cover it all. If you show you care... alot... you'll never make anything less than a B because she'll work with you."
3434,902669,4.5,5.0,"I took Dr. Sarafova's immunology class and absolutely loved it! She is the most helpful professor I've had in Davidson and she managed to explain the complexity of the immune response very clearly. The labs were interesting but very challenging, which was difficult but also prepared us well for grad school. I haven't learnt so much in another class"
3435,902669,3.5,5.0,"While I loved getting to know her outside of class (she is EXTREMELY helpful in extra help and won't let you leave her without certainty that you understand), she is a very tough grader.  If on a question, you mess up the first part but get the rest right, she might give you no partial credit because she's annoyed that you missed &quot;something easy.&quot;"
3436,902669,2.5,5.0,"Though her lectures are interesting, Sarafova is very hard and sometimes hard to understand. She is available outside of class, but I felt that after a certain point she could not help me anymore. Tests are NOT all from notes and lectures and are hard to follow. Grading seemed very subjective!! I would not take her for 111!!!"
3437,902669,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher.  However she is not easy.  Nothing is impossible though, as long as you work hard you will be fine. She is always avaliable to help outside of class too, don't be intimidated by her (you will know what I mean when you meet her), she is very nice."
3438,902669,3.5,4.0,"I am no genius, but if you work hard, you just may be able to do well in the class. She cuts you no slack if you don't know the answers, though, so don't take her if you're looking for an ego-stroking professor. Overall, I enjoyed the class and think she's great... although I do wonder if the textbook was really wrong as many times as she claimed."
3439,902669,2.5,5.0,"people who commented first two may be are genius, because they say Dr. Sarafova is easy, but if you are a student with normal intelligence, no matter how much you study, tests are going to get you down for sure."
3440,902669,2.5,5.0,"dont take bio111 with this teacher if possible. tests questions are extremly vague and hard, lab grades are random,and getting grades back really late. But she is a very very nice person.But remember, a nice person does not mean a good teacher."
3441,902669,5.0,3.0,"really helpful, tests are completely from notes and lectures. TAKE SARAFOVA for BIO 111, she makes everything very clear!"
3442,902669,5.0,2.0,"really really good teacher. she makes things interesting because she has spent a lot of time working in the field. clear teacher. funny, very helpful. tests are fair. take her if you can"
3443,175659,1.0,3.0,She is the least understanding/supportive professor I have encountered throughout my Davidson career. Take her if you know everything will go exactly as planned.
3444,175659,4.0,4.0,"Extremely nice professor, but I would avoid if taking BIO 108 as a science distribution requirement. 5 tests throughout the semester and a cumulative final. Just makes you spend an unnecessarily long amount of time studying for exams in a class you are only taking for a requirement. I'd search around for other science options."
3445,175659,5.0,2.0,"She's the sweetest professor at Davidson. Even though she knows nobody is there for the science, she makes class and lab fun. Her tests demand attention to her lecture notes, but are fair. She's extremely receptive to student ideas and questions too, both about the material and any accommodations students may ask for."
3446,175659,5.0,2.0,Professor McNally gives very clear lectures . She does not give a lot of homework but she does give lots of readings. You won't regret taking her class.
3447,175659,5.0,5.0,Dr. McNally is one of the sweetest professors and always willing to help but this class is no joke. I thought that I could take this class as a requirement but it became the hardest class I have taken at Davidson to date. The lectures and information are really interesting but the tests are really difficult. I had to work really hard to get a C+.
3448,175659,5.0,4.0,"Took her for Microbes and for Human Bio. I did not do so well in Microbes fall of freshman year because I did not realize how much I had to study! But if you put it in the effort McNally makes it doable. Helpful, nice, and makes all the material easy to understand."
3449,175659,4.5,3.0,"mcnally is awesome. i took her microbes and disease class to fulfill my science core requirement and i actually enjoyed the class. she makes things interesting and clear. very good lecturer, very organized lectures. fair tests. definitely take mcnally."
3450,175659,4.5,3.0,"An excellent way to knock out the lab science. Dr. McNally is incredibly nice, an excellent teacher, and fair grader. Labs are often interesting, tests are detail-specific."
3451,175659,5.0,3.0,"McNally is the best teacher I've had at Davidson so far because she actually teaches and does it well.  Make sure to read the text for clicker questions.  The tests are far from easy so make sure to know all of the material from the text, lectures, and assignments. I loved this class and want to take another one from her!"
3452,175659,5.0,3.0,very understandable and intelligent about the topic--extremely interesting class
3453,175659,5.0,3.0,"The class was actually more exciting than I expected it to be. She's very helpful and understands that people are not always very interested in bio for this course. But you've gotta know your stuff for the tests...no joke. Gotta explain everything in detail and just know it. She makes no bones about that. Fun generally, but labs suck. Loooong."
3454,175659,5.0,4.0,"she is one of the most engaging professors i have ever had in my life. i was taking the bio 103 class just to get rid of one of my core requirements but now i'm even thinking about majoring or minoring in bio, she makes the class so interesting and she makes sure that people understand the concepts she is explaining, exams are challenging but fair"
3455,175659,5.0,2.0,"Like a breath of fresh air!  Super nice and helpful.  Not super difficult (labs especially easy), but you can't b.s. your way through tests.  Wished I could have had her for more courses!"
3456,175659,5.0,1.0,No Comments
3457,175659,4.0,4.0,"Passionate about the subject.  Unfortunately, sometimes it seems that she expects everyone to remember everything, but she's just doing her job--and doing it well."
3458,175659,4.0,4.0,The can be really hard b/c she wants you to know everything but she is really helpful.
3459,175661,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Campbell is nice and cares about her students and her class. She's a tough essay grader, but if you go to office hours and listen to her feedback she'll grade based on improvement."
3460,175661,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, if you conference with her on an essay before submitting then it's a guaranteed A, not too much work"
3461,175661,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Campbell is the MVP. She is charismatic, enthusiastic, and incredibly smart. She gives nuanced responses to questions and presents readings in context. Her fan fiction class was a gem because it was clear she cared about the topic and about the intellectual growth and personal well-being of her students. Very access-friendly."
3462,175661,5.0,4.0,"such a kind and caring professor. hadn't written an english paper in about a year before her class and she was so willing to help me through it all. made an 8:30 manageable. a little difficult for me since I usually struggle in english classes, but it was still a great class. clearly loves what she does and her students"
3463,175661,4.0,3.0,The best way forward in this class is to take advantage of critique.
3464,175661,5.0,3.0,"Campbell's lectures were always clear. Her assignments were rarely boring but they were never easy. She offers loads of help outside of class, so I definitely recommend seeing her in office hours (it will definitely boost your grade). Try to be prepared for her class as best as possible to understand class, but she rarely puts you on the hot seat."
3465,175661,4.5,3.0,Amazing professor. Lectures were  never boring. Great at taking complex ideas and explaining them in a way that makes sense. Go to her office hours. Highly recommended.
3466,175661,4.0,3.0,"I took her 231 class last semester and felt comfortable in her class despite never enjoying reading before. I would say the reading is quite demanding if you choose to do it. A worthwhile class for all I would say, as Professor Campbell really cares about her students and is passionate about the subject matter and wants her students to do well."
3467,175661,4.5,2.0,"Abo****ely, 100% awesome.  Energetic lecturer, interesting material, not too difficult.  Dr. Campbell is one of the best."
3468,175661,4.5,3.0,Dr. Campbell not only makes class interesting but she really pushes you to improve your writing. Highly recommended!
3469,175661,4.5,3.0,"I took Dr. Campbell's Writing About Toys class and I absolutely loved it. The reading for class wasn't outrageous, yet we did alot of writing and my research and citation skills definitely improved. I also gained an interest in the effect toys/ads have on kids and society. I'm happy I had her as a professor because she cares alot and it shows!"
3470,175661,5.0,3.0,I took her Writing About Toys class for my W.  There's not too much reading outside of class.  If you do your papers early and take them in to her during office hours she'll give you feedback which can really help your grade in the end.  She made me a better writer too which is a huge help at Davidson.  Take her for your W course.
3471,175661,4.5,4.0,Shes an awesome teacher!! she'll really help you improve your papers! take her!
3472,175661,5.0,3.0,Dr. Campbell is definitely my favorite teacher. She's so helpful and definitely knows what she's talking about. She really helped improve my writing. Class was always fun and I'm actually sad it's over!
3473,175661,5.0,4.0,Professor Campbell is one of the best and kindest teachers that I have ever had.  She knows what she is talking about but is open to your opinions.  She has a structure to her class but is flexible.  The class is productive yet relaxed.  She is a very fair and thorough grader.
3474,175661,5.0,2.0,"I graduated in '02, but had Dr. Campbell for two classes (220 and 301) and she was my advisor.  Highly, highly recommended.  She's a great teacher and a really cool person.  She's not an easy grader by most standards, but getting a B-B+ is a given if you do the reading...at Davidson, that's pretty good."
3475,175661,5.0,2.0,Dr. Campbell is great.  She is so nice and funny and always willing to meet with you if you need help in the class.  I feel I improved alot during her writing class.  Definitly recommend taking her class!
3476,175661,5.0,3.0,One of the nicest professor I had at Davidson.  Always willing to help and extremely approachable.  She made the course be both fun and interesting.
3477,175661,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic professor. Friendly, interesting, and happy to help all the time. Really passionate about what she teachers.  Lots of fun to be around.  I miss her &quot;worst week&quot; contests, where she'd go around and declare someone's workload the worst.  Great sense of humor."
3478,175661,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Really wants to help students do as well as they possibly can. Friendly and easy to get along with. Her expectations are clear, though not easy. Extremely approachable, and really enjoys what she does, and it shows. Really down to earth but definitely knows her stuff. Brilliant."
3479,175661,5.0,3.0,"Great class.  She's very approachable and makes class interesting.  And, she's fun to look at :-)"
3480,175661,5.0,2.0,I also took her for Women Writers and she is pretty easy and really helpful and understanding.
3481,491056,3.0,5.0,"While I did learn lots in the Memory Research class, this had to be the hardest class I've taken at Davidson. Multhaup has a ridiculously confusing syllabus and gives out an absurd amount of assignments (labs/tests/dailyQs/presentations)."
3482,491056,5.0,5.0,"Not an easy class nor easy professor, but excellent organization and presentation of information. She is one of the most intelligent professors at Davidson and incredibly helpful if you seek out office hours. Can't miss class, must study research trends, and get the book. One of the most monumentally important classes I ever took. She's amazing."
3483,491056,3.5,4.0,Tests come directly from notes so you cannot skip class. She is extremely organized and definitely challenges you. She is willing to help even though she may seem intimidating.
3484,491056,4.0,4.0,This class is hard but if you study it is worth is. Dr. Multhaup is so great and an awesome teacher. These other reviews don't do her justice. This class is so interesting and I'm so glad I took it with Multhaup.
3485,491056,2.5,5.0,"Multhaup's class is impossible to do well in. Her questions on the tests seem to have more than one right answer, but no matter which answer you pick, it will be the wrong one. She also expects you to remember the smallest details. Its almost like asking what was the 3rd word in the second paragraph on page 100 in the textbook."
3486,491056,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Multhaup is an absolutely horrendous** professor. Stay away at all costs!! She is of no help, she is mean, she has no sympathy, and a very poor overall professor. She just reads off slides. Not to mention she makes an interesting subject very dull."
3487,491056,3.5,5.0,"Only problem with Dr. Multhaup is that she is one of those professors who asks questions on tests and then gives two right answers and expects you to pick the &quot;more correct&quot; one. I am the type of person who always picks the less common, less obvious, but still correct one. Somehow I still tested poorly. I will never understand it. correct=correct"
3488,491056,3.0,4.0,"powerpoint lectures every day appear clear, but tests are impossible. avoid at all costs."
3489,491056,4.0,4.0,"Take it from another professor-while the power points and examples are helpful, I still do horribly on the tests.  Don't take this class as an &quot;easy&quot; class. P.S. She hates when you ask if certain info will be on the test."
3490,491056,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Multhaup is wonderful. She is so detailed and organized.  Her lectures make perfect sense and although her tests require lot of studying, it's easy to figure out what's important based on what she emphasizes in class. She can be intimidating, but is one of the best professors at Davidson. Great preparation for grad school!"
3491,491056,4.5,3.0,Very clear and organized! Excellent powerpoints
3492,491056,4.5,3.0,No Comments
3493,491056,1.5,4.0,"Take it from another Professor.  I mean look, there are so many others!  Why take it from an inarticulate powerpointer like Multhaup&#63;  I learned what I needed to, and actually found Psychology pretty interesting, but her style is intolerable.  If you don't believe me now, let me remind you that Davidson does have an add/drop policy."
3494,491056,4.5,4.0,Excellent lecturer: keeps class interesting and engaging.  Tests are death and don't seem to reflect effort at all.  Reuses tests and extremely neurotic about making sure that 0 information about old tests leaks out.  Very sarcastic and insincere but in a funny way at times.
3495,491056,4.0,5.0,"I am currently in a graduate psychology program, and Dr. Multhap's classes are EXCELLENT training for writing in psychology. I recommend her to anyone planning on going to grad shcool in PSYC."
3496,491056,4.5,4.0,"Knows her stuff as well as any prof in the world. Powerpoint lectures every day, which can get boring. Extremely difficult but fair tests. Grade dist. in the class right now is 1 A, mostly B's, slightly less C's, and a few uglies. Material can get redundant; field is new, unproven. Good class overal"
3497,507443,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Marti is very knowledgeable in sociology, but I had him for WRI 101. Our entire grade was based on 3 papers of 2000, 3000, and 4000 words. Directions for papers are very long but if you put in a lot of effort, an A is achievable. Definitely spent too much time writing papers for this class, but it payed off. "
3498,507443,2.0,4.0,"Prof. Mart&iacute; is extremely knowledge in sociology, but for a 101 class, his standards were too exacting. We wrote 2000, 3000, and 4000 word papers with wordy and unclear instruction. Overall, I definitely learned a lot and liked the topic, but Marti's teaching and lack of accessibility outside of class made the class unnecessarily difficult."
3499,507443,1.0,4.0,He never seemed to be prepared with a lesson. Class was just him rambling about what he had already said before over and over again. The workload is overwhelming and he expects you to know everything he is talking about. Not once was he available for office hours. He doesn't care about your opinion. DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS MAN PLS!!!
3500,507443,1.0,4.0,This class was awful. Mart&iacute; told me many times that my questions were useful and did not deserve an answer. He was unaccessible outside of class and gave no guidance and little feedback. DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM.
3501,507443,2.0,4.0,"He is very self centered. Everything connects to him somehow, but you can never connect anything to you or your experience. That doesn't matter to him."
3502,507443,3.0,5.0,"I took SOC 105. 100-150 pages of reading per class with a 2 page reflection paper due every Tuesday on top of a normal course load of papers and a final project. Dr. Marti's workload will consume your free time and leave you no time to prepare for any other classes. Super smart and interesting guy, but I highly recommend to not take."
3503,507443,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Marti was probably the hardest, and most rewarding professor I've had. He is one of the top experts on sociology of religion in the nation, and it shows. TONS of reading, excellent discussions, and you come out of that class prepared to take any class at Davidson with lots of reading/writing."
3504,507443,4.0,5.0,"Be prepared to read and write weekly essays. However, he knows what he is talking about and full of useful information."
3505,507443,4.0,4.0,"Marti is funny and insightful, his class has helped me develop a sort of sociological tool kit to analyze the world. The class does feel very regimented at times, there are definitely times for you to contribute and other times for you to listen and take notes. I like Marti but he is definitely absorbed in his methods. Probably would take again."
3506,507443,2.0,4.0,A LOT of reading. Weekly essays. Cannot say I learned a lot.
3507,507443,5.0,5.0,"A ton of reading, but extremely interesting. A lot of writing. Awesome professor that cares about each student."
3508,507443,5.0,4.0,"Theory is hard to read, but I learned to read pretty thick stuff in the semester, and my world opened up. Be ready for a lot of reading. And be ready to be challenged on your understanding of that reading. We're all smart students yet, really, a dose of intellectual humility is needed for this course. You'll get a lot out of it."
3509,507443,4.5,4.0,"Be ready to read write discuss. Good moments of explanation. Interesting stuff. Came away learning more than I thought since it's a constant process of reflection and evaluation of what we think we ""know"" already."
3510,507443,4.0,4.0,"People who think Sociology is a joke, should take a Marti class. Dr. Marti is a GENIUS, but TOUGH. Learning is from him is completely enlightening, but he is not afraid to knock you down several pegs in public. THERE IS SO MUCH READING YOU COULD DROWN, and he grades papers very erratically with basically no feedback. However, you learn A LOT."
3511,507443,5.0,4.0,Yep. Good. Smart. Books. Papers. Talking. College.
3512,507443,5.0,4.0,Really interesting. Lots of discussion. Tons of reading.
3513,507443,5.0,4.0,"Various readings that mix a textbook and several paperbacks. All in all the class gives a fairly well-rounded overview of sociology. He lectures a bit to bring out points and clarify things. Smart man. Interesting stuff. He talks ~with~ students (not ~to~ students), and available when needed. I wouldn't say easy, lots of analytical writing."
3514,507443,3.5,3.0,"Weekly papers and 3 major papers= very writing intensive. Read the books. Marti is a grear professor that gives you a lot of room to make your own decisions, which can be difficult at times. But he's very helpful and wants you to learn. Fun class."
3515,507443,5.0,4.0,"Defining &quot;easy&quot; depends on what you expect.  Expect powerpoint, list & definition lectures with memory regurgitating tests&#63;  Marti is not for you.  Expect dialogue, thinking through material, writing assignments based on your questions & interests&#63; This is the place.  Don't expect easy. Expect to learn.  I did fine."
3516,507443,4.0,4.0,"Plenty of writing both for the course and in class. Marti believes students shouldn't be babied so he doesn't give a lot of point by point lectures. Instead, he insists students bring their own interests and questions from readings & works from that. He knows lots of stuff, pretty nice, but some looking for &quot;easy&quot; might be frustrated."
3517,507443,2.0,4.0,"weekly papers. Fun discussions. 3 big papers. grades harshly. Bottom line is do you a fun and interesting class or do you want a good grade&#63;the man can be too vague in what he wants, but he is nice person."
3518,507443,4.0,4.0,"This class was definitely very challenging but it was also my favorite class at Davidson. There is a lot of work but if you think for yourself and show him that you understand the topics when writing your papers, you will do very well. If you hate writing papers, I wouldn't take this class."
3519,507443,5.0,4.0,"Cool prof, lots of reading. Lots.  We discuss in class, very interesting.  He knows this stuff backwards and forwards so it can be a range of topics but I like it."
3520,507443,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Marti is a FANTASTIC professor.  More personal attention than most others, and the man knows his theory.  Makes sense of readings I couldn't quite get on my own.  My appreciation for theory went way up and going through the class radically changed the way I see the world.  I don't think I really understood sociology until I took this class."
3521,507443,4.5,4.0,"Great vibe, interesting discussions, mind-expanding material.  Ok, yes you have to read and write and talk and do other assignments, but I came to college to learn and I learned a lot from this guy."
3522,507443,3.5,3.0,"a really nice guy, helps out if you need anything.... must do the reading, tough grader on the papers, can be unclear at times but i learned a ton"
3523,507443,4.5,3.0,"Cool prof who likes to discuss.  Lecutres are interesting (if you call them lectures, just sometimes introduces or expands on topics).  Papers mostly with a final paper instead of a final exam.  Big variety of reading assingments so be ready to print out tons of paper."
3524,507443,4.5,3.0,Lot's of disucssion.  Books interesting but there's a ton of reading.  Overall I liked the class and did ok but didn't do as well on the writing assignments as I wanted.
3525,507443,1.5,5.0,Dr. Marti is a horrible professor and holds extremely liberal views that he imposes upon his students.  He is completely useless during office hours as he offers no help whatsoever in writing papers.  Do not take this class unless you love doing lots of work and not receiving the grade you deserve.
3526,507443,2.0,3.0,Good class but there's a fine line between teaching and class discussion. He misses it sometimes.
3527,507443,5.0,3.0,"Really fun class, workload is kinda hard, but the actual class is really good."
3528,507443,5.0,4.0,Lots of class interaction; need to keep an open mind as you work through readings and discussion.  This became was one of my favorite classes so far.
3529,507443,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3530,507444,3.0,3.0,The actual class was enjoyable but her grading was unfair. She would grade down if she did not agree with your opinion. There were three short papers and a group project along with the final. Participation someway was graded. May not help your GPA.
3531,507444,2.0,1.0,"Dr. Kaufman didn't really teach this course. Students were expected to read the materials and lead discussions in order to teach each other. Dr. Kaufman observed and that's it. I learned a lot from the assigned readings, but nothing from the class itself. I did conduct my own research though which was cool but that was something I chose to do."
3532,507444,2.0,3.0,"She might be better in other classes, but she didn't know how to speak in SOC 102. She would start a sentence and pack it with filler words before abandoning the thought entirely."
3533,507444,4.5,3.0,Very nice and knowledgeable. Made me really think about gender.
3534,507444,4.5,2.0,"If you put a decent amount of effort into a paper, Kaufman will give you an A or high B. She's also very helpful outside of class and easy to talk to. Her class was fairly easy and interesting at the same time."
3535,507444,2.5,2.0,"Class was very boring and Kaufman wasn't a very effective discussion leader, but she grades really easily."
3536,507444,4.0,2.0,"Easy class, boring though. Recommend if your a slacker like me"
3537,507444,3.0,4.0,"Grades harder than you expect; the class itself is interesting and enlightening, but boring without class participation. Prof. Kaufman is cool, but seems a bit aloof at times, and although willing to help, it's debatable how helpful her efforts prove."
3538,507444,4.0,2.0,Lectures daily & big on participation
3539,507444,4.0,3.0,"Very sweet, class is interesting if you like the topic. Lectures but always wants students opinions. A big of a space case and rambles a little bit, but I enjoy her class and feel comfortable going to her for extra help. Tests easy if you study but grades surprisingly low for no apparent reason."
3540,507444,3.0,3.0,"Interesting topics and knowledgeable prof (could answer any questions).  Easy/fun courses, but then grades usually surprisingly low &amp; sometimes inconsistent.  Had trouble controlling class &amp; always behind schedule."
3541,507444,4.0,2.0,"Easy, but very interesting class."
3542,507444,4.0,2.0,"Class was pretty easy. If you are prepared (which isn't asking too much), you will do fine. No worries. She's nice, but lectures can be boring. Uses PowerPoint to a fault. Tries to tie material to the everyday, which is satisfying. Grades fairly; I did OK and didn't invest much time into class. Good"
3543,507445,3.0,5.0,"Very tough grader on papers and tests. His handwriting is basically horrifying... Although his discussions are interesting, he dominates the discussion... I've fallen asleep quite a lot of times in his class. I also watch the clock in every class. However, he's helpful outside of class."
3544,507445,3.5,5.0,"Very tough grader on papers and tests. His handwriting is basically horrifying... Although his discussions are interesting, he dominates the discussion... I've fallen asleep quite a lot of times in his class. I also watch the clock in every class. However, he's helpful outside of class. Very interesting guy, but my HUM 150 teacher topped Epes."
3545,507445,3.0,4.0,"Discussions were extremely disappointing, not very invigorating. Grades papers pretty tough, very nice guy, but leaves sarcastic comments that come across as mean on papers"
3546,507445,2.0,5.0,"As a discussion leader, he talks for the enitre class. However, His class doesnt motivate you to do the work, which could end up costing you big time."
3547,507445,1.5,4.0,"The class is far from being intellually-stimulating. He also smokes like a friggin' chimney, and stinks up the class room for the first few minutes."
3548,507445,4.0,2.0,"Pretty easy grader, but looks really closely into your papers and leaves a lot of comments. Leads most of the discussion himself, which is good. Very intelligent, a nice guy. Will quickly respond to emails."
3549,507445,5.0,4.0,No Comments
3550,507445,4.0,3.0,"He likes to talk, which means you usually don't have to...and that's nice at 9:30 in the morning.  Plus the gobble is sexy"
3551,507445,4.5,4.0,"Insightful, but tough.  A good man."
3552,327219,3.5,2.0,"She makes class extremely entertaining and her lectures are filled with energy and fun. The course requires a lot of homework and the assessments are fairly tough. She is also a little all over the place so you have to be able to go with the flow. Overall, however, I learned a lot and would definitely take the course again!"
3553,327219,3.5,2.0,"I loved Professor Scott, but she has a distinct style. The class I took was highly entertaining and I loved going to class, yet highly disorganized and homework was deep. I would recommend her unless organization is a must."
3554,327219,3.0,3.0,"it may be hard to decipher, but she is really looking out for you in every way possible. her lectures were pretty disorganized and killed far too many trees with the assigned busywork, but she wants you to succeed - if you put in the time and effort, you will. Tests are not hard if you study the grammar."
3555,327219,3.0,3.0,"She is very disorganized. Homework is easy and the tests are average. However, maneuvering through her many google docs can be a pain and make the class slightly unmanageable. "
3556,327219,4.5,3.0,"Professor Scott appears to be a harsh grader in class, but when it comes to the final grade she is much better. She assigns busy homework but it makes you learn the stuff. Also, Quizlet really helps with tests. She's hands down the best looking professor at Davidson, so that always kept me on the ball as well."
3557,327219,2.5,4.0,"I am half hispanic but had little grammar knowledge coming into to the class. The homework was busy work and we spent most of class checking the homework instead of learning anything new. When we did ""learn"" something new it was unorganized and rushed she overestimates how much she can get done. She is nice but not that great of a professor."
3558,327219,2.0,2.0,This class was way too hard for a 102 level course. Homework was essentially busywork and the final blog assignment was interesting but took 10x the time she said it would and she kept adding random requirements. Her notes on the board were unorganized and frantic in the last 5 minutes of class. The tests were very long and hard.
3559,327219,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Scott is a wonderful person, but he spanish class is not the best. I came in with a relative 2 years of prior to the class. The class was extremely dis-organized. I recommend that if you have problems go see her during office hours. The office hours were usually first come first serve. In sum, I had a tough time, lots of h.w!"
3560,327219,4.0,3.0,"People complain about professor Scott, and it's true; she gives more homework and is more demanding than the other 201 professors.  That said, she is a fabulous professor and the one you should take if you really want to develop a good base to continue in Spanish. Love her, and learned so much in this class."
3561,327219,4.0,3.0,"Profesora Scott is a really interesting Spanish teacher. It helps that she loves teaching introductory Spanish and really wants everyone to learn. I learned a crazy amount of Spanish in just a semester. Don't take her if you're bothered by chaos and disorganization. Take her if you want to learn fast, but be prepared for a ton of homework."
3562,327219,2.0,4.0,If you do not go to this women's class you can absolutely forget about getting a good grade. She is very nice but crazyyyy at the same time. You will be doing homework for hours. Not worth it! if you can do not take this class.
3563,327219,4.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, Scott is a perfectly nice person but her attendance policies are ridiculous and the amount of useless busywork she gives as homework is absurd. This class will take up a huge portion of your time. Don't take this class unless you want to take the equivalent of a bad high school spanish class."
3564,327219,4.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR OR THIS CLASS .   WARNING
3565,327219,3.0,4.0,"Professor Scott is a very nice person but i do not recommend taking her as a teacher.  She gives waaaay too much homework that does not improve your spanish.  her conception of time management is completely unreasonable. additionally, she grades extremely tough."
3566,327219,4.5,3.0,"Rosalba is simply amazing! The best professor I have encountered at Davidson. She is so enthusiastic about her spanish and her students. She is a native speaker, who is extremely knowledgeable and experienced. She does give a lot of work, mainly compositions and reading, but her class is definitely worth the work! Visit her office if you need help."
3567,327219,4.0,5.0,"She's an enthusiastic professor who is enormously helpful when you meet with her one-on-one. She expects you to know & use your grammar. She does give a lot of written work that you have to hand in, but she gets them back to you & really wants you to learn from your previous works. Dedicate time to this class and your writing will really improve."
3568,327219,3.0,3.0,"Great energy &amp; fun. A whole lot more work than I expected. Can be really disorganized, but craziness of lectures made it entertaining.  Assignments were usually easy &amp; an easy/fair grader."
3569,327219,5.0,2.0,"i'm basically obsessed w/ rosalba.  she was such a great professor; very engaging, fun, and compassionate.  really connects with students on personal basis.  i'll miss her :("
3570,327219,4.0,2.0,"She was a good teacher, but kind of flighty, if you get my drift.  I enjoyed her class, fairly easy grade"
3571,327219,5.0,4.0,"Amazing.  Be ready to work, but she makes it worth it.  I hd her for an 8:30 class and she's better than a cup of coffee.  High energy and great at making the language come alive.  Made me want to be a spanish major."
3572,327219,4.5,3.0,Ms. Scott has been an AWESOME professor. She has gone beyond any expectations I had before. I personally don't like Spanish but have to admit that I look forward to her class everyday. I have learned a lot more than I did during two years of HS and a year in Davidson. Hard class but great quality!
3573,327219,4.0,3.0,"Lots of pointless work, isn't very organized, you'll never know what you're doing in class till you get there... even then sometimes you aren't sure. Always willing to help though"
3574,327219,5.0,2.0,"Rosalba is awesome.  She's very funny and her class is interesting.  For my class she didn't give tests or quizzes, just essays and readings.  And her class really improved my speaking skills."
3575,327219,4.5,2.0,"She goes out of her way to help students. She is an amazing professor, but you better be willing to work."
3576,327219,4.5,1.0,No Comments
3577,175671,4.0,3.0,"You read one section of the homework (10-15 pages) and present it to the class. Good way to work on public speaking and learn a lot without reading a lot. The research papers are loosely related to class presentations but in way more detail. He takes forever to return grades and the directions are always confusing. Nice professor, not fave class."
3578,175671,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Wertheimer is very nice professor and quite passionate toward his field; however, this class was not only confusing but boring. Each class period is marked by student presentations even though the few graded papers were not connected but entirely research-based. The directions nor the syllabus were clear."
3579,175671,2.0,4.0,"He does not teach the class. The class is taught by students. Students are assigned readings and they present them to the class, the class takes notes on them, and that is the class for the whole semester. You also have 4 papers that are the entire grade and he does not give any instruction on how to do them or do well. His knowledge is large tho."
3580,175671,5.0,4.0,One of the best Professors. Really cares about students; is generous with deadline extensions. Really learned a lot from him.
3581,175671,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Wertheimer's class because I'd heard great things about him. He lived up to my expectations &amp; exceeded them! He is very smart, helpful, and taught me about researching &amp; think in the field of history. He is SO dedicated to students &amp; goes above &amp; beyond. Go to office hours to talk any subject, &amp; especially about class (tough grader!)."
3582,175671,3.0,4.0,"I liked Dr. Wertheimer. He cares about his students and he clearly loves teaching, but I found his class to be overly difficult for a writing 101. I worked hard on the papers, and never really attained a high mark. Sometimes professors don't like the way you write, and that's okay. However, it was frustrating to experience that in my writing 101."
3583,175671,5.0,4.0,One of the smartest people you'll meet. Greatly improved my writing.
3584,175671,5.0,3.0,"This professor is essentially Ross from ""Friends"". He knows what he's talking about, he always clarifies class discussions, and everything we learn is taught from our peers. This is also not a textbook-based class, but there are three huge papers that make up 75% of your grade. I just love this professor honestly all the work is worth it."
3585,175671,5.0,4.0,"As good as it gets. He's a great guy and a dynamite lecturer, and he uses innovative course structures that give students a lot of freedom. You'll learn a ton and your writing will become more clear, concise, and compelling. Take his courses if you are willing to put in work."
3586,175671,3.5,4.0,"Very nice man, but incredibly strict. Also a very hard grader, but tries to give students extra credits. Be prepared to work VERY VERY hard for a good grade in his class."
3587,175671,4.0,4.0,super helpful
3588,175671,4.5,4.0,"This guy is very intelligent. His lectures are the most engaging I've had so far; he uses interesting primary sources to elaborate and he generally inserts clever comments of his own. A decent amount of reading, not too bad. Very hard to get grades in the A range, especially with essays. Overall the class was very enjoyable and the prof was great."
3589,175671,2.5,4.0,"I believe his test are impossible to ace. The lecture-portion of tests kills me, the &#63;'s come from the most obscure places. H/E he does teach u helpful analytical techniques. My best advice is that you really must like/LOVE history, or &quot;Grade A&quot; work will seem unnecessary. No easy grade, but def worth it if you are here to learn -&gt; quality teacher"
3590,175671,5.0,3.0,"Dr. W has got to be one of the best professors at Davidson. You will never be bored in his class because he makes time fly with his meaty and enthralling lectures. His tests are very hard--but he gives partial credit on multiple choice (seriously). Funny, helpful, and really interesting to talk to outside of class. You won´t regret taking him!"
3591,175671,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Wertheimer was a great professor. He lectured a lot, but you could get by in class without doing the reading. However when studying for his reviews, in order to do well, you have to go over all the material and know it well. I loved his class though and I would love to take another class with him."
3592,175671,5.0,4.0,Dr. Wertheimer is a wonderful professor who goes out of his way to make sure you understand the material and use your brain. Truly enjoys his subject area and working with his students.
3593,175671,5.0,3.0,"Clear, Creative, Effective.  Great guy, great class!"
3594,175671,5.0,1.0,Awesome. Great lectures. Great reading. Very tough Prof but worth it. Take Hist 355.
3595,175671,5.0,4.0,"Razor-sharp, and expects as much from everyone else.  Excellent, enlightening professor."
3596,175671,5.0,5.0,Was my advisor when I was at davidson.  Still keep in touch with him.
3597,175671,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. I learned a lot in his class. Smart and funny guy.
3598,175671,5.0,3.0,"VERY smart, VERY wordy, VERY funny. Class consists mainly of lectures. His tests are nearly impossible, yet he's an easy grader."
3599,175671,4.5,3.0,Great professor and a great writing instructor.
3600,175671,1.0,3.0,"This guy is a total weirdo, stay as far away from him as you can."
3601,175671,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher who is really passionate about history.  A fair grader - it's not hard to get a B, but very hard to get an A.  All around great guy."
3602,175671,4.5,2.0,The class is kinda boring but he is a nice teacher and its not that hard
3603,2336313,1.0,1.0,"If you go to her office hours get ready to have none of your questions answered and a lot of ""what do you think?"" You are stuck with the same people in your group and she definitely has favorites when picking them. If you are placed with someone who doesn't participate, be prepared to have your grade lowered with no exceptions. No feedback too."
3604,2336313,1.0,2.0,Get ready for idea maps because that is the whole course. Don't like your cohort? Too bad. Want feedback? You aren't getting any. This course is easy if you can pretend you know what you're talking about. She doesn't care to answer your questions and will penalize you for disagreeing with her.
3605,2336313,2.0,1.0,"While I thought the course readings were well-curated, the day-to-day structure of class was extremely repetitive with almost no explicit instruction all semester. Every class period consisted of doing the exact same concept map assignment, with very little input from the professor. She was also absent for at least one-quarter of our class periods."
3606,2336313,2.0,1.0,"Garcia Peacock is not a serious professor. If you want a class where there wont be much work and you can get an easy grade, take her. You will be wasting your time. Garcia Peacock missed class about a fourth of the time. She didnt really seem to care about teaching. Every class was the same with useless idea maps and superfluous discussions."
3607,2336313,5.0,3.0,Very passionate about what she is teaching. I really enjoyed her class.
3608,2336313,1.0,2.0,"I strongly despise this class. Peacock's style is entirely discussion-based, doing &quot;visualizations&quot; on the board, and regurgitating what stupid freshmen say into what she thinks for most of the discussion. If you want to learn something, do not take this class. If you want the hardest challenge to be getting through boring classes, take it. don't"
3609,2336313,5.0,3.0,"Dr. GP is AMAZING. Taking Writing 101 with her was a treat. She really wants to see genuine effort and improvement, and she always had great, concrete ideas on how I could improve. Class activities always included discussion, but it wasn't intimidating. She makes a huge effort to get to know her students outside of class and is so caring!"
3610,2336313,4.0,4.0,"As an environmental studies professor with abundant historical knowledge, Dr. Garcia Peacock fits well in the liberal arts scheme.* She also teaches writing. Her classes primarily focus on the fundamentals of discussion technique. Dr. GP brings her diverse skill set to the classroom. A young professor, she has transitioned well to the big leagues."
3611,1076795,1.5,4.0,"I love Psychology but could not stand Carole's class.  Her lectures were unorganized and extremely boring, she is an unnecessarily harsh grader, and has very little interest in her students.  Very unenthusiastic, doesn't seem to care about what/who she is teaching.  Grading policy and vague exam guidelines make it difficult to do well in the class."
3612,1076795,2.5,4.0,"One of the most boring professors I've ever had the misfortune of encountering. A fellow classmate fell asleep and had dreams during class. The way the class is graded doesn't make any sense either, easy tasks are too heavily weighted, difficult tasks under weighted. Badly planned, boring and unnecessarily difficult."
3613,1076795,4.5,2.0,"I really enjoyed this class.  Reasonable workload and reviews were fair.  Most of the classes were lectures with power points, which I thought was a good format.  Not the most enthusiastic professor, but she definitely knew the subject.  Office hours were helpful."
3614,1076795,2.0,5.0,She is a teacher that thinks she is really fun and interesting. But is not. Her lectures are boring and you will find yourself hating her for making such interesting material into a race of copying notes rather than explaining and using in real life situations. Get Boyd
3615,1076795,4.5,3.0,"A solid intro psych course.  Class is entirely lecture and follows the book almost exactly.  Lots of reading, but that is expected because of the range of material covered.  Tests cover four chapters at a time.  Dr. Martin is very helpful outside of class and is very approachable.  The class is not necessarily &quot;exciting&quot; but by no means bad at all."
3616,2455100,5.0,2.0,Mekonen is amazing. She always speaks German to you in class from day 1 and is very accessible. Her class is VERY EASY. The tests can be difficult but they only count for 20% of the grade so it's still really easy to get an A if you do all the homework and study for quizzes. I don't know of anyone with complaints about her.
3617,2666048,5.0,3.0,She is an incredible professor super enthusiastic and easy to understand.
3618,175681,4.0,3.0,Dr. Cain is a great professor! His class can be a little dry but he does a good job of making the material relevant to all of his students. Exams aren't too difficult and he loves it when students come to office hours. Good option for people in environmental studies/ who need a science credit.
3619,175681,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Cain is a very experienced professor and it shows in his teaching style in and outside of class. His lectures are very clear and if not, his door is always open. Like any other physics course, the amount of time involved in completing and understanding is the most difficult part. But Dr. Cain makes it as easy as possible."
3620,175681,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Cain is wonderful. He gives very clear and interesting lectures, but a lot of homework as well. His office hours were very helpful and he is always available. Definitely would take another physics class with him."
3621,175681,4.0,3.0,"Cain is friendly, approachable, and full of energy. He gives pretty good lectures and answers questions pretty well in office hours. The subject material is easy, and the workload is manageable, but the test questions are relatively difficult and sometimes graded harshly. I pulled out an A-, but it didn't come easily. Overall, I recommend."
3622,175681,3.0,2.0,"Nice guy, but poor choice of classroom. I blame the seats..."
3623,175681,5.0,4.0,He's a great lecturer and he keeps your attention in class despite how comfortable the seats are. The lectures serve more as supplements to the chapter readings. Starts off with a lot of homework but thins down towards the end of the semester. He really wants his students to succeed and more or less forces office hours.
3624,175681,5.0,1.0,Fairly easy physics class.  Very reasonable grader.  He gives great partial credit on problems.  It's very straight forward and should not be difficult if you have experience with prior physics classes.  He is a great lecturer and clearly cares about his students.  Always available to help.  He really wants you to learn physics.
3625,175681,4.0,3.0,"Cain expects you to read the chapters yourself, and that the lectures are more of an addition to them. He goes through the content very quickly, and grades relatively harshly on homework and tests. Cain never goes through the computations in class, but expects that you can do them perfectly on homework and tests."
3626,175681,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Cain knows what he's doing. He teaches and explains things very clearly, so even non-physics majors can understand the material. He's even more helpful in office hours, giving you exactly the answer that you're looking for. He does grade a little too harshly, but the workload for the class is very manageable. Overall, I wasn't too disappointed."
3627,175681,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely adore Dr. Cain. I would become a physics major just for him if I wasn't so bad at physics. The class isn't too bad, and there actually isn't that much calculus. He grades homework pretty hard, but the tests are fair."
3628,175681,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Cain is really tough and expects a lot from you on tests, but overall very fair. USE HIS OFFICE HOURS! They saved me in 130 :) He really knows his stuff, loves to teach, and will go over things with you over and over until you understand. Beware: he almost always answers your question with a question, so that you figure things out yourself."
3629,175681,3.0,3.0,"Despite earnestly wanting to teach everyone physics, he breezes through material, and often confuses students more than helps them during questions. Tests were pretty straightforward though."
3630,175681,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Cain is amazing.  He is not an easy grader, but is fair and always willing to help.  His lectures are clear and easy to follow.  He keeps it interesting."
3631,175681,4.0,3.0,"Cain is a great guy. An entertaining and pretty funny lecturer. Even though the chairs make half the class fall asleep, he does a good job of keeping folks engaged. HW is easy enough and you should take notes of the reading as you go along. Class notes are important for tests, which are kind of hard. He looks a lot like Merlin. Wish he had an owl."
3632,175681,5.0,3.0,Excellent teacher. Very good class and lectures.  The homework was extremely hard but it was good preparation for the exams.  I'll always be a bit bummed my grade got hit because I didn't see the 5th question on the final.
3633,175681,4.5,3.0,"Amazing professor. Quirky at times, but in a hilarious way. He really knows his stuff, and while he avoids giving straight answers to questions, he always does a good job leading you towards the solution. Favorite Davidson professor by far."
3634,175681,5.0,3.0,"Always available and eager to help. Homework grades help your average as he does not grade too hard on those, but tests are graded harder. Lecture style can make it hard to stay awake, but Dr. Cain is sooo nice and sometimes funny too."
3635,175681,4.0,3.0,"Haha, I wish he were my uncle, too!  He is HILARIOUS!  The quintessential professor!  I struggled in his class, because I did not always complete the readings and physics is not my best area; however, he does his best to be clear and at the very least will keep you entertained.  Some people got bored in lecture: chairs conducive to sleeping.  Cozy."
3636,175681,4.0,4.0,"He is genuinely interested in teaching and it shows. He is always available, and he is really excited to see students come in for office hours. The tests are hard, and he can move a little fast in lectures. SIt in the front row and go to office hours...it really makes a difference with him."
3637,175681,4.0,3.0,"I only had Dr. Cain in lab for Physics 130.  He is nice most of the time but as the lab goes on, he can get on your nerves.  It's weird; if you are screwing up, he'll lecture you, unless it's just so bad that you can't help but apologize repeatedly.  Then all of a sudden he's Mister Nice Guy."
3638,175681,4.0,4.0,I LOVE Dr. Cain. I was horrible at Physics and he was so helpful. Great professor who is always willing to give extra time.
3639,175681,4.0,5.0,"Like Capt. Ahab, and astronomical knowledge is his whale.  Says, &quot;NOW!&quot; at inappropriate times, like when talks about the past: &quot;Albert Einstein was a genius NOW!&quot;  Says, &quot;Please!&quot; at absurd times: &quot;Stars don't work that way, PLEASE!&quot; Makes funny sounds like CHOO-CHOO-CHOO when he works computer.  Tough class, but helpful teacher.  Knowledgeable!"
3640,175681,3.5,3.0,I wish he were my uncle.
3641,175681,3.0,3.0,"Astronomy is a pretty easy class if you keep up with the reading (which is pretty minimal).  Great guy with lots of funny characteristics that keep you humored. Grades hard though, and does not always clarify why you missed something on a test."
3642,175681,3.5,3.0,Just no.  And he has major attitude.
3643,175681,3.5,3.0,"Don't be fooled.  You'd think a class like this was easy (especially if you're a science person), but it's harder than it should be.  Dr. Cain tries to be animated, but the class drags on forever and he is a ridiculous grader."
3644,175681,3.5,2.0,"Pretty crazy, way too high energy, uses phrases like &quot;by hook or by crook&quot; much too often, but overall a good non-lab science for non-science majors."
3645,175681,3.5,3.0,"Woah...lotsa personality, but things are kinda crazy in class, and it's harder than it needs to be."
3646,175681,4.5,2.0,"Very personable, but sit in the front row for best results."
3647,175681,5.0,2.0,"Great guy - funny, helpful, and caring."
3648,175681,5.0,2.0,could this guy BE any cooler&#63;
3649,2225728,1.0,2.0,"Easy, but who cares? Wish I had not taken this class. Phan cared about minutiae, not even mentioning broad takeaway themes about American politics. Nor did Phan motivate students, ignite curiosity in subject matter, or prompt critical thinking, but such learning goals are difficult when a prof reads off textbook-made PowerPoints each class."
3650,2225729,4.0,5.0,"Professor Toska is very enthusiastic and knowledgable about international relations and political science. The lectures can be difficult to understand at times, but she is very accessible outside of class. The exams are what is hardest and definitely require a lot of preparation and studying. "
3651,2225729,5.0,4.0,"She's a great prof! This was my first political science course. There was one paper, and it was honestly not too bad. The reviews were what was super hard... you better know the material really well. If you try super duper hard then you would get a good grade. Office hours weren't too helpful, but she was always there if you needed her!"
3652,2225729,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Toska is one of the most intelligent professors Ive had. Her lectures are really interesting and she is always willing to help you outside class. I didnt find her grading to be overly tough (as Ive heard from others); however, the readings are advanced though so you will have to work a bit to understand them."
3653,2225729,5.0,4.0,"This professor gives incredibly interesting lectures, and is really good at moderating class discussion. Reading is fairly normal. Dr. Toska can make this class interesting to anyone, I highly recommend her to my friends."
3654,2225729,4.0,4.0,"Great class if you are looking to go into poli-sci. She's a great woman but lectures can be boring. If you don't pay attention during lecture, you're screwed. The tests are difficult but not impossible."
3655,2225729,5.0,3.0,Toska has to be one of my favorite professors at Davidson after taking her class. She's unbelievably smart but makes the material really easy to learn. Definitely put work into her class and it will reward you. She's also super helpful and available outside of class if you need it.
3656,2225729,5.0,3.0,"Incredibly knowledgeable about political Islam and not overly humble for her expertise to not manifest in the seminar. Ties in personal experiences working throughout Middle East and Africa, too, making all topics relevant to contemporary politics. Accessible and gives students ample guidance & positive feedback on independent projects."
3657,2225729,5.0,4.0,"This class was wonderful and interesting, but it also required quite a bit of work. Tests and paper were rough, but not unreasonable. Grading was very fair. Toska was always reading to answer questions by email or in office hours. Take if you like poly sci. Take if you want a bit of a challenge. Don't take if you just want to get a poly sci credit."
3658,2225729,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Toska was an amazing professor for international relations. She's been all over the world and has first-hand experience in a lot of war-torn countries. She's kind, intelligent, and hilarious. That being said, be prepared to read A LOT. Much of the reading material was dense and complicated, but her lectures were always interesting"
3659,2225729,4.0,3.0,"Worldly. Outgoing. Passionate. Funny. Dr. Toska is incredibly knowledgeable about IR and makes it relevant today. Gets to know students on personal level, engages them heavily (maybe 15 questions asked daily for participation points), and forces them to think critically/challenge their arguments. Thesis of each reading is very important for tests."
3660,304726,4.0,2.0,"She is an amazing professor. She is very knowledgeable in her field and is passionate about sharing her work. She works hard to make the class enjoyable, however, on some quizzes or tests, her questions are tricky or she does not always gauge how hard something is. In the end, I would take her again and advise you to as well."
3661,304726,5.0,4.0,"I took Latin 201 to get my language requirement done and her class was one of the hardest things I've ever done. She expects preparation and excellence so do the reading and take advantage of office hours! That being said, she is an amazing professor who genuinely cares about the wellbeing of her students. She and I are still friends!"
3662,304726,5.0,4.0,Dr. Neumann is one of my favorite teachers. Her lectures are clear and interesting. She is very realistic about her expectations and wants you to achieve.
3663,304726,5.0,4.0,"There are not enough words in the English language to describe Dr. Neumann. She's fantastic and so incredibly knowledgeable about Latin. Do your work; she'll know if you don't and call you out on it, but she does it to inspire you to do better. One of my favorite professors."
3664,304726,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Neumann intimidated me at first and for good reason: she is a smart lady with high expectations. Class attendance and participation is mandatory  if you want to pass. If you show that you're working hard, she is caring and understanding. I think I spent at least 5 hours a week in her office hours, but don't regret a second of it."
3665,304726,4.0,5.0,"Incredibly difficult. The amount of work is overwhelming and the class bounces around a lot; however, Dr. Neumann is probably one of the nicest and most caring professors I've had. Take this class if you're ready to work and do A LOT of self studying."
3666,304726,3.5,3.0,"She does not care what people think of her, and she is tough but over time, I really liked her humor. The class is fun and the material in very interesting. Reading is the homework and memorization passes test. The final paper though is very tough to do well on."
3667,304726,5.0,4.0,"I don't think you could go wrong taking one of her courses, but be prepared for it to not be your last! She's a great teacher and a great person as well. I've learned more from her than from any other professor at Davidson. Her office is way out in Preyer but she makes herself accessible. She's also a tough grader but you deserve the grade you get."
3668,304726,2.0,4.0,"I was sorely disappointed after taking the several courses I did take with her. The quantity of information thrown at you each week is overwhelming, and she expects each (undergrad) student to operate on the level of a PhD student. I learned very little from her, as any opinion that does not match hers is, in her view, incorrect."
3669,304726,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Neumann is amazing. So smart, so knowledgeable about her discipline, and very easy to talk to. I took my first class with her sophomore year and then ended up taking 4 more from her and asking her to be my adviser, because basically I want to grow up to be her. If you have interest in anything classical, definitely take her class."
3670,304726,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Neumann is a Latin genius! Very nice and very knowledgeable. Her class is extremely hard if you don't do all the reading and plenty of studying, so you have to keep up! Other than that, the class was really enjoyable, as was the professor."
3671,304726,4.5,5.0,DEMANDS excellence in your thinking. Her IQ must be @ least MLXXX- her intellect shines thru in her class. Another excellent professor @ DC. Take a class with her and your brain will really get a work out.
3672,304726,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Neumann is extremely knowledgeable about Latin.  She makes you want to learn Latin and the tests are always fair if you study and pay attention in class.  Plus she is an awesome prof who loves what she does - but does not put up with any BS, so go to class."
3673,304726,5.0,3.0,Jeanne is AWESOME!
3674,304726,5.0,4.0,"Neumann rocks. She is what makes Davidson the incredible experience that it is. Her classes are demanding, but if you dont want to learn (and learn alot), you shouldnt sign up. She is kind, passionate, and one of the smartest people I have ever met."
3675,304726,4.5,4.0,No Comments
3676,304726,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Neumann is an extremely intelligent and interesting woman. She is certainly someone to get to know at Davidson.  However, most of the time in class, it seemed like she was rambling-it was hard to know where she was going with the lecture.  She's not too tough though, if you pay attention."
3677,304726,5.0,5.0,"Neumann is my favorite professor at Davidson. She makes you work hard, but it is well worth it. She is very smart, but never talks down to you or makes you feel inferior. I would highly recommend her and would say take as many of her classes as you can. Smart, funny, and really hot, but kinda tough!"
3678,304726,5.0,4.0,"her classes are very demanding, but she is just such a cool person and professor that it's worth every bit of time you spend on work."
3679,304726,5.0,4.0,"She is passionate about teaching and very funny.  Classes are great - interesting and challenging.  However, she can be intimidating and too New York."
3680,1908318,5.0,3.0,"Love this professor, looking forward to taking her again. Definitely would recommend taking her classes."
3681,1908318,5.0,3.0,Ms Botros is an excellent teacher who really cares about her students.  She does her best to keep students interested and motivated. Her goal is for the students to learn.
3682,1908318,5.0,1.0,"Basma Botros is a really cool professor. She is unlike any teacher at Davidson. Not arrogant at all, and she teaches her classes with a light hearted attitude.   Definitely recommend her. Also, shes's pretty cute. ;)"
3683,1908318,5.0,3.0,"Had her for AT for Arabic 101. Very nice, helpful and relaxed. She's kind and approachable and has a warm smile."
3684,1908318,5.0,3.0,One of the best teachers I have had!!!
3685,2063976,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Wicker is a nice guy, and can be funny. His lectures are often scattered though, and the book isn't much help in understanding either. The best thing you can do is come with very, very specific questions to office hours. His lectures also often go over, and tests are hard and lengthy A difficult and confusing class, but also interesting. "
3686,2713194,4.0,3.0,Professor Kogel is great for learning Russian! The classroom environment is welcoming and she understands the difficulties of learning the language. She truly cares for her students and is flexible to help you get where you need to be without overwhelming you. A great choice for learning a language at Davidson. 
3687,2713194,5.0,3.0,"Professor Kogel's class progressed in a very logical and easy to follow way. The workload is very reasonable and you have plenty of opportunities to receive feedback and ask questions. Professor Kogel creates a great classroom environment where you will always feel comfortable speaking. If you want to learn Russian, she will get you there!"
3688,2713194,5.0,3.0,"Professor Kogel is extremely knowledgeable about Russian! Shes very helpful and kind and wants to make sure that you understand the material more than anything. Class was engaging despite being virtual, and she used lots of different online tools to help us learn over Zoom. I highly recommend RUS101!"
3689,1930861,3.0,5.0,"Make sure to always participate and ask questions and do not let the cold-calling seem intimidating. This was something noticeable during lecture. Otherwise, read articles and come to class prepared in order to really do well on exams. You learn a ton on how to set up experiments which is challenging yet rewarding."
3690,1930861,4.0,4.0,"Lot's of people warn about El Bejjani's cold calling, but it's not actually that bad. He lets you confer with your table and is really just looking for you to participate/be engaged. You can get the answer wrong and it won't affect your grade. He is passionate about the subject matter, but be goes kinda fast, so don't be afraid to ask questions."
3691,1930861,1.0,4.0,"The least compassionate and caring professor I have ever had. Hes rude, difficult to talk to, intimidating, and makes you feel guilty when you dont know the answers. Would never take him again. Absolutely terrible experience and I frankly think hes a terrible person."
3692,1930861,5.0,4.0,"Dr. El Bejjani has an engaging lecture style and cares a lot about student learning. Expectations can be high, but tests are fair. Definitely learned a lot not just content-wise but also improved interpretation skills."
3693,1930861,5.0,4.0,"I have met few professors at Davidson as caring and committed to student learning and development in the sciences as Dr. El Bejjani. He has high standards and often requires students to be engaged with the material outside of class, which can be uncomfortable, but it helps retention of the material. If you stay engaged, you'll learn a ton."
3694,1930861,4.0,4.0,"BIO 113 was very dependent on two things: paying attention in lecture (TAKING NOTES, being an active listener) and reading the online textbook that he provides. If you can do those consistently, you will both understand the material well and be able to participate in class. Overall, El Bejjani is a great teacher who really cares about the students."
3695,1930861,2.0,5.0,"He seemed genuinely invested in my learning. But he had unreasonably high standards, and his tests were long and frustrating."
3696,1930861,1.0,5.0,"He cold calls on everyone in the class at least once per class and it made me so anxious that i couldn't even pay attention. You don't lose points if you get the question wrong but he'll be rude and condescending to you. He's a good biologist but a terrible professor, don't take unless you really know your stuff cause you won't learn"
3697,1930861,3.0,3.0,He does A LOT of cold calling. He creates an atmosphere of fear in his class where no one wants to look up because they might get called on. I was not a fan but he did make me work hard for the exam.
3698,1930861,4.0,3.0,"Dr. El Bejjani was new to teaching intro bio this year, and it was really cool to see him put effort into adapting to a new teaching style. At times he was rushed to finish in class, but it was clear he truly cared about our understanding of material. Tests require critical thinking (not memorization) and he is always available in office hours!"
3699,1930861,4.5,3.0,"He's very helpful during office hours if you have questions -- very research based classes, and he expects you to participate. The best way to learn is by coming to class. If you're interested in biology and research, his data-based and interactive teaching methods will be up your ally. You cannot memorize and do well! "
3700,1930861,4.0,3.0,"Dr. el Bejjani is awesome! If you're remotely interested + participate, he'll have your back. In class, he rushes to finish, and because of that, he can be very confusing. He also thinks his students are very capable, and for that reason, assigns a lot of material that is extremely challenging. Use office hours, and do well in lab, and you'll be ok"
3701,1930861,2.0,4.0,Don't take unless you have to. 
3702,1810037,2.5,4.0,One of the worst professors I have had. She is so confused and unclear about everything. She is very sweet and offers to help alot but she is not helpful at all.
3703,1648257,5.0,2.0,"What an incredible professor! I started this class with no previous exposure to physics, but over the course of the semester I was able to build a real hovercraft. His approach of teaching the class his advanced language for the first couple weeks really pays off when he is able to explain the deepest secrets of the universe in 50 minute classes."
3704,1648257,5.0,4.0,I would recommend Dr. Staff just as much as I recommend consuming raw ATP.
3705,1648257,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Staff is hands down the best professor that taught at Davidson! DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT leave Davidson without taking Dr. Staff. He was able to not only teach me Spanish but also Calculus, Genetics, and Religious Studies. I am now able to teach Calculus in Spanish. The secret?? Office hours! Those multiple degrees really does come in handy."
3706,1648257,4.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. Staff. He is so nice and SO SO smart. I didn't know one person could have so many advanced degrees. Mindblowing! Provides the lecture notes online, so that's pretty cool. Ask him to have dinner at his house; he's great at literally every type of cuisine."
3707,1648257,4.5,3.0,"I had heard so much about Staff's courses in other departments that I never dreamed he'd be teaching anything in this one. He's definitely one of those professors that everyone knows and loves, whether they've had him or not. The lively discussion definitely makes up for the notable workload. Two words: office hours!"
3708,1648257,4.5,3.0,"My freshman advisor is the head of the communications department, and the first thing she said was that I couldn't graduate without taking Dr. Staff. I've never been happier with a decision. You can always find him by the fireplace in the Union, eager to chat. He's SO accessible, extremely witty, and one of the most intelligent professors I've had."
3709,1648257,5.0,4.0,"You will definitely have to work for this class, but it is SO WORTH IT. Dr. Staff is super smart and willing to help students. I wish I had taken advantage of office hours more. He really makes Contemporary Jewish Ethics fun!!1"
3710,1648257,4.5,1.0,"I definitely didn't think I was going to like this class, but Dr. Staff made a subject I would usually find boring to be pretty enlightening. Definitely all the rumors are true: He will make you WANT to work for his class!! Ask him to coffee - he's got great stories and he loves to talk. Also it doesn't hurt that he's kinda cute..."
3711,1648257,3.5,1.0,"He's a really smart guy!! Definitely knows his stuff. Also pretty versatile (I heard he teaches in multiple departments&#63;&#63;). One of the best lecturers I've had at Davidson, definitely a can't-miss professor. Also has students over to his house if you get to know him well enough! Go to his office hours, he's a great teacher and an even better person!"
3712,239260,2.0,5.0,"I thought I hated Dr. C because I was failing the class, however, even the smart kids in the class also hate him. He is difficult to approach. He wrote the textbook so he knows everything and I know nothing. He is very funny but the content is impossible, especially if you didn't take chemistry, which he fails to mention in the syllabus. "
3713,239260,3.0,5.0,"This class was so hard. There were lots of opportunities to get your grade up, but you really have to work for it. You really have to figure out what he wants in a paper and peer reviews. Don't take it if you don't want to learn about science writing. Definitely not an easy A situation."
3714,239260,5.0,4.0,Dr. Campbell is a really great professor. He teaches in a way that engages the entire class. He is definitely a cold caller so be sure you understand the readings before getting to class. I would definitely take a class with him again.
3715,239260,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this class. He wrote the textbook which rarely focused on biology and all the assignments (like taking notes on the readings and making an infographic) were irrelevant and graded incredibly harshly. The only way you can do really well is if you are able to read his mind. So, in the absence of magic wands, take another class for credit."
3716,239260,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Campbell was an excellent WRI 101 professor! While the class is difficult, it is manageable and you are able to improve steadily. The first paper you get back might be scary, but Dr. Campbell encourages progression and grades by the rubric! Great learning supplements such as movies and documentaries and does not give random assignments."
3717,239260,3.0,5.0,"A professor who clearly has a lot of passion for Biology. Is always willing to sit down and work with you. That being said, I felt like the class was an excessive amount of work and extremely difficult for its level (almost no background given for complex topics.) Tests took the entire day to complete. Questions asked in class were confusing."
3718,239260,5.0,5.0,"Really tough class, but Campbell knows how to teach and all his material. Great guy, willing to sit down with you and talk you through things, really wants to help and make sure you understand the material as much as possible. Went from getting F's on tests to A's with his help--highly recommend."
3719,239260,2.0,5.0,"Great lectures. Learned a lot. Ridiculous tests. Very hard grader. Some people get the questions he asks, but I just didn't and it killed my grade. Get ready to spend 15 hours studying for tests and 5 hours taking them. Take if you are VERY confident in your bio abilities."
3720,239260,5.0,4.0,Best professor and class I have ever had!
3721,239260,5.0,4.0,Mr. Ray of Sunshine ... Sure to brighten your day!
3722,239260,5.0,4.0,Fantastic. Best instruction I have received at Davidson.
3723,239260,4.5,4.0,This non-lab genomics course is a lot of work but well worth it. You learn a ton about cutting edge material.
3724,239260,4.0,4.0,"He was extremely supportive and helpful. He really wants everybody to do well. However, his tests were very hard, and you have to do all the reading to succeed. "
3725,239260,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Campbell is my favorite professor at Davidson. He is so passionate about not only biology, but about teaching. His tests are not easy and doing the daily reading is essential, but Dr. Campbell is always willing to go above and beyond explaining things if you ask for help."
3726,239260,4.5,3.0,Best professor at Davidson
3727,239260,4.5,3.0,"If you want to learn, take 113 and you will. If you want to memorize then forget, take Bio111. "
3728,239260,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Campbell is a legend. He sets high expectations but shows that students can achieve them through his personal stories. He's a great help because he actually makes you think. He's a genuine, intelligent, and funny professor. He's certainly my favorite professor at Davidson so far and I consider myself lucky to get to know him. Take this class!!!"
3729,239260,5.0,5.0,"Best Biology i've ever taken. He really made me love biology more than i have coming in. His expectations have led me to take more biology courses at Davidson. He really cares, and is very helpful during appointments and office hours. He is a genius, but you are never frightened by his presence. He is funny too."
3730,239260,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Campbell is one of my favorite professors I've ever had. He cares so much about biology and you can feel the enthusiasm radiating off of him during lectures. The take home tests are long and hard, and you really have to study, but he's always ready to help you. Highly recommend him!"
3731,239260,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Campbell's Bio 113 class is tough and you'll spend hours studying. His take-homes are long. You really need to put the time into this class. But Dr. Campbell is so approachable during office hours and really cares about making sure you understand the material. Highly recommend if you're interested in Biology, but you'll have to work for it."
3732,239260,4.5,4.0,n/a
3733,239260,4.0,5.0,"Campbell is one of the most understanding, helpful, and thoughtful teachers on this campus. His BIO111 class is, however, very very difficult. Do not take it if you aren't prepared to have hours of work per night. His tests are nearly impossible, but his labs are meant to help make up for the bad grades that are pretty much imminent for his tests."
3734,239260,5.0,3.0,Great!!!!
3735,239260,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Campbell is awesome!!! Although he expects a lot out of his students, he genuinely cares about biology and teaching. Very approachable, fair, and clear. If you do the reading and understand the figures, the class isn't too difficult."
3736,239260,5.0,5.0,"Great teacher. Very interested in helping students learn and willing to devote a lot of time outside class. Takehome exams are time consuming, but if you prepare, they are doable. He is very devoted to helping students learn and makes classes interesting."
3737,239260,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Campbell is clearly one of Davidson's best. He really wants every student to succeed, and he is willing to offer help outside of class. He is very generous with his time, which is impressive considering how many commitments and other projects he has in addition to teaching. He has high expectations, but they can be met with due effort."
3738,239260,4.5,4.0,The Best! So down-to-earth so understanding! put forth the effort in his class he will no doubt return it. Test fair but very difficult and time-consuming. TAKEHOME exams. Readings are a priority. Office hours really help. Lectures never boring. goes above and beyond to teach and to find new ways to increase your grade. Very interactive. LOVE HIM
3739,239260,5.0,4.0,"My favorite professor at Davidson. I LOVED the class. He does expect a lot on the tests, and the first website was frustrating, though they got much easier once you knew what you were doing. I may be in the minority that enjoyed cold calling. It really forced me to be interested and prepared. We always accomplished stuff in class."
3740,239260,4.0,2.0,Expects alot of you but it is worth it.
3741,239260,4.0,5.0,"Difficult but very good professor. Tests are difficult, must be thoroughly prepared for every class, and you'll have to learn some stuff about web pages. Overall a good class and definitely not easy. You'll learn important concepts, not memorize, and be able to think your way through lots of problems once you're done."
3742,239260,5.0,5.0,"Cold calls constantly in class, so the reading is always necessary. Tests are pretty hard as are webpages, but class is generally interesting. He typically jokes a lot and is very willing to help outside of class. Definitely not a memorization class, you must understand the material. Highly recommend."
3743,239260,5.0,4.0,"awesome professor!  if you are a biology major you should definitely get to know him, especially if you are interested in molecular stuff"
3744,239260,4.0,5.0,"As someone said below, Dr. Campbell's commitment to his job is amazing.  He spends a lot of time and effort thinking about effective teaching, and is really a great mentor-type person.  Would be great as an advisor.  The class was incredibly hard, but it's worth it to know Dr. Campbell. Just do awesome webpages and be forewarned about the tests."
3745,239260,5.0,5.0,"Hands down, best college professor ever.  This man's dedication to teaching is unparalleled."
3746,239260,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Campbell is passionate about teaching. He ensures that his students understand the material being covered rather than memorize it. As a person, he is dedicated, balanced, intelligent, and interested. His courses are challenging but he helps build the desire to learn and perform on a higher level. I strongly recommend enrolling in his courses."
3747,239260,4.5,2.0,No Comments
3748,239260,4.0,5.0,Dr. Campbell knows a lot about genomics and his text book is great.  I was in his first genomics class (2002) and got a lot out of it.  Just make sure you keep up with the work and thank your lucky stars that he'll let you take those exams untimed...
3749,239260,5.0,4.0,He is one of my favorite teachers.  I had fund learning in his class and to this day I consider myself lucky to have had him as a professor.
3750,239260,4.5,4.0,"Wonderful class. Wonderful teacher.  He explains things very well and is concerned that you understand the material.  He was always very helpful one on one and he gives really good lectures.  His grading scale is tough, but he is fair overall."
3751,239260,3.5,4.0,"Makes things harder than they need to be, nice guy one on one but doesn't seem that way in class."
3752,313016,1.0,5.0,"Most difficult class I've taken at Davidson for no reason. Daily quizzes that assignments don't prepare you for, and since we take a quiz every day, Dr. Martin does minimal teaching. And when he does teach, he speaks like he's in a room full of Stats PhDs instead of confused Econ students. Stats isn't crazy hard, but Martin made it feel that way."
3753,313016,2.0,5.0,"The professor was incredibly unclear about how he wants things done. In terms of work, one of the worst classes I've taken yet. Do not know how he determines the grades he gives. Be ready to work through your weekends on group projects only to get bad grades on them because you did not follow his instructions, but never explains anything."
3754,313016,2.0,5.0,"Very unclear professor. If you like busywork, working all weekend, and not actually learning, this is the class for you. He assigned tons of group projects that did not help me learn (a group research paper every weekend, a group poetry/rap video every weekend). He's very friendly, but also unnecessarily difficult, especially during a pandemic."
3755,313016,2.0,4.0,"He really wants you to figure things out on your own and doesn't want to straight out tell you answers. Beware: environmental studies is SO much studies- the whole class is research based- and very little environmental. By the end of the semester, I could write a research proposal, but that's all you do all semester- good if you need to learn this"
3756,313016,1.0,5.0,If you ever think of taking him for an economics class save yourself the time and your gpa.
3757,313016,3.0,2.0,"ENV 202 taught me how to do social science research, however the class was extremely repetitive. The class did not apply outside/current socio-political issues and relevant events as much as it should have in class discussion, though homework was quick and easy."
3758,313016,4.0,5.0,"Hardest Econ class I've had, but that was expected. Labs + homework points are a great way to make up for grades on tests, which are as difficult as people say. The material honestly isn't that hard, but the tests are unnecessarily difficult and time-constrained. Old-fashioned and therefore won't help you out with grade unlike most econ profs."
3759,313016,2.0,4.0,"make easy stuff sound hard and make interesting Econ dull,"
3760,313016,2.0,3.0,"There were no tests in the class, which was nice. But grading criteria was very unclear and I found his grading of papers to be unreasonable. The workload was fine, readings every night but most were rather quick. I wish I had learned more out of the class, I was expecting a lot more"
3761,313016,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I have ever taken at Davidson. Tests are impossible and filled with questions meant to trick you. He doesn't teach any of the material in class and the textbook doesn't help either. He designs his tests so you can't finish them in the 50 minutes he gives you. Median grades are always a C or below. Avoid Dr. Martin like the plague.
3762,313016,2.0,5.0,Would suggest taking it with any other professor. Lectures are not great. He expects much more than he should.
3763,313016,3.0,5.0,"Martin is great at teaching, but prides himself on his class being impossible so he enjoys when you are suffering. Avoid avoid avoid. "
3764,313016,1.0,5.0,Very removed from the class and nearly impossible grader.
3765,313016,1.5,5.0,"Dave was awful. Very unclear. Students were expected to learn from the book and ask questions in class. Horrible structure, with no real sense of organization. TESTS WERE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE! AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This is not the prof you want to have if you are going to be an Econ Major... I am sorry but this is an example of Tenure gone wrong."
3766,313016,4.0,5.0,"Econ stats is tough class at Davidson no matter who teaches it.  However, it is even tougher with Dr Martin. Tons of homework, ridiculously hard tests, and a big final project.  Comes across as self-absorbed during class, but is actually super kind and helpful.  Office hours are great.  Good guy, good teacher, but avoid this class if possible."
3767,313016,5.0,4.0,"Long HW assignments that nicely summarize important concepts so all you have to do is study your HW instead of notes when preparing for a test (though there are no tests in this class). Helpful in office hours, answers emails, is quite clear when explaining things in class."
3768,313016,1.0,5.0,"Has no interest in teaching, more interested in churning through tons of material.  Is inaccessible/unhelpful in office hours.  Granola with an complex, I agree."
3769,313016,1.0,5.0,Avoid at any cost. An example of tenure gone wrong.
3770,313016,2.5,5.0,"Presents useless stuff in class that is beyond what will be tested.  The tests and assignments are impossible to complete, because they are incredibly long and numerous.  He is an earthy weirdo w/ a chip on his shoulder for anyone cooler than him."
3771,313016,5.0,5.0,Spent more time on his one class than my other three combined but it was worth it.  Dr. Martin is great and could be the best teacher I've ever had but he's tough.
3772,313016,5.0,5.0,Dr. Martin is an outstanding teacher and a wonderful guy - just be willing to work harder than you've ever worked before. You'll spend more time in his class than your other 3 combined - so expect your GPA and your social life to suffer while in his class
3773,2787001,3.0,3.0,"Nice guy, but just not the best at teaching the information. Acts as if we'd understand a lot more in an into course, but then his grading is very understanding. I put a lot of effort into this class and felt like I did not learn anything by the end of it."
3774,2574012,5.0,5.0,"SO MUCH MATERIAL! Get ready to work because this course covers a LOT! However, I would definitely take Dr. G-B for another course since she gives really helpful video lectures. She is a fair grader and has been one of my most understanding professors regarding the challenges presented by the pandemic. Her office hours are really helpful!"
3775,2574012,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Her class is not easy, but Dr. G-B is a fair grader and does give credit for participation. It's obvious that Dr. G-B cares about her students, and has been one of my most understanding professors during a global pandemic. She is super helpful in office hours if you are confused."
3776,2574012,1.0,4.0,"SO MUCH POINTLESS WORK. So many things to fill out, turn in, and complete that I can't even remember the subject of the damn class. The busy work is endless. Needless to say, her explanations are giant, endless circles - just like the class work: pointless. If you're taking this class for a credit, head on over to the bio department."
3777,2574012,1.0,4.0,"Absolutely don't take her. She's unhelpful, unproductive and rude. When her terrible labs don't work, she's snarky with students. She's unwilling to change terrible habits (like her marriage to the worst program ever, gradescope). Homeworks are really difficult because she is truly a nightmare and can't explain anything tot save her life. 0/10"
3778,2471614,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Henderson cares a lot about theatre and about her students. Classes are interesting and group presentations can be very funny. While there is a fair amount of homework, it is not hard to get an A if you do as you are told. I enjoyed this course and learned a lot about theatre."
3779,2096831,5.0,4.0,Dr. Stroup is a great professor and I really enjoyed the class! The class is mostly self driven with Dr. Stroup using the class to answer any questions students had about the readings and assignments. Dr. Stroup stayed late just to meet with me once for office hours. If you do the work outside of class you'll do well.
3780,2096831,4.0,5.0,"Prof. Stroup is enthusiastic and intends well, but the workload is too high. The course prioritizes theoretical math over practical application. Stay on top of assigned practice problems and you'll be fine."
3781,2096831,2.0,4.0,"I think all high school AP economics teachers teach better than him. This is a self-study course at all. The logic of his lecture is very confusing. I don't know how the 4.3 score on this site came from. The score for him should be 3 or even lower. 105 is not a difficult course, but if the professor is bad at teaching, the course becomes difficult."
3782,2096831,2.0,2.0,Dr. Stroup is just a bad lecturer and teacher. They spend class going on tangents and confusing us. I would not recommend taking their class
3783,2096831,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Stroup for ECO 105 was an amazing professor. You will certainly need to focus in class during lectures to do well on the reviews and exams which are challenging. Luckily, the group project does let you apply your knowledge and solidify your learning. Pay close attention to what he says, it's easy to get lost sometimes in the jargon."
3784,2096831,1.0,4.0,"This guy makes you wait in the zoom lobby just so he can prepare for class. He's egocentric like no one else and definitely astroturfed this page. Last year, he released the final on the fifth day of finals, after he stopped teaching econometrics for an entire month. Don't take his class..."
3785,2096831,5.0,5.0,Stroup is a great lecturer and knows his stuff. The class is a good balance between learning the basics and thinking about the bigger picture. Statistics material felt dry at times but the project pulls everything together in the end. Tough going but great course overall.
3786,2096831,5.0,4.0,"Passionate, caring, kind. Stroup makes you work for it, but structures the class so you can understand everything. He is super approachable and will go out of his way to help if you put in the work."
3787,2096831,5.0,4.0,It's so obvious he loves teaching. Lectures are clear and he makes macroeconomic modelling fun. I always look forward to class and enjoy his refreshing teaching style.
3788,2096831,5.0,4.0,"He's very engaging, interesting, etc. and extremely available outside of class. Be warned that he does speak quickly when lecturing, but will always stop and chat about your questions. One of the most engaging professors at Davidson!!"
3789,2096831,5.0,4.0,"So hard, so worth it. Learned so much about economic modelling from this class. Passionate professor, organized and helpful. Expects you to work hard and struggle with difficult concepts. Be prepared to work!"
3790,2096831,3.0,4.0,"I think Dr. Stroup is smart but long-winded and often gets sidetracked from the main point, which confuses students even more. He's accessible for office hours, but the course is so hard that you basically are forced to take him up as an outside resource. I don't think he designed his course in a way that makes it approachable for students."
3791,2096831,5.0,4.0,Dr. Stroup's courses were the highlight of my Davidson experience! He'll teach you how to use economic tools and then show you how to question and modify the assumptions the theories are based on.
3792,2096831,5.0,4.0,"Energetic all hours of the day but not too much that he's unapproachable. Stats is his expertise, and you can tell he has ample experience teaching it. Emphasizes heuristic learning. Provides ample extra credit, feedback, office hours, and informational emails for students to succeed if they demonstrate the motivation and time commitment."
3793,2096831,5.0,4.0,"Absolutely amazing professor. Stroup is energetic, organized, and clear. 8:30am Stats was one of the hardest courses I've taken, but he sets you up for success if you work hard. Easily one of the most caring, understanding, and approachable professors at Davidson."
3794,2096831,4.0,4.0,"A real character who's slightly eccentric but endearing. Dr. Stroup's knowledge seems unparalleled and passion unmatched. Will go out of way to help students, even meeting them at late hours in library. Attentive to email. Speaks quickly and can be intimidating with how much he knows, but demonstrate curiosity, and you'll know how to succeed."
3795,2096831,5.0,4.0,"Like many Davidson professors, Dr. Stroup is very caring and passionate. However, what puts Dr. Stroup above and beyond is the fact that he demands evidence based, rationale thinking in his classroom. Forcing students to think in this way will change the way they evaluate arguments in their everyday lives."
3796,2096831,5.0,4.0,Dr. Stroup really loves economics! He has a contagious belief in the power of evidence+reasons over moralistic narratives.  Somewhat of a tough grader but gives lots of practice problems
3797,2096831,5.0,4.0,"Stroup is  great! Passionate and engaging lecturer, though his tests are tough (analysis and application, not regurgitation) but fair, and without any real surprises. He is extremely knowledgeable, has a contagious love of economics, and is available outside of class. Very approachable and obviously cares about student learning."
3798,2059970,5.0,4.0,I love Alice Weimer. I had her my freshman year for HIS 167 and she was a superb teacher. She is totally understanding and gives great feedback. You do have a lot of readings but its totally manageable. Essay workload isn't that bad either.
3799,2059970,5.0,4.0,"I definitely struggled in her course at first, since it requires a lot of reading and analysis. But she's so welling to help and such a great person, she made me try harder to do the best I could. Truly, a lovely person and I really improved, though classes were long. Honestly Dr. Wiemers helped me survive college."
3800,2059970,4.0,4.0,I loved taking her class. She's so passionate and knowledgable about Africa. She's also just a great person to talk to out of class whenever you're struggling.
3801,2059970,2.0,4.0,Doesn't make grade expectations clear. There is a lot of reading for the class of which isn't always addressed thoroughly in class. Rushed through some lectures.
3802,2059970,5.0,3.0,"History methods courses can be infamously boring, but Wiemers does a great job to keep the class interesting. She has tons of energy and knows SO much about Africa. The class itself is  discussion-based and reading heavy.  Her papers are clearly assigned and graded. Would definitely recommend this class."
3803,2059970,4.0,3.0,Professor Wiemers is kind and helpful. Her class involved a combination of group work and lecture. Her feedback on papers was specific and detailed. She is an average grader. Going to her office hours was useful. I found her lectures interesting and they were not too long. I definitely recommend taking a class taught by her.
3804,2531019,5.0,2.0,"A literal God. She is very chill and easy-going, but also knows so much about the topic. A lot of readings, but you have a whole week to do them. Weekly discussion boards but they're simple and you do them in groups. Final paper is pretty easy too as she gives ton of feedback and is so kind and understanding"
3805,2531019,5.0,2.0,"Really enjoyed this class! Class is mainly based on lecture, discussion, and readings since it's a seminar. Readings were the appropriate amount since we had a week to complete it. I liked the structure of having a moodle post once a week and it was relevant to the readings. Super relevant and interesting topics taught!"
3806,2531019,4.0,2.0,"I think she was a great professor and I highly recommend this course. However, she assigned a lot of readings, but most you could skip. Participation is the key! Also, she is heavily focused on group projects, which are usually easy, but are a headache since she regularly changes the groups. Overall, I'd say if you put effort in, you'll be fine."
3807,2531019,5.0,2.0,"She is one of the best profs you will ever have at Davidson! If you need to fill your visual art cred, take her class. She really cares about you and understands if you're going through a hard time. Communication is key! Not sure about the grade yet but if you try in her class it should be easy to get a good grade"
3808,2113231,1.0,5.0,Very disappointed with the Davidson College psychology department. Dr. Robinson was not properly trained and only a research assistant who had no business teaching classes. Very unqualified. By far my least favorite class at Davidson and steered me away from being a psychology major. Wish I could have a redo bc I heard Dr. Smith's class was great.
3809,2113231,2.5,5.0,"While Dr. Robinson is very nice and approachable, I would steer very far away from her class. She is stubborn with giving back points where they are deserved and does not give tests that fairly detail the material. Get ready to guess on all the tests. She is much better suited for the research department since that is the only thing she grasps."
3810,2113231,1.5,5.0,"Dr. Robinson is very nice and approachable but she is not confident or knowledgeable enough to teach the material effectively. However, she is very good at explaining new research in her field clearly and enthusiastically. I believe she is best suited for full time research instead of teaching. She deserves more guidance from the dept when teaching"
3811,2113231,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Robinson is very friendly. But she does not offer much help outside of class. She seems very scattered and nervous every class--especially when asked questions during lecture. She frequently answers student questions with: ""I'm not sure."" Her lectures consist of her reading PowerPoints word-for-word with little input. Not the best professor."
3812,2113231,1.0,4.0,Honestly had to start a rate my professor page since I had so many thoughts on her. She doesn't know anything. Reads exactly what the powerpoint says twice and freaks out when anyone asks a question. Should stay in the research department since she clearly doesn't know how to teach. Would get more out of the class if I just read the textbook.
3813,1674960,4.0,2.0,"Very helpful, super nice.  Even though Latin is pretty tough, she does what she can to protect her students' GPAs and you still learn a lot.  I would definitely recommend her class, as well as the Classics department as a whole."
3814,2176726,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Kuchera is caring, so it is easy to ask him questions in and out of class. His lectures were also very clear so it was easy to follow through. Definitely recommend his class."
3815,2176726,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Kuchera is dedicated to each student's individual success, is very organized, and doesn't make you feel dumb (in a physics class, which is so important)! Class is hard but just go for extra help and put in the effort and you'll be fine"
3816,2176726,5.0,3.0,Dr. Kuchera is interesting in class and helpful outside of it. Would take another class of his.
3817,2176726,3.0,3.0,"Pretty young guy who seems very intelligent but leads monotonous lectures that sound and feel the same every single day of class. He is usually available for office hours but doesn't always give the best feedback. He is reasonably clear in class but often a bit dry. The homework problems were challenging, but not too many of them and graded fairly."
3818,1947350,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors at Davidson! Grades based on competition of assignments up to standard, so as long as you do all of the assignments and revise based on his feedback, you will do well. I learned a lot in this class and thoroughly enjoyed it. Dr. Smith is very kind, accessible, and wants to see students succeed. "
3819,1947350,5.0,2.0,Grades via completion (has a clear grading criteria) and allows for revisions. Can still get an A if you miss 1-2 mini assignments check syllabus. Had him during Zoom and missed a lot of my 8:15AM class but still got an A and was warmly received in office hours. Committed to inclusion as well so great professor for students of color!
3820,1947350,5.0,3.0,"This is was one of my best classes. Dr. Smith is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He really cares about teaching and about the well-being of his students. He is also a very flexible teacher and will change his schedule if students are having a touch time understanding the content. A couple reviews, readings, lab work, and a course final."
3821,1947350,5.0,4.0,"He is a true gem. I really gelled with his testing style and class style. Classes were a good mix of lecture and discussion. I learned a lot about biodiversity and conservation themselves, but also multiple different perspectives on the implications of the topics. Tests were challenging but not unreasonable."
3822,1947350,5.0,3.0,"Kevin (Dr. Smith) was a wonderful professor. Fun, charismatic, engaging, open to questions, and down to earth, he is a joy to have in class and I look forward to hopefully having him in the future."
3823,1947350,5.0,3.0,"Reading is required, Dr. Smith will cold-call in class, but the class is super interesting. Fair grader and very helpful."
3824,1947350,5.0,3.0,"Kevin does a great job of making conservation biology a class truly worth your time. The class is taught entirely from primary literature, which is discussed and analyzed at great depths in class to ensure students are capable of extracting the main ideas from dense scientific papers. Extremely rewarding if you keep up with reading/participate!"
3825,1947350,5.0,3.0,"Kevin is a great guy and fortunately, a great professor. His classes are very discussion-based, and he will call on random people to help answer questions (so do the readings...) But, he goes through the material at a slow pace, making sure everybody understands the concepts. His tests are what you would expect, and you'll miss him next semester."
3826,1947350,5.0,2.0,"Kevin Smith is a friendly, down-to-earth guy who does an excellent job in making somewhat challenging material accessible and easy to understand. He's flexible with material and really focuses on getting a deep understanding of each reading. Tests aren't overtly difficult so long as you are actively participating and pay attention in class."
3827,1947350,4.5,2.0,Kevin is awesome! He's helpful and great at clarifying concepts. The class is discussion based with some lecture and he does a great job facilitating conversation so you can construct your own knowledge. The class greatly depends on input from the students though so make sure to come prepared and ready to contribute. He does a lot of cold calling. 
3828,1947350,4.5,3.0,"Kevin was a great professor. For a bio class, it was very discussion based, and very conceptual (less rote memorization). Kevin is funny, clear, and very available. Class was very manageable. I would definitely take a class with him again!"
3829,1777387,4.0,2.0,"She is really fun and engaging and generally a good person. However, this class had a lot of reading in it. It would take me at least six hours per week just reading her material. She grades on participation, so make sure you show up and know the readings. Her exams are pretty chill too; as long as you show up to lecture they're a breeze."
3830,1777387,4.0,4.0,"Make no mistake, she's not an easy professor. She assigns a lot of reading (over a hundred lines a night at peak) but if you read in English and are good at sight translation (I recommend skimming the reading for vocabulary before class) you can get around it. Play into her desire to have a literature class, not a translation class."
3831,1777387,4.0,4.0,Totten gives a decent amount of homework but is awesome in office hours. She has latin reading group twice a week and is super super helpful. If you go to office hours and reading group regularly the tests are very manageable.
3832,1777387,4.0,4.0,"She's a tough one but she knows her stuff. I took Latin to knock out my language requirement. I've never been very good at latin, but I worked my butt off and ended up with a A-. "
3833,1777387,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Totten is incredibly intelligent and holds you to a very high standard. She is also hilarious and ridiculously endearing. One of the best professors at Davidson, but not for the faint of heart."
3834,1777387,4.5,2.0,Great and clear teacher. Is pretty easy in 101. She's also hilarious. Also perfect and I'm in love with her.
3835,1777387,3.5,4.0,"I loved Dr. Totten. There is a heavy focus on translating in the class, but she keeps the class very open. It was a small class, so it was easy to feel comfortable and discuss what problems you were having. She is genuine when it comes to her students and really wants to help them and get to know them. It was a hard class, but I have no regrets."
3836,1777387,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Totten was entertaining and occasionally hilarious. I learned a lot from the class, and though there were lots of lines to read, it was manageable. I definitely recommend a class with her."
3837,1238800,2.0,3.0,"The course material was good, but never liked his teaching style or felt totally comfortable in his class."
3838,1238800,3.0,4.0,"He seems caring and nice at first, but during the semester my class had multiple incidents with him being rude. He tries to give his students bad grades in order to ensure that not all of them are successful even though you may be deserving of an A. He will improve your writing, but is not as great of a person as he comes off as."
3839,1238800,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hillard is a very genuine and caring person. He cares about his students and their success. The material he covers in his Pandemics and the Public Mind class is fascinating. If you do the work and are a part of the discussions in class, you shouldn't have trouble in the course. He sets draft deadlines to get feedback, and it really helps."
3840,1238800,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, cares about his students. Lots of readings and class discussions can be a little slow sometimes, but he will work with you to make you proud of your essay."
3841,1238800,5.0,3.0,"Might be my favorite professor I've had at Davidson so far. Lots of papers, but that's to be expected in any WRI101 class. Only class I've had where I've actually been excited for class discussions. My writing abilities improved drastically throughout the semester, and paper topics were very interesting and made for great discussion. Take his class"
3842,1238800,5.0,2.0,"Honestly such a great guy in general. Cares so much about the draft processes, so he cancels class and allows for draft conferences. He is also so understanding and will find time to meet with you as much as you want to satisfy your learning experience."
3843,1238800,5.0,3.0,Really enjoyed his class. A bit boring at times but he is really nice and gives good feedback and cares a lot about his students. He is very fair with grading and often meets with students to give feedback before a paper is due which boosts your grade.
3844,1238800,5.0,2.0,"Really enjoyed humanities with Dr. Hillard. Discussions are more of him telling you what he thinks about the reading material, but that's not a bad thing. Easily accessible for help and he fairly grades papers. Would recommend."
3845,1238800,3.0,3.0,"Very sweet person and gives good writing feedback, but can be long-winded. Lectures weren't particularly interesting on a regular basis, but occasionally he brought in a new perspective or changed the syllabus based on what the students were interested in, and I really loved that."
3846,1238800,3.0,4.0,Writing about words and images is a very interesting class. Discussions weren't on topic and in depth as I would like but nevertheless intriguing. When it came to papers he gives you lots of feedback before final paper is due but when you get them back there is a lack of comments or reasoning to the grade which I thought was interesting/frustrating
3847,1238800,2.0,4.0,Difficult teacher to please. He teaches a very interesting writing course on Words and Images. I thought discussions about the readings went great but when it came down to writing papers I got zero feedback or explanations for the low marks. I felt that my writing skills did not improve over the course. Course was also unorganized and off task.
3848,1238800,4.5,2.0,"Hillard was generally very good. Carefully navigated controversial and complicated themes, gave good feedback for papers and projects, listened to students and complied with what they needed. Class was interesting and enjoyable. Hillard demands a lot of the students but is always willing to help."
3849,1238800,5.0,1.0,Prof Hillard is great! He really listens to student feedback and treats you as a peer. His grading is extremely fair and you are given a great deal of feedback before handing in graded work. I definitely recommend a class with Hillard.
3850,1238800,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Hillard was an amazing professor. For every project (essay assignment), he provided handouts with clear bullet points and pointers of what he looks for. There were 2-3 revisions for each project, a mix of peer-reviews and him commenting on your work. For the morning class, he even provided a basket of granola bars for us everyday. Loved him!"
3851,1238800,4.5,2.0,"One of the best professors at Davidson! Truly glad I had his class. He knows the material, can talk about racism, rhetoric, writing, etc. all day. He is very enthusiastic about the material as well. Talks alot during class, but always says powerful stuff. Great teacher and class! He definitely will make you a better writer as well."
3852,1238800,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Hillard is a great person. Class was American Racism and was very interesting. Much lively class discussion, and he tries to let everyone speak. Very fair grader: we went through several drafts before each final. Would also listen to class if we wanted to extend deadline. Simply enough, this teacher is one of the nicest at Davidson."
3853,1238800,4.5,4.0,"Hillard is an amazing professor. He truly cares about your growth as a writer and carefully edits your drafts, while also proposing great questions for you to think about. Will always give you help if you need it. Class discussion contributes a lot to the class. Four papers throughout the semester and a manageable amount of reading."
3854,1238800,5.0,4.0,"Hillard is a great professor that really cares about your progress as a writer. His comments on papers are  really helpful, and don't be afraid to stop by his office hours if you need to."
3855,1238800,4.5,4.0,"I took his writing class about American Racisms, and it is the most interesting class I've ever had. Also, he taught us how to write more clearly, and helped us a lot with analyzing texts. Papers aren't necessarily easy since the material is intense, but pay attention to class discussions and you'll be fine. I would recommend this class to anyone"
3856,1238800,3.5,3.0,"Hillard is extremely condescending and it is pointless to attend his classes.You can do well as long as you write exactly what HE wants you to, but you'll have to deal with him being very, very pretentious."
3857,1238800,4.5,2.0,"Hillard was a great teacher, he is extremely helpful and don't be afraid to ask for an extension. In his W course your paper is revised 3 times before you turn it in (except the last one) so there is plenty of time to get a decent grade. Also what he expects is outlined in the syllabus. Our class loved him, he was open-minded and easy going."
3858,1238800,3.5,3.0,Dr. Hillard's lectures were not very interesting at all. You simply must read the books and write the essays. Only four essays (which includes the final essay paper) over the semester is extremely manageable.
3859,153375,5.0,3.0,"Professor Cheshire is a true delight. He cares a lot about his students and his subject matter. He takes a very holistic view to teaching Latin, so the class structure wasn't what I was used to. I really enjoyed his class."
3860,153375,4.0,3.0,Very enthusiastic
3861,153375,4.0,5.0,"I really struggled in his class (because hey Latin is hard), but Dr. Cheshire was supportive throughout the semester. He was always eager to meet outside of class for help. The material was tough, but he was a great teacher and his teaching style (felt more like a discussion than a lecture) was refreshing."
3862,153375,5.0,4.0,Keyne is by far the most outstanding professor I have ever met. He truly creates an atmosphere that fosters growth in academia. Without this professor my first semesters at Davidson college would have been quite a bit bleaker.
3863,153375,4.5,2.0,"I took Cheshire for both Latin 101 and 102. His teaching style is a little unorthodox (you don't take notes), but overall he was a super helpful teacher. He definitely likes those who ask questions and come to office hours so if you show him that you are working hard your grade will be fine. Overall great class and not too difficult. "
3864,153375,4.5,4.0,"I absolutely loved this class and Dr. Cheshire. Our discussions were fascinating and he was so unbelievably knowledgeable about all the material. I always felt that the class period was too short! His teaching showed that he is very passionate about his subject, in the best of ways. He was also extremely helpful when we were writing our papers."
3865,153375,4.5,2.0,"very helpful, pretty hard"
3866,153375,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Cheshire is awesome.  Great teacher, super interesting, always helpful."
3867,153375,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Cheshire is, simply put, the man. If at all possible, take a class with him. He loves the subject matter and knows his stuff. He cares about his students and is always available outside class. He is a fair grader and has a great sense of humor."
3868,153375,4.0,3.0,"Great professor--so enthusiastic, and clearly in love with his subject. Grading policy was fair, but make sure you do your reading! Overall, just a wonderful guy and a pleasure to be in class with, and learn from. Highly recommended."
3869,153375,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful professor: Funny and interested in the material and students, very engaging."
3870,153375,5.0,4.0,"I can't say enough about Prof. Cheshire.  He's always willing to meet with you, and he's gifted at making confusing things become clear.  He's incredibly knowledgeable, and it's hard to not enjoy his class."
3871,153375,4.5,3.0,"Great!  Sometimes unclear, but way too cool."
3872,153375,5.0,4.0,"Yet another reason to be a classics major at Davidson. Dont believe me&#63; Average the scores of Cheshire, Neumann, and Toumazou. Word."
3873,153375,5.0,2.0,He knows his****
3874,153375,4.0,4.0,Dr. Cheshire rocks very hard
3875,153375,5.0,4.0,He is by far my favorite professor at Davidson. His energy and passion for Classics is unmatched. He always around for questions or just to chat. Definitely take a class with him!
3876,153375,5.0,4.0,"keyne cheshire is the coolest teacher i have ever met. he gets so excited, and makes lectures entertaining every time. if you like reading, take this class!"
3877,153375,4.0,2.0,No Comments
3878,153375,4.0,3.0,"Gotta give him some credit, he made Latin somewhat interesting.  Very passionate.  I do a great impression of him."
3879,153375,4.0,4.0,No Comments
3880,153375,4.0,3.0,No Comments
3881,511779,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Gay is my favorite professor at Davidson. Its really telling of a professors quality when you learn a lot but the class is fairly easy! He genuinely cares about his students. Yes he is liberal, but so is every professor at Davidson. Ive taken several classes of his and have loved them all! Class discussions are always interesting and fun!"
3882,511779,3.0,2.0,"By far my chillest class this semester. A good class to fulfill the history requirement while also learning some pretty interesting stuff. Minimal work and low stress, solid fourth class."
3883,511779,4.0,3.0,"Important to be active in discussion-he cares about participation. If you do not participate, there will be more pop quizzes. Interesting things! Sometimes he goes off on tangents but important to understand the crux of the matter. This class has taught me ideas and concepts I use a lot!"
3884,511779,3.5,3.0,Work throughout the semester but a really interesting class. Dr. Gay is really caring and easy to do well in.
3885,511779,4.5,3.0,"As a freshman, Rick Gay was a great professor! He is a tough grader when it comes to grammatical errors. The class discussions were always interesting and entertaining. I would definitely take this class again!!!"
3886,511779,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Gay is incredible. He goes off on tangents often, but personally I always find them interesting. If you participate, you'll do well. Overall, a very interesting class with a great and fairly easy professor."
3887,511779,1.5,4.0,"The class description should read ""do as I say, not as I do"". It's ironic because the class is on education, yet taught by one of the worst professors I've had.   Expect lots of trivial vocab memorization.   Everything is in the text book. I don't think he contributed a single original idea."
3888,511779,3.0,3.0," Dr. Gay is such a nice man! He is so helpful and willing to meet outside of class, even for lunch. He does go off on tangents, but besides that he is very organized about the materialreadings and schedules for class. When he is getting political, he gives a warning and he does discuss the other side's point of view, which I appreciate. He's great"
3889,511779,3.5,2.0,"Really nice guy. Goes on tangents sometimes but mostly relevant. Genuinely interested in subject matter and tries to vary up class material (youtobe videos, reading plays, moodle blog)"
3890,511779,3.5,3.0,"Really genuine guy who enjoys teaching, I have him for both hums and education and I think he's great. He does go on tangents sometimes but they are usually pretty relevant."
3891,511779,3.5,2.0,"I almost dropped EDU121 after reading the comments on here, but I actually really liked the class. It was interesting and there's a good balance between lectures and discussions. Tests are take-home, open book essay questions and aren't that hard. I was happily surprised with Dr. Gay and I'd definitely recommend this class."
3892,511779,5.0,4.0,Hard but fair. Interesting and fun. The best professor I've ever had!
3893,511779,1.0,5.0,"If you get Rick Gay in Hums, drop, immediately. HE is literally the WORST professor I have ever had. He has no clue how to teach, cannot lead discussion, and goes off on tangents: but not fun tangents. Utterly pointless and stupid tangents. He is no help with papers and definitely has favorites. The Education department must be suffering b/c of him"
3894,511779,1.0,5.0,Absolutely worst. Can't keep political views out of his class. Keep your views to yourself or you will pay. Test are insanely hard. Essays with only one right answer. Awful.
3895,511779,1.0,3.0,Probably the most frustrating techer/professor I have ever had. Everything was straight out of the textbook in class. Extremely boring. His exams were impossible and his comments on papers were useless and trivial. Its like he was searching for places to take off points. Avoid him at all costs
3896,511779,2.5,2.0,"Dr. Gay is an interesting character--super nice and genuinely well-intentioned, but just not a great professor.  Sometimes class was interesting, and I felt like I learned something about education, but it could have been a lot better.  His tests are pretty useless; they're about 80% IDs, and half the IDs are terms we shouldn't need to know."
3897,511779,1.0,3.0,He is NOT qualified to teach this course.  NOT AT ALL.
3898,511779,2.0,5.0,By far my worst grade at Davidson
3899,511779,3.0,4.0,"good material, but awful teacher.  Can't lecture and format of the class is the same every day.  Can be longest hour and 15 of the wk.  And ironically, this education prof does not know how to make out a test.  Tests are ridiculously hard, no matter how much you study, because he test trivial info"
3900,511779,5.0,5.0,this may be my worst grade at davidson! but it's a fascinating class.. just put in the hours.
3901,511779,4.0,2.0,"Lectures were very discussion based, so nice. But largely just him. He's best when lots of students interacting as well. Office hours are helpful but not incredibly great. Nice as a person. Very chummy guy. Cool to get to know. Way into English lit., especially Renaissance stuff."
3902,2508585,2.0,4.0,very confusing professor. would not recommend.
3903,2508585,5.0,2.0,"I love Dr. Mundy! He's a very funny and understanding professor and definitely knows his knowledge on games. Sometimes his lectures were a bit dry and long, but he's accessible during office hours to help you out. Homework is light relevant reading and learning how to build a game. Later half of the sem, you work in a team to build your game"
3904,2508585,1.0,3.0,"Hands down the worst professor at Davidson or anywhere else. Terrible to interact with, and very unclear."
3905,2508585,5.0,2.0,This class was really really cool. This has been the first class I've had at Davidson where I knew what to do to get a good grade but I wasn't stressed over any of it so I was able to enjoy the course material for what it was. Mundy is one of those geniuses in his field so definitely take advantage of his time as a professor here!
3906,2508585,5.0,2.0,"Owen is my favorite professor at davidson. He is hilarious and makes teaching in the Digital Studies realm fun and enjoyable. Some days were very heavy reading, but as long as you're showing participation thats all that matters."
3907,2182974,5.0,3.0,Had very little exposure to the subject matter before enrolling in the course. Dr. Waheed always made transnational connections which made the content much more engaging and rewarding.
3908,2182974,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Waheed altered the trajectory of my undergraduate experience. Her commitment to South Asian history is inspiring, but above all it is her genuine care for her students which sets her apart. Her lectures, in Bollywood and the Indian imagination, are some of the best I've received during my time at Davidson. The college is lucky to have her."
3909,2182974,3.0,4.0,"Great class material. Thoughtful reading selections. Makes you work for the grade. Class lacked organization at times. Often changed the syllabus, taking out readings or adding new ones at the last minute. This was fine for a seminar; the grades were just participation and one paper, but I would avoid taking her lower level classes that have exams."
3910,2182974,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Waheed is very intelligent and knowledgeable, however classes would always be heavily centered around class discussions even in a writing class. Definitely come to class prepared to talk about previous assignments. She is also super available outside of class and willing to help."
3911,2182974,5.0,3.0,"Though her lectures can be a bit monotonous at times, Professor Waheed has truly mastered the study of South Asian history and her lectures do a good job of explaining the course material in a way that is easy to understand. Definitely go talk to Professor Waheed during her office hours or after class. Shes a great professor &amp; wants you to do well"
3912,2182974,5.0,3.0,Dr. Waheed is an absolutely brilliant one-of-a-kind professor and the main reason I finally learned to reap the fruits from intellectual risks over playing it safe. She's been monumental in getting me to think more critically and thoughtfully as a person through her lectures and very helpful in office hours. A refreshing truly original professor!
3913,2182974,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Waheed was the professor that inspired me to major in history rather than polisci. You definitely have to put in WORK to succeed in the class, but it was really rewarding because of the class discussions and everything that I learned. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! Not only will it make the course clearer, but Dr. Waheed is so brilliant and helpful."
3914,2182974,5.0,4.0,"Dr Waheed is a wonderful professor who truly cares about her field and this is clear through her lectures and willingness to speak with students outside of class and after the course ends. her expectations were high and I felt this environment provided space for great learning. B/c of her class, I decided to be a history major."
3915,2182974,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Waheed was not very organized and did not follow her syllabus at all. There were many nights where emails were sent the night before class telling the class the assignment. Grades were not given back in a timely manner at all, often one to two months after the assignment was handed back. Readings were heavy and may not be discussed in class."
3916,2182974,2.0,4.0,"This class was incredibly frustrating because Dr. Waheed's expectations from students were unclear. She frequently made changes to the syllabus at the last minute. I didn't find her lectures helpful, and half of the class was spent in a question-and-answer format of discussion that never really got off the ground. Grades were nearly always late."
3917,2182974,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Waheed seemed nice at first, but lectures quickly became very dry. We had a lot of reading each night (usually around 3 articles), and frequently we didn't even discuss all of them. She also relied on the students to run class, even if we didn't understand the readings. Basically, we would go over some brief history, then have a discussion."
3918,83781,4.5,5.0,Wonderful
3919,83781,2.5,3.0,"Disagree about attendance, as I missed &gt;50% of his classes and did ok. Essays are easy but tests are designed to trick you and often do so. Boring in class, which generally early in the morning. Doesn't cover much in class. Nicest human being I've ever met, wish everyone was like him in that regard."
3920,83781,4.0,4.0,Not sure why he's called Easy Ed.  Best answer multiple choice tests were deceptively difficult.  I didn't like the lectures either.  They were boring and often pointless.
3921,83781,4.5,2.0,deceptively easy-going
3922,83781,4.5,2.0,"easy class. if you show up for class and read the chapters, you can study for 2 hours and make As on the tests. very small work load. dont blow it off though. if you dont show up for class, you'll fail."
3923,83781,3.0,2.0,"Yes he's nice, yes he's not too hard, but he is also old. He will forget the order of lecture and go off with his old-guy stories. Very little time is actually spent covering material, and then he lets you out of class early. Waste of time. Also, he does this annoying thing where he puts an apostrophes at the end of -ing words ex. &quot;Test doin's&quot;"
3924,83781,1.0,4.0,"unclear tests, totally unhelpful in office hours, couldn't have cared less about our class"
3925,83781,4.5,1.0,"We used to call him &quot;Easy Ed&quot;...the class really isn't hard at all if you pay attention in class and do the assigned reading.  The workload is completely manageable, but lecture isn't all that interesting.  He is the nicest professor I've ever m"
3926,83781,4.0,2.0,"His tests are pretty tricky (low 70s is usually the average), but he helps you out in other areas to bring up your grade.  He cares a lot about his students, always wishing us &quot;warm wishes&quot;.  He is a very good man."
3927,83781,5.0,4.0,"any test you take for him, you will NOT have studied enough for it... but, he's a really nice guy and his class is very interesting, even at 8:30 AM."
3928,237386,3.0,3.0,"She's really really nice and helpful. She really knows her stuff. She is very accessible outside of class. She is very understanding. Awesome person to talk to in office hours and so willing to help. That being said, the class sucked. Her grading scheme is confusing, at best. Lectures drone on. Her feedback isn't clear and you don't have to attend."
3929,237386,4.0,3.0,Dr. Dietz is one of the best professors I have ever taken. She is extremely caring and helpful. I would recommend tanking any of her courses. Her workload is not too demanding and she is a fair grader. Great professor!
3930,237386,5.0,4.0,"Do the reading and participate in class to really take advantage of your time with Dr. Dietz. She is a fantastic professor, and you will learn lots if you put in the work. She grades fairly and clearly, and makes herself available to you for help. She also cares about each of her students well being."
3931,237386,4.5,3.0,"If you pay attention & take notes, you should be fine. Always available to help students. Lectures can get long, but she makes an effort to throw in some humor and modern day connections - plus she brings candy to class sometimes."
3932,237386,5.0,5.0,"Professor Dietz is by far one of my favorite professors at Davidson. Although she's a tough grader, especially on papers, our in-class discussions are amazing and she knows what she's talking about. Also, if you ever need help on assignments or papers, she's more than willing to help. Love, love, love this teacher and I always look forward to class"
3933,237386,5.0,4.0,"One of Davidson History Department's greats. She's a superb lecturer and keeps class interesting. She's good with allowing students to pop into the conversation. You'll really have to work to get a good grade as she's a tough grader, but she's not impossible by any means. If you want a great class experience, take her. Brit hist mostly. Foxy, too."
3934,237386,5.0,2.0,"The most genuinely kind and caring professor I've had at Davidson. Very interesting lectures, fair reviews, light reading assignments. Would definitely reccomend this class to those trying to get their history requirement out of the way rather painlessly."
3935,237386,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor.  Lectures are clear.  Grading is fair.  She is willing to help you in any way she can.  Highly recommend for history majors and non-majors alike!
3936,237386,4.0,2.0,"dietz is awesome. she loves her subject and it shows. shes a good lecturer and also a very kind and understanding person. fair grader, fair tests. i highly recommend."
3937,237386,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Dietz is the best.  She is a tough grader and is very picky, but she is super helpful and genuinely cares about all of her students' well-being.  Her lectures are super interesting and she always wants you to be engaged.  What a sweetheart.  TAKE HER CLASS."
3938,237386,5.0,3.0,I love Dr. Dietz. She is honestly one of my favorite teachers ever. Her enthusiasm makes everything interesting and her lectures fly by. She is a reasonable grader and wants her students to succeed.
3939,237386,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Dietz was awesome! The lectures were super interesting and more or less contained everything you needed to know for the tests, through you do need to read at least part of every primary source. She's a bit of a hard grader, but if you're having trouble, her office hours are very helpful."
3940,237386,4.0,5.0,Hard class but she was very encouraging and tried to make discussion more interesting.  Unfortunately this was the most boring semester of Humes.  She was great though.
3941,237386,5.0,4.0,"Absolutely amazing teacher! Interesting, engaging, helpful and friendly. Loves her class and the people in it. Never plays favorites but acts like she genuinly cares about every student. Essays are challenging but she is always available for help and really wants to to improve. Highly recommended!"
3942,237386,3.5,4.0,"She leads discussion on a leash, allowing for little-to-no chance for input from other students. She is very knowledgable of the subject, but sometimes lectures more than allowing the students to make their own conclusions."
3943,237386,5.0,2.0,Loved this class.  Dietz rocks!  Her lectures were really interesting and she was always willing to help or clarify.
3944,237386,5.0,3.0,"She's a great professor, always available to help you with a paper. She'll even look at the same paper 3 or 4 times if that's what you need. She's a tough grader, but fair, and she gives long explanations at the end of a graded assignement telling you where you went wrong and what your strong points are. Also a great lecturer."
3945,237386,5.0,3.0,The Viv is awesome.
3946,237386,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3947,237386,5.0,2.0,No Comments
3948,237386,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Dietz was one of the best teachers I've had at Davidson. She tried so hard to get students involved in discussions--it didn't always work, but i wasn't watching the clock in her class."
3949,1498966,3.5,2.0,Lots of fun to have as a professor because he makes goofy remarks and keeps things interesting. Reasonable expectations and always willing to help outside of class.
3950,1498966,5.0,3.0,"Barros is an awesome professor. He is very knowledgeable and facilitates good discussion. The readings were interesting and manageable, but he requires a short critical analysis before each class. Participation is crucial."
3951,1881946,1.0,2.0,Must unclear lecturer I've ever had. Just as unclear in office hours and lab. He can take even the simplest topic and make it confusing. Uses powerpoints that came with the textbook for lectures. Tests aren't that hard even though you have no idea what will be on them. Also an easy lab grader
3952,1881946,1.0,3.0,"Would not recommend this professor. He teaches from a different text book than is listed for the course, reads from power points he did not make, loves to talk about himself, and is extremely unhelpful."
3953,122715,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Kuzmanovich is one of the best professors at Davidson and the best prof in the English department by far. Although he can seem intimidating, he cares deeply for his students. My advice? Read the material and ask questions/participate in class. He's a great resource in and out of the classroom. I highly recommend taking at least one class w him."
3954,122715,2.0,3.0,"His fragrance course was incredibly confusing, and he offered little to no help outside of class regardless of how many times I went/asked questions. Assignments are way too open-ended and he does not help much in specifying his expectations until after you get your assignment back. All around good guy, but questionable professor."
3955,122715,5.0,4.0,A truly outstanding professor who exemplifies the best of a liberal arts education. He challenges students to think critically for themselves and to defend their ideas. Exceptional.
3956,122715,5.0,5.0,As close to genius as you can get in the English dept
3957,122715,5.0,5.0,His perspective changed my life and is the reason I ended up in graduate school.
3958,122715,4.5,4.0,"Best professor at Davidson. This class will change how you read stop signs. Very hard, extremely rewarding. This course is the reason you go to a liberal arts college."
3959,122715,3.0,5.0,A real father figure. He works hard to prepare and he expects you to work hard too. Talk to him outside of class. He will talk to you every day if you come to him.
3960,122715,3.0,5.0,"Zoran Kuzmanovich is one of the most brilliant men I've ever met. but, he's so brilliant that you may have a hard time following his logic sometimes.. Regardless, he kept the class very interesting and really knows his stuff! Great professor! I definitley would take another class with him!"
3961,122715,1.0,4.0,Don't be fooled by the euro-mind tricks. Therre's some brilliance in there but it's covered by icky ego.
3962,122715,3.0,5.0,"Kuzmanovich is one of my favorite teachers at Davidson. however, sometimes his classes can be completely confusing. He will let the students lead discussion and sometimes he butts in and completely derails the train of thought. On the best days, though, you leave his class feeling like you just expanded your brain 10%.  he's a sweetheart!"
3963,122715,1.0,4.0,"I had him for 220 and he was my favorite professor.  I had him again for a seminar and i have never been so disappointed.  I was sincerely enthusiastic prior to the course, as was the rest of the class, but quickly realized that not only was kuzmo devoid of enthusiasm for teaching it, he seemed sincerely annoyed by the students' presence each day."
3964,122715,2.0,4.0,"One of the worst classes I've taken at Davidson, and Kuzmo didn't help. I've never had a professor make me feel so stupid. Sure, he has his &quot;Santa Claus&quot; moments, but they are few and don't make up for the otherwise continuous degradation."
3965,122715,1.5,5.0,Generally an awful class. Just buy the norton and read it yourself. he rambles and doesnt make sense. his tests are killer too
3966,122715,3.0,2.0,"He's bonkers at times but always interesting. He loves to be challenged, but class conversation can be at times stilted. For this course he preferred just talking at us which was at times tiring. The material is tough, but he is brilliant and loves to make connections. Connections are an important part of it all. Endure him, don't be scared..."
3967,122715,4.0,4.0,"Great guy.  Intimidates some, but that's just his demeanor and appearanc.  Say one funny thing in class, or visit his office, and he'll love you."
3968,122715,4.5,4.0,"He's a professor out of a movie. Yes, at times intimidating, but no more than Santa Clause, and with a sparkle in his eye and quick wit that makes every class not only interesting, but entertaining."
3969,122715,4.5,2.0,"Some people find him intimidating, but he is an amazing teacher and a brilliant man. Spent an hour of office hours talking to him about his life and politics and stuff. A great professor; don't let him scare you!!"
3970,122715,5.0,4.0,Kuzman is the man.  Don't let him frighten you--he's actually a really nice guy and quite brilliant.  Amazing lectures--no note taking can do them justice.  Tons of reading and tough tests but a very rewarding class.
3971,122715,4.5,4.0,"Had him freshman year and he almost scared me away from the major - at least, until I went in to talk to him and realized he's actually a big softy under that really evil-twisted-santa-claus exterior.  He's brilliant, too."
3972,122715,5.0,3.0,Dr. Kuzmanovich is awesome.  He is to brilliant for his own good.  He can relate to the students extremely well and will make anything interesting.  You will more in his class about life than you will about english
3973,81758,4.0,4.0,"Great guy, super accessible outside of class. Incredibly passionate about the subject and therefore office hours/class participation go a long way. Out of class work doesn't always align perfectly with lectures, but help nonetheless. Throws you into the world of policy--can take adjusting, but a class worth taking if you're interested in policy."
3974,81758,2.0,5.0,"Very nice guy, very knowledgeable about foreign policy. He adjusts class/syllabus a lot based on medical issues, which is understandable, but don't expect that flexibility to go both ways. Gives very broad assignments and then expects a very specific, polished result. This class will teach you a lot about perseverance, don't expect a good grade."
3975,81758,1.0,5.0,"He is a decent guy and has some interesting stories but the trade off for an interesting story in the field once a month is no useful feedback on papers, and he just lectures for the entire class and expects you to write everything down and be an expert at the subject. Expect to fail all of your papers in this class."
3976,81758,1.0,4.0,Worst Professor I have ever had. No matter what you do or how hard you try will always find something wrong with your work and a reason to give you a bad grade. Graded work takes months to get back and feedback contradicts itself.
3977,81758,1.0,4.0,"For an intro level class there were far too many papers. Furthermore, it seemed as though he assumed the students were expert political analysts when he graded papers. Lectures consisted of him talking about his own personal experiences instead of focusing on paper structures, what he was looking for, etc. However, he is a very kind person."
3978,81758,3.0,3.0,Good professor but lecture heavy and graded on very few assignments
3979,81758,2.0,5.0,"Do not ever take Dr. Menkhaus' class for the Davidson in Washington Program if you want to enjoy your summer. The workload is absolutely absurd, with a 9-5 internship, one paper a week, and a 3-essay final. Also, he is bad with feedback and my writing did not improve at all. His lecture style is composed of him just talking at the front."
3980,81758,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Menkhaus a knowledgable guy. Unfortunately, his class is only lectures, and by this I mean he sits at the front of the room and talks the whole time and you're expected to get down every word that he says. There're very few graded assignments and he takes forever to get them back. Overall, he was just okay."
3981,81758,5.0,3.0,"One of the most interesting professors I've had at Davidson so far. Hearing about his experiences working in Somalia is fascinating. The course material is also very interesting. He's a fair grader, just takes a long time to get assignments back because he takes on many responsibilities with the school. Highly recommend a class with him."
3982,81758,3.0,4.0,Dr. Menkhaus is passionate about his field of study and often interjected facts about Africa during POL 140. It is important to do the reading and to take notes during class. Most of the important information he gives is during his lectures.
3983,81758,4.0,4.0,"I took this poly sci class as a bio major and even though my bio heavy brain did not understand what was going on, it was a good class overall. His lectures were really interesting and he is a fair grader. Only problem is he takes on too many jobs in the school that he takes FOREVER to grade so you dont know how youre doing"
3984,81758,5.0,2.0,"Good guy. Him and I may not agree on everything about politics, but his lectures are interesting, he's a fair grader, and I enjoyed the class. Would recommend for anyone wanting an interesting polisci course. He always has interesting stories about his world travels and living abroad too."
3985,81758,4.0,3.0,"Menkhaus is first to say that Philanthropy and the Nonprofit Sector is his ""bread&butter course"" at Davidson. Lectures sometimes felt a tad underprepared, but more importantly, he provided the best platform for students to engage with one another, reflecting on effective giving and the course's lab component where we gave $20K to local nonprofits!"
3986,81758,5.0,3.0,"Menkhaus is literally the hidden gem of Davidson. If you don't know much about him, Google him. His ""field stories"" are the reason for taking his class. He tells stories about sleeping on the couches of ambassadors, flying around war-torn cities in helicopters, getting coffee with spies, proving the DoD wrong and playing war games with the military"
3987,81758,4.5,4.0,"Menkhaus is a legend. He says things like ""And that's why you have to be able to outdrink Swedish intelligence officers"" and ""Death threats are easier to handle than bar fights."" You will have to work in his class, but he's a fair grader and makes sure you learn stuff. He will stick up for you in the wider poli sci world if you earn his respect. "
3988,81758,4.5,3.0,"Menkhaus is the man. One of my favorite quotes: ""Being able to outdrink Swedish intelligence agents is an important part of field research."" He really knows his stuff and teaches straightforward lecture classes. He expects a lot from writing and is very busy, but he's a great guy and will go to bat for you. "
3989,81758,3.5,3.0,"Menkhaus's lectures are pretty clear and cover most of the material that you were supposed to read (which few people actually do), but know the names and major ideas of the authors for tests.  I found him a very interesting guy and his anecdotes about Somalia are always interesting and pertain to the subject being covered."
3990,81758,4.0,2.0,"I was not a poli sci major but took this course and learned so much (yes, even at 8:30am). Menkhaus is an incredible lecturer, and as long as you take great notes, you will do fine.  Very fair grader but very hard to visit during office hours, as he is constantly traveling. i would highly recommend this class. he's not as hard as people think."
3991,81758,4.5,3.0,"Best teacher ever. Super interesting lectures...sometimes it was so interesting that I forgot to take notes! Phenomenal.. I wish he would teach all of my classes. I had his class at 8:15, but I actually looked forward to going and I never dozed off because it was such a great class."
3992,81758,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Menkhaus is a smart, nice guy, but I do not recommend him. He claims to want a discussion based class, yet he ends up lecturing the whole time. Also, He takes a long time to grade, and he does not provide very useful comments/ feedback."
3993,81758,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Menkhaus may frequently be called to DC and beyond to help the government, which can make meeting with him difficult, but when you do meet with him, he's very engaging and helpful. Incredibly knowledgeable, yet down-to-earth and friendly in lecture. Tests/papers can seem daunting, but he grades very fairly."
3994,81758,4.5,3.0,A phenomenal teacher and a great guy. Teaches you the importance of brevity and answering with hard facts. Also be prepared for class to be cancelled every other week since he's traveling to DC to testify before Congress on Somalia (he's the #1 expert in US) Finally the class was virtually all lecture so go to every class write down EVERYTHING.
3995,81758,4.5,4.0,"Menkhaus is my favorite professor at Davidson.  This is a lecture class, but you will definitely not be bored.  I had this class at 8:30 and I was still excited to go."
3996,81758,5.0,4.0,"Menkhaus is incredible - a MUST TAKE!  He assigns a lot of reading, but both it and his lectures are phenomenal.  He single-handedly made me understand what's going on in the news today."
3997,81758,5.0,1.0,don't miss his class
3998,81758,5.0,4.0,"I couldn't have asked for a better professor, nor could I have asked for a better way to set up a class.  He is smart, engaging, and if you don't take a class with him, you are missing out."
3999,81758,4.0,2.0,"Menkhaus is well-qualified, let there be no doubt.  He stays pretty busy with his own work, but not to an excess.  He's available if you need to meet.  But really this is a true lecture class.  Tests and essays will generally be graded hard.  Did I mention the reading&#63;  Because there is without a doubt a lot of it."
4000,81758,5.0,5.0,"Absolutely amazing. He's a hard grader, but it's worth it, no question. One of the coolest guys you'll ever meet, and is involved in huge world changing projects all over the world. Very down to earth and personal at the same time.  Be prepared for a lot of reading and a lot of work, but know that it is worth the effort - don't get discouraged."
4001,81758,5.0,5.0,"Menkhaus is a terrific lecturer, class is always interesting. His real life experience always spices up any of his lectures. Be ready to read a ton and to do some long papers."
4002,81758,4.0,4.0,"you cannot miss his class...you can pick out the readings he mentions in class and read those carefully.  great guy, helpful, interested, and def worth the work!"
4003,81758,5.0,3.0,This guy has experienced first hand what he proclaims to teach you about.  You don't want to miss the oppt to take a class with him--suck it up and do the reading.  You won't regret it.
4004,81758,4.0,5.0,"Too much reading.  If you miss class, you're in THE BIG hole.  THe first test is impossible.  The amount of reading will kick your ---.  On an average night you will read about 80 pages."
4005,81758,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Menkhaus knows it all, and he's really good about teaching it to you too.  This man gives interesting lectures and keeps you interested."
4006,81758,4.5,3.0,No Comments
4007,81758,4.5,4.0,"Great professor, smart and knows his stuff.  But he is so hard! Worth it!"
4008,81760,2.0,2.0,"Among other reasons, I picked Poly Sci because I'm not a math/natural science person. I dreaded stats and put it off as long as I could. Sellers and O'Geen made the course not only bearable in terms of ease, but sometimes also entertaining. Both profs are super nice guys and I'm glad I held out for Sellers' turn to teach the course. Easy grader."
4009,81760,4.5,4.0,"While the material in this class was not fascinating, per se, Dr. Sellers made the class fun and enjoyable. It's not necessary to do all the reading and the workload is quite manageable. Dr. Sellers is a great guy, really cares about his students, and is always available to help."
4010,81760,4.5,5.0,"This class was a pain and a joy: an experience I would definitely repeat.  The simulations are extremely helpful, but you can't underestimate how hard the group work is gonna be.  Sellers is one of the best professors I've had here at Davidson.  He's kind-hearted, he's fun, he KNOWS politics, and, most importantly, he wants you to succeed."
4011,81760,5.0,4.0,"Old student who will always remember Seller's helpfulness and thought provoking classes.  A trye student's professor who will challenge you, but will remain by your side to help you conquer that challenge.  A true depiction of what a Davidson education is all about!  When you leave Davidson, you realize the impact of people like him on your lives."
4012,81760,5.0,2.0,Sellers is awesome.  He works hard and makes time for all of his students.  He's truly a fantastic professor!
4013,81760,5.0,3.0,"One of the BEST professors at Davidson.  Genuinely CARES about his students.  KIND, HELPFUL, and HUMAN.  Went to Davidson so he knows how hard it can be.  Fair workload, fair and anonymous grading.  I'm not a polysci major and I still enjoyed the class.  TAKE HIM."
4014,81760,1.0,3.0,Nice guy but horrible teacher.  Very bad at brokering effective class discussions; everything is forced and you are given little leeway to disagree with the fundamental assumptions underlying his arguments and ideas.  Take him for Stats and avoid him at all costs elsewhere.
4015,81760,4.5,2.0,Great class.
4016,81760,2.5,2.0,Dr. Sellers is a fairly easy grader.  The readings for this class were ordinarily irrelevant to the lectures and class discussions but must be reviewed in light of the course final.  Four one-page papers made the course's work load manageable.  Does not keep attendance.
4017,81760,5.0,3.0,A really nice guy who makes a strong effort to engage the class and usually succeeds.  The only problem is that so much of the class material seems to be obvious platitudes like &quot;politicians run for office in order to affect the political process.&quot;
4018,81760,5.0,2.0,This man loves political science!  You can tell when he gets so excited about putting together research projects!
4019,81760,5.0,1.0,nice easy teacher. likes to talk
4020,2738021,5.0,4.0,"One of the best lecturers I've had: engaging, understandable, while also encouraging questions and discussions. Course content was interesting and applicable even as someone with no background in what we learned. Thorough reading and work is expected, but the structure allows students to make the timing on assignments work for them. I recommend!"
4021,2738021,4.0,4.0,"I love Dr. Harper-Shipman's lectures. So profound and inspiring. She was a bit disorganized and unclear when it came to grading, but I believe if you work for it, you will receive the grade you deserve."
4022,2738021,5.0,4.0,"Harper-Shipman is an amazing teacher, she is amazingly smart knows so much about her topic and will push you to be great. The class wasn't really easy but it wasn't super hard, if you keep up and participate you will do well."
4023,81768,2.0,3.0,"I feel like I haven't learned much from any of her classes. If you can avoid taking her, I would. Her ""activism"" feels performative at times. "
4024,81768,5.0,3.0,Was amazing!  Thoughful discussions and cares about students.
4025,81768,5.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Green&#39;s Female+ Playwrights class and loved it! The content was interesting, discussions were good, and it was not at all stressful. When I took it there were no tests just a few short writing assignments and projects. I would recommend to anyone interested in theatre or someone looking to get their performing arts req. completed."
4026,81768,2.0,5.0,Only take this class if you need it for the major or are highly invested in the topic. The midterm exam was surprisingly difficult and the daily reading were often not fully utilized in class. There was a lot of unnecessary work and assignments that didn't assist in the course goals. The final research paper was well planned and executed though.
4027,81768,4.5,2.0,"Sharon is awesome. She's super friendly, and her classes are very interesting. She appreciates humor, and makes the class much fun. But don't cross her. You really do not want to be on her bad side. She grades hard on papers, but is generous with class reviews and tests. DEFINITELY TAKE HER CLASS. YOU'D LOVE IT."
4028,81768,3.5,4.0,"She is unrealistically strict and inflexible. For theater 101 she accepted no late work, only allowed 2 absences per semester (even for athletes), and she doesn't like to hear negative opinions about Davidson productions. For the end of semester group projects, she was so harsh in her verbal critique that a girl cried."
4029,81768,4.5,1.0,"What a super lady. If you stay on her good side, she will be good to you. Lectures are very clear and the coursework is just fun to do!"
4030,81768,4.0,3.0,"Green is hilarious and will always keep class pretty entertaining. Her lectures are very clear and she's easy to work with outside of class. Intro to Theater is somewhat challenging but if you want a good a grade, it's really not that hard to do is as long as you do what she says."
4031,81768,1.0,4.0,"Like others have said, she was the most prejudiced and mean professor I have ever had. Unfair grading and decides to be nice and grade easier on some, and decides to be unfair and grade harsh on others. I've gotten Fs at Davidson before, which resulted from my poor work and I still liked the professors. Green gave me an F out of her bias and hate."
4032,81768,4.0,4.0,I am convinced she's just  a bit crazy which makes the class so much fun. Her lectures were interesting. Those who participate do better than more quiet students on written assignments and even if you put in a lot of effort. Get on her good side if you want a good grade. Tests are fairly graded though and classes are interesting.
4033,81768,3.0,3.0,"Her class isn't too bad, although sometimes I wish I had heard the advice to get your Fine Arts credit while studying abroad before I signed up. I was angry at times - I put legitimate effort into this fine arts assignment and you give me a C on it&#63; Tests are OK if you study. Lab requirement is 25 hours of free labor for the theatre department."
4034,81768,3.0,2.0,"As the others have said: speak up if u want a good grade in the class. while she may grade harshly at times, if you get on her good side you'll end up fine. easy way to get rid of your fine arts requirement & there isn't a lot of busy work."
4035,81768,3.5,3.0,Dr. Green definitely makes the class harder than it should be. Her tests are not easy and she rarely gives out A's on her theatre reviews. Lab grade is an easy A. Participation is a MUST.
4036,81768,1.0,5.0,one of the meanest women I have ever met.  grades unfairly if she doesn't like you (and she doesn't like people for no reason).  team taught class--they gang up and are petty and immature.  felt like i was in middle school.
4037,81768,4.0,2.0,"She's insane, but it works for her. THE 101 covers everything from directing to design. Class participation is a must. There's also a significant lab req. (work 25-30 hours on a production, publicity, backstage, etc.), but that's a great experience. I loved this class-- my favorite this semester!"
4038,81768,4.0,2.0,Sharon may or may not be mildly psychotic.  Very fun class and a very fun professor.  Speak up if you want a good grade.  Speak up about conservative politics if you want a bad one.
4039,81768,3.5,2.0,Sharon Green is a little crazy but it is an easy and funny class. Good way to get rid of art requirement. Make sure you speak up. She also likes when you make fun of her.
4040,81768,4.5,3.0,"Fun, informal, quirky professor. Has a tendency to get off topic, but the tangents are always hilarious. I've taken lots of her classes--it was good for my soul AND my GPA."

4042,81768,4.5,2.0,A great class to get your fine arts credit for people that aren't artistic
4043,81771,4.5,2.0,"Sadly, he's retiring soon. He's a VERY nice guy. Don't have to show up to class, and you don't really have to read the book, either. Not too difficult and he explains the material well."
4044,81771,5.0,2.0,"Very clear about what he wants from you. Puts old tests online REVIEW THEM, his tests are very similar. Although very clear and  easy to understand sometimes his voice is too quite in class, making it easy to fall asleep. Overall a great teacher, one of my favorites at Davidson."
4045,81771,4.0,3.0,Great teacher
4046,81771,5.0,3.0,Good class.  Good times.  Nice guy and helpful out of class if needed.
4047,81771,5.0,2.0,One of the nicest and capable teachers I have had.
4048,81771,4.5,2.0,"One of the most kind-hearted teachers I have ever met. Such a nice guy, always open for discussion and willing to answer questions."

4051,81771,4.0,1.0,"He can be dull at times, but does a great job of explaining material"
4052,1791852,5.0,3.0,"I had her at UWG, she is so friggin' cool. Very smart and really good about answering questions and going back over things if you don't understand. She's always nice unless you're rude to her. I wish I could take more of her classes!"
4053,1791852,4.5,2.0,Easy class to attend. Made sexy too
4054,1791852,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor! Lectures were always very clear and engaging. Also very nice and helpful in office hours. My favorite class a Davidson thus far!
4055,1791852,4.0,1.0,"Molly was extremely helpful in office hours, and an accommodating professor. Her writing assignments were simple but she tends to be a tough grader on her papers and on tests."
4056,1791855,4.0,4.0,"VERY accessible outside of class, 2 office hours 1 practice session every week and will reply your email at 11 pm. Her lecture doesn't cover everything so read the textbook. She'll tell you to do problems from the textbook and won't assign homework. Work hard if you want a good grade, but don't stress out because she gives out extra credits a lot"
4057,1791855,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Snyder was my FAVORITE prof at Davidson. She is so smart and knows more than any professor about applying to medical schools. If you don't get the chance to take a class with her, you should still introduce yourself because she is extremely wise!"
4058,1791855,5.0,5.0,"If you want to learn the material well and are prepared to have a professor willing to match your dedication, Dr. Snyder is your professor. If you are willing to put the work in, you will be successful. Probably the best professor I've had at Davidson yet. She wants you to succeed, and she's truly found her calling"
4059,1791855,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Snyder is not an easy professor, but she genuinely cares about your success in the course, and she is a great professor. If you are willing to put the work in, she will move mountains for you to succeed. Had her for orgo I &amp; II and I'm so happy I had her for both. Be self-motivated, work a ton of problems on your own, go see her for help."
4060,1791855,4.0,5.0,"Snyder is a great professor but you definitely need to work VERY hard to do well in the class. There's rarely a huge amount of homework that is due, but there is always endless amount of studying and problems you need to do one your own. If you want a easy way out of a class Snyder is definitely not the way to go but you will learn a lot"
4061,1791855,4.0,5.0,Very tough teacher but is always available for help
4062,1791855,5.0,4.0,"Really awesome professor. Such a mom to our class. She'll make you work, but its orgo, so you have to expect it. Will teach you the concepts without making you memorize, but will test to the same standard, so you never really know what to expect on the test. If you study, you can do really well."
4063,1791855,5.0,5.0,"Immunology is taught every 3 years, so I was lucky to take it. I learned a ton from Dr. Snyder's class and even though it was really challenging, I would take it again. There are five major assignments (group project, midterm, final, etc), each worth 20% of your grade. Could be good/bad depending on how much work you put in. Overall great course."
4064,1791855,5.0,4.0,"Great class. Great professor. It's a lot of work, but if you put in the time you will get a good grade in the class  and do well on the MCAT."
4065,1791855,5.0,4.0,"An outstanding professor. Tests and labs are difficult, but Nicole motivates you to learn the material and be a better scientist. There is no better professor to take orgo with, she's just so clear and works extra hard in office hours and review sessions to convey all of the material. I took the class a year ago and still ace MCAT orgo problems!"
4066,1791855,5.0,4.0,Dr. Snyder is by far the best professor in the chemistry department and by far the most competent at teaching organic chem. I struggled at the beginning of the semester but was able to make As on three out of the four tests by the end. Has weekly quizzes and problem sets to make sure you are keeping up with the material. Has tons of office hours!!
4067,1791855,5.0,5.0,"A+!  Professor Snyder teaches organic chemistry very well.  Her lectures are clear and she makes all of her notes available online.  She also goes out of her way to make sure everyone (not just the chemistry majors) understands the material.  The exams are difficult, but she curves and drops the lowest score."
4068,1791855,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Snyder expects hard work, dedication to study, and an effort to learn chemistry, as opposed to memorize.  She assigns quite a bit of work, and her tests are difficult.  However, after finishing her class I feel I have learned a ton and will benefit greatly in any class or examination that builds on this class. I highly recommend her."
4069,1791855,5.0,3.0,"Highly recommend.  Nicole is a gifted teacher who wants all of her students to succeed.  As other posters have noted, she assigns a lot of work and has very high expectations, but they are not unreasonable.  Grading was fair and generous.  Class average was an 85 and she drops the lowest exam."
4070,1791855,5.0,5.0,"Great Professor!  High expectations, and difficult grader, but gives a lot in return.  She even meets with every student individually after the every exam and is always available.  The organic chemistry section of the MCAT was a breeze because Professor Snyder taught me how to think instead of just memorize.  Highly recommend!!!"
4071,1791855,1.5,5.0,"Dr. Snyder is inconsistent in her grading, assignment expectations, and teaching. She does not teach all the necessary info during class, which makes every problem session and office hour practically required. However, she is truly a nice person who tries to be extremely helpful. I do not recommend this class."
4072,1791855,4.5,5.0,"She has high expectations for her students, and assigns a large amount of work including: quizzes, problem sets, prelaba and post lab write-ups, along with project and tests. That said, she is very helpful, and willing to spend time with you to understand. Favorite chemistry professor byfar."
4073,1791855,5.0,4.0,she is an amazing teacher that definitely wants her students to succeed. it's a lot of work but you will learn more than you have in any other class. definitely great preparation for the MCAT and i absolutely recommend her!
4074,1791855,5.0,4.0,"Easily my favorite professor at Davidson.  This is definitely a hard course and the coursework is demanding, but Dr. Snyder will do everything she can to help you.  If you attend the weekly review sessions and go to her office hours you'll do fine."
4075,1791855,4.5,5.0,Worlds of help and pleasant to work in lab with. She is extremely difficult and seemed unreasonable with her expectations but she truly wants you to learn the concepts and makes it possible for you to succeed. She has office hours on sunday! Inspirational instructor
4076,2125685,5.0,3.0,"Tsai Laoshi is such an amazing and caring language teacher. I really wish I could keep having her classes. There is no question of whether or not you will participate, she will make you participate. She is very upfront about feedback and does not sugar coat things, but she does it because she really wants you to improve."
4077,2125685,5.0,3.0,"Awesome language teacher! Makes chinese very fun and easy to learn. She's a very lively and hilarious teacher -- which makes the in-class participation less intimidating. Involuntary speaking is a must, but that's the best way to practice and learn a language. Very kind and willing to help during office hrs too -- understands that chinese is hard!"
4078,2125685,5.0,4.0,"Professor Tsai is an amazing teacher! She incorporates IRL into her lessons, is very encouraging, and has clear grading criteria. She is also very accessible outside of class- you can always find her at the Chinese Dept. Lunch table engaging with her students! She has made learning Chinese fun and interesting! I wish she taught higher levels!"
4079,2125685,5.0,3.0,One of the best language teachers you'll have. The class is intense but she makes you engage so that you'll actually learn the language. Participation is required in her class but it's a good balance between work and fun. She gives quizzes almost every day and homework every night so there's a lot of graded work.
4080,2125685,5.0,4.0,"Tsai Laoshi is amazing! Not only is she funny, but also cares about you and wants you to do well. She knows Chinese is a complex language; if you're confused, she is more than happy to answer your questions in English. Go to her office hours! She will give you great feedback and extra practice if you want it."
4081,2125685,5.0,4.0,"Such a funny and lively teacher. Don't take her teasing and jokes to heart, she has the best interests for all of her students. Class involves a lot of involuntary speaking and writing, but that's the best way to learn Chinese. She has the utmost patience for students and at the end of the day will make sure you have the pronunciation down."
4082,511864,1.0,2.0,"He comes off as very caring at first, but he can overstep his boundaries with students. Also, since humanities is an effort-based class and there is no way to measure effort, it seems that he randomly gives out grades, especially since you don't know your grade until it's submitted. Very egotistical and unorganized."
4083,511864,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Denham is really passionate about the Humanities program. He cares deeply about his students as people. He is, however, unwilling to work for them (likely due to his huge ego). He gives little feedback, dismisses issues in the program, and belittles you if you are pursuing an interest that he considers to be unimportant."
4084,511864,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Denham is a professor that is very passionate about Germany, considering that he got his PhD in that field. He makes you think you feel listened to only to critique of your character if he doesn't like you. His grading is subjective, grading on perceived effort. Therefore, if your hard work goes unnoticed, you're screwed grade-wise."
4085,511864,4.0,2.0,Humanities is Denham's baby at Davidson. Denham is very passionate about the material he teaches and focuses more on student's engagement with their work than grades. He grades based off of effort and is very helpful outside of class. He has a major ego but overall he is a great professor.
4086,511864,4.0,2.0,"Humanities was frustrating at times and really rewarding at other times. 3 grades were based solely on a Portfolio of coursework in May. Denham grades based on effort. If you go to office hours, update him on your progress with the coursework, and apply his feedback, you will do well. Denham does have an ego but he overall takes feedback well."
4087,511864,5.0,4.0,"Professor Denham was amazing. Humanities was a pretty difficult class for me but he was very helpful and did everything he could to help. He was always accessible for help, encouraging, and just overall a positive influence. If I needed help on anything, I felt I could trust him to help in anyway he could. Highly recommend going to office hours!"
4088,511864,3.0,2.0,Denham spent the whole semester lecturing about German politics instead of German grammar. Most of us felt we didn't learn a lot. Stopped assigning vocab quizzes after the first few weeks. Denham missed a lot of class. Our class didn't seem to be a priority for him.
4089,511864,3.0,2.0,Not good for writing 101. He grades very fairly but doesn't really meet the qualifications for learning how to write. Gets off on random tangents a lot and the assignments were kinda vague. Easy A for daily posts but not sure the purpose of the class was met.
4090,511864,3.5,2.0,"Denham comes off as kind of standoffish and prickly in class, go to his office hours! He is extremely helpful with assignments and often encourages you to email him the next draft so he can review it. He is genuinely interested in your life and tries to help you out as much as possible. Take his class!"
4091,511864,2.5,1.0,He can gossip in several languages.
4092,511864,5.0,3.0,"Denham's the man.  He believes fully in the liberal arts tradition, and this is reflected in his teaching style: his goal is to get you to think.  Due to this, sidetracks are common, but not a detriment.  After all, you can study German on your own.  You can't pick Denham's brain by yourself."
4093,511864,4.0,2.0,"This man's very smart. He also does not like stupid people, and he will let you know if you say something dumb. I think he's a good professor and loves teaching, but unfortunately our class was often sidetracked and we abandoned our syllabus fairly quickly. Thus we ended up not speaking much German and my speaking skills regressed. Cool guy though."
4094,511864,4.0,1.0,"Get in office hour time with Denham, he really appreciates it and you'll do better in his class. I don't think my German improved, but my knowledge of the culture increased!"
4095,511864,5.0,3.0,Denham is the man and gets an unfair shake on this site.  He actually encourages individual thought and pushes his students in the way every professors ought to.  I adore him and will always feel grateful to have been in his class.
4096,511864,2.5,1.0,"Elitist...egotistical...cocky...yes, all of the above. Davidsonian article out of line, yes. BUT he really cares about how much his students learn and think...he wants you to reach your full potential. He cares about your well-being. He appreciates open-mindedness. He's a serious intellectual, but not a serious person. He does not care about grades"
4097,511864,3.5,4.0,"Denham's smart, and he knows it, and he isn't afraid to tell you you aren't. But he's clearly passionate about learning--of all varieties--so he's definitely worth taking a class with, if you can handle criticism. A stickler for attendance, though, so if you miss or are late for class a lot, pass him over."
4098,511864,3.0,4.0,"He is extremely nice to everyone to their faces, but he loves to make fun of then behind their backs.  He also enjoys gosip.  Whatever you do, do not trust this man."
4099,511864,3.5,2.0,"A pedal-to-the-metal type of teacher with information flying at you, but you seem to love every minute of it."
4100,511864,3.0,3.0,"Nice enough, but his 1st priority was the CIS theses. Potential to learn a lot, but he never kept on topic, was unclear and relaxed in his explanation of his expectations on assignments, which changed from draft to draft, and he failed to return 3 of 5 assignments before finals, so it was possible to leave with grades very different than expected."
4101,511864,4.0,1.0,"He's a nice enough guy and he knows a lot about a variety of topics, but sometimes this leads him to get off track and stray too far from what we're supposed to be discussing."
4102,511864,5.0,3.0,Dr. Denham is one of the few Davidson professors (maybe 3) that truly understands that lightning steers the course through all things.
4103,511864,4.5,1.0,No Comments
4104,511864,4.0,2.0,"He's a pretty easy prof.  We didn't really do a lot of anything in class.  He loves to discuss politics and make known how liberal he is, but he's a really nice guy too.  Very willing to help or just talk outside of class.  Sometimes gets overly proud of his Chicago undergrad or Harvard MA and Ph.D."
4105,511868,5.0,4.0,I didn't like History classes until I took Dr. Thomas! Amazing professor!  I learned a lot!
4106,511868,4.0,4.0,"If you have never taken a course with Dr. Thomas, you definitely should. He is probably THE most knowledgeable professor I have ever had at Davidson. His courses aren't the easiest, but if you go to office hours and ask for clarification when you are confused, you will do well."
4107,511868,1.5,5.0,"Job Thomas is very kind, and has an adorable sense of humor. His HIS171 class is next to impossible, however. His lectures are difficult to follow and VERY dry and boring. He is unclear about his expectations, and the tests are all essays in which he expects students to know insane amounts of random details."
4108,511868,5.0,4.0,"I love this professor. He is fair, knowledgeable, caring, and always available for office hours. This is the second class I have taken with him, and greatly enjoyed it. The only people who seem to complain about his teaching are those unwilling to put in the hard work necessary for this class."
4109,511868,1.0,3.0,"Easily the worst professor I have ever had in my time here at Davidson. Impossible to understand, crabby, unclear about what he wants, random in his grading.  Also the most boring class that I have ever set foot in-- he is neither an engaging lecturer nor does he invite class discussion!  I would not recommend him."
4110,511868,4.5,4.0,"I am going to be an art history major because of professor Thomas. He is one of the most brilliant professors I have ever met. His course is very challenging, but if you enjoy art history, and are willing to work, it is definitely worth taking his classes. His accent is a non-issue, and he doesnt choose favorites, just rewards hard work."
4111,511868,3.5,5.0,"Professor Thomas is a very nice man and a wonderful teacher.  The accent is not as difficult as people here are claiming.  My only complaint is that he definitely has his &quot;favorites&quot;: He chooses the same student in my class of 7 to read from her paper every time.  Frustrating and unnecessary. Other than that, I have no complaints!"
4112,511868,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Thomas is a fascinating man. One of the nicest I've had. He invites the class to his home for dinner. I struggled but learned more than I have ever learned in a history class. Tests were very tough, not as much the material as the format (final involved 20 pages of essays and a map questoin). I fyou are willing to work, I would reccommend him."
4113,511868,3.5,5.0,"Job Thomas is an amazing man.  Sure, his classes are probably the most difficult at Davidson, and he rarely gives A's, but that shouldn't stop you from taking one of his classes.  He has a lot to share about history, art, and life in general.  Take a chance on one of his classes, because there's more to life than grades!"
4114,511868,4.5,5.0,A brilliant man.  His Gandhi lecture was great and his Chinese History course was informative (although rather daunting).
4115,511868,4.5,4.0,"I LOVED Professor Thomas. Brilliant, articulate, committed... sweet sense of humor, too. Take the time to meet with him. He wants to help, and he can. There's a lot of material, but it's not unreasonable, and he's good about tying everything together so that you see it's all relevant. Also, I love the accent. (History of India)"
4116,511868,1.0,5.0,"Job Thomas could be one of the most difficult I have ever and can ever imagine having.  If you manage to survive up until the final as I have, it doesn't matter because the incredible amount of information on the final will destroy you and make the class basically impossible to do well in/pass.  F art history."
4117,511868,5.0,4.0,"Fascinating class and fascinating teacher. A wealth of knowledge for the person who wants to learn something. Changed my life. Take the effort to get to know the man. Not only is he brilliant from an academic perspective, his life knowledge is incredible. He also can be a good friend."
4118,511868,1.0,5.0,"Job Thomas is a bitter old man, hard to understand in class, and uninterested in his students.  He even accused a student of an honor violation without any evidence.  I strive to find the words to adequately describe his bitterness toward students.  Avoid him at all costs, and pray for the day when he is terminated or retires."
4119,511868,4.0,4.0,"Everyone makes way too big of a deal out of how hard his class is. If you work hard and put the time in, then you CAN do well. He's confusing at times, but overall, my favorite professor that semester by far. Take his class but be prepared to work..."
4120,511868,4.0,4.0,"You either love or hate Job Thomas; I'm a fan. Once you pick up the accent, Dr. Thomas' humor and knowledge become evident in lecture. You will learn tons of information in this class. Office hours are essential, but he is available and very helpful outside of the classroom. He is intimidating and certainly demanding, but a great teacher who cares."
4121,511868,1.0,5.0,"Rude, irritable, calls students out in the middle of lecture for seemingly random things to others.  Harsh grader - gives no credit ideas that are not in lectures or the textbook.  Save yourself!"
4122,511868,4.0,5.0,"If you want to learn a lot and don't mind getting a C, sign up for one of his &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; classes.  I loved it...even though I failed. That's what AP credits are for."
4123,511868,5.0,3.0,GIVE ME A JOB! JOB! He's awesome. One of the nicest guys on campus and always willing to help a kid in need. Job loves sports and art and just being awesome. The accent is a little tough at first but he's a stud.
4124,511868,2.0,5.0,"HORRIBLE!! AVOID JOB!! Office visits are very helpful and he's a friendly man OUTSIDEof the class room, but inside he's difficult to understand, lectures contradict text, and test are damn near IMPOSSIBLE (8 pages of written essays in 50 minutes!!! and i'm not even going to speak about the final!!)"
4125,511868,5.0,4.0,Most of the comments on here are a joke. Probably the nicest prof in our history department. He consistently teaches unbelievable classes and he is not difficult to understand if you have your head out of your ass. I have learned more from him than anyone else at Davidson.
4126,511868,5.0,4.0,"You have to keep up with the slides!  But I disagree with the other comments here.  Dr. Thomas is a very sweet man, takes good care of his students, and was always very helpful to me.  ALWAYS willing to repeat something if you don't understand, but accent isn't too difficult. DIFFICULT but good clas"
4127,511868,1.0,5.0,"Don't take this class. Is unnecessarily difficult. Lectures are hard to follow and contradict the single text. Teaching style is completely outdated. But otherwise seems like a very knowlegable, interesting and impressive person."
4128,511868,3.0,4.0,"Very dedicated to the subject and extremely knowledgable.Somewhat difficult to understand due to accent. Tests are extremely hard, but doable with a good deal of work. A's are possible, but expect to know absolutely everything about Asian Art or history. Very funny and fun to work with in the office"
4129,511868,1.0,5.0,"Unbelievably bad. Unfriendly and difficult, makes everything, including asking important questions, harder than it needs to be.  Threatening. Could have very well been a high school class; encourages no independent thinking and every paper was a report. Learned little, and tests were impossible."
4130,511868,2.0,4.0,"Very hard class.  His accent is very thick and hard to understand, and even though he says he wants to help us with papers and what not, he's rude when you go during office hours, as if your wasting his time.  Avoid Job!"
4131,81796,5.0,3.0,"I had Dr. Roberts for Writing 101. She is truly one of my favorite professors so far at Davidson. She is extremely caring and is aware of the adjustment of being a freshman in college. She is a pretty tough grader on papers and picky; however, the class is made for that. I would 100% recommend her for Writing 101."
4132,81796,5.0,3.0,"By far of the best and most respected professors at Davidson. During election season, she can be somewhat hard to get a hold of outside of class (has many local and national media obligations), but she is special. Her expertise and wisdom are unbelievable and no one cares more about their students success."
4133,81796,4.0,2.0,"I took her my freshman year at Davidson. She's a super caring professor and honestly really funny. On mondays, she would bring us muffins and would ask us about how our weekend went. Taking her class helped me feel more confident in my writing. She was really chill but I think she could have pushed us harder and gave us more in-depth feedback."
4134,81796,2.0,1.0,"I did not learn much at all in her class. Her lectures are incredibly jumbled and lack any substance at all. She did not explain how our final grade was broken down when the semester changed course and it was difficult to understand what she expected from us. I do not recommend taking her, it was a waste of money and time."
4135,81796,2.0,1.0,"You don't realize how little you learn from her lectures until you go to study for the midterm/final and realize you have learned nothing. You're guaranteed an A- if you show up and put a little effort in, but you can only get a full A if you're one of her favorites. Inaccessible outside of class, but readings are basically optional."
4136,81796,2.0,3.0,Roberts gets a great reputation around Davidson for being a really easy professor (and she generally is) but I took one course with her and it will be my last. She's definitely checked out of Davidson and generally just wings it when it comes to her lectures. She lacks basic organizational skills and it doesn't make up for her fun personality.
4137,81796,5.0,2.0,"Professor Roberts is a very kind and understanding. She takes the time to explain answers to questions asked, and sets time aside to meet if necessary."
4138,81796,3.5,2.0,"I may be biased because Dr. Roberts is my major advisor, but she is hands down  the coolest professor I've ever had. She loves her students and the material she's teaching. Her classes aren't too hard if you talk to her outside of class and study with a group. The papers I've written for her class have been some of my favorite projects "
4139,81796,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Roberts is a great professor in that she's friendly, flexible, and funny. She may get a little off topic during lectures, but it you need any help, her office doors are nearly always open for students. "
4140,81796,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Roberts is my favorite professor thus far at Davidson. Not only does she deeply care about her students, but she is very quick and intelligent and can easily make connections between campaigns, elections, politicians, current events and public opinion that make the class very interesting. Great class!"
4141,81796,3.5,2.0,Dr. Roberts is a teacher who truly cares about all of her students and wants them to do well.  Muffin Mondays are a weekly occurrence and make the class absolutely worth taking.  She's a strong believer in the flexible syllabus so due dates are absolutely not set in stone.  Definitely would take this class again. 
4142,81796,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Roberts is a very kind woman, but not the best teacher. She never seems to stay on topic and the class notes are incomprehensible when you're studying for her tests because you realize you never actually talked about anything. She is blown away by technology, so if you use social media in a creative way for presentation, you're guaranteed an A."
4143,81796,2.5,2.0,"Dr. Roberts is kind-hearted and a really fun professor.  Never a dull moment.  She assigns a lot of readings, but you can get away with skimming some of it.  The class is well organized, but she doesn't always follow her own plans. Sometimes the lectures are a bit spacey and, though interesting, the 20 page memoir paper is very time consuming. 7/10"
4144,81796,4.0,3.0,"My favorite professor at Davidson. Extremely knowledgeable, and the readings really add to her lectures. Learned a lot about things I thought I already knew. Put the effort in, you'll earn the grade you deserve."
4145,81796,5.0,2.0,AWESOME TEACHER! Great class!
4146,81796,1.5,3.0,"She is flexible and a kind person, but it's hard to get higher than a B on easy material. Extremely unclear and unfocused. Don't expect to learn anything."
4147,81796,4.0,2.0,"don't expect to learn much about writing--but the deadlines are flexible, she's a nice nice and UNDERSTANDING woman, and she's particularly sympathetic to the freshman experience."
4148,81796,5.0,2.0,"Have had her for 5 or 6 classes.  Very interesting and knowledgeable.  Sometimes gets off topic, but still a fun professor. Can still do well without doing much reading.  Also, very willing to help with anything."
4149,81796,4.0,3.0,"Hard grading, very flexible deadlines and not necessary to read to do well in course. Gets off topic like a charm, but make sure you can say something worth while. Take it, will make you a better writer."
4150,81796,4.0,3.0,"American Dream of Success is a great class. She promotes lots of discussion. Grading is a little tough, but deadlines are very flexible. Don't expect to get your papers back on time."
4151,81796,4.5,3.0,Very passionate teacher; loves her students; gets off topic frequently- frustrating if you're trying to get through syllabus; a joy to talk to.
4152,81796,4.5,3.0,No Comments
4153,81798,2.0,3.0,"A very, very boring class. Krentz talks (lectures?) for the entire 50 minutes (minimal visual aids, no notes on the board) in the least engaging way possible. The homework is busy work and is the exact. same. format. every night. Instructions for many assignments are vague/unclear but he sometimes gets aggravated if you ask questions. Not great."
4154,81798,1.0,3.0,Such a dry and boring professor. All of his homework questions are super vague but he grades harsh and is condescending if you get something wrong. Overall just an unenjoyable environment to learn in. You will have to read for every class and if you aren't super into classics it will be boring.
4155,81798,1.0,4.0,"No paper is good in Professor Krentz's eyes unless he has written it himself. It seems like no idea for a paper is the right one, and he finds a million things wrong with every paper. His feedback on papers is unnecessarily picky and condescending. Also expects you to be an expert on outlandish topics with very limited resources, such as Socrates."
4156,81798,3.0,3.0,"I thought this class would be interesting, and parts of it were. His lectures were dry and class participation was limited because of lack of interest. All the homework was busy work and he is a HARD grader. Very opinionated and condecending to anyone who has an opinion. Take this class if you are interest in Classics."
4157,81798,5.0,4.0,"He honestly gets an unfair rep on this site; he's truly amazing. If you like ancient Greek or Roman history, do his reading and you will learn. Some nights it may be a lot, others not so much, but the assignments are short no matter what. Classes are based on homework so please read. Really kind hearted and friendly man. Great professor."
4158,81798,1.0,4.0,"I was really disappointed by this class and by Dr. Krentz. I found the lectures to be very dry, with little reason to attend class. Class participation was nonexistent; when he tried to force it, there was a long painful ""Bueller...."" moment. There was also homework/busywork nearly every nice. Oh and beware ""the stare""."
4159,81798,2.5,4.0,He expects so much for an intro class. His directions in homework are unclear and he's very condescending when you ask for help. Weird grading scale and harsh grader on homework. Tests are easy if you like to memorize. Boring lectures and unwilling to help. Makes you feel awful and he is proud of that. I love classics but this will scare you away
4160,81798,1.5,5.0,This class was awful. Students were expected to have extensive knowledge about how to analyze classical documents. It was definitely catering to the classics majors despite being a low level intro class. Taking this class is one of my biggest regrets at college.
4161,81798,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Krentz loves to hear himself speak. I took CLA 101 because of recommendations from this site. I was mislead. DO NOT take the course if you just want to fulfill the history requirement, not worth it. The workload is unreal for an into class and Krentz and Totten (co-taught class) treat it like a 300 level class. "
4162,81798,3.5,4.0,"Interactions with Dr. Krentz are all about the power dynamic. In particular, I would want women to know that he tends to make inappropriate sexual comments to attractive younger women in his classes - he genuinely cares about his students and would never do anything inappropriate, but he enjoys making women feel uncomfortable and ""off guard."" "
4163,81798,3.0,3.0," Dr. Krentz is a brilliant academic, but not easiest professor to get along with. Class discussions are entirely controlled by him, because he will only affirm what you say if it what he agrees with and what he wanted you to say. He also has a tendency to talk over his students, making him come off as self-absorbed and condescending. "
4164,81798,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Krentz is condescending, slightly pervy, and overall pretty awful. In this class, he was team teaching, and took every possible opportunity to trash his co-professor, who was infinitely clearer and more qualified than he was. His lectures are boring, rambling, and unclear, and his assignment prompts are vague and generally useless. Avoid him."
4165,81798,2.5,4.0,"Roman history is easy if you read and take notes. Active participation will win you his favor. Tests are primarily on the texbook reading and easy 50 Multiple choice quizzes substantiate the grade. You have the option to write essays instead of the tests and instead of taking a final. Stickler for deadlines, if you miss them expect a zero."
4166,81798,1.5,4.0,"I've heard he's ok in other classes (like Greek History and the Cinema course), but AVOID him for Roman History!! Makes the course way too difficult, and you learn nothing in the end."
4167,81798,3.0,2.0,"Once you come to peace with the fact that he's very condescending and not sugary nice, you'll enjoy his classes. You have to be able to laugh, because he's actually a really funny guy. And he's very attractive. This class was fun and interesting and a refreshing change from the traditional lecture style course. But lots of work. No procrastinators!"
4168,81798,3.0,4.0,"I liked Prof Krentz. With that being said, this class didn't meet my expectations. Some readings don't seem to relate to the class. He doesn't grade papers, you just get a finla grade of your portfolio at the end of the semester. The class did improve my writing a lot."
4169,81798,4.5,3.0,"SUPER HOT. Extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the subject. Yes, the stares are slightly awkward, but an excellent teacher overall. Definitely take this class!"
4170,81798,1.0,5.0,This professor does not take his student's opinions into account and is very disorganized with his lectures. He can be quite condescending and his grades are sometimes arbitrary.
4171,81798,5.0,3.0,"Excellent professor who works hard to make sure every student gets something out of the class. Easy to approach. Fair grader, but can be challenging. Funny but knows when to push the class."
4172,81798,3.0,4.0,"Krentz is one weird man.  I liked Jesus class.  He's a hard grader, but he will make your writing stronger. If you disagree with him, make sure you do it well. He also has this awkward gaze thing he does...watch out for it, and challenge it."
4173,81798,1.5,4.0,"Okay guy. Bad teacher. VERY opinionated. If you don't take his advice on a paper, he will punish you severly with the grade. Class has little direction. Class is very often off the course topic. Some people have liked him, I don't. Take a risk if you want."
4174,81798,4.0,3.0,Good lectures and a nice teacher.  Slightly prone to awkward pauses when someone makes a joke or says something he doesn't agree with.
4175,81798,5.0,4.0,"Very helpful and informative. I recommend it to any Davidson students, one of the best classes here."
4176,81798,4.5,3.0,"Great class and professor.  Requires the work to be done, but is fair and leads great discussions."
4177,81798,1.5,3.0,Where to begin&#63; First of all this is the worst class that I have ever taken at Davidson.  Krentz did not teach me anything. The discussions that we had in class were stagnant because noone challenged their beliefs nor looked upon the topics objectivel
4178,81798,4.0,3.0,very nice and knows his roman history. has interesting assignments
4179,81798,4.5,3.0,Excellent teacher who makes history a challenging and lively mental puzzle.  Forces you to examine your ideas.  A great class.
4180,81798,2.5,4.0,No Comments
4181,81798,4.0,2.0,Very knowledgeable but picks favorites (esp. in humes).
4182,81798,1.0,3.0,No Comments
4183,81798,1.0,3.0,"this class was horrifying.  his style of  teaching  left me as devoid of knowledge about the topic as i was on the first day of class.  also, i disagreed with almost every comment he made on anything i ever wrote."
4184,81798,1.0,3.0,i'm sorry- just plain bad
4185,81798,2.5,3.0,Lots of reading and tons of writing for the class.  DOes not really help you that much.  Does not givr gradesx until the end of the semester.  Allows you to rewrite any thing up til reading day.  He STARES!!!! he catches your eye and stares intently.
4186,81798,1.0,3.0,No Comments
4187,81798,4.5,3.0,"Challenging - Grades all writing as a portfolio at end of semester,"
4188,1822603,5.0,2.0,Great class! She covers a lot of detailed material but no tests or quizzes.  You end up exploring a topic of personal interest for the major project/paper.
4189,1822603,4.5,2.0,"Great professor, test get increasingly difficult be ready to explain a lot of untaught material. Class gets a little lengthy and dull but overall not bad."
4190,1822603,4.5,2.0,Awesome professor. Grades very fair. Fun class. Take her class.
4191,1822603,4.5,2.0,Take daily clicker quizzes which force you to carefully read the material. Tries hard. Tests are challenging and require you to memorize lots of info.
4192,1845144,5.0,4.0,"Kind, approachable, willing to spend time on the topic. Dr. Thompson is the type of professor that does not simply give out A's. I know this is something many people are not a fan of but this is because she wants you to understand the material. Do the readings and visit office hours. I started off with a C in the class and ended with an A. "
4193,1845144,1.0,4.0,Extremely difficult if you do not have a strong background in astronomy. I had to teach myself outside of class and had already taken two semesters of astronomy in HS. Course covers an extreme amount of material and will not equip you for tests or homework. Participation and office hours are a must. Do not take this class expecting to learn
4194,1845144,2.0,3.0,"Her lectures are average at best. Given this was a 100-level class, I can understand why the class structure resembles that of a high school class. We would do easy problems and examples during the course, but the reviews are unreasonably hard. I would not recommend it if you didn't take AP Physics or some sort of exposure to physics before."
4195,1845144,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Thompson is a very friendly person!! She goes through homework with you if you visit office hours, so it isn't difficult to get full marks for homework. You can also ask her advice on your lab notebook in office hours, which also leads to full mark for lab. If you do these two things every week and study hard, you will get an A! GOOD LUCK!!"
4196,1845144,2.0,4.0,There's no other way to put it: she just isn't good at teaching. Luckily 130 material isn't all that hard if you're a science person (though good luck if math/physics isn't your thing). Also homework was graded harshly and we couldn't work together. There's no point to that aside from lowering grades.
4197,1845144,1.0,3.0,"The worst professor at Davidson. Continuously held students to standards she could not meet herself, such as returning work in a reasonable time, using correct grammar in course materials, or having knowledge of how to operate the technology she assigned us to use for homework and labs."
4198,1845144,2.0,5.0,Lectures were boring and vague and generally weren't related to the homework or tests. She routinely fell behind and was not very great at explaining things
4199,1845144,2.0,4.0,"She was an adequate professor, her lecture were extremely dry but thorough. She quickly got behind on class lectures and some of the material was rushed. Tests were very difficult and there was no leniency with the grades (very harsh grader, little partial credit). Overall, I would not take another class with her and would not recommend."
4200,1845144,3.0,3.0,"She might be a good physics professor, but she should not be teaching a Writing 101 course. She never graded and returned our papers, so we weren't able to see any improvement over the course of the semester. It was a frustrating experience."
4201,1845144,4.0,3.0,"Took Dr. Thompson's Astronomy class for science credit. Would recommend if looking for an easy way to fulfill the requirement. She gives 3 tests including a final, but homework assignments take no longer than 30 minutes. Compared to bio, physics, or chemistry, taking I would take astronomy if not looking to major in science field."
4202,1845144,4.0,3.0,"Not a bad teacher, one of the best in the department. She is pretty helpful in office hours if you ask the right questions. Lectures are not too bad but can get slow/condescending at times. She goes over everything pretty well, so you don't really need to read the textbook. The tests are comprehensive but not very challenging. Would recommend."
4203,1845144,3.5,4.0,"Dr. T would always hold review sessions before tests, and provide equation sheets before the tests, so we would know which ones would need to be memorized, and which ones would be given. She also gave interesting projects and labs. As a non-science major I appreciated her fair grading and willingness to help; she made herself very available to us."
4204,1845144,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Thompson is a great professor. She is very clear in class is extremely helpful in office hours. You know what to expect on the tests, so they are not hard. The labs, however, are long and tedious. She is very passionate about what she teaches! KT is awesome."
4205,1845144,4.5,3.0,"KT is awesome. She does a good job of making lectures interesting, although they are long. She is very helpful and clear in office hours and almost always available. The labs are long and tedious but bearable. The tests are not difficult if you have studied, they are just long. I definitely recommend taking astronomy with her--KT rocks!"
4206,1845144,3.5,3.0,"She is sort of condescending and gives dry lectures. Labs are extremely long and boring. The content material is simple, and she synthesizes it reasonably well. The tests aren't easy or hard, just long and comprehensive. She doesn't respond to emails very well but is good to great in office hours. Moderate workload and expectations. Not bad overall"
4207,1845144,3.5,3.0,"She is a pretty friendly lady but has a dull personality and doesn't offer very engaging lectures. She is pretty good in office hours but doesn't answer questions very well in class. She is somewhat clear but also condescending and fairly dry. The tests aren't easy or hard, just comprehensive. There are a bunch of little assignments and projects."
4208,1845144,3.5,3.0,"Thompson is a young lady who tries to break down things for students but comes off as condescending and full of herself. She is helpful during office hours, but class lectures are slow-paced and dry. Labs are easy but very boring. The content material is simple and becomes increasingly easier. Homework is fair. Tests are middle-of-the-road."
4209,1845144,4.5,3.0,"Great professor, actually teaches the concepts and doesn't just have you memorize facts. "
4210,1845144,2.5,5.0,"She's nice but it was just super hard. Lot's  of mandatory reading and super long labs. It got really dry and boring and she just goes on and on, you'll know what I mean if you take it. Also not good at answering questions. Class would probably be good with another professor."
4211,2738095,4.0,2.0,"You can make up absences through one on one meetings, that was a lifesaver. I slept through most classes, but still excelled in the course, if you're decent at spanish you can cruise to an easy A"
4212,2738095,5.0,3.0,"Profe Offerman is a really great professor. If you study a few hours a week to stay sharp, you will do well. Lectures were engaging, and she does an excellent job including cultural topics as well as grammar and vocab. Profe is very caring, accessible, and accommodating. If you want to genuinely improve your Spanish, take her class."
4213,1324982,5.0,4.0,"Wow. Literally the most caring and dedicated professor I have yet to meet. If you feel like you are struggling, go to office hours, tell him. He will help you greatly. Now, he is a rather tough grader, yet I believe he curves and 'helps' your grade. Please take him. He is such an understanding and involved professor."
4214,1324982,5.0,5.0,"He's an awesome guy, very understanding and helpful, can't praise him enough. The class can be pretty tough, make sure you take notes carefully and DO NOT skip class. Office hours v recommended. Just make sure you pay attention to what he says in class, especially in terms of the application of the material and take quizzes seriously."
4215,1324982,5.0,3.0,I will not tolerate any Barsoum slander. Amazing professor. The class was difficult sometime but he literally asks does that make but sense? after every sub topic. His office hours are always open and he is a very kind professor. My favorite so far 10/10
4216,1324982,5.0,5.0,"Human Physiology is a tough class since we go over many physiological systems. We had a 90 min quiz every other week, which were stressful but helped keep me on track with the material. Dr. Barsoum really knows his stuff and is eager to answer any questions we have. He has high expectations and wants his students to succeed."
4217,1324982,1.0,3.0,"Grades harshly especially considering how difficult it is to even understand what he's asking for. There were multiple times where a question could be understood in different ways to produce different correct answers. You, the student, must try to read his mind and guess his intentions(cuz asking doesn't help!!!) I wont be taking him again... EVER."
4218,1324982,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Barsoum is a wonderful person. Not only is he kind and a great lecturer, but he also recognizes that we are all human, and that things aren't always easy and we can't always balance everything at once. Multiple times this semester, Dr. Barsoum took steps to make sure that everyone was okay and were able to perform our best. Amazing professor."
4219,1324982,5.0,4.0,"One of the hardest classes I've ever taken, but he is amazing. Decent lectures, fair amount of reading, and hard tests. Nicest professor I've ever had. So much outside help, and he really cares about his student. Ask questions during office hours."
4220,1324982,3.5,4.0,"Super nice guy. Easy to talk to and appreciates you going to office hours. Actually never use the textbook. There is no homework except for an occasional article he will send you to read. Tests were hard, and were purely based on lecture, so take really good notes. Lab overall was pretty easy, but hard grader on the lab report and pig practical."
4221,1324982,3.5,4.0,Dr. Barsoum is one of the nicest professors I've had so far. He's super helpful if you go see him during office hours and he gets super into his lectures. The only downside is that he has the hardest tests ever. His tests have little to do with what you learn in lecture and are very difficult.
4222,1324982,4.5,4.0,"Reading the textbook is a must, but you can scrape by with taking notes on the lectures (but really you should read the textbook). Make sure you have good lab partners because lab is a good chunk of the grade. His tests are free response, and they look for a thorough understanding of the concept, not just memorization of factsnumberspathways"
4223,1324982,5.0,4.0,Barsoum is awesome! There are clicker quizzes for practically every class so that can be a grade booster or grade sinker. He's a really nice man and he's ALWAYS helpful during office hours. You can keep asking until you understand and he won't be annoyed. His exams are pretty difficult -- they're all based on applying what you know. 
4224,1324982,4.0,2.0,"If you make an effort to understand and participate, you're likely to do well. Dr. Barsoum is a great guy, and I've heard he's a wonderful Bio 111 professor too. Take him if you get the chance!"
4225,1324982,4.5,3.0,Definitely my favorite professor at Davidson I never loved bio in high school but his class made me want to be a bio major. Great lecturer and super engaging helpful and passionate about the class and the material esp. in office hours.  Tests esp. the final are tough but I learned a ton and would definitely recommend his class to anyone
4226,1324982,4.0,4.0,"I thought the bio material was really easy, but Barsoum finds a way to make every test hard and ridiculous. I walked out always thinking I aced it, but I would end up with C's. He tests your ability to understand his unreasonable logic more than what you know. The article quizzes - no words. Lecture is enjoyable and he is really nice otherwise."
4227,1324982,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Barsoum is my favorite professor at Davidson. He is cool and always willing to help, even if it has nothing to do with biology. He's easy to get along with and talk to. I strongly recommend taking his classes!"
4228,1324982,3.0,5.0,"SUCH a hard class! Impossible to do well on the tests, and he doesn't even curve. Gives purposefully hard quizzes, and the only real opportunities to boost grades are through lab grades negligible clicker quizzes. Though he was very available during office hours, I struggled A LOT in this class."
4229,1324982,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Barsoum is a great teacher and person.  He makes lectures engaging and always answers questions fully.  Occasional pop quizzes ensures the class reviews notes daily, which is great.  He is helpful in lab and great in office hours when needed. If he does not know the answer to a question in class he will always email the student an answer later."
4230,1324982,5.0,2.0,"I love Dr. B! He is awesome in office hours and the lab is pretty simple. He great to work with and wants you to succeed! I would even suggest this class for non-bio majors, it's a fun and interesting way to complete the lab requirement. 3 test, weekly quizzes, and one large lab report. There is also a pig practical at the end."
4231,1324982,5.0,3.0,"Hands down the best professor I've had at Davidson in four years. Always ready to answer questions and meet outside of class. Very fair, and really passionate about teaching. I wish I had him freshman year; I would've been a BIO major."
4232,1324982,4.0,2.0,"Dr. B is a great teacher. His lectures are usually pretty interesting and he is really helpful during labs. Also, he's really accessible and cares about his students"
4233,1324982,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Barsoum is one of the nicest professors I've ever met, he is EXTREMELY accommodating and really wants his students to do well. That being said, his tests were deceptively challenging, especially because his lectures are so straight forward and easy to comprehend. I highly recommend his office hours, especially for lab reports."
4234,1945532,5.0,3.0,"Greg is a fantastic professor! As would be expected with WRI101, there is a lot of writing, but his feedback is always helpful. His lectures were always interesting and discussion based. I hope I will be able to take another class with him!"
4235,1945532,4.0,4.0,"Greg (as he tell students he doesn't mind being called) is a fantastic professor. While eccentric, he makes classes exciting and interesting. Homework was never too much, and if you put work into your papers your grade will be fine. Definitely plan on taking him again."
4236,1945532,3.0,5.0,He is nice but assignments are too hard.
4237,1945532,4.0,2.0,"Greg is a passionate, friendly and accessible professor. He was a fair grader for WRI101 and gave good feedback ."
4238,1945532,4.5,1.0,"Greg is very knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches. He loves to argue with students about the points they make, but keeps the lectures interesting.  Definitely an easy grader when it comes to papers, and really helpful in office hours."
4239,1945532,4.0,2.0,Greg is easily one of the most interesting people I've ever met. He knows what he's talking about and is genuinely excited to tell you about it. I never dreaded a class period or a grade. The music class I took with him was great for musicians and non-musicians alike.
4240,1945532,3.5,2.0,"Greg is one of the most interesting people I've ever met. This, coupled with the fact that he knows exactly what he's talking about made his class a joy. The music class I took with him is great for musicians and non-musicians alike."
4241,1945532,4.0,2.0,"Greg was really into what he was talking about, and he is really easy to relate to. The subject in 'Noise and Listening' as a Writing 101 was really abstract. "
4242,2097088,5.0,3.0,"Kind/helpful/witty. Unlimited office hours. Responds to emails within 12 hours. Open to help if you try to do problems on your own first. Tests straightforward and not ""creative"" or too tricky (similar to hw). Explains how/why. Ultimately wants you to learn and does whatever she can to achieve this goal. Taking Calc AB/BC  gives you advantage."
4243,2097088,4.0,3.0,"Not a bad teacher. Friendly lady. She is reasonably helpful in office hours and offers a lot of them. She is pretty clear in class, but I can't give her a 5 because she teaches straight out of the textbook. The assignments aren't easy or hard. Homework is straightforward (but takes a while), and tests really aren't bad, especially with studying."
4244,2097088,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Keough is a great professor. She is extremely good at explaining things, especially in office hours. Office hours are a must! Calc II was difficult, but Dr. Keough made it bearable. A lot of homework and difficult tests but overall not bad."
4245,2097088,5.0,4.0,"Professor Keough is awesome. She's kind, funny, and definitely knows her stuff. Unfortunately, Calculus II is still a brutal class and I probably would probably not take it again. Avoid Calc II, but definitely take Keough if you're going to do it #TeamKeough"
4246,2293698,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Baron is wonderful. He's very kind and willing to meet to discuss. His class is pretty easy, especially if you've taken something related to public health before. His passion and experience comes across in his lectures as well. Minimal assignments and they were graded fairly."
4247,2117580,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Backus is clearly passionate about environmental studies and puts forth the effort to give his students the best chance to succeed. In my personal opinion, his lectures sometimes move quickly and sometimes trivialize big, perhaps somewhat difficult concepts. Sometimes explanations or clarifications are confusing but overall he's an okay teacher"
4248,2117580,3.0,4.0,"This class has extremely hard reviews. You could study hours for them and still get a poor grade. Backus usually lectures in class. Some of his lectures are interesting and others don't make much sense. Overall, Backus is a nice person and is accessible outside of class for help, but he is a really hard grader and expects a lot from you."
4249,2117580,5.0,4.0,"I love Dr. Backus--he is my favorite professor at Davidson. He is laid back in class and really cares about his students. His reviews are tough, but generally fair. I have taken Climate Systems and Oceanography, and would highly recommend taking a class with him!"
4250,2117580,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Backus is a really funny professor, and makes topics really easy to understand. He's kind of soft-spoken, so sit near the front. Projects (mostly group projects) are not very stressful and tests are directly from the material--mostly lectures, less from the textbook.  He regularly brings food to class. Low-stress, high-quality prof overall"
4251,2613199,5.0,3.0,Great teacher always willing to help
4252,2613199,4.0,4.0,"Overall good professor, very nice and always available to meet 1-1 outside of class. Truetzel really cares about you doing well in class and understanding the material. However, I'd say elementary Latin is very difficult if you have never encountered the language before - and it is paced for people who have taken it in high school."
4253,2613203,5.0,2.0,"Professor Kaliski is one of the best I've ever had. Acting I serves as a nice introductory course, but even if you've been acting for a long time, you'll still gain knowledge. This class will force you to go outside your comfort zone, be vulnerable, and work with all your classmates to portray stories. Kaliski cares for his students, 10/10."
4254,2613203,5.0,2.0,"If Ain't What it Used to Be is offered for your WRI101 course, TAKE IT. Steve is very cool and laid-back. The class is engaging and fun and you will get an A if you show up and do the readings (all very short and interesting). Steve does not have bloated expectations for your work in the class -he is very reasonable. I enjoyed this class very much."
4255,2613203,3.0,1.0,"Kinda goofy, but a nice dude. I don't feel like a took much away from the class. It was fun. I had a good time, but I wish I would have learned more. I don't feel like a better actor. We also did some work on his play &quot;The Refugees,&quot; and I'm sorry, but it wasn't well-written. Hard to take him seriously at times. He seemed somewhat... unqualified?"
4256,2011092,2.0,4.0,Be prepared for LOTS of literature reading. He often gives assignments really close to the due dates and doesn't give very clear assignment details/instructions. The work load is immaculate for just a lit course that isn't directly related towards your major. Often stressed a lot because of this work load paired with my other classes (not bad @all)
4257,2011092,3.5,2.0,"Gives good feedback, but does not provide clear guidelines for assignments. Often told students of things that should be included much too close to the due date."
4258,2011092,5.0,4.0,"Great lectures but really stresses your involvement in them. Office hours are highly regarded as a good time to sit and break everything down. If he likes you, he will even stay past his office hours "
4259,1822683,1.5,3.0,Class was very unorganized and lectures were unclear. She never returned graded work and was rather vague about what she wanted in assignments. Lots of reading but little discussion about readings.
4260,1822683,4.5,2.0,"Great professor! She is very engaging,the class is interesting, and she is a fairly easy grader. Definitely recommend this as an elective course"
4261,1822683,4.5,2.0,"Great class and I learned a lot about anthropology. The first part of the class was very easy- only a creative short paper and midterm which we're fine if you gave some effort. The second part included reading two novels, doing fieldwork, writing a ethnographic paper and a essay-based take home final exam. Overall good class and very nice teacher."
4262,733156,2.0,4.0,"not many assignments, readings aren't bad but the second semester papers are time consuming and feel like busy work if you just want a history credit. historiography paper, book review, and final paper that requires tons of primary sources for no reason. great person, friendly but essays are a pain if you just want a requirement out of the way"
4263,733156,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Mangan's enthusiasm for latin american history is contagious. I am not a history fan and her love of the subject made me pay attention in class. Emphasis is on group work rather than lectures, which some people like and some people don't. We had 2 papers and a very large and time-consuming group project at the end of the semester."
4264,733156,5.0,2.0,I love Dr. Mangan. She is so passionate about Latin American history and she is very caring towards her students. The class is easy but pretty awkward. She beats group work into the ground and uses it in lieu of lecturing. It's incessant. Her tests are essentially primary source analysis that could be taken without taking the class.
4265,733156,4.0,3.0,Dr. Mangan is clearly excited to foster a collaborative environment amongst the students in CIS.
4266,733156,5.0,4.0,"Mangan is a real gem. Class was tough no doubt, shes a tough but very fair grader. Great feedback on papers. Some papers do have vague assignment criteria. Use office hours every chance you can get. Shes always more than willing to help. Did not have an interest in the material but took the class just for Mangans energy and passion for history."
4267,733156,2.0,5.0,"She gave us essays with unclear criteria and then graded them really harshly. She also gave us an enormous group project that took forever and that I ended up learning very little from. Overall, I didn't learn as much as I expected to and spent a lot of the class feeling frustrated."
4268,733156,5.0,3.0,Dr. Mangan is one of the best professors I've had at Davidson.  Class is a great balance between lecture and discussion and Dr. Mangan is an exceptional lecturer.  She's more than willing to provide help out of class and is a very fair grader.  Definitely would take a class with her again.
4269,733156,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Mangan is the most helpful professor I have ever had at Davidson. If you put in the effort she will meet you halfway grade-wise. She is a gem in the Davidson History Department for sure. I would definitely recommend taking a class from Dr. Mangan, even if it is your first history class."
4270,733156,4.0,4.0,"Great professor! Very nice and very helpful. I came in completely unprepared for a course like this but she helped me and others through it. The essays were graded as first and final drafts and she graded a bit tough, but that only encouraged improvement. She's fun, I'd suggest taking her."
4271,733156,4.0,4.0,Prof Mangan was so great. She's very knowledgeable about Latin America and her lectures were easy to listen to and interesting. She is very available outside of class and is also just a really nice person.
4272,733156,5.0,4.0,Very clear that this teacher has passion about her work.  Very interesting yet organized lecture style. Tough grader but very helpful outside of class. I also really enjoyed her selection of texts for this class. One of the best.
4273,733156,4.5,5.0,"this class was really tough, but to her credit, she is a great teacher and lecturer. she is very helpful outside of class. i was worried i was going to fail, i really only took the class to fulfill a requirement and wasn't interested at all. she gives A LOT of reading. the only thing that kept me in the class was seeing her during office hours."
4274,733156,5.0,3.0,"Mangan's office hours are sooo useful, go to them for papers. She gives great lectures and her tests are hard but extremely fair. She makes amazing outlines of her lectures before the class...use them!"
4275,733156,4.5,3.0,"How awesome is she&#63;  Good lectures, always available to help during office hours, wants to hear how you're doing, and not that hard a grader if you work a bit.  Definitely take a class from her!"
4276,1189866,2.0,4.0,"I thought his focus on primary sources would make the class more interesting, but the way he goes about trying facilitate discussion just doesn't work and neither does his lecture style. The readings are long and not all necessary. I took Modern Russian to get a distribution requirement out of the way. It will definitely be my last history class. "
4277,1189866,3.0,3.0,"Needed to get a distribution requirement out of the way, but I'm actually glad I took the class. He assigns a lot of reading, but it's not too hard to make a B+ without doing most of it. He doesn't seem to grade too harshly, and every now and again he can be funny. Allows rewrites and extensions on papers. Overall, not  a bad class to take. "
4278,1189866,4.0,3.0,TPK expects a lot and his lectures are a little slow. But he's helpful and approachable
4279,1189866,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I have had at Davidson. His lectures and discussions are just asking us about what the main points of the book are. His grading is completely arbitrary. Office hours are a joke. He is of no help and will tell you what you should've done . . . even if that is what you did. He is always right, and you are always wrong. Avoid him."
4280,1189866,1.0,5.0,TPK is a horrible teacher - one of the worst I've ever had. He's unclear in lecture and office hours are useless. I would leave class not knowing what we had talked about. A's almost impossible. Avoid at all costs.
4281,1189866,1.5,4.0,"Doesn't make much sense when he is speaking. He attempts to be helpful with lots of office hours, but when you actually go to his office, he is unclear and you get nothing out of it."
4282,1189866,1.5,4.0,Class material would have been interesting if I could understand any of the lectures. Very confusing. Grading feels arbitrary.
4283,1189866,3.5,3.0,"His lectures aren't terribly exciting, but the books are solid and there is some discussion. Gave a pretty low percentage of A's on papers and tests."
4284,1189866,5.0,1.0,"I liked this class, but the fact that I took this class in high school, and with the same book, made this class too easy for me. There is A LOT of reading, mostly primary sources, but I didn't pay too much attention to them and I did fine. A good class and great teacher. Majors may find it too easy."
4285,2056172,2.0,4.0,"In Medieval Europe, Professor Kabala was a very nice and approachable guy and clearly passionate about the material. However, the workload and expectations were often heavy and unclear. He did not return grades in a timely manner at all. I was not expecting this to be an easy course, but this class was unnecessarily difficult and time-consuming."
4286,2056172,2.0,3.0,I took this class thinking it would be fairly easy however that is not the case. He moved way to fast jumping from chapter to chapter only giving us a few days to understand massive amounts of information. Also his quizzes and projects are highly unfair. The difference in difficulty between homework/ class work and quizzes and projects are insane!!
4287,2056172,5.0,3.0,"Awesome prof, super interesting course. Super helpful in office hours. Definitely one of the easiest classes for the Data Science minor."
4288,2056172,5.0,2.0,"An awesome guy. Truly cares about his field and appreciates when students do the same. Amazing during office hours, which you'll actually need in this class. You learn a ton and do quite a bit of work, but it's all really easy. The review that says this class is difficult is flat out wrong. Get him to like your project group, I'd really recommend."
4289,2056172,5.0,3.0,"Taking Dr. Kabala's course ""Central Europe in the Middle Ages"" was a fascinating experience. I was instantly drawn to this course because of the general lack of medieval history courses at Davidson, and my fond interest in the subject. Needless to say Dr. Kabala is an amazing professor and person. He had my class over for lunch during finals!"
4290,2056172,3.0,3.0,"Took DIG101 thinking it'd be an easy A, got reading long ass papers and 5 labs instead. His lectures are super long and boring and he mumbles a lot making it even harder to follow. He will get mad at you if you don't pay attention and correct every single grammatical error you've made on the blog posts which are described as low key informal (?!). "
