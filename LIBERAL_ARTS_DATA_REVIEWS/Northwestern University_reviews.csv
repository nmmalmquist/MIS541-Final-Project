0,2156545,2.0,4.0,"The instructor is, essentially, not involved in this class; it is self-directed learning.  She grades harshly, and unlike almost all grad professors, she will fail you.  She's unable to use IT well (or won't), is defensive, and makes no apparent effort to create or foster any interest in the topic in students.  She sticks out as low quality at NU."
1,2390018,5.0,4.0,"Really sweet prof, effective teacher. Tests and quizzes are sort of an unusual format and take some getting used to, lots of fill in the blank/either-or. Definitely recommend for bio!"
2,2390018,5.0,4.0,"Professor Mcdonough, You're of the kindest, most endearing and memorable professor's at Northwestern. I hope everyone be privy to your passion in teaching and understanding several realms of biology. You truly are a gem, rather an asset to the biology department. You are the best!"
3,1144840,5.0,4.0,"This class was really interesting and Professor Rapp teaches really well. He's so engaged and interested in what he's discussing, and he's genuinely interested in making sure the student understand everything as well. It's also cool that he's a teacher and researcher (and great at both), because he has a very practical understanding of the subject."

5,2633746,5.0,2.0,"Theo teaches concepts and then teaches you how to teach yourself. The truly important part is his teaching you to, when you run up against a problem, how to troubleshoot and find answers. Lets face it, you aren't always going to have a guru to ask for help. He teaches you how to NOT need him at the end. That all by itself is worth gold."
6,2633746,5.0,2.0,"I very much enjoyed having Theo as an instructor. He was the replacement for our original Instructor, so he really had to pick up a lot of pieces. He is knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I would prefer him to have given more firm opinions but I understand his apprehensiveness. 

I think Theo is the kind of teacher whose students advance."
7,2633746,5.0,4.0,"Theo was very helpful outside of class, he cares very much about his students, and he is very knowledgeable on math and data science. He always came prepared for his lectures and was very engaging with students. I would highly recommend Theo as your professor. "
8,2633746,5.0,1.0,"Amazing professor! He explains even hard topics the most easy and understandable way, always respectful and polite, all the lectures are well-created, very visual and fun, feedbacks are detailed and to the point. "
9,2633746,5.0,4.0,"Theo teaches very fluent and nice . he answers all the questions and covers lecture deck, and shares so many useful information about future careers related to the course."
10,2633746,5.0,2.0,Fantastic charisma and knowledge of the material. Able to convey essential points during a fast paced bootcamp style class.
11,2633746,4.0,1.0,great professor. very interactive. Tries to give answers to all questions.
12,2633746,5.0,5.0,Theo expects your best efforts. You will learn more than you thought you would.  Be willing to do the work and stretch yourself.  You will be pleased you did.  He is encouraging and supportive.
13,2633746,5.0,2.0,He respects his students and I do enjoy his ability to deliver tough content with some humor and always sheds a light at the end of the tunnel. He teaches for understanding. 
14,2633746,5.0,1.0,"Theo was my Instructor at Rice University Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. He is very knowledgeable, articulates clearly  and great at what he does. I will recommend him anytime and would love to take his course over and over again. 
Charles"
15,2633746,5.0,1.0,Theo is an excellent teacher and person who cares if his students do well. He is great at explaining concepts and is well articulated and it's easy to understand him. 
16,2633746,5.0,4.0,"Excellent lectures and amazing guidance on projects required for this coursework. Overall, I had a wonderful learning from this course with Theo Khayat."
17,2633746,5.0,4.0,Theo is an awesome instructor! Really excited about the materials and topics covered. He'll go out of his way to make sure you understand a concept or problem you might encounter
18,2633746,5.0,5.0,Theo is great! He is real in the way he teaches and makes very difficult material easy to understand. He is kind also. I would highly recommend taking any of his courses and working hard because you will learn a lot.
19,2633746,4.0,4.0,"Great communicator. Theo is very easy to get along, pretty accessible and humble. He is quite knowledgeable about the topics and is hands-on."
20,2633746,5.0,5.0,"Theo is very knowledgeable! He knows so much about so much. He is very caring in his delivery of the content and helping everyone succeed. He is very respectful and can answer around this topic. He really is amazing. Any of my struggles was not a reflection on him, it is a reflection on me and my learning style. Tough course in tough times."
21,2633746,5.0,4.0,"You can tell Theo really loves teaching, he is very knowledgeable on every subject and you can tell he is passionate on what he teaches and offers great advice to the students. If I had the chance to take another certificate program, I would not hesitate to take him again."
22,2633746,5.0,3.0,"Theo is great! He is super smart and passionate about Data Science and also you can tell he loves teaching, responded to a million questions with a smile and always trying to help. Very approachable, kind and caring. Classes were clear and well paced. My only suggestion would be explain the thought process for activities, not just solved examples."
23,2633746,5.0,4.0,Theo is a positive resource with a broad set of skills that are useful to students. Theo is humble and respects any level of question. He also will help find answers to any unique questions that he hasn't heard before. Theo will give you as much time as you need to grasp a topic and is eager to help out in office hours.
24,2633746,5.0,4.0,"Theo is well spoken, very knowledgeable in the industry, always willing to spend time with his students, and made the hours of lecture easy to listen to. Also, Theo is simply just a super nice person at all times and never missed a class. It was a long class over 24 weeks and it certainly was money well spent!"
25,2701340,1.0,3.0,"Professor cancelled half of her lectures, was always unprepared, and gave vague answer to questions from student. Rude and obnoxious, ego driven professor. Avoid at all costs."
26,2701340,1.0,4.0,"The absolute worst professor in the Northwestern MSDS program. Unorganized, rude to students, and unhelpful. Lot of reading and no instruction. Her class is a joke and she is the saltiest person i had to deal with in a grad program."
27,1230884,3.0,4.0,"great textbook and supplementary materials. dry lectures. overall, best prof for 311"
28,1798198,5.0,5.0,Professor Williams is the best.
29,1798198,5.0,5.0,Gail is the best. Hands down.
30,2041911,3.5,2.0,"Very knowledgeable on the subject matter - Networking Needs a better understanding on how to be a professor and ""teach"" the course material.  Feels students should Google and learn how to work in real world  No feedback on homework. Does not grade homeworkassignments in a timely manner Very nice personality and is available to help if asked"
31,2351161,5.0,3.0,great
32,2351161,4.0,3.0,You have to study a lot but there is usually no homework. Erin is super sweet and tries to make class as fun as possible.
33,1679417,1.0,5.0,"I had Zatta for Classics and the Cinema in Fall 2012. The quality of her instruction was extremely poor: her English is very bad, she does not engage the class, does not encourage critical thinking and the course structure was non-existent. This could have been a great course with a different instructor."
34,2086975,1.5,4.0,It's really ridiculous for a International professor are not friendly with International students. 
35,2390094,2.0,5.0,"The professor is not answering emails, you will be talking to yourself. "
36,2390094,2.0,5.0,You can ask her a question and she will tell you word for word off the power point orrr she will over explain herself where you are completely lost.
37,2390094,5.0,3.0,"Professor Avivi -Reich is an incredible Professor , Ive never met anyone who would dedicate so much effort and time to students . Took her class during the crazy pandemic semester and she went above and beyond for us , provided as much time as we needed to understand the material . The amount of energy and caring she provides is unmatchable !"
38,2390094,1.0,3.0,"The entire course consists of summarizing a textbook chapter every week. Something you could get for $1800 less by reading the book yourself. The assignment prompts are incredibly vague, so you don't know what she wants. Then she'll dock you for missing a minute detail you didn't consider important. Very disappointing excuse for a class."
39,159823,1.0,5.0,"JUST DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME this is simply not worth it. He solves one problem (out of exam questionnaire for 40 min, ends up with the wrong answer, does 5-6 mistakes on the way. THOUGH, he gives 4 problems (as long as I've mentioned and 3 open questions and only one hour to go on the exam. I wonder if he would pass his own test?))))"
40,159823,5.0,3.0,Really great professor!
41,159823,3.5,4.0,"Lectures are excellent; great sense of humor. He explains complex material simply, with good demos. Skipping lecture = not a good grade on exams. He gives extra credit opportunities. If you want a good grade, pay attention, read the text, do the homework, and learn the material! Labs are easy if you prepare and know the material."
42,159823,1.0,5.0,Don't even waste your time taking College Physics with Professor Schmidt.  His lectures are totally useless and will only confuse.  There is no order or structure to how he solves problems so you can't follow.  He doesn't respond to emails and he took off on a sailing trip for 1/2 of the class! This was the worst instructor that I've ever had.
43,159823,1.5,4.0,"He's not really that helpful, his lectures are reallllly bad and the exams are ridiculous.  The material is relatively easy but he blindsides you on tests with with stuff you've never seen before.  Also, he can't teach.  At all.  Seriously."
44,159823,5.0,4.0,"Go to his office hours and just learn the stuff thoroughly.  If he mentions something briefly in lecture learn it tight, part of his tests are pulling up little details, this separates A from B students.  His tests are short and if he only tested major concepts everyone would get A's and then who would be the Chiropractors&#63;"
45,159823,1.0,4.0,"Awful communicator. Lectures are terribly disorganized. He reads from old notes and loses focus and direction frequently. Exams are tough, but curved. The labs for this class are ridiculous, and the lab manual is a riddle. Don't take this class with Schmidt. You have been warned."
46,159823,1.5,5.0,LECTURES ARE USELESS. Tests are not comprised of lectures or homework. Just frustrating.
47,159823,1.5,5.0,"It would have been nice, if at least what were we told would be on the exam was on the exams, instead of stuff that had barely been mentioned in lecture."
48,159823,1.5,4.0,"just disappointing.  given his glowing rep, you'd think the man'd be able to teach.  oops!  guess we were punked!"
49,159823,5.0,1.0,No Comments
50,159823,4.5,4.0,He's pretty funny and helpful except his exam's harder.  You will really have to understand the material to ace his exam.
51,159823,5.0,2.0,"Art Schmidt is a great professor.  Always available to help, you just have to ask.  Sit down with him - he can be hysterical.  Considering he teaches Physics, he is pretty easy.  If you're going to take Physics, take it with him, he's the only way to go."

54,2678864,1.0,4.0,"Decently nice person but awful professor. The instruction was shoddy and unclear. The assignments were extremely vague and badly made, and she clearly has an expectation for what the actual right answers are regardless of the lack of specificity. Then, when students do the assignment technically accurate to the vaguenes of the assignment, bad grade"
55,888911,5.0,5.0,"Fantastic professor to learn organic chemistry from! Organized, funny, and extremely helpful outside of class. Trzupek writes some seriously hard exams but the foundation for orgo that you get from making it through his class is priceless. He prepares you for the whole sequence phenomenally well!"
56,888911,4.0,4.0,"Trzupek is a great lecturer and a patient, helpful teacher. Go to his group help sessions or office hours if you have questions. The only downside is that Trzupek's tests are difficult. "
57,888911,5.0,1.0,Lawrence is a gr9 teacher get it like gr8 but with a 9 hahaha but really Lawrence is the man you go Lawrence 
58,888911,5.0,5.0,"Larry's the best! I loved his humor and his genuine willingness to help. He's one of my favorite profs at NU, but one of my least fav testers. All in all I'd take his class again."
59,888911,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Trzupek is AWESOME! Orgo is a really tough class, and his exams are hard, but he is always willing to help and is probably as clear as it gets when explaining chemistry. Wouldn't want to take the class with anybody else!"
60,888911,5.0,4.0,"The best teacher ever! He is super organized, fun, nice, and funny. I would never want to take orgo with any other professor"
61,888911,5.0,4.0,No Comments
62,888911,5.0,4.0,"OK, I figured I'd post my review here since Trzupek has left Furman to go back to Chicago.... that won't change his teaching. Thoroughly organized, clear lecturer who very clearly knows his stuff. Tests are hard, but fair, and doable if you've reviewed your notes. Watch out for flying chalk. You gained a great prof when he left us at Furman."
63,159835,5.0,3.0,best class ever. he is really helpful outside class too
64,159835,5.0,4.0,this guy's amazing. take his class
65,159835,5.0,3.0,Probably the best prof at NU. Take any class you can. You won't be disappointed.
66,159835,5.0,1.0,"BAD TEACHER.  DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES!!!  Just kidding, What a neat teacher."
67,159835,5.0,1.0,Very neat.

69,159835,4.5,3.0,Looks like Thomas Gibson from  Dharma and Greg  and is bilingual!  Nothing is quite like him speaking in Spanish.  Great class too!
70,2242656,5.0,3.0,These classes can be long but Ashley made them fun and bearable.
71,2242656,5.0,3.0,"Great TA. She is so entertaining, makes the material interesting, and really just wants to make sure that her students learn and understand."
72,2037873,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Waas is the best professor that I had ever seen before, he is reliable and responsible. And he definitely will stand on the students' side to think."
73,2037873,5.0,4.0,Nice and responsible professor who have passion in helping students to find their real job. Not a typical teacher who teach u with textbook and give u exam depending on the book. All the project is related to real business and help u go through the hand on experience.
74,2037873,1.0,2.0,Provides no feedback on assignments Does not provide clear communication Does not put any effort into teaching the course Did not learn any numerical finance - Google and wrote papers each week on IT related topices.
75,2037879,3.5,3.0,Knows the subject matter Fair grader - watch your grammar & spelling (will reduce points) Contributions - Online discussions req Available to help and response timely Course is taught reading chapters in a book and short videos - Would have been nice to have lectures to learn from her vast knowledge Would have like more feedback on assignments
76,1689729,5.0,1.0,"Awesome professor.  Best ever.  Really smart, personable, engaging and helpful.  I learned from her class."
77,2678934,5.0,3.0,"So inspiring, caring, and supportive. Highly reccommend."
78,477340,1.0,3.0,Dismissive and really made completing the lab sequence difficult for me.
79,477340,5.0,4.0,"Great guy, fantastic professor, really knows biology in a special sort of way I can only describe by example: he had us working as undergraduates in a now extremely popular field before most people knew how big it would become. Always around for office ours and to chat, you should take him!"
80,477340,4.5,5.0,Dude hes awesome. Just watch out for bad jokes.
81,477340,3.0,4.0,"Dr. M is very laid back and cool, but make ridiculous tests and quizzes and is unwilling to budge on grades (I was 1.5 points aways from a B- and he refused to give it to me). Class is a waste of time because he flies through his lecture slides and tests you on the entire book- every week is like finals week."
82,477340,2.5,4.0,"He wants to help and he wants to be clear, but it just doesn't come out that way.  His quizzes were ridiculous.  I had no idea what they were asking and I did read all the material."
83,477340,1.0,5.0,"Worst lectures, worst tests.  The man lectures like he's on speed, and he usually can't answer it if someone does manage to squeeze a question in there.  His tests are ridiculous and poorly phrased.  He wanted to be a doctor, but he's not, so he's taking it out on his students."
84,2150568,1.0,5.0,"Her weekly posts and content show how good she is at writing research papers. She expects everyone to write as per the expectations. Good luck with your writing!  Helping out students is not very good, even after they explicitly request it."
85,2150568,2.0,5.0,"She likes to write, that is obvious just by reading her weekly lectures - long and borderline rambling. Problem is she wants to turn all her students into professional writers. Hope you like to write!  Also, not enough live demos demonstrating and showing the experiments she wants for the assignments. A whole lot of telling and not enough showing."
86,2150568,1.0,3.0,"This is the most miserable course I've taken in the MSDS program by far. Instead of going over technical knowledge, she spent 90% of time going over how to draft and finalize a final paper. 85% of grading is based on both paper assignments. If you dreamed of practicing your paper skill, you are in the right class."
87,2150568,4.0,4.0,"MSPA Time Series Class - If you are the type of person that needs a structured class, with everyone working on the same data sets, solving the same problems, dont take this class.  Professor Maren makes you select a data set that is relevant to you for all you time series work.  Everyone works on different data."
88,2007212,1.0,4.0,"The most unfair person ever known. If you disagree with him, he will never admit that you are correct and he is very stubborn with what he thought is correct. He treats students differently."
89,1882295,1.0,5.0,"Super hard, no extra credit, doesn't follow the syllabus !! DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS"
90,1882295,1.0,5.0,"No extra credit, final is super hard. Must buy and read the book, his lectures are confusing and not based on the book. He yelled at me for being 5 minutes late, infront of the class. "
91,1882295,1.0,5.0,"Hard on grading, VERY BORING. Better off with a different instructor. He doesn't have his masters yet! "
92,1882295,1.0,5.0,You are better off reading the book by yourself. This professor will confuse you instead of teaching. You have been warned.
93,1882295,1.0,5.0,DOnt ever take his class.. you will regret it
94,1882295,2.0,5.0,"Worst teacher ever! makes fun of you. have no respect for others. dont care about helping you , tries to be funny. No one in the class likes him"
95,1841342,4.5,2.0,Good course wasn''t many students but prof tried his best and was great.
96,1841342,5.0,2.0,I took his computational geometry class and he was wonderful. His slides were thorough enough and sufficient if you remain attentive in the class. Homeworks are easy and his teaching is clear enough. His grading is also lenient. I recommend his classes to everyone.
97,999622,4.0,4.0,"As I stated in my other rating, Professor Elzbieta Foeller-Pituch is 100% worth talking if you actually want to learn something and improve your writing."
98,999622,5.0,4.0,"Professor Foeller-Pituch is indeed a difficult grader, but that is because she genuinely cares about improving the writing of her students. Her classes are lecture/class discussion based, and the atmosphere only becomes forced when she is trying to prompt responses from students who have clearly come unprepared. She is insightful. She cares. A+."
99,999622,1.5,5.0,Often seemed flustered and unprepared for class.  Asked very leading questions which made discussion awkward and forced.  She also assumed students knew a great deal of historical knowledge.  Also not afraid to call students out in class / embarrass them into participation.  Not a great classroom atmosphere
100,999622,1.0,4.0,Take a class with her and get ready for interminable blathering. She doesn't put as much thought or work into class but expects a lot from her students.  She doesn't return ANYTHING so you're left in the dark about where you stand. Worthless professor. Avoid!!!
101,1112264,1.5,1.0,"This professor has students he likes and those he does not – is you are the latter do not bother to go to class. Insecure aging professor who should not be teachings in a leading school. Everything is prepared before class, even the dry jokes."
102,1112264,2.0,1.0,Makes stuff up when he answers question.  Very erratic way of running a classroom.
103,1112264,5.0,2.0,No Comments
104,1906895,1.0,5.0,"He regards ""his"" stronger students as if they were his rivals."
105,1906895,1.0,5.0,He doesn't take his work seriously.
106,1120463,3.0,5.0,"Yes, he is not the nicest person in the world.. but nobody says anything to him because he's really THAT talented. He catches every single detail and doesn't let mistakes go. I have a lot of respect for him.. but if I didn't I probably didn't take this class. He can get very.. mean.."
107,1120463,3.0,4.0,"A good conductor but a bad teacher. If you want to listen to his sacarsm and being insulted or got mad at, join the NUSO. Rehearsals are dull. Excusing people from rehearsals are handled case by case, that means he may not excuse you for any reason if he does not like you. He just concerned about his own performance and achievement, NOT YOU!"
108,825570,3.0,5.0,"His lectures were very good but his assignments were very difficult and the was not available outside of the office hours, which was not in my timezone.  It was difficult to find other students to try to collaborate with as well.  He does everything directly from the book, review some of the questions at the end of the chapter to prep for the final"
109,825570,5.0,5.0,Akkawi was one of my best teachers.
110,825570,5.0,4.0,I was able to utilize the concepts taught in this class immediately in my professional career. Dr. Akkawi is an enthusiastic faculty member and he shows concern for the student's need to learn the content.
111,825570,5.0,5.0,Dr. Akkawi was a master of the material and did a good job of presenting. The video recordings are a little outdated with the resolution but the content has a wealth of knowledge.
112,825570,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed this course, because it challenged me more than any other course I have taken so far. Akkawi was extremely helpful and available outside of class. He also put up extra materials on Canvas which was very helpful for us to understand the material and get ready for the exam."
113,825570,5.0,5.0,I found Professor Akkawi to be really willing to help students and I appreciated the amount of time and effort he put into the class.
114,825570,5.0,4.0,"I wouldn't say he's hard, but he does challenge you, which is good as that is how you learn. Homework was especially challenging at times. Provides weekly lectures and if you follow them and take good notes, you'll do good. No surprises - final was similar to homework. Advice on final: speed is essential. Work fast or you won't finish in time."
115,825570,1.0,3.0,"I had a 98% entering the Final; which consisted of 4 problems. He awarded me a 50%, even though the answers were identical to previous work that had received a 98% . When I called him, he said that on the Final he &quot;awarded 1/3 of the class a 100%, 1/3 a 75% and 1/3 a 50%.&quot; He threatened six of us with an F if we reported him to the administration."
116,825570,1.0,4.0,Bad explainer and comes off as arrogant. Avoid if possible.
117,825570,2.0,4.0,"He doesn't give much feedback on your homework, so you have no idea what you did wrong. the assignments can be fun, only if you had prior dealings with networking. but if you haven't you might end up doing assignments for 7+ hours and looking up youtube tutorials for help, as he doesn't offer much. plus, they don't even help you study for the final"
118,825570,2.0,4.0,"Homework assignments are graded lightly, so when you take the final which is much harder you will score low.  He is difficult to get help from and the course concepts are more difficult to master than other classes.  He only knows how to explain the concept one way, so if you do not follow you will need to figure it out on your own.  Take alone."
119,825570,1.5,4.0,"The professor is also the Director of the program which makes me question whether or not I want to continue in the program. I have already told many of my co-workers to  look elsewhere. The professor is not helpful, lectures are prerecorded, confusing and outdated. He doesn't offer weekly sync sessions. Overall he is kind of lazy. "
120,825570,5.0,4.0,Great teacher and communicator.  He is always making sure students understand database software and design.  Highly recommend Dr. Faisal Akkawi.
121,825570,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Akkawi is knowledgeable and his classes are very interesting. That said, there is generally lot of background work and reading if you want to make most out of the class and learn. But he manages to generate interest in the subject and is one of my best professors I came across."
122,825570,1.5,4.0,"Had him for Database Systems and Design. He's friendly and charismatic, but an awful teacher. Lectures were unorganized, the book was seldom referenced and of almost no help. Extremely frustrating class. I got an A, but learned little. Kind of terrifying that he's the director of the whole program at Northwestern."
123,825570,3.0,4.0,"He is a great speaker and always neat and groomed. He knows how to act in the front of class. But he is very average teacher. His class would be a good recap for people with database knowledge, but very complex for new students. He is the boss and can allow himself to be an average instructor in a school with a good name."
124,825570,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher, need to follow with classes, gives good directions for homework but you have to do it perfectly otherwise he takes off a lot of points for mistakes."
125,825570,1.0,5.0,"I don't know how this guy teaches at all- he has no teaching skills and his class is impossible to comprehend. I have spoken to many people in class, and everyone (including the people with the Database background) are frustrated with him. He needs to step down and hire a good teacher. I will avoid him from now on."
126,825570,5.0,1.0,He is great and helpful. Easy to follow his explanation and he answers your questions
127,825570,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Akkawi is an excellent communicator, resourceful and knowledgeable beyond the information covered in his course."
128,825570,5.0,4.0,"This teacher is great, I noticed everyone who didn't think it was okay to take weeks off of school passed and everyone who thought it was okay to skip class didnt graduate the class. this professor is very well recognized as top notch"
129,825570,1.0,5.0,"Worst class ever with this Prof! In my college, this class was my ONLY &quot;C&quot;. No idea what the hell he was teaching. It's a waste of time sitting in his class."
130,825570,3.0,5.0,"He's funny and definately has a sense of humor.  I didn't understand much of the class ( at RMU in Chicago).  His exams are extremely hard and because he doesn't use the book there is very little to help with studying.  He is extremely intellegent, but I wouldn't take his class again."
131,825570,4.5,5.0,Perfect Faculty.
132,825570,4.5,5.0,An excellent prof. He cares a lot about the students and you will learn about Database design and implementation.
133,825570,1.5,3.0,"terribly unorganized, lectures didn't make sense, wastes a lot of time answering silly questions"
134,825570,1.0,3.0,The worst
135,825570,4.5,4.0,"good communication skills, very helpful"
136,825570,4.0,3.0,"Very good assignments. Exams are tough. Class requires a lot of practice. Overall, lectures are great and you learn a lot from the class."
137,825570,1.5,4.0,"What a debacle! Confusing & confused, unprepared for class, examples and assignments didn't make sense. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything this guy is teaching. Just because you have a PhD doesn't mean you have lecturing/people skills. Get it together man!"
138,159980,5.0,4.0,Here's the thing:  if he's your teacher for 233 the class is hard because it's hard material and it's a lot of people's first time learning it-Peshkin is sometimes abrupt and intimidating but at the end of the day you can tell he really cares about us learning!!
139,159980,4.0,4.0,"Professor Peshkin might seem indifferent or annoyed, but he really does care about his students. He wants people to learn and his strategy involves a lot of work on the student's end. This was my second class with him, and knowing that he expects students to be independent and learn by doing really helps."
140,159980,1.0,5.0,Disturbing
141,159980,4.5,3.0,"Course requirements are demanding, and Professor's personality initially seems abrupt or impatient, but classroom instruction is excellent and I learned a lot."

Lots of material covered and lots of homework since online class. No lectures; you mostly learn on your own. Weekly &quot;Office Hours&quot; to provide road map for the week and Q&amp;A."

Everyone in the course LOVES her. If you get the change to learn from her, do it! This particular course grade is made up of 5 test grades."
157,162061,4.5,3.0,Professor Murphy is one of the most inspirational and passionate people I have ever encountered. He inspires his students to care about the world and the material he teaches. He appreciates it when students invest time and effort into their papers. He is flexible on deadlines as long as you put effort and care into your assignments.

164,162063,3.0,4.0,Is great for a student really interested in Anthropology. Is very informative and knows what he's talking about. For someone taking class for credit- not recommended. A lot of tangents and course matter is challenging
165,162063,4.5,2.0,He tends to get off topic sometimes but his interest for teaching this cource is amazing and his stories will make you chuckle now and then.

171,192784,4.5,3.0,It was okay if you did your weekly facebook posts and kept up on readings. Def learned a lot and recommend this class!
172,192784,5.0,3.0,Great prof. Can't recommend her highly enough.
173,192784,4.5,4.0,Prof Enteen was the highlight of my class schedule. She assigns a midterm essay (5-7pages) and a final research paper (10-12 pages) and you must contribute weekly to online postings through facebook. I never thought I'd rethink my notions of Gender and Sexuality within the context of the Asian Diaspora. Definitely take her for any classes.
174,192784,5.0,4.0,She gets you thinking in different ways. It's well worth taking any of her classes.
175,192784,4.0,5.0,"learned a ton, worked a lot, and she definitely changed my thinking!"
176,192784,1.5,4.0,there are better profs to take this class with.
177,192784,3.5,4.0,Enteen is a stellar prof.  Take anything she teaches.
178,192784,5.0,3.0,Enteen is AWESOME!
179,192784,5.0,3.0,Definitely deserving of her chilli pepper status.

184,2554135,1.0,3.0,This class is a joke of a Python course. You can find better content online through multiple sources. Weekly assignment were written by another professor and the code was very poor quality using constant improper techniques. Naive approaches taken in all the helper code. Professor Ott also has no idea how to code nor answer tech question. Such a FJ
185,2554135,1.0,4.0,"I do not recommend this professor. He was very disorganized. He arbitrarily changed the date of the first class, which conflicted with other classes. When he did hold the first class, he couldn't continue because of tech issues. He promised to post recorded session; when he did, there was no sound. I decided to drop and get a refund."
186,1804575,5.0,2.0,"Professor Chen is an adjunct professor, but he is better in teaching than most of the full time faculty members here."
187,481570,1.5,4.0,She is not a good teacher and she not that nice either.   Avoid if you can.
188,481570,1.0,5.0,Avoid at all costs!
189,481570,2.0,5.0,"Her class is like hearing her textbook read aloud - and her tests are often not based on anything but what she feels like writing when she creates them. You better know the topic inside and out, and even then you'll be lucky to come out with a C."
190,481570,1.0,5.0,"she's horrible person and not really a good professor. Although she thinks she's greater than she really is, don't be fooled by her pretense...Her class is like listening to her text book she writes same things over and over again."

193,481571,3.0,3.0,"Interesting professor, although I don't really care for the fact that he wrote ALL FOUR of our textbooks, so we really only heard his subjective viewpoints (Also the books costed almost $300)."
194,481571,4.0,2.0,"Dr. McAdams wrote a fantastic book: &quot;Stories We Live By.&quot;  IF you can take a course where he discusses this book, that is your best bet. He is VERY clear about developmental theories, but truly enjoys discussing his research.  He does come off a bit cocky and you can't disagree with his findings without getting the eye."

196,1524005,5.0,3.0,"Dennis is the absolute best. Straightforward class, well-divided between lecture and interactive examples. He embodies ""chill:"" never seen him not calm, cool, and helpful, and he turns mistakes into constructive lessons. This man loves Organic Chem, but understands that you don't. Never condescending. I wouldn't doubt that he can fly either."
197,1524005,5.0,1.0,"Amazing, most brilliant and brightest graduate student!"
198,2390310,5.0,3.0,"I have taken 3 classes from him so far. The class workload is balanced, you will definitely want to do some reading and research online which are expected of a graduate-level student. Prof. Abbott is very approachable and he provides good feedbacks and at the same time challenges you into diving deeper into the subjects."
199,409900,3.0,4.0,"Pretty interesting class. It's mandatory for a film major. If you're looking for an easy distro, you're in the wrong class. You learn a lot about media and modernity. Class is taught lecture style, so can get a little dry sometimes."
200,409900,2.0,1.0,"More interested in being &quot;the cool guy&quot; than anything else, but its weird because he never remembers anyone's name.  I'm a senior and have had like 5 classes with him and he is so not interetsed in students.  Likes to hear himself talk."
201,409900,5.0,2.0,Changed my life.

211,160049,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bailey is a very nice professor and seems intent on helping his student succeed by being accessible, providing many resources, and explaining concepts thoroughly. His Intro to Stats class (taken online) was actually really enjoyable and interesting! He easily breaks down topics so they are more digestible, and makes it easy to do well."
212,160049,2.0,4.0,"No chance to truly test if you understand the material, you find out with the final but then it is too late to try to fix what you don't truly know. Homeworks do not match what to expect from the final."

Even though I found some of his attitudes...surprising, he based them in well designed research. And he's a heck of a nice guy. He does sometimes throw some tricky wording into his test questions, through. Watch out."
217,160049,5.0,4.0,"Mike is fun and quite interestesting, take his class"
218,160049,4.0,2.0,"He's not a bad guy, don't believe the hype. He takes the time to make sure his students learn."
219,160049,1.5,3.0,"Bailey really sucks....his research is biased and not conducted correctly, yet he makes assumptions that would imply he has a large n and no biases....really terrible prof. Don't take his class!!!!!"
220,160049,3.0,3.0,Hated being a lab rat for the department as part of the introduction to psych class.  Found it unethical.
221,160049,5.0,1.0,"Professor Bailey explained the content of the mateiral clearly and had his best interet in all students to benefit from the class. It involves hard work, reading textbook and showing up to class daily. His class is interesting and at the same time can be fun learning new mateiral. It's a fun experie"
222,160049,1.0,1.0,"A horrible, unethical teacher. It's a shame he's so popular...but when you have incredibly easy to cheat on tests, then that is no surprise."

224,160049,1.5,1.0,sux
225,160049,4.5,3.0,Bailey is a fantastic prof. His class is enjoyable and he's always willing to meet outside of class time to help.
226,160049,2.0,2.0,Plays favorites big time. Pushes his own research and doesn't answer questions satisfactorily.
227,160049,1.0,5.0,Not a decent person outside the classroom.

He's a cranky old man who tries to crack jokes during lectures, and goes TURBOSPEED in lectures. He's not a nice guy in 1 on 1 settings either, and makes you feel dumb if you don't get something after 1 second."

241,1435975,1.0,5.0,"She teaches at IU and I wish she never came here. She doesn't care about the job at all and is not good at explaining the material. If you asked a question about a topic, she is usually unable to answer the question, or at least unwilling to do so."
242,672082,5.0,3.0,He was my professor for 4 classes in the late 1980s and then my thesis advisor.  He was the best professor I had at NU and one of the reasons I went on to study Russian history in grad school and teach today. I now send students off to NU with orders to take his classes!
243,672082,4.5,2.0,History of the Soviet Union is his strong suit and he keeps it really interesting-we only read primary documents and typed lectures and the whole class we debate the writing-he will learn you name too
244,2218334,5.0,3.0,Rob is an all around nice guy and a very talented photographer himself. Knows what he is talking about because he has experience in the industry.
245,2455909,5.0,4.0,10/10 would take again!
246,1735015,4.5,1.0,"He is a GREAT teacher. If you want to learn math, he is the one to go to. You will never stump him, and he knows his stuff!"
247,176531,5.0,1.0,Roloff is absolutely incredible! His lectures are hilarious and very interesting--time passes by so quickly in his class. You have take a course with him while at Northwestern!
248,176531,4.0,2.0,"This guy is the man - highly recommend him. I was afraid of taking his class, as I just finished my junior year and this class was to be my first college course. I was proved wrong. He's funny, relatable, smart (dude never looks at anything while he lectures), engaging. Quite possibly the best teacher I've ever had."
249,176531,5.0,1.0,"Theories of Persuasion was the best class I have ever taken! Professor Roloff connected class material to everyday life in a way that was as intellectually stimulating as it was enjoyable. He is incredibly helpful, hilarious, and very attentive to students' needs. I would highly recommend taking any of his classes! "
250,176531,5.0,1.0,"Wow what a professor! This is why you come to a school the caliber of Northwestern to meet and be taught by professors like Roloff. One of the best experiences you will have at NU is his change management class. He is very funny, witty, and engaging. A definite take and an easy A for a catharsis paper."
251,176531,5.0,1.0,"This is one of the best professors at NU, funny, knows his stuff and extreemly helpful. Take this class and you will not be disappointed at all. Did I mention that he is extreemly well respected and very inspirational. Long live Roloff."
252,176531,5.0,3.0,"Took his theories of persuasion class over the summer, one of the most amazing professors I have ever had! Take his class!"
253,176531,5.0,2.0,I had him for a theories of persuasion class over the summer. He will not let you down!
254,176531,4.5,2.0,An outstanding teacher with an interesting perspective.  A little much to take at first but once you figure out who he is the class is great.  Very entertaining and more importantly educational.  Really takes the time when grading papers to give feedback.  Lectures are very involved but he provides outlines which make note taking so much easier.
255,176531,5.0,3.0,He'll keep you laughing
256,176531,5.0,2.0,"It's 22 years since my negotiation and communication theory classes with Mike Roloff.... and his examples are still remembered AND relevant! Take a class with this guy and you will learn more than you know. Absolutely outstanding! Bright, articulate, witty and a reasonable person.... lots of laughs, too."
257,176531,5.0,3.0,"I had Dr. Roloff for several classes.  I just couldn't get enough of this guy.  He's brilliant, is a GREAT professor, teaches with an incredible clarity, and is basically fascinating.  I'm serious -- I'd be a Roloff groupie if possible.  EXCELLENT!!"
258,176531,5.0,1.0,Roloff rules!  One of those professors every NU student should have at least once.  Easy A.
259,176531,5.0,4.0,I took 4-5 courses with this professor and recommend EVERY student at NWU take at least one of his courses.  I've been out of school 7 years and still remember many concepts/theories because of his amazing lecture style.
260,176531,5.0,4.0,Dr. Roloff is a wonderful professor and truly knows his stuff.  I have learned so much from him throughout my years here at Northwestern.  He's a great teacher and friend!  I would highly recommend his classes!
261,176531,5.0,3.0,Wonderful professor!!
262,2585021,5.0,3.0,She cares about her students and what they're going through. Will help you do well in class.
263,1708481,4.5,4.0,She's awesome
264,827841,1.0,5.0,Incomprehensible speed lecture and you are supposed to memorize irrelevant jokes because it will be presented as a fill-in-the-blank question on the exam. He is by far the worst professor in NU - completely gives 0 care. He doesn't test you for the material but rather you are expected to remember random phrases in classes. Absolutely avoid him!
265,827841,1.0,3.0,"Schulz is easily one of the worst professors I have ever had. He cracked meaningless jokes and never explained concepts clearly. Really, really bad."
266,827841,2.0,4.0,"A lot of people like him because he is amusing, and its true that he's one of the funniest proffessors I've ever had. But the class is based only on difficult exams. If you want to do well, study, go to lectures, go to the office hours he has before exams, go to discussion, do the reccomended psets, and read/reread the texts"

268,827841,5.0,4.0,ERIC IS THE MAN!!
269,827841,2.0,5.0,"Schulz is STRONGLY and grossly overrated as a prof.  Sure he cracks a joke every now and then, but he lectures at a nearly incomprehensible speed and his exams are ridiculously pointless and hard...when the man has multiple choice questions each worth 8% which are based on a random sentence from the text, that's in no way helpful."

274,2189767,2.0,4.0,"Condescending and demotivating, especially if you ask questions"
275,2189767,1.0,3.0,"The instructor is highly defensive. lectures are few and very low quality, and class materials virtually non-existent.  She attempts to market herself as a consultant, including about technology; however, is unable to fully use the learning management system (Canvas).  She is unfair in grading by deducting points for disagreeing with her opinions."
276,1104344,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor! Really makes sure everyone understands the material before he moves on. Ready and willing to challenge overconfident students on their views. He's the man.
277,162268,2.0,1.0,He was easy.
278,162268,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Rice can be disorganized and sometimes goes off on different topics, but he is a great teacher and accessible to his students. Homework is fair- neither too hard or easy. He likes to analyze topics through political philosophies."
279,162268,4.5,3.0,I had Dr Rice for five classes at NU. He brings a lot of passion to teaching and always keeps it fresh. He's pretty flexible if you have an issue and super accessible. I also had him as one of three advisers on an independent study project in my last quarter. His help here set me up for grad school.
280,162268,5.0,2.0,Great class learned a bunch
281,162268,4.0,2.0,"He can be hard to follow at times, hes big into interpreting history through philosophy.  If you don't know philosophy, you could be a bit lost at first.  Keep up with the reading and its easier to understand where he's coming from."
282,162268,4.5,4.0,Awesome professor.  Best at Northwestern.
283,162268,3.5,2.0,"Great Class, I had a lot of interest.  Not real clear on finals and midterms.  In the end because of his lack of clarity, cost me a good grade in his class, a C."
284,162268,5.0,2.0,I love prof rice and you will too.  he's great.  not hot but extremely interesting.
285,1188331,5.0,3.0,Great at both lecturing and facilitating discussion. Answers questions effectively. Absolutely no complaints!
286,1188331,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher!  Her new class really made a semi-boring topic interesting and thought provoking.  A &quot;history&quot; textbook in Latin didn't seem interesting, but her discussion based translation class was really refreshing!"
287,2265604,3.0,3.0,Reading materials were interesting but her grading criteria is totally unclear. Just a bunch of checks and check plus. What does that mean? She also seems to like herself a lot since there were a few times she discredited the work of other journalists and it was rude. I get the impression she misses her career and is envious of others' success.
288,2265604,2.0,3.0,Our entire second class of narrative structure was spent bashing acclaimed journalist Lowell Bergman. I felt the time could have been more productive. He's an accomplished professional and mentor to many and her and the guest criticized him for 4 hours. Her grading system also does not comply with university policies and is confusing.
289,1184263,4.0,2.0,the ladies love backman and with good reason. ridiculously smart prof with an easy going personality
290,1784328,3.5,3.0,Great hands-on class technical course Very knowledgeable in subject matter Mid-term and final are a lot of work Fair grader Helpful and accommodating regarding assignments 
291,1784328,5.0,3.0,"Challenging material, but Dr. Bader was very clear in his lectures, sync sessions and other communications.  Keep up with the readings, practice the exercises from the text, and reach out to him and peers if needed.  If I could do well in this class with ZERO prior knowledge of database systems, anyone can."
292,1784328,4.5,3.0,"Very helpful professor.  Knows what he's talking about and always willing to help you via supplemental tutorials and presentations.  Ask for help and direction - you'll get it.  Make sure you read the assigned text and complete exercises.  Overall fun, informative class.  Didn't struggle.  But didn't slack on reading and work either."
293,1784338,5.0,3.0,good final project! each weekly assignment builds on each other for the final project. keep up with those and attend lectures for more information to each assignment and you should do great!
294,1784338,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Woo is an excellent lecturer, he is clear in his instructions for assignments and is a fair grader.  Real world case studies are what I am interested in and Dr. Woo delivers these. Some of the discussions really made me think about my organization processes.   The guest speakers were excellent."
295,1784338,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Woo was understanding and considerate. He was generally very positive. The course did seem more catered to a business-like perspective and as the other comment said, it may not be optimal for a rigorous understanding of networking."
296,1784338,5.0,2.0,"As a working professional, I appreciated that Dr. Woo valued our time.  He presented useful material in an interesting and challenging manner. He encouraged further research, but did not make the class unnecessarily cumbersome. He was accessible and prompt in returning voice and emails. The material presented was informative and practical."
297,1784338,1.0,1.0,"If u want 2 learn networking -avoid! Subject taught like a business college class - write papers 'why is networking important' If u write technical paper he literally said ""this paper is to technical."" If u want 2 pass without sweat, just write some BS and submit it in time. Northwestern really degraded. This guy is a director and does not care"
298,813597,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher, clear, interesting, a little bit scary though..."

300,813597,4.5,3.0,HOT HOT HOT!
301,809504,5.0,3.0,"I took Chris for 3 classes (PM, IT PM, and Obj. Oriented Programming). His lectures tend to run long, but he is very detailed and specific as to what his expectations are. The work does take a while, but if you hang in there you will be just fine.   I would for sure take his class again."
302,809504,5.0,2.0,"The assignments are pretty easy to follow, and he walks you through them during his mandatory lectures. Some assignments can be done in 1 hour, some can take up to 5 hours, but it's never hard. If you don't understand something or still have questions, it's pretty easy to message him and he responds pretty fast."
303,809504,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Make sure you don't skip the sync sessions. He goes over the assignments and does most of the assignment for you if you watch them.  If you watch the sync sessions, you will just be fine in this class.  Quizzes are not easy but final exam basically comes from your quiz questions."
304,809504,4.0,3.0,"Knowledgeable professor on the topic of IT Project management.  He is a fair grader and will provide feedback on homework.  He can be picky at times, but not tough.  The course is not as difficult as CIS 494 and requires more papers and less project management tools.  Repeats a lot of what was taught in that course less the practical skills."
305,809504,4.0,4.0,Professor is a knowledge expert on the subject of project management.  His lectures are structured and fill up the entire 3 hours of class time each week.  Pay attention to the details of the weekly assignment as he will take off points for the smallest details.  No quizsexams only weekly assignments which seem to take longer than planned.
306,809504,4.5,4.0,"He does a very good job of explaining the material, and the homework is hard, but fair, as it is necessary for learning the material. "
307,809504,5.0,1.0,"I had Professor Hield for Project Management, and was not sure what to expect.  His lectures were clear and to the point which i really appreciated (aprrox an hour each week).  During the sync session, he thoroughly went over how to do homework.  Make sure to follow the directions on the syllabus exactly.  I would def take him again."
308,809504,5.0,4.0,Clear and thorough lync sessions. Good assignment overviews. Feed back on assignments. 
309,809504,1.0,5.0,"Teaches Java, and instead of running the samples on Netbeans, he writes them on the board. Very difficult to understand his handwriting. "
310,809504,1.0,5.0,Not Recommended
311,809504,1.0,5.0,Not recommemded
312,809504,5.0,1.0,Helped a lot with object oriented programming
313,809504,5.0,1.0,Best professor ever. Really. He had a lot of his own notes. I am surprised he had not published his own book. Extremely useful class.
314,809504,5.0,3.0,No Comments
315,809504,5.0,1.0,Well organized...I actually learned a lot in his classes!
316,809504,5.0,2.0,"Very nice guy. Lenient grader. Very clear when it comes to exams, and projects. Very accessible via email."
317,1784356,4.0,4.0,"Embodies the academic spirit, fair course administration, encourages open and respectful dialogue on relevant topics."
318,1784356,5.0,2.0,Lenient. Fun. Wise. Informative.
319,1784356,5.0,5.0,"A brilliant instructor; works really hard and reads all papers and comments on them. I loved the class, although I think that online class involved too much work - I think that home works should be around 30% shorter. If you  like writing - you will benefit form this class; but be prepared to work really hard!"
320,2032172,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gucler did a great job of being there for his students. He really cared about each individual's understanding of the material and always offered help. He was very easy to get a hold of even though he was living in Sweden at the time of this class. He is very clear in his instructions and grades very fairly, so do your work and you will succeed."
321,1298993,5.0,3.0,"I took an intro CS class with Ian and I absolutely loved it! His lectures are very clear and concise, and you can tell that he genuinely cares about his students. I didn't have any prior CS experience so I found the workload tough but manageable."
322,1298993,5.0,1.0,Best Prof
323,1298993,4.5,2.0,One of the best professor at NU
324,1298993,4.0,2.0,What a boss.
325,963121,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors at Kellogg
326,963121,5.0,3.0,I have taken him for 3 classes - Best teacher I have ever had.  Northwestern is lucky to have him.
327,963121,5.0,3.0,I wish he taught all of my classes for the rest of my life
328,963121,5.0,2.0,I have taken 3 courses with Sorin.  20 years of education and Sorin is #1 on my list!!
329,963121,5.0,3.0,"I cannot believe Sorin isn't on here yet! Simply the best guy ever. Very thorough notes, extremely helpful, interested in the material. All-around fabulous guy."
330,1962545,5.0,1.0,"Amazing professor, very helpful and understanding!"
331,1962545,4.0,2.0,"This one of the best professor,  EVER!!! "
332,2267720,5.0,2.0,"Assignments every week (sometimes 2 per week) plus discussion board posts (with 3 replies required). He did give a lot of code to get you started, plus he gave sample outputs and hints/tips for the HW which was nice. Overall pretty easy class and the final exam was self-proctored, some MC some free response. Not too strict of a grader"
333,2267720,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Arroyo really knows his stuff, great teacher who provides good feedback would take again. "
334,2267720,5.0,2.0,I didn't really attend any lectures and the class was a breeze (I do have a math background). There were a few issues with showing work on quizzes and the final but Professor Arroyo was quick to respond and resolved the issue. Would recommend taking this class with him.
335,1266254,3.0,4.0,She's entertaining but that's really it. The structure of 202 is too rigid. I would probably like her more in a different class environment.
336,1266254,5.0,3.0,Always engaging and helpful. Needed to fix the terrible rating :)
337,1266254,1.5,5.0,"Terribly difficult to follow.  Essay Final is 30% of grade. Attendance is 10%. Group project had me with lazy people and doing their work. We grade each other so they got no credit and dropped. She never returns emails or work. Told me not to worry. I aced the final, got a B+.  She dropped me a letter grade for being late to 3 classes. C+ overall"
338,1608293,5.0,3.0,She's a wonderful teacher and person.
339,356973,5.0,3.0,"I had Prof Goerss at Wellesley College. I loved his classes. His lectures were clear and his notes were great. I am now a lecturer at a university and while I am nowhere near as good as Prof Goerss, I try to emulate his teaching style. I am very glad that he was at Wellesley when I was. Thank you Prof Goerss. "
340,356973,4.5,4.0,"I  loved Professor Goerss when I had him at Wellesley. I had him for many classes. His lectures were clear, his tests were fair, and his jokes were goofy :)"
341,356973,4.5,5.0,Goerss is exceptionally clear in his lectures. He doesn't follow the book so the assignments he gives from Hatcher's Algebraic Topology are difficult. You realize how clear he was after the fact though.
342,178801,5.0,1.0,"She's at UW Parkside now. Amazing teacher, really. I'm not a music major, but she helped me re-discover my love of music, and we didn't once listen to something I'd consider 'up-my-lane-music'. If you have a chance. Take her class."
343,178801,4.0,2.0,She was my favorite prof in my 4 years at NU. She genuinely cared for her students.  NU treated her badly and lost a great professor :(
344,178801,5.0,4.0,"Whitaker is amazing.  She was an advocate for all of the music ed kids, and now look.  NU, your music ed program is going down the toilet...please please please fix it"
345,178801,5.0,3.0,Great teacher!!  She always went extra miles to help her students. Too bad that she has left.  What a big loss for Northwestern.
346,2703999,1.0,5.0,Hardest professor Ive ever taken. She has unrealistic expectations for her students and would rather see you fail than do well in her class. Avoid her at all costs!
347,2583171,5.0,2.0,"I took professor Eddy's class during my freshmen year. He was a great professor, and I enjoyed his class a lot, he is extremely caring and hilarious and I would recommend him to anyone considering taking a class with him, he is definitely one of those memorable professors that you will remember after graduation. A 10/10."
348,2294407,1.0,4.0,Chaotic.
349,2294407,2.0,4.0,"Clearly knowledgeable in his field. However, he's disorganized &amp; his lectures are scattered. Also was very inaccessible outside of class. After first midterm, he asked class for feedback &amp; took things very personally when people offered criticisms, making personal attacks on students during class. Lecture &amp; exam material differ widely. avoid."
350,2607772,5.0,4.0,"Nancy is amazing! Super easy to reach, gives great and thought provoking lectures, and pulls good material that relates to our current political/social climate. She encourages every student to participate, and to hopefully run for office some day. Nancy gives great advice in addition to a great course, any class you take with her you will LOVE."
351,520876,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr Derlugian's Organized Crime class in the Summer quarter. Normally, his classes are a mob scene with everyone trying to get in. My class had one other NU student. Everyone else was Stanford or Ivy and had heard about the class. It was easily my favorite class at NU. Georgi is tops!"
352,520876,4.5,2.0,Fantastic professor; knows the material like the back of his hand.
353,520876,4.0,3.0,"Brilliant guy. Hang on 'cause you're in for a ride and he's not slowing down for anything. Surprisingly not too hard, although he's so much smarter than everyone else he probably thinks you're an idiot. No big deal -- you definitely don't want to miss taking a class from him! Prepare to do some work and you'll be just fine."
354,520876,5.0,3.0,"From three-toed horses to 3000 AD, how does he tie it all together so well&#63;"
355,520876,3.0,2.0,"What a riot. A bit disjointed, and a little intimidating as a freshman, but good overall."
356,520876,5.0,2.0,This man rox my sox. Most brilliant prof I have yet to discover. Take him any chance you get.
357,520876,5.0,2.0,Best prof. EVER.  Derluguian is one of the most fascinating people I've ever had the pleasure of learning from.
358,2060974,1.0,5.0,"Her lectures were dry, boring, and dull. Tests and quizzes were freaking hard. A lot of tricky questions. She doesn't curve. Doesn't care and help student when you ask her a question. She made this class way too difficult for no reason. Her lectures were nearly useless for the exam. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. IGNORE."
359,2060974,4.5,4.0,"Difficult course material, but so worth the effort! I learned A LOT in this class and retained the majority of information studied. Dr. Najor really went above and beyond in making herself available for office hours and after class. As a science student, I can't say I've had a more down to earth professor than her. Would definitely recommend!"
360,2060974,1.0,5.0,"Totally ruined a subject! The lectures were boring. Lots of tricky questions in quizzes and exams, which didn't not fairly reflect what you have learned. Tons of frustration has been built during the quarter. She refuse to give extra credits or curve the grade to motivate her students. For the sake of your GPA and your mental health, avoid her!"
361,2060974,1.0,5.0,"The only people who do well already work in the field or have taken it before. The weekly quizzes (as well as her exams) are very difficult, and do not cover what she covers in class. She wants to be helpful, but is the opposite. Presents false info. Won't give extra credit, and will take no blame for everyone doing poorly. Avoid at all costs! "
362,2060974,1.5,5.0,"Has great personality for teaching, but doesn't have a mastery of the topic & doesn't assess the class appropriately.  The quizzes require that you read the chapter with a fine-toothed comb.  Even using her study guide, lecture, my notes, and re-reading the chapter, quizzes are difficult to do  a C.  Only current med professionals/re-take get As."
363,2060974,1.0,5.0,"Ruined a subject I actually find interesting. She not only presents incorrect material occasionally, but also gives exam length quizzes each class. She says they're only on the lecture, but sends an outline that contains significantly more material NOT present in lecture or slides. No extra credit or curving so as to ""keep us motivated."" Horrible."
364,791233,1.5,4.0,It doesn't matter how smart the Professor is if he/she can't properly teach in a comprehensive manner. This person does not appear to truly grasp the fact that majority of the students never did programming. He teaches as if people do have experience. He needs to learn how to teach more than anything else. Terrible person to learn from.
365,791233,2.0,5.0,"Well, if you have never taken a programming class, you will struggle-struggle the whole quarter! Class covers lots of programming techniques and does not go deep into details (read the book.) For me, it felt like a good class to recap my existing knowledge."
366,791233,1.5,4.0,This guy is useless
367,791233,4.5,4.0,He is very decoted to students.
368,791233,4.5,1.0,The class was useful for me. He answered all the questions I had. I had a lot.
369,791233,1.0,5.0,"Teaches directly from the book.  Doesn't create own lecture note, uses presentations created by book authors.  Not a good teacher for beginners."
370,2388684,2.0,3.0,This professor is incongruent at best.
371,959185,1.0,4.0,Rick Morris is not a good instructor.

374,1026793,5.0,4.0,"Professor Smith was an inspirational professor that took time to be thoughtful when assigning work and always cared about his students. He would make you work for your grade and was not afraid to give you a challenge. I appreciated him because he took time time to get to know his students, thus being one of my favorite professors."

376,1026793,5.0,3.0,extremely cool!
377,2642685,5.0,4.0,"Pacing of the course was great, the information was difficult and required a lot of reading/watching videos online.  She was very responsive and helpful to questions as long as you showed what you tried.  I loved the course !"
378,2642685,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, if you can the course with dr. Dill, you're lucky."
379,828164,4.5,1.0,Best teacher to take!
380,828164,3.5,3.0,Rude at times. Unclear. Thick accent makes it hard to understand his english.
381,828164,5.0,3.0,Mohammad is really great. He sincerely wants his students to learn and apply the material.
382,828164,4.5,4.0,"Intense class, but a fun, patient and understanding professor."
383,828164,4.0,4.0,He was great!
384,828164,5.0,3.0,Mohammad is so cute.  and he's a fabulous teacher.  the best of both worlds.  Definitely makes nine o'clock class worth it.

386,987913,4.0,5.0,"He is a very good teacher. However, You need to have thick skin with him because some of his criticism can seem quite hurtful. But really he cares about his students a lot. I improved my playing a lot under him and he gave me great technical advice. Only thing that i did not like is that he is sometimes quite dogmatic about certain musical aspects."
387,987913,5.0,5.0,Honestly the most caring teacher I have ever met!

390,1133332,5.0,3.0,"This was a hybrid course, so we pretty much met every other week. Prof. V. is great at lecturing and as long as you've done your part, she'll do hers. Class time was exciting and learning was fun."
391,682799,5.0,2.0,Awesome Awesome Awesome Never expected such a good writing instructor as an Engineering student
392,682799,5.0,2.0,"Took English 105 during the summer, while prof. Yarnoff doesn't typically teach it during the academic years. He is literally one of, if not the very, best instructor I have ever have! "
393,682799,5.0,3.0,"One of the best teachers I have ever had. He knows the literature very well, is an expert at leading discussions, and is an excellent writing instructor. And he's a great guy to just talk to."

395,682799,5.0,3.0,Great prof. Really interested in students' progress. Really helpful with adult students. CARES THAT YOU LEARN!!!!
396,2501429,4.0,3.0,Take her with confidence. Loved my practicum experience with her. I wasn't so sure at first because it felt unnecessary but I got a lot out of it. I learned a lot from her experience and couldn't believe how much she had because she doesn't look her age.
397,2501429,4.0,3.0,She was great. Very inspirational.
398,2501429,5.0,3.0,She was great and I really appreciated having her once we finished with practicum and moved to internship. I wish she was the internship supervisor too. She wasn't our supervisor but I could still reach out to her. She talked about things never mentioned in other classes. You can tell she has a lot of field experience and wanted us to grow.
399,2501429,5.0,3.0,She was my supervisor and it was the best educational experience I have had as a master's student. I wish she was my clinical director.
400,1569614,5.0,3.0,Marty invites his students to join him on a journey of understanding.
401,494427,4.5,1.0,Outstanding instructor who really cares about what he teaches.  He is passioniate about the subject matter and it shows.  Anyone looking to add to their leadership toolbox needs to take this course with him.  His lack of organization is a trademark but not a deterent.
402,494427,3.5,1.0,"This rating system does not ask the most important questions.  Did I learn something in this class&#63;  YES - a great deal.  However, I had to learn it myself, with the support of other students.  the instructor laid the groundwork, but expected students to take it from there.  Arnston's heart is in the right place and the course matters a great deal."
403,494427,2.5,1.0,"Dr. Arntson is a strong advocate for the disenfranchised.  He gives students the necessary information and expects us to process it, in its complexity, and work with each other to make sense of it.  The classes he teaches are not difficult, but leave students with a greater sense of understanding.  He is difficult to find for help however."
404,289629,5.0,5.0,Hardest class; mind-changing. Everything the other reviewer said is exactly right. 
405,289629,5.0,5.0,"This woman is the most amazing teacher and mentor anyone could hope to have. Brilliant beyond imagining, fully committed to her work. Those who are easily daunted will probably find her classes to be the kind of thing you look back on and are grateful to have done once it's over, but for folks who really want to learn, there's nobody better!"
406,1135485,3.0,3.0,very good professor
407,1411973,4.5,1.0,great teacher
408,760709,5.0,4.0,"He is a great professor who tries his hardest to impart learning, and make stats relevant to business and marketing. I will always owe any small amount of analytical foundation that I have to his class."
409,760709,4.5,3.0,made me fall in love with stats
410,760709,4.5,2.0,"A good and decent man. Very helpful, genuinely interested in your success. If you work hard you will be rewarded. Numbers don't lie, after all."

413,760709,3.0,5.0,"Very unnecessary course.  Very unclear, would have liked to know what to do with data retrieved, instead of data retrieval."
414,760709,4.5,2.0,"Really nice guy--seems genuinely interested in teaching. I think he knows that most students are taking stats because they have to, not because they want to. He works hard to make it seem relevant to real business/marketing issues."
415,1682312,5.0,2.0,"Her Biomaterials class was awesome!  Great teacher, available, and took an interest in us doing well and understanding the topic. Clear and concise.  A class I  always attended and well worth it. She's also pleasant to look at (I'm a hetero chick. She is happily married - he's hot too!). class got me interested in pursuing biomaterials research."
416,2167697,1.0,4.0,The final letter grade assignments completely lacked transparency. No final grade boundaries were given. There allegedly was a curve but nobody knew by how much. The syllabus changed many times without warning. Scored copies of the final exam were not available and neither were keys. Lectures poorly recorded and explained very little. Good luck.
417,1567639,3.0,5.0,Ricky is a mix of an academician and a businessman. He truly cares about research and is very well respected and known in the community. But he is also very strategic and political and isn't the easiest person to work with. 
418,2110365,1.0,5.0,Doesnt answer his phone 24/7. Very inconvenient. 0/10.
419,2110365,1.0,5.0,The grading was very harsh and the quiz questions were very poorly written. He is unhelpful in office hours and is also very rude.
420,2671517,1.0,1.0,"afam 380 Unsettling Whiteness is an actual class. &quot;There is a certain class of race problem-solvers who don't want the patient to get well, because as long as the disease holds out they have not only an easy means of making a living, but also an easy medium through which to make themselves prominent before the public.&quot; Booker T. Washington"
421,2671517,2.0,1.0,Taking the professors classes previously I expected a more open outlook and discourse regarding the subject matter. Pick another class for your soc credit.
422,2237342,5.0,3.0,One of the best profs I've ever had! You can tell he really cares about the material and making sure each student gets something out of the class. And he's funny.
423,1651618,5.0,4.0,"Laura Kipnis presented one of the most engaging, well organized, incisive classes I took during pursuit of my MFA. The readings were outstanding. The discussions were relevant and enlightening. And she tackled very difficult topics with careful consideration. I wish more professors followed her lead."
424,1651618,2.5,1.0,"Nice teacher!! Easy class, though you tend not to learn too much. Very discussion based. Kipnis is a kind woman, and generally pretty lenient."
425,1651618,1.0,2.0,"Truly, the worst teacher I've ever had."
426,1756068,1.0,3.0,"This professor's logic and arguments are atrocious. He cites facts that are easily proven misinterpreted, misunderstood or seemingly fabricated."
427,1756068,5.0,4.0,He's smart and cares about his students. I think every econ student should take this class.
428,1756068,4.5,2.0,Great professor. I expected this class to be sort of boring but he kept it interesting.
429,1756068,4.5,4.0,"Awesome instructor, very helpful, willing to answer any and all questions, very accessible outside of class, willing to help connect you to possible job opportunities through his connections"
430,2089900,5.0,4.0,She's an Indiana Jones-type professor who seems to have done all of the things she teaches about. It's amazing
431,2239406,1.0,1.0,"poor english, harsh on students; nearly never prepare for the class; simply read ppt. students end up learning nothing. always find faults. no suggestions. Hard to follow. Hard to understand. pretend to know everything. poor knowledge"
432,2042805,5.0,4.0,Professor Menaker makes this class very intriguing by inviting highly respected/profiled guest speakers to our online lectures. Immensely  knowledgable of current litigation in the news and always available outside of class!
433,2325433,5.0,2.0,"Easily a top 5 professor at NU. Easily accessible, knowledgeable, fresh ideas, fair class through and through. He relates class material to real life and makes it easy to digest."
434,117690,2.0,4.0,Have heard the other orgo profs are better. I would avoid him and take the others if you get the chance. Too much ego.
435,117690,3.5,4.0,He sometimes teaches rather quickly so i found it helpful to red teh book.  I would recommend reading ahead because the quizes he gives are pretty tough.
436,117690,4.5,5.0,"One of the best science courses I have ever taken.  Coddens can be intimidating, but he means well and makes himself available outside of class.  You definitely have to stay on top of the material or this class will seem harder than it is.  I couldn't imagine learning organic chemistry from any other professor."
437,117690,4.5,5.0,"He's really tough, without knowing him well, you would think his midterms are WTF-ly unpredictable. BUT, he's really willing to help his students and do not give you the COLD stare if you start talking to him. He's awesome, I swear, take orgo with him and you feel like you are genius when you get out of his class throughout the year."
438,117690,4.5,5.0,"Coddens is a tough professor, but if you take the time to see him during office hours, he is very nice and helpful.  Approaching him aggressively will not work in your favor."
439,117690,1.5,5.0,Unhelpful. Rude. I feel sorry for him.  It's such a shame when students really want to learn and he turns his back on cultivating &quot;our future&quot;.
440,117690,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE CODDENS EVER!!! His test are unbelievable. Not sure why he is a professor at Northwestern. He was so rude that I cried several times in his office because of his insults. This man has no business being a teacher, he doesn't care about his students. As long as Coddens is still a professor, I will not donate a dime to the university."
441,117690,5.0,3.0,Best. Teacher. EVAH!
442,117690,1.0,5.0,Makes the material hard for the sake of being hard.  Horrible teacher.  Unwilling to help students. take anyone but him!!
443,117690,1.5,5.0,just terrible
444,117690,1.5,5.0,"Dr. Coddens is absolutely the WORST professor I have ever had. Avoid at all costs. He is rude, disrespectful, and unhelpful. He does not care about his students success in his course or in life. He is constantly degrading students for not knowing the answers to questions. If you go to his office hours, he acts like you are wasting his time. BAD"
445,117690,2.5,5.0,Inexplicably difficult tests
446,117690,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Coddens doesn't really care if you understand orgo or not, he just likes to prove how much he really knows. He is absolutely terrible and what's worse, he is the Dean of the Department of Chemistry!"
447,117690,1.0,5.0,Dude acts like he will help you but will SCREW YOU.

450,117690,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Coddens is a fantastic professor -- if you take the time to get to know him. Once the students not really committed to the class are weeded out, he takes a genuine interest in the remaining students. Go to his office hours -- it is absolutely worth it"
451,117690,4.0,5.0,"He will be INCREDIBLY tough, but you will learn the material. If you're pre-med you'll be glad you went through this class.  He teaches the toughest stuff and lets you learn from the book on your own.  If you go to his office hours, he's really helpful"

460,1149888,4.0,4.0,"Dr Hatch is great! Unfortunately, you will be dealing with TAs most of the time and she doesn't always pick good TAs. She is available outside of class though, which is super helpful. Labs are a time suck, but the experiments are pretty interesting."
461,1149888,1.0,5.0,"unprepared for class, disorganized, doesn't know how to teach"
462,2106310,5.0,4.0,"Tzelgov is a caring, funny, smart guy. Grading were based on discussions, participation, and a take home exam. Class flew by and were interesting. Great insights and solid contextual background on the texts. HE IS A SUPER PROFESSOR"
463,2106310,5.0,3.0,"Tzelgov always offers extra help, always excited for class, extremely and passionate about teaching . His background allows him to bring passion and knowledge to the classroom in an energetic way. I always look forward to learn from him. He is there to help, and runs a class in one of the most non-stressful and enjoyable atmospheres in school."
464,2106310,5.0,4.0,"The class on poetry and politics in israeli poetry blew my mind. Get ready to read a lot, to think out loud, and be amazed.  His knowledge of american literature provides great comparison and his passion to poetry is not to be missed. best class i took by far and i am not a literature guy."
465,107470,1.5,5.0,"It?s clear that his conferences and research are far more important than his students.  He sends his TA to teach while he?s away (which is quite a bit, according to former students), leaving us to teach ourselves from the book (which he wrote).  He?s signed in more students than the space allows, which isn?t fair to students."

472,2386905,1.0,1.0,I don't recommend this prof. Very tough to have her as a prof.
473,2386905,1.0,1.0,"She does not give good feedback at all. If you want a prof that thinks highly of herself and thinks that the world revolves around her, she's the one. Instead of inspiring her mentees, she ridicules not just your work but the way you do your work. I don't advise taking her as an academic advisor if you want to really learn about research."
474,2460637,2.0,4.0,"CISS455 is a requirement unfortunately. He &quot;suggest&quot; you login to discussions daily, discussion questions are mini-assignments, assignments are labor intensive meaning they take hours/days to complete. Makes you fill templates with minimal foundation therefore you are forced to google everything. Very tough grader. Does provide extra credit."
475,934886,5.0,3.0,"She's super smart, knows her stuff an is wonderful at managing teacher-student, peer to peer dynamics. If you're the least bit insecure about learning from a  really smart woman who also happens to be kind as well as progressive in terms of student-teacher power dynamics, you'll struggle."
476,934886,2.5,1.0,"Nice woman, but not the brightest bulb. Nor the sharpest pencil. Etc. Tries hard to be like the students and seems to need our approval, rather than being the professor and an authority. Acts young, needs to face up to being older. We WANT you to be professorial. Don't act like a kid. Should get better, I'll bet."
477,1649670,5.0,2.0,"Great instructor, had great knowledge and would stir intrest in you as a student. Great communication skills and assignments are very well thought out. Other CIS instructors do not know how to teach or are very dry."
478,1649670,5.0,2.0,"Great instructor! Many Information Systems instructors at Northwestern are terrible, Erich is an exception."
479,1649670,4.5,1.0,Good teacher; recommend! you will enjoy learning without stress.
480,1649670,4.5,1.0,Great professor. Easy on the HW and great on clarity. Recommended!
481,158735,1.0,2.0,Good lecturer but absolutely unreasonable and inflexible. Would not reccommend.
482,158735,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Gardner is not interested in helping you learn, but rather more into herself. If youre an original thinker, Id avoid this class, she will put you down, as well as your GPA. She put very little effort into lectures, the material was all over the place, and was not helpful inside the class nor accessible out. Totally overrated. Worst professor."

499,1610776,3.0,5.0,Professor Masur delegates all of her grading to her teaching assistant. And the specific assistant that I got is Hope McCaffrey. Hope struggles to grade impartially on opinions she might disagree with. She grades very harshly when she disagrees with you and is unreasonable when you have a conversation about why you got a poor grade.
500,658462,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely love this professor. She has been so wonderful to me, and she has the best interests at heart. I would recommend her to my peers and prospective students. Great Job Professor Kamal!"

505,658462,4.5,3.0,Kamal is awesome! I loved her lectures and she is very helpful if you see her during office hours. Watch out for the tests! They're hard! Homework is easy though.
506,1862702,1.0,5.0,"If you want a self-taught class, this one is for you!  You won't receive much help, lectures are entertaining but not informative, tests are ridiculous. You're graded by a mid-term & final (80%)and he makes it impossible to get a good grade; lots of curveballs & advanced questions that don't belong in an intro class. This class sets you up to fail."
507,158767,5.0,4.0,"I love him. One of my favourite professors from Northwestern. He's smart, outspoken, helpful, everything positive you can think of. Truly wonderful and you can learn A LOT from him!"
508,158767,5.0,3.0,"I took jour 370 with LaMay and it was my favorite class I've taken at Medill. Unlike a lot of Medill professors who are self-righteous and preachy about journalism ethics, LaMay kept it real. He started out the class saying in his opinion this should be called media law since media ethics don't really exist. Going to class unnecessary but fun."
509,158767,5.0,4.0,"I love him. He is great, interesting to listen too and also talk to. And he's super attractive which is a bonus."
510,158767,3.5,3.0,"Craig is different. He can be really intense and he can also be the most easy going man in the world. Either way, he's memorable."
511,158767,4.0,4.0,"Beautiful, amazing man."
512,158767,5.0,3.0,"Lamay keeps it real.  Ridiculously smart, a great speaker, completely approachable in and out of class. great guy."

514,158767,5.0,4.0,Craig is one of a kind.
515,158767,5.0,4.0,wonderful teacher.
516,158767,4.5,4.0,"Lamay is easy going but also intense. It's what makes him such a good teacher, and such an attractive man."
517,158767,4.5,3.0,"he's a great speaker, but he's best one on one. remembers what it's like to be young. self deprecating but one of the smartest profs i had at nu."
518,158767,4.5,3.0,"Extremely intelligent, down to earth and understanding. One of my fave NU professors, seriously."
519,158767,5.0,4.0,"I had Lamay years ago and he was the best Medill prof then, intellectually one of the best I had at Nu and also one of the nicest. I use what he taught me everyday."
520,158767,5.0,4.0,"The nicest, smartest, hottest professor ever. One of the best I had at NU."
521,158767,5.0,4.0,My FAVORITE Northwestern professor ever!
522,158767,5.0,3.0,"A very nice, very modest amd very smart man. never met anyone like him."
523,158767,5.0,4.0,"A really smart man who stands for what Medill is at its best. No one like him. And yes, he's really good looking in a rough around the edges kind of way."
524,158767,5.0,3.0,Craig LaMay is what every man should aspire to be. His classes are the bomb and his older son is REALLY good looking. Def take a class with this guy!
525,158767,5.0,4.0,"I took his class years ago before going to work for a major metro paper. I have used everything he taught me and continue to respect him tremendously. One of the best teachers I ever had, undergrad and grad. He is so amazingly smart and well respected, yet utterly humble and approachable."
526,158767,5.0,4.0,"This guy is famous. great teacher, greater human beiing."
527,158767,5.0,3.0,"Great, great teacher. His lectures are long, but keep you awake and interested. He has a lot of experience in law and media and he tells fantastic stories about his real-life experiences."

530,158791,1.0,2.0,"His class must be the worst experience I've ever had whether it be in college, highschool, or kindergarten.

537,1754196,2.0,3.0,"Reading & Writing Creative Nonfiction. The material was interesting sometimes, but impossible to get her to answer questions or give any advice. She also assigned her own husband's videos way too much. I would have liked to read some traditional non-fiction."
538,1754196,2.0,3.0,Was under the impression that we were all in class with her to hear her talk about herself.
539,1754196,1.0,2.0,I often felt in class that Ms. Biss wished she was anywhere but with us. She spent most of her time talking about herself or talking badly about other writers. I learned nothing and got the least feedback from her than from any other writing class.
540,1754196,1.0,2.0,She spent the majority of the semester talking about herself while badmouthing pretty much every other writer in the department.  I felt dirty after every class with her.  She also will make big claims about meeting with you outside of class but never EVER makes herself available.
541,2522196,1.0,1.0,Worst professor I have ever had in my life.
542,2522196,1.0,1.0,"My parent died partway through the quarter which made me more distractible and I think it hurt the quality of my work. Although it's not his responsibility to adjust or understand, prof Miller was surprisingly callous in his response and was not understanding at all. It really hurt."
543,2522196,1.0,5.0,Very frustrating class. Dr miller doesn't seem to care about his students. Never seemed very prepared for class and working out what he wants from you is a constant struggle. Want help preparing for the final? Good luck with that! Make friends with others in your class because youre in it for the long haul together
544,2522196,1.0,2.0,All I can say is that these other raters hit the nail on the head. I was incredibly disappointed by Professor Miller's class. He treats his favorite students well but then if you disagree with him on *anything* he will find a way to get back at you. Weirdly vindictive for a prof. Don't take his class
545,2522196,2.0,5.0,"very frustrating prof. the class guidelines are not clear and you are graded based on only a few assignments. refused to meet outside of class, making students walk all the way across town if they wanted to get any face time. don't take his courses! find a better prof in psych who does real health work like Chen or real quant work like Revelle"
546,2522196,1.0,2.0,"worst prof I've had in my graduate career. as a grad student you expect some amount of intellectual curiosity from your professors, but prof miller is only interested in his narrow area of research, talking down other areas as inferior. It got to be quite insulting at times, especially since I'm not a psychologist. I do not recommend his courses."
547,2522196,2.0,3.0,"Professor Miller was fine I guess? but this was my least favorite psych class I've taken in my undergraduate career at Northwestern. expectations unclear, he only cares about his own research areas and shows clear disinterest in other areas beyond biological psychology. didn't get the sense that he was too intellectually curious beyond his niche"
548,2522196,1.0,5.0,"Not clear on his expectations for the course. also seemed to care a lot about his one particular area of study, but didn't give any thought to others. this impacted grading, so be sure to say what he wants you to say in your final paper! Just parrot it back without thinking and he will be happy"
549,2522196,1.0,1.0,"Not a hard grader, but not interested in teaching. I didn't get the sense that he cared about his students :/"
550,1936474,5.0,4.0,Professor Martin makes learning programming so much fun! And shes very patient with any questions we come up with. Love taking her class ;)
551,1936474,4.5,4.0,Dr. Martin was interesting in her sync sessions and the material was factual and current. 
552,1936474,5.0,4.0,Great course/professor and very relevant whether you are looking to work in the sports field or are a sports fan.   Dr. Martin's expertise in Exercise Physiology defined the early part of the course and her statistical background was evident once we started working in R.  I highly recommend Dr. Martin.
553,1936474,5.0,4.0,"Dr Martin is truly an amazing instructor.  She is a great communicator and is always willing to help and clarify questions on the course.  She always returned emails in a timely fashion and her class is very organized. The class itself is great, there is a lot of reading and even more work to be done with R Programming. "
554,1936474,3.5,4.0,"This was the first time this course was being taught & I think some of the kinks were still being worked out.  However, Dr. Martin has extensive knowledge of analytics, sports/sports analytics, and physiology/kinesiology.  Very interesting stuff, but also felt like a lot to absorb in 10 weeks."
555,1936474,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Martin is thorough in her lessons, assignments, test and works really well with the students. She is very understanding of the students concerns and pushes them to excel at every step of the way. Dr. Martin has been very responsive to all the students in regards to their questions and assignments. I am glad to be a student in her class."
556,1936474,4.0,3.0,"Great instructor. Her discussion topics were really great and they helped us to understand the subject better. Other than that, just one non-positive feedback is that I felt like she did not involve in class discussions often."
557,1936474,4.5,3.0,Great professor.  Dr. Martin was very helpful when it came to providing guidance on assignments.  She responded to e-mails quickly and her explanations always made sense.
558,1936474,4.0,2.0,Dr. Martin has been great and very helpful.  The topic for discussion are important to the class understanding.  The tests are manageable in the week.  The project is also manageable with practice in R. 
559,1936474,4.5,4.0,"discussions relevant -- the schear nature of R is difficult to teach in an online environment but I feel we're set up to succeed  --  we'll see on the grading, but seems to be fair.  "
560,1936474,5.0,3.0,Great experience with this professor!
561,1936474,5.0,3.0,Great Professor. Responds to emails within 24 hours. Actively participates in the discussion boards.
562,1936474,5.0,3.0,Very detailed regarding what is expected on assignments.

566,2022507,1.0,3.0,"I had a horrible experience. The content is extremely dry and boring, and his lectures are just a word salad of business buzzwords. Mandatory $137 course packet. Attendance is mandatory and participation is expected. Papers are due every week, and he doesn't post prompts until two days before (Once, he didn't post until a few hours before class)."
567,1313908,4.5,3.0,GOOD TEACHER
568,1313908,5.0,4.0,Ankenman is a very dedicated professor and he works hard to make sure that his students have a thorough and complete  understanding of statistics for engineers. Unlike other professors he stresses the ability to apply what you have learned. Great class!
569,797834,1.0,4.0,"He doesnt care about his students at all, you will learn nothing in this course."
570,797834,2.0,2.0,worst class ever. DO NOT TAKE IT WITH HIM! You will not learn anything!
571,797834,5.0,1.0,Amazing
572,1838236,2.5,2.0,"He's a great person and cares about his students, but the material is dreadfully boring and though his powerpoints are good to read--he's not the most engaging lecturer. If you're having trouble in one of his classes--try talking to him one on one."
573,158883,1.0,5.0,2/3 exams are fully or mostly multiple choice written to mess you up. completely arbitrary selection of material to be tested over. mediocre lecturer. pretty unhelpful if you reach out to him and will literally laugh at you when you ask questions. will never take another class with him again 
574,158883,5.0,1.0,"He's awesome, if you're interested in learning. if you want to just take a class dont sign up. Go to class and do your work. You will do well. If not you will get a bad grade. "
575,158883,5.0,2.0,Absolutely hilarious. By far one of the best professors at CofC. Passionate about his work. Test difficulty is somewhere between ECON 200/201 tests and ECON 317/318 tests. Assigns multiple-choice homework before exams to help you review. TAKE HIM.
576,158883,4.5,5.0,Very difficult class for non-economics students.  But Witte makes things very enjoyable.  Very funny.  Very outgoing.  Unbearably smart.
577,158883,5.0,4.0,great to be around.
578,158883,5.0,5.0,best prof i ever had

582,158883,4.5,1.0,"The guy dressed up as Bevis for Halloween the year I had him. How can you not love that&#63; If you can do math and do the reading, you can get an A in his class."
583,158883,4.0,4.0,"Mark Witte is the bestest Mark Witte EVAR.  Making econ interesting is possible, and Prof Witte did it!"
584,158883,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Witte remembered me like 3 years after I took his class.  I swear if I walked up to him tomorrow, he'd remember me.  I was glad to see he is still at NU.  I don't know about the Hot/Not thing but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt."
585,158883,1.5,5.0,tests are completely devoid of lecture or reading material.  Applied mean has no bearing whatsoever to the grades people recieved.  A standard deviation of SEVENTEEN and the mean is 70.
586,158883,2.0,3.0,He reads from his notes...that are posted online. How is that enjoyable at all&#63;

603,320692,5.0,4.0,"I took the class 121-3, Special Topics: Gastronomy and Identity. It was a great class, different than the others I took in Spanish. Among other things, we had the opportunity to speak with real chefs from different countries of Latinoam&eacute;rica, and also we cooked."
604,320692,5.0,4.0,She really cares about her students. She is a genuine person.
605,320692,5.0,2.0,nicest prof out there. 10/10 would recommend. Very helpful and kind.
606,320692,1.0,5.0,She's full of herself. Don't take her!

608,320692,1.0,3.0,her teaching style is very poor and doesn't do a good job explaining or helping.
609,158906,5.0,2.0,One of the few classes I still think about at Northwestern!
610,158906,2.0,1.0,"Definitely doesn't life up to the hype.  For an Intro to Sociology class, there was far too much emphasis on the military and failure to emphasis important sociological theories.  Also, he told **** jokes on several occasions and one week he told Mexican jokes that were so offensive, the next week he publicly apologized to the class."
611,158906,4.0,2.0,"i had him in 1990 - fall of freshman year - and still remember that it was one of my favorite classes in undergrad, particularly for a massively large intro class. he made it so interesting - great lecturer."
612,158906,4.5,3.0,"One of the few classes that I actually looked forward to.  He is a very prominent prof that specializes in military sociology, and is often criticized or praised for coming up with the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy on gays in the military."
613,158906,1.5,3.0,"man, this guy is ridiculous.  I found some of his views on gay folks (especially his belief that they should be barred form the military) offensive and off-putting.  It made his other points less credible.  he also is not an especially talented lecturer.  skip him."
614,158906,4.0,3.0,"Took this class because I heard he was going to retire soon, and that he was an interesting lecturer.  I was a lil' disappointed, but it's probably because I don't like sociology (not Moskos)"
615,158906,1.5,3.0,"can be arrogant and very closed-minded, very vocal against ****s in the military"
616,158906,4.0,2.0,"He is really entertaining.  He brings soc out of the cut and dry material that it is, and relates it to class with polls and editorials. Definately take soc with Moskos!"
617,158906,5.0,1.0,Overrated but a good class
618,158906,5.0,2.0,Class is like watching a movie.  Watch for his random references to his friends Ralph Nadar and George Stephanopolus
619,158906,4.0,2.0,"Fun, interesting, entertaining lectures where you learn a lot. He's one of the best and it's sad to see him go. His favoritism of certain students, displays of arrogance (whoopty doo Princeton) and name dropping (yay Clinton) caused a couple eyes to roll."
620,158906,5.0,3.0,"Very informative prof. Easy to understand because he speaks like a normal human being, which is why some may call mistakenly call him  easy . Super Nice guy. Has students over his house for dinner occasionally. Studies military, doesn't  love  it."

625,2426055,5.0,5.0,I've never experienced anything like these in residency sessions. My life changed having taken them and I can't believe the amount that I learned. Transformational.
626,2426055,5.0,4.0,Practices what she preaches - this is a full immersion type of class where you're treated as an equal and your interests matter. You'll work really hard but won't know it because you design the project you want to do. She'll treat you like a colleague and mentor you - leaving you with an amazing end product. Learned more than any other class ever.
627,992461,5.0,3.0,"If you're a non-math major that needs a stats credit, take Jerry's class. He's awesome."
628,992461,4.0,3.0,HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT. Can't believe he is over 40!
629,992461,5.0,3.0,He is the nicest guy and very knowledgeable abougt statistics.  The professor always responds to phone calls and emails in a timely manner.  I would definitely take another course with him.  He is the hottest professor that I ever had.  I was not that interested in stats and was forced to take it.  But I went to all his classes because he was hot.
630,992461,3.0,3.0,"Total geek, but whatta babe"
631,1662169,5.0,4.0,"Excellent class, learned a lot more than I expected and enjoyed the process"
632,1662169,5.0,4.0,Difficult but excellent class. I highly recommend Professor Braun
633,1662169,5.0,4.0,I enjoyed the class a lot. The professor was very clear and helpful.
634,1662169,5.0,4.0,I am taking Prof Braun's class now. Prof Braun really goes out of his way to help his students. He has really good lecture slides and is very motivated to help us learn. I am fortunate to have taken his class.
635,1662169,5.0,4.0,"Best professor at Kellogg, I highly receommend"
636,1662169,5.0,4.0,Great class
637,1662169,5.0,4.0,"I am taking his Fin I currently on the Chicago campus. I really like the class and I am getting a lot our of it. Before this class I did not want to take it. Now, I am learning to like finance and I might even take Professor Braun's Fin II class this summer. Bottom line, Prof Braun is one of the best professors at Kellogg."
638,1662169,5.0,4.0,I am taking his Fin I class downtown.  Fantastic class. He brings finance to life.  Very dynamic.  Fortunate I took his Fin I class.
639,1662169,5.0,5.0,Great class. Very difficult final. Very good teacher the. Best so far
640,1662169,5.0,4.0,"Fin I with Braun is a very good class.  The Prof is very available and helpful.  He has great lecture notes and and a very intense lecture style, which makes the class very interesting.  I am actually learning to like finance."
641,1662169,5.0,4.0,Fin I with Professor Braun was a very valuable learning experience.  I am  not a finance person but I realy learned to appreciate the topic with Professor Braun.  I strongly recommend Professor Braun to all Kellogg students.
642,1662169,5.0,5.0,Turbo Finance was a great class with Braun. I strongly recommend students take the class with him.
643,1662169,5.0,5.0,Turbo Fin with Prof Braun is a great class.  The class is very intense and so is the Prof.  He really makes the material interesting to learn.
644,1662169,5.0,4.0,Best prfoessor I have had at Kellogg.  Strongly recommend
645,1662169,5.0,4.0,Great Prof.  Very helpful in and out of class.  Great lecture notes.
646,1873113,1.0,5.0,this man does not know how to teach a class. his lectures were scattered and had no real sense of structure. i had to learn everything online or through the textbook. he is rude to students and sometimes does not even show up to class. he had us sit through a lecture but he never came. smh.
647,1873113,1.0,4.0,"I took this class despite negative reviews. After 2 quarters with Priest, I regret not taking those reviews seriously. Dr. Priest is either unwilling or incapable of clearly explaining ANYTHING. He is condescending and rude to his students. His exams, like his lecturing and thought process, are INCOMPREHENSIBLE. And his ego makes class unpleasant."
648,1873113,1.0,1.0,Terrible professor. His teaching is so bad that you MUST read the textbook in advance to understand whats going on.
649,1873113,1.0,4.0,"Horrible professor, completely self-absorbed and creepy. Will never take a class with him again. I ended up teaching myself and passed the class with an A. Save yourself the money and headache. I though this school was top-notch. This man hardly understands chemistry."
650,1873113,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Priest was an amazing professor for orgo. Take him if you want a deep, complete understanding of organic chemistry. Don't take him if you want a good grade!"
651,1873113,5.0,4.0,His lectures are truly amazing. You will learn a lot and possibly suffer a lot.
652,1873113,4.5,4.0,Dr. Priest's class is rough but worth it. Prepares you for pre-medpre-healthlife like no other. 
653,1873113,2.5,5.0,Brutal.
654,1873113,2.5,5.0,The best!
655,1873113,5.0,4.0,OPP rocks! Makes orgo fun
656,150752,5.0,1.0,"I liked the class, but it isnt that end all be all of acadameia-It is weird that everyone thinks he is the messiah of history when all that he lectures on are things that can be gleaned from any history book on the Holocaust"
657,150752,5.0,4.0,The best lecturer I've ever heard. Absolutely wonderful.
658,150752,5.0,5.0,"AMAZING LECTURES!  Bring popcorn, his lectures are better than a movie.  All I can say is amazing!"
659,150752,5.0,4.0,"Every lecture is a rewarding experience, both for your mind and for your eyes."
660,150752,5.0,4.0,"Peter Hayes is awesome.  Some poeple think that he's pompous, but it's just that they aren't smart enough to see how brilliant he is."

668,455921,1.0,3.0,"Mueller's courses are a waste of time and tuition money. He is knowledgeable, but incapable of demonstrating a point with any clarity or brevity. He is simply an extremely poor teacher. I wish I had read and heeded his reviews before enrolling in the course."
669,455921,3.0,1.0,"Martin Mueller is not a great lecturer. His voice sounds like a cross between Cobra Commander of G.I. Joe fame, and a regular man with a bat stuck in his throat. he can't stay on point to save his life. However, he knows a hell of a lot about Shakespeare. His digressions are often amusing. And he's one hell of a nice guy. Also, it's an easy A."
670,455921,1.0,2.0,"The worst teacher I've ever had, period."
671,455921,1.0,5.0,"WORST PROF AT NU.  He's lost his damn mind.  Classes are usless garble, quizzes compeltely arbitrary and foreign, it was misery."
672,455921,3.5,2.0,Martin is a real unadulterated lecturer. His digressions are enthraling and you'll learn more from his many little known and sporadic facts than you have from anyone before.
673,1580280,5.0,4.0,"Take a class with Foster. He's an absolute media guru who understands the concept of getting pieces published. If you can't handle Foster's advice, you won't survive in the professional world."
674,1580280,1.5,5.0,"I STRONGLY CAUTION YOU AGAINST TAKING A CLASS WITH THIS MAN. I, personally, found him so condescending that I was not able to work effectively in his course. He gave off some very weird vibes and discounted everything I tried to say about my own writing and learning processes. Not an experience I wanted in grad school. STAY AWAY."
675,2718977,1.0,5.0,He isn't really working. He is showing off tomthr world he is but he is just wasting time
676,2718977,1.0,5.0,"He is very hands off as a PhD advisor, but doesn't really care about research. He doesn't actively work with you. He is very strategic too. His choice of problems are bad and is not competitive in academia. Overall, a bad choice for a PhD advisor."
677,158995,2.0,4.0,Pretty terrible with class content. Acts like everything is really simple when it's actually super confusing. Just seems to have forgotten what it's like to be a student.

If he likes you you'll get an A, because he certainly doesn't read any assignments you hand in. You won't really learn anything but you can get an easy A if you need it."
685,161076,5.0,1.0,"He is one of the best Profesor in the world. I was impressed that he also took part with john pilger video about Indonesia. He's smart, prestigious, and handsome guy. God bless you and your family Jeffrey"
686,161076,4.5,3.0,Professor Winters is very well versed in his field and a fantastic teacher. His 'Politics of Human Rights' course is highly recommended to anyone with interest in the subject or poly sci or history majors in general. Also a very accommodating prof and all-around nice guy. This was not the easiest class I have taken but I learned a lot. Thanks!
687,161076,5.0,3.0,"Boo to the boo'er of Winters, you abuser of human rights.  Try hanging out in Indonesia, learning the language, then hammering on human rights issues.  He eats human rights abusers for breakfast"

692,163136,5.0,5.0,Outstanding professor! Really takes time to understand his students and nurture them.  Gives great advice and very helpful in career as a student and a professional.  He is one of the true gems of Northwestern!
693,163136,4.5,2.0,"i had him in 1993 or 1994, and i still remember him. his class was fun. i remember that he really knew his stuff, but above all, he is super nice and - shockingly - remembered me years later at a reunion."
694,163136,5.0,5.0,"Whitaker is the best teacher I've ever had. On top of that, what a handsome guy. He has the most beautiful hands I've ever seen!"
695,1658183,5.0,1.0,"Bob is awesome! He has experience in the business and doesn't give too many homework or assignments. No tests- show up, pay attention, stay involved and you should do well in his class"
696,2581839,5.0,4.0,"This class was amazing! I grew a lot and gained skills that I will take to my professional and personal life. Eva had to teach 100% virtually but met with every student in individual Zooms plus class Zooms. Her group project was huge and intimidating, but ended up being a great experience and was on very current topics. Wish I could take her IRL."
697,867673,1.0,5.0,"I like live action role playing as much as the next guy. So when I heard that Dr. Mee was into that, I was totally pumped to attend her class. I love plushies but I'm not really sure why I paid for bio class though. I didn't learn anything about Biology. Her final exam was a mystery to me. I feel like I got bandersnatched by a jabberwokkee."
698,867673,1.0,5.0,"Quite possibly the worst teacher I have ever had. Her class is worthless and condescending. In class, she states her concern about us doing fractions alone but then the 4 HR EXAM has 400-level type questions entangled in her LARP scenarios. Also, unreliable. Esp at creating answer keys. Save your passion for bio and your GPA! Don't take this class!"
699,867673,5.0,3.0,"Pretty durn swell.  Not only did she provide a comprehensive and comprehensible intro to biology, she made it interesting and challenging enough to keep pre-meds engaged.  And this is the first time she's taught it!"
700,1570147,5.0,4.0,Erica Slotter is a fantastic lecturer. Helpful in and outside of class.
701,804216,4.5,2.0,"Jointly taught a very cool class on Intervention, International Law and Human Rights which got me hooked on Africa in general and the subject in particular. He also guest lectured on Africa in another class. Take a class with him if you get a chance."

Then again, a lot of long-term tenured professors have this problem; after years of dealing with people 1/3 of their age, they no longer care whether any of us enjoy or learn the material, especially because they can't be sacked. Just a paycheck, I guess."

718,474489,3.5,2.0,"Businesslike, professional, definitely master of material. Not so clear, tired/bored (he's been teaching this stuff a long time). Serious about actually teaching, but a bit of a drudge. Past his prime, but knows the (right) answer to any/all/every question on the subject."

724,474489,3.0,3.0,His book on the Holocaust is really boring.
725,699777,4.5,4.0,Hard class but you learn a lot.  Lectures are Useful but sometimes accent is  a little hard to follow.  He'll gladly repeat things or slow down if people just ask.  Very approachable.
726,1912216,1.0,4.0,"He never grade you. No matter how much time you spent on the assignments/final report, you are going to get a A. Unfair to students who made efforts. You'll almost learn nothing useful from this course. It's operation research. it has nothing to do with DS. Try a different course, if not try a different professor."
727,1912216,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Bhatti provides good instruction that is rarely followed. In my experience people have said that he does not give feedback. However, EVERY instance of feedback that he did provide was NOT heeded by students. People focus on how he presents information not the information that he provides. If I need trustworthy information, he is first."
728,1912216,1.5,2.0,"Expect 100% self learning in this class, mostly through the text book and other resources. Very little feedback on assignments,  mostly pertaining to form and not substance.   Video lectures are uninspired, with very low production values, and are essentially a reading our loud of the text book materials."
729,1912216,1.0,5.0,"Expect to learn from the textbook and receive little to no help from Dr. Bhatti. I asked for help after spending about 25 hours per week doing reading and assignments and he told me to watch his lecture videos twice. Additionally, be careful of the questions you ask--he can be very harsh if he thinks your question is stupid."
730,1912216,1.0,3.0,"Professor Bhatti might  be a machine learning algorithm. Taking this class is like interacting with Siri. Grading is automated and he follows a rubric that is highly inflexible, in really silly ways. It's laughably easy to get around his 7 discussion post requirement per week. On the plus side, he provides great references and resources."
731,1912216,2.0,4.0,Very boring course.  Essentially a lot of book reading.  Very little to no lecture or interaction provided.
732,1912217,1.0,4.0,Not great professor.
733,1912217,2.0,2.0,Basically all self-study.  Very little (no) teaching by the instructor.  The books were ok - and that's all we had to use.
734,1912218,5.0,4.0,"Prof Wedding brings real-world perspective of how to apply Data Science in a corporate setting into the classroom. His assignments are hard, but guides you against the pitfalls, he cares, and he teaches in such an engaging and accessible way. One of the best professors I've ever encountered."
735,1912218,5.0,3.0,Don is excellent and he shares a wealth of resources. He is very knowledgeable and realistic about what is possible and what is expected. He is very supportive if you do the work. He gave a significant amount of his time outside the course to discuss options for furthering studies after completing the MSDS. I highly recommend Professor Wedding.
736,1912218,5.0,4.0,Is extremely good at engaging and teaching people at different levels.
737,1912218,4.5,4.0,Just take him for PREDICT 411 and you'll be glad you did. 
738,1912218,5.0,1.0,Great professor. Very engaged with students. He is really helping the students to learn the material than just giving out grades.
739,1912218,5.0,1.0,Amazing instructor.  Very engaged.  Always available to help.  The class overall lacked much educational material in the form of lectures.  It was still mainly read the book and run the SAS code.  But he reviewed the homework towards the end of each week which was helpful in understaning the material.

743,556469,4.5,4.0,"The course is hard, but really interesting and you learn a lot. Prof is knowledgeable, chill and  willing to help you and is nice if you approach her. Recommended."
744,556470,5.0,5.0,My fave.
745,556470,1.0,4.0,Agreed -- a bitter man whose obvious brilliance is overshadowed by his even more obvious hatred of people.
746,556470,1.0,1.0,bitter man. i asked for advice and he was just bitter for no reason. i am happy i don't have to take his classes anymore.
747,556471,5.0,3.0,"Doctor Griswold is an extremely intelligent professor, she is very approachable and will always help if you need any."
748,556473,5.0,4.0,"Prof Hunter is an awesome teacher.  You will learn so much in his class, he is understanding, caring, and fun to be around.  Great teacher, great lectures, his is very very knowledgeable.  You won't regret taking his class.  He is wonderful"
749,556473,5.0,2.0,Great Sociology teacher!  Best at Northwestern.  Hunter is the best
750,556473,5.0,2.0,One of the best profs.  Really good...
751,556485,4.5,2.0,"sociology of law -- excellent!  Great Prof.  Smart, funny, helpful.  Does all his grading -- no TAs.  Yay.  Take the class"
752,1971657,3.0,4.0,She was okay!
753,1971657,2.0,5.0,I watched these lectures on the mediasite website and boy am I glad I skipped this class. Its a little harsh the way she was acting and she came across as rude the way she was putting down the students.
754,1971657,2.5,4.0,"She is slightly below average, but an easy A if she likes you."
755,1971657,1.5,3.0,Anna was very engaging in this class however she wasn't very comfortable with the material. It was awkward seeing her stumble through what she was teaching. A little on the off side but overall an average teacher at best.
756,1971657,1.5,5.0,"Where to start, unclear on her material, rude, abrasive, and very condescending. She openly mocks and belittles the students for making points. She is a tough grader and she is quite honestly the class you regret you took. "
757,556494,5.0,2.0,Incredible!
758,1314256,4.5,1.0,Great
759,2264537,2.0,1.0,Expectations aren't clear. She thinks her class is harder than it is. Slow to provide feedback. Easy grader but I don't think I learned anything. Lots of reading but you could probably do fine without doing all the readings.
760,2264537,5.0,3.0,"This professor is passionate and knowledgeable, although she sometimes is a little scattered. Final is challenging."
761,2264537,1.0,1.0,"No direction, no learning. Definitely not in par with Northwestern standards. Took it because it was core course. NOT RECOMMEND at all."
762,2264537,1.0,1.0,It's our obligation to stand up for what's right.
763,2436571,5.0,4.0,"This was for the MSDS 410: LInear Regression course. The professor provided extremely thorough course material. I can't speak highly enough of the professor's preparation, mastery of the subject, and ability to teach the subject intelligibly. Absolutely loved the class, extremely interesting course material and a great learning experience."
764,1979884,1.0,3.0,Grading often based on his opinions and his perspective
765,1979884,1.0,3.0,Provides inconsistent grading. The feedback he provides often doesnt make sense and nitpicks on things he can find.
766,1979884,1.5,4.0,Who 'doesn't do email' with an online course? Constant complaints about how many students he has to teach. BS assignments and overemphasis on discussion boards with really generic questions: 'What makes a good manager?'
767,1979884,1.0,4.0,"Unclear guidelines and not very good at explaining anything.  Not very understanding of the concerns of the students, but just talks about what he wants from the students.  Pretty much the worst professor I've had.  I emailed him with questions and he answers easy questions, but just stops replying if he doesn't like anything from the email."
768,638445,5.0,4.0,"Nice guy, smart. Would not take again cuz final paper pain in as. Weekly assignment: video &amp; forum response to question. In video, address both sides 2 your stance 4 good grade. Video has time min, but prof want better explanation over long video where u bs. Discussion forum same. Took in summer term, no grade yet &gt;:( Not caveman, character limit"

772,1795605,5.0,2.0,Renee is AWESOME. You should take any class of her that's available. The best lecturer I've ever had hands down.
773,1478167,4.5,3.0,Great instructor and even gives ample opportunity to make up lost points.
774,1478167,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, she's clearly very knowledgeable in her field and she also teaches with great positive energy. Do the assigned readings and participate in class discussion and I promise, the quarter will fly by."
775,1478167,5.0,3.0,"Really fun teacher, very interesting and knowledgable about what she teaches.  I've taken several classes from her; she grades fairly, most of her exams are purely multiple choice. Exams are 75% lecture and 25% book, but she is always clear and is an amazing teacher.  Need more teachers like her."
776,2020890,5.0,4.0,"Considering he is an active performer, his record as a teacher is mind blowing. Former students playing in the Berlin Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, and countless positions in academia. If you are driven, he will work you very hard, but you will come out of it a solid musician."
777,2020890,1.0,3.0,I paid $45000 a year tuition to attend Northwestern to study with Professor Mulcahy and he missed 60% of the academic year. He was away doing other projects. He started teaching to get his hours in before the year had begun and before I arrived in Evanston. I got a lesson with him 2x a quarter (which was not what he promised when I applied).
778,2020890,2.0,3.0,Wow! He goes on vacation for 4.5 weeks in the middle of a 10 week quarter. Then wants to give make-up lessons over thanksgiving break when everyone has arranged to travel home.
779,2020890,1.0,5.0,I partially agree with previous comments: sarcastic - yes; hilarious - not if it's directed towards you! Inspirational - when he's not too busy badmouthing other trombone players. The bone studio at NU is simply too big. Very little chance for individual attention. Mulcahy stops any honest feedback with intimidation.
780,2020890,3.0,3.0,"Hilarious, sarcastic and inspirational. "
781,2020890,2.0,4.0,"It is great to hear Professor Mulcahy play in the CSO every week, but that is where his interest lies. His teaching  is second to his playing and you feel that as a student. You get about 2 lessons a quarter with him. For the cost of tuition, I wanted more help."
782,2020890,1.5,5.0,"Professor MULCAHY is a great trombone player. However, in my lessons he would often speak in disparaging terms about his colleagues in the CSO. You get a lesson with him about every 5 weeks and sometimes he seems more interested in sending texts on his phone than teaching. Studio class can be variable. Inspiring one week, distracted the next."
783,2020890,2.5,4.0,"After auditioning and being accepted to the NU trombone studio, I was excited to study with Professor Mulcahy. However, in my 2 year Graduate degree, I had surprisingly few actual lessons with him (even though he assured me at the audition that I would get one about every 2 weeks). I had more lessons in 1 semester in my undergrad than in 2 years NU"
784,2713156,3.0,2.0,"Discussion board posts weekly with expectation to post 3x (once initially, two replies). Had to read the book to answer the questions. Easy A on them though. 2 short papers, pretty easy plus he gave templates. Final group project we didn't get enough feedback on. Lectures were not helpful and hard to hear over Zoom. Overall not bad not great"
785,2713156,2.0,3.0,Somewhat unclear assignments
786,2713156,1.0,2.0,"Unclear instructions in assignments, and the grading criteria doesnt match. Heavy work load and didnt reply your inquires."
787,1820259,4.0,3.0,take his class
788,1820259,1.0,1.0,"Wonderful professor. Recommends his students to return books after reading when they buy it from amazon. He has no problem with underlining, marking books and returning them."
789,1820259,5.0,2.0,"Josh is an amazing professor, engaging, funny, and really smart. He keeps class relevant and interesting. Willing to engage ideas contrary to his own. Willing to during office hours. Readings are super interesting. TAKE HIS CLASS."
790,159339,5.0,3.0,She is the best! She explains complicated concepts extremely well and puts them in a way her students can understand. Finally - I understand how to conquer word problems!!
791,159339,5.0,4.0,"Sweet, clear, fabulous fabulous fabulous. Take her classes, give her apples. She's the best."
792,159339,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher, amazing woman!"

796,2113136,3.5,4.0,Lots of reading and analysis of articles.
797,892534,5.0,5.0,Johannes was a awesome professor.  He was always availiable outside of office hours if needed. The accordian rules!
798,892534,5.0,3.0,Best teacher EVER!
799,1590913,5.0,3.0,"Jeff is very organized and gives you all the assignments up front.  There is a fair amount of work each week, but if you manage your time effectively, you can get ahead of schedule.  I finished the course 10 days early so I could start summer sooner.  You will learn a ton."
800,1590913,4.5,5.0,"Bad: u have 2 read A TON of stuff. Then u have the written assignment each class and then u have 2 post on the forum + 2 projects (mine is 35pg). Jeff is 2 strict about timing. Good: professor is awesome I loved his lectures. He is very professional+clear to understand. I am not native & can't do much useless verbage, so I ended up with B-"
801,1787531,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Jarrell was awful.  He often told us certain subjects were ""not his favorite"" or ""not his forte"" and would just tell us about how he slept through college courses.  He barely ever actually taught.  Towards the end of the quarter he ran out of time to actually teach.  I don't know why he didn't just skip the stuff he didn't like and teach later."
802,2035352,3.5,2.0,Dr. McNally structures this required course nicely.  Each week there are 2  chapter reviews.  You also write a paper on a leaderleadership book. A two person team will present a chapter and coordinate a class exercise each week.  Dr. McNally is very knowledgeable on the subject and the class is entertaining. 
803,2023075,5.0,4.0,Derek Nelson is an amazing professor and the best I have had in a STEM course. He has an impressive ability to portray complex course material in an understandable way while covering an inane amount of information in each class. There are daily quizzes which are exceptionally difficult. You have to study as much for them as the exams.
804,2023075,1.0,4.0,"Nelson is horrible. He is the most apathetic, uncaring instructor I have ever had. He clearly does not care about his students nor their success or well-being. His teaching style is horrible and his lectures consist of monotone monologues where he discusses material at a level far too high for introductory organic chemistry students. Just terrible."
805,2023075,5.0,4.0,"The best professor I have ever had - clear, direct, wildly knowledgable. He is helpful in and out of the classroom, and never failed to clearly communicate an idea. Love this guy"
806,2023075,4.0,4.0,"(I'm an SPS student so YMMV if you're undergrad) Good lecturer although the class is brutally fast, but not his fault he has to get through so much content in a short time. Challenging and tricky daily quizzes - do the HW and GO TO OFFICE HOURS &amp; you should be okay. Generous curves. Solid guy. IDK about the hot pepper though. YMMV."
807,2023075,1.0,4.0,"Treats most questions as an inconvenience to his poorly conceived lectures, does not probe for understanding. Examples given in practice quizzes and exams often contain erroneous answers that confuse many students, and are often the sort of unfair gotcha exam questions that seem to have more relevance in establishing arrogant superiority."
808,2023075,5.0,3.0,Nelson is great! Wish he taught orgo as well.  Clear lectures. Tests are aligned with topics covered in class; no surprises on exams. Super approachable. Thumbs up!
809,2023075,5.0,5.0,Took the entire sequence with Professor Nelson. Very happy with my knowledge. Lectures are perfectly structured.
810,2023075,5.0,5.0,"Class was hard, requires a lot of time to understand material. Lectures are very well organized and professor is great at explaining"
811,2023075,5.0,5.0,"Class is hard, but worth it! Derek Nelson is the best"
812,2023075,5.0,3.0,Dr Nelson is the bomb. He made organic chemistry lab a party every single week
813,1652403,3.0,5.0,Very difficult woman in general. Quizzes/tests/assignments designed to trip you up. You will learn a lot but through your own struggling outside of class. Serious time commitment likely required.
814,1652403,2.0,4.0,"I've taken 3 classes with her, no one has received an A. I have received a 92.73 and was told that my work was &quot;great, but not A quality&quot;, this was the top grade for the course. Does not give clear expectations and believes leaving out instructions is key to building good developers."
815,1652403,3.0,4.0,"Although her grading was tough and goes through material very quickly, its with the expectation that you read the material before class and you have 2 weeks to complete assignments. Her quizzes are hard, but its open notes and open book. Where she provides the most value is in her industry insight. Advice: stay ahead and ask industry questions"
816,1652403,1.0,4.0,Great lecturer but doesn't like to give anyone an A even if they have earned it. Hater.
817,1652403,1.5,3.0,"Exams are difficult, written with an attempt to trick you. 98% of class time is spent watching her blow through PowerPoint slides; no actual programming work is ever done in class. Might was well try and learn to speak Arabic watching someone run through a slide deck for 3 hours. Knowledgeable but stubborn."
818,876233,5.0,3.0,"Professor Stern taught this class at INSEAD Singapore in November 2014. I took it there, and it was one of the best classes I have taken at INSEAD. I was just sorry that it was the last class I took because I just graduated so my mind was already elsewhere. I am glad though that it was my last experience at INSEAD. Highly recommended if he ever com"
819,876233,5.0,4.0,Outstanding! Updated examples with clear academic theory.
820,876233,5.0,4.0,Best MORS course at Kellogg!
821,876233,4.5,3.0,"I took this class 2 years ago and found how much helpful it was only recently, as I am using the material to manage a change at my work place. I wish I could have taken it again!"
822,876233,5.0,4.0,Great teacher!
823,876233,5.0,4.0,Best class I had at Kellogg!

825,876233,1.5,4.0,"If you can get the slides, don't bother to show up -- he just reads from them.  He plays favorites, which is even worse. Don't bother to meet with him to ask why -- he makes up a bunch of MORS-y crap. I learned very little in this class; it was all obvious. One of the worst classes I took at Kellogg -- take Power in Orgs with Weber instead."
826,1677003,4.5,3.0,He's cool
827,2354892,5.0,4.0,My favorite professor in undergrad. Changed my college experience and how I view the world. 100% recommend for classics majors/minors 
828,2354892,1.0,4.0,"Professor Wallace is the epitome of the professor you DON'T want in your college experience. I'd take literally any other class at this school before I take one with him again. He loves to go on off-topic political rants, is opinionated, and rudely calls out the flaws in students' writing. He is disorganized and has no plan. You can do better."
829,2354892,1.0,4.0,"I was a TA for Prof. Wallace. Undergrads, don't take classes with this man. He misteaches half of the material (not exaggerating, it's stuff I knew by the time I was a sophomore), is incredibly egotistical/condescending, and makes racist comments about students behind their backs. You're better off with any other prof in our department."
830,442062,4.5,2.0,"I really loved this class! Although his class was about four hours long I never got bored because of how passionately Curtis talks about his subject. He's very helpful when you ask for help, he's a fair grader and you can learn A LOT of useful information in his class! Looking forward to taking another class with him."
831,442062,4.5,3.0,"He's extremely passionate about his work. Funny and makes class more lively. If you do the work and follow up with everything, you'll do well. He's a fair grader."
832,442062,4.5,3.0,"curtis is awesome, he's so passionate about what he talks about and because of his passion he makes me and probably a lot of other students want to learn more, go to class, do the work, and plus he's funny and he makes analyzing film so enjoyable."
833,442062,4.5,4.0,What  a wonderful teacher.  Knows SO MUCH about so SO MANY things that it's just a joy to have him teaching you his ways.
834,442062,4.0,4.0,"220 Is an enjoyable class overall, although your TA can make or break you. Mine killed me over the smallest things and was entirely unhelpful. Watch out for Margaret! Some of the movies are cool, others are boring, take it if you're a film major, not worth"

837,442062,5.0,3.0,One of greatest profs at NU. I miss Bordwell & Thompson. I was a lazy ass(regretfully)and did well and I'm no film analysis genius.The material is amazing and Curtis is awesome...it shows that he prepares really damn well for class...he memorized all our names in a class of 100!
838,442062,3.0,3.0,Avoid 220 like the plague (unless you're RTVF and absolutely have to). Curtis instructs his TAs to fail a certain number of people per class. Don't say I didn't warn you...
839,2623189,4.0,5.0,He was great! Tests were pretty hard though. Definitely wanna use the previous tests he provides as guidance
840,2606810,2.0,5.0,"Video lectures are a little drawn out, but she is knowledgeable about CBT. All projects are due during the final week and you can't work ahead, so you have no idea whether or not you're going to pass. This class was described by a NU faculty member as &quot;an active GPA killer.&quot; It's required for counseling students, but I would not recommend."
841,2105058,5.0,1.0,Lectures on Husimi Q representation and superconductivity were superb!  Also quantum triviality and the Wilson renormalization group.  Both are VERY hot topics in field theory now and he did them well.
842,2105058,5.0,1.0,Genius Should spend more time on quantum triviality
843,2019062,5.0,3.0,Now I love music theory - she makes sure you find a way to make connections. I look forward to class.
844,2019062,5.0,2.0,"Dr. P's course is absolutely stellar! She is incredibly kind and very dedicated to all of her students, very thorough and plans the course in such a way that assignments are comfortably timed. Her enthusiasm is contagious. I am learning so much and having a blast doing it. My favorite class!"
845,2576118,5.0,3.0,"I've had Dr. Ventrella as a professor in two lab classes and Biochemistry lecture. She is an amazing professor who cares deeply for her students and goes to great lengths to help them succeed. Tests are very fair and there are many resources provided to prepare you. She is also very receptive to feedback, down to earth, and overall a great person!!"
846,1920761,4.5,3.0,"Sara is amazing. She's very funny, very clear, and very easy to learn from."
847,165625,2.0,2.0,"Worst core curriculum course that I took at Northwestern. Professor actually repeated an entire lecture that he had given a week earlier. Often cut class short. As a result very little material was covered. Course ended with a hurried, cursory reading of Erie RR v Tompkins. I learned much more about civ pro during bar preparation."
848,165625,5.0,5.0,"The best teacher, for one of the most dreaded courses in law school. Take this guy if you can."
849,165625,5.0,5.0,"Funny, helpful, brilliant, great speaker.  He's not only one of the foremost academics in the classes he teaches, he is also quite talented at doing exactly that - teaching."
850,165625,5.0,5.0,"Great teacher, brilliant guy.  Some people think he borders on egotistical.  I didn't find this to be the case, and even if it was his ability easily makes up for it."
851,165625,5.0,4.0,"After first semester, do not waste your time with his classes if you only want to learn the &quot;blackletter&quot; basics.  His classes are valuable in that they take the law and place it in a theoretical context which is holistic yet nuanced.  Great if you're into the &quot;theory&quot; of law."

854,159484,4.0,4.0,Generally a good professor
855,159484,2.0,3.0,I had heard some good things and some bad things about the class so I decided to give it a shot.  The material was interesting but the discussions lacked any guidance.  Overall I felt like Prof. Fenrich was more interested in being the &quot;cool guy&quot; than teaching the class.
856,159484,5.0,3.0,Fantastic prof...great sense of humor and expectations are clear and managable. I would highly recommend taking any of his classes. Who could dislike a prof who likes to end the semester over drinks&#63; Loved him!
857,159484,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic prof........funny, intelligent. I would highly recommend him."
858,159484,5.0,4.0,It's been almost 5 years since i took a course from fenrich but i still remember him.  took a total of 3 classes from him - he makes history fresh/relevant. you will work but you will learn.  totally objective in grading. LOVE the films. he's responsible for introducing NU kids to dr. strangelove!
859,159484,5.0,4.0,"Among the Top 10 Classes you have to take at NU.  And with this prof!  Prof. Fenrich is by far the best professor at NU.  The workload is considerable, but the knowledge and experience with him is well worth it."
860,159484,4.0,3.0,"He's just a whole lotta fun.  My friend and I got front row seats for most of his lectures.  Love his lecturing style, enthusiasm, and his incorporation of relevant flicks to help us understand the times.  Plus he's just a doll!"

862,159484,5.0,4.0,You will work for him but you will find it rewarding.  Excellent at leading thoughtful discussions without injecting his opinions into them (as many profs do).  You will not be afraid to express your views in his class.  Purely objective grader.

She's willing to accomodate you, and let you redo assignments if you screw them up. She even made me consider taking a french minor, because she made the class so enjoyable"
867,1814276,4.5,4.0,"His standards are high and he requires a lot of reading, but Dr. Kramer is not unreasonable. He uses technology is a great way to augment the course. He is a very good teacher."

869,966410,1.0,3.0,Worst teacher ever
870,741147,4.0,3.0,"I had a freshman seminar with Prof Walsh, and I really enjoyed it! He always has fun anecdotes to tell during class and his passion for ecological restoration is infectious. The workload was pretty heavy (TONS of readings), but at the end of the day, you really do learn a lot about the environment! Def recommend if you're interested in ecology."
871,741147,5.0,3.0,Passionate and experienced in teaching concepts of local ecology.
872,741147,2.0,4.0,Class is confusing and all his assessments are basically short answer and must include every single point to get full points... Many times instructions of the question doesn't even tell you how much to include in the answer so you have to just guess how much you need to write... Not a fan
873,741147,1.0,4.0,"Bs's through every lecture. Appears as if he's seeing his power point presentation for the first time. Exams/quizzes poorly worded=you lose points. Forget about asking a question, you'll be even more confused.Lecture a waste of time. Selected textbook horrible.You will have sleepless nights/restless days.Keep up with the readings. Be good at stats."
874,2709279,1.0,3.0,"Unorganized, unprofessional, doesnt show up for meetings, goes off topic often in lecture, wont respond via her preferred methods of contact, stated students dont deserve professional courtesy in a grad program, at which point I dropped the class for another professor. Dont waste your time/money."
875,892709,5.0,3.0,"You will do exceptional in Sam's class if you are not late for class, do not miss a class, and start your final paper early, I recommend in the first week, there may be extra credit if you submit it 2 - 3 days early."
876,892709,5.0,2.0,A great Professor despite his Progressive rants
877,892709,5.0,3.0,"Sam is the most awesome prof, funny and easy on the eyes."
878,892709,5.0,1.0,He's funny and cool
879,892709,5.0,3.0,"Sam is a great professor! He is laid back and awesome to listen too. He really wants you to learn and makes that clear to you from the first day of class. I have taken two classes with him and I'm hoping for a third sometime soon! If you get a chance to take one of Sam's classes, do yourself a favor, and take it! :)"
880,892709,4.5,2.0,I took 3 classes with Sam because he is GREAT!!!  Before his classes I never thought that studying can be so entertaining. I learned a lot through a lot of fun!!!
881,892709,4.5,3.0,"Sam is really a great professor. He makes each class interesting by making it real, not just teaching theory. He also has real world experience since he has an actual day job so its even more cool that he keeps teaching. Everyone should take his classes."
882,892709,5.0,4.0,I never wanted to miss this course! The prof WANTS you to get the info...and extends himself so that you do! You will never have a more informed/cool prof! SAMBO ROCKS!
883,892709,5.0,3.0,"Yeah, he's cool, he's funny, he's smart, and he keeps the class completely interested.  High energy.  GREAT prof!"

888,892709,3.5,3.0,"so, this guy is pretty cool and funny. but he can be a real d*ck! his exams are impossible. but he's a pretty easy grader. i passed, and i didn't pay attention at all."
889,771881,1.0,2.0,"We only had a couple of homework assignments, and he ultimately graded them pretty leniently, but his instructions were super vague and confusing. I knew multiple people in my class, and none of us ever felt like we really understood what was going on. Also, he's not a good lecturer and makes weird, somewhat rude comments to students."

893,2189103,5.0,4.0,This class is hard if you haven't taken math since high school.
894,2189103,4.0,4.0,Knows her stuff. Good teacher. Easy on the eyes. Can't ask for more than that.
895,894798,5.0,1.0,"A fun class-maybe confusing for those who don't remember high school physics, but otherwise, it was awesome"
896,894799,5.0,2.0,"Ken Alder is AMAZING. He was one of the best professors I've ever had, period. If you don't take a class with him, you will regret it for the rest of your life! He is extremely clear, interesting, engaging, and plain brilliant. He also cares a lot for his students and manages to make the History of Western Medicine actually fun!"
897,894799,5.0,2.0,Awesome Professor-very Interesting and fun!
898,894799,2.0,1.0,"Ok, I guess."
899,163678,4.5,3.0,"If you have to take College Physics then Rivers is the person you want as your instructor.  The material is difficult but this guy works to make his lectures interesting.  He is also open to questions before, during and after class.  He is a great communicator and is method of solving problems is organized and structured."
900,163678,5.0,3.0,Great professor- loves what he's doing and tries to help in any way possible

If he had never told me about the syntonic comma, I might still be struggling to play the Kodaly Solo Sonata; now that I know the comma of Didymus is approximately 22 cents, I can be free in my performance."
908,1814380,2.5,1.0,"Mr Gordon is the easiest teacher in the world. If you get anything lower than an A in his class you should withdraw yourself from college. You learn absolutely nothing in his class. You're better off just reading the textbook & never coming to class. Take this class if you want a A, but avoid him if you want to learn about accounting."

927,1832831,3.5,3.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed taking her class.  She made the class fun and interesting.  Plus, she was always willing to answer questions and would even stay after class to speak with students.  The textbook is not necessary because her presentations cover everything you need to know.  She wants her students to succeed and it shows.  Highly recommend"
928,2045827,5.0,2.0,Eric was one of the most laid back professors I've ever had. He was very clear about what needed to be done for the papers and the work never felt overwhelming. There is some extra work on the side but it's very helpful for the papers so I didn't mind doing it. Very lax due dates and worked around schedules with busy students. Great professor.
929,2045827,1.0,4.0,"He's a smart guy, but he had trouble explaining things to students who weren't already at his level. I survived, but it was a pain even for NU. He spent too much time talking about philosophy and not enough on our homework. His feedback wasnt clear and didn't help me improve. I wish I'd taken one of the other sections that were more interesting.  "
930,1806219,1.0,4.0,"I would not take the summer with Northrup. Avoid at all costs. His lectures are unbearable, and I learned better through textbook. He tries to show as nice, but he does not care about his students at all."
931,1806219,1.0,1.0,Very inconsiderate. Avoid.
932,1806219,4.0,4.0,"The best prof in my undergrad. You have to take him in the summer though. Super helpful and the whole class loved him. It's not easy, but the curve is amazing."
933,1865618,3.5,4.0,"Great class but very high expectations. On tests, there is no partial credit. It is either 100% correct or it's 100% wrong + expect to be blindsided.  Also be warned that she uses several sources instead of one textbook but she won't tell you that. The class is organized by body region so expect to jump around the textbook, when she does use it."
934,905107,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Ott is a great chemistry professor. She is very throrough at explaining if you dont understand, and like others mentioned, she makes herself available for you. Quizzes are every week, but not bad because its material u just learned and you have time to study. I would recommend her for CHM 120."
935,905107,3.0,5.0,"Most people in my class failed her initial midterm.  She is clearly passionate about chemistry, but has some time management issues, which makes it hard for her to explain things in an appropriate manner.  She tries to be helpful and accessable but kind of fails. =/ Really nice though! However, I doubt I'd recommend her."
936,905107,4.5,3.0,"Great professor. Organized, accessible and professional. Communicates ideas clearly and concisely. Lectures were never dull. Exams are challenging but conquerable (well ... most of them) if you study hard."
937,905107,5.0,4.0,She is really organized and is very good at explaining. She is willing to help you if you ask for it. Graded exams and quizzes are returned quickly.
938,905107,4.5,2.0,"I got into a car accident on the day of the quiz and came in late. Not only i wasnt allowed to retake the quiz at a later time, but i was asked to complete as much as i can and submit with everyone else. I solved all but one problem and had points deducted for that one missing answer. A police report from my accident was of no use! Tough lady! heh"
939,905107,4.5,4.0,Dr. Ott is a great teacher! She might not do a very good job at explaining but if you go back to the book it will make a lot of sense. She is helpful and really nice. I actually overslept for the final exam and she called me to wake me up! Obviously a really caring teacher for those that care about the class! I recommend her!
940,905107,3.0,3.0,"She's dull.  She is great at taking notes of the lectures, but I can do that.  She doesn't really understand the material, or if she does, she does a terrible job at teaching it.  She is extremely straightforward, because she reads off her notes.  She often has trouble solving her own problems, and is really useless to visit out of class."
941,905107,5.0,1.0,"She is really knowledgeable, and her notes are very clear.  Northwestern is lucky to have her.  By the way this rating is for her summer class at CLC"
942,905107,4.5,2.0,Wonderful teacher. Really great at explaining things. Gives great examples.
943,905107,4.5,3.0,"She is a good teacher. She is organized and very well prepared. There are no barriers to learning in this class. Read the book, do the hw, go to class, take notes and it is easy to get an A. Don't expect any pity from her if you don't attend class regularly or don't do the hw. She is totally complacent about her student's progress in the class."
944,905107,5.0,3.0,"Hey, she might be snarky (seriously -- why mock people's grades&#63;  That's cold, Miss Lady) but she's smart, clear, and pedagogically sound.  It's challenging, but you're taking this 'cause you want to go to med/dent/some other All-Growed-Up school.  So suck it up, study hard, and you'll be well prepared by Doc Ott."

The classwork is challenging, but rewarding, and definitely a motivational set of tools to explain the complexity of our world. Highly recommend."

952,2160548,1.0,1.0,Not a good human being 
953,2160548,1.0,5.0,"She is a good musician and horrible mentor and educator, who is ruled by her ego. Study with her at your own risk. She puts her own ego above her students&#39; well-being. She doesn&#39;t care about the psychological damage she inflicts on young people."
954,2160548,2.0,5.0,"High schoolers reading comments to determine where to audition/enroll - really consider what you want out of a program. This is a classical, orchestral program with few outside gigs/time/anything unrelated to music. Similar to Peabody in my opinion. Know that you will work hard and experience very little at NU, which still gives you a good music ed"
955,2160548,2.0,5.0,"Her job is to make you a better musician, so she's tough. Culturally she's not into pats on the back. Know that going in. Outside of class she's an incredibly nice human being. The cons are that she has a lot going on outside of NU, so she's gone/busy a lot.  Studying with her allows for no outside activities. Little empathy for other interests."
956,2160548,2.0,5.0,"Great musician & businessperson. Generally a nice person. Perfect for grad students. Lack of organizational skills/ability to plan have negative impact on undergrads who have to take non-music classes too. Don't count on being able to work, socialize, travel or participate in Greek life/clubs. Need to be very flexible with your time to study w/her."
957,2160548,2.0,5.0,"I agree with first poster. Prof Wu doesn't provide positive feedback, but she's an excellent percussionist. There's never a ""good enough,"" which makes for excellent musicians. The problem at the university level is that she does not allow for any electives, evening/weekend plans, university activities/clubs, travel, double majoring or employment."
958,2160548,1.0,5.0,"Great percussionist with limited teaching ability or planning skills. No encouragement, only criticism. Additional rehearsals scheduled weekdays/nights (ending 12 am or later), most weekends & some holidays. Very little notice is given of scheduling, but you're expected to attend even if you have other classes or outside conflicts including a job."

960,1785780,5.0,3.0,Excellent Professor!
961,1785780,5.0,3.0,"Super cool guy. I took him online for a IT Strategy class and thought his lectures were relevant based on his experience and the HW assignments were challenging yet if you put in the time, energy, thought you will be fine.  I would for sure take his class again."
962,1785780,3.5,3.0,"One of the most engaged Professors.  He puts a lot of information into his lecture slides.  Very engaged in the topic of IT strategy.  The  book material is dry.  Plan on reading and writing a lot in this course.  Also, the exams require you to attend the lectures and complete the assignments.  Not much feedback on exams and papers."
963,1785780,4.5,3.0,I really enjoyed the class and the principles we discussed are very applicable to the IT industry.  He's got great experience and has passion for the topic.
964,1785780,4.5,2.0,Pretty clear lecture and easy to understand... Submit Home works in time and you will be all right.
965,919490,5.0,4.0,"Katie was a tough teacher but if you were willing to do the work and put in the effort, she will do whatever it takes to help you achieve an ""A"".  She takes class seriously and gives a lot back in terms of real life examples and professionalism.  I learned so much from class - I would definately attend another one of her classes in the future."
966,919490,4.5,1.0,"Strict and sometimes pedantic, but she knows her stuff. If you are planning on not turning in essays or not showing up/showing up late to class you will not like her. Otherwise, she is very passionate and knowledgeable about the English language and a good professor."
967,919490,2.0,3.0,Teacher has no heart. She sucks.
968,1957832,1.0,4.0,Prem is a pretty terrible professor who shovels materials at you. We spent an inordinate amount of time on density matrix formulation which is mostly useless for calculating anything. Very little time was spent learning nonlinear optics in a way that is useful. Prem has an attitude problem where his chief concern is to see  how you stack up.
969,1468361,3.0,3.0,good professor.
970,1935317,1.0,3.0,"Professor Swan was my thesis advisor many years ago, and sadly, it ended up being a bit of a traumatic experience for me as her feedback and advising was critical and condescending, as opposed to helpful and constructive. If you work with her, make sure to go in with eyes wide open on that."
971,1015783,5.0,3.0,Colom-Mena makes the study of Spanish very interesting. He is eager to help the students to learn and is very attentive. Take his class if you want to learn and improve your mastery of Spanish.
972,1015783,5.0,1.0,"If you want to take a really good Spanish course, take one from Joel.  He cares a lot about his students,and if you really like Spanish, you will learn so much."
973,1533937,1.0,1.0,"I don't think he has a very good reputation. Plus, whatever he teaches has no bearing in real life. Why would rich people interact with poor people?"
974,1533937,2.0,2.0,"If you look at where your professors have taught, if it's multiple locations, it should tell you something..."
