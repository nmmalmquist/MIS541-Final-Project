0,958471,3.0,4.0,"I can confirm many of the other comments here, at least as I experienced class with Prof Snider. I found her condescending as well. The worst part was her unwillingness to correct grading errors when she was in fact incorrect. I like all the other professors I've had at UVA, but I would not recommend Prof Snider."
1,958471,1.0,3.0,"Her teaching is strictly worse than reading the textbook yourself. She only copies grey boxes and some proofs from the book to the blackboard. She even needs to look at the note for simple algebras (e.g. solving linear equations). When not looking at the textbook, she only says ""I expect you to be able to do this,"" without explaining anything."
2,958471,3.5,4.0,"Snider is a good instructor in that she gives clear, consistent explanations with lots of examples. She is not trying to be your friend, and has a 0 tolerance policy towards lateness, talking, eating, texting, laptop use. She is extremely condescending, there is no other way to put it. Be warned, the final is MUCH more difficult than the tests."
3,958471,2.5,4.0,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! DARIA WILL MAKE YOU HATE MATH
4,958471,3.0,4.0,She has a condescending tone. She had generally inconvenient office hours. You are really going to have to try hard in this class.
5,958471,4.0,4.0,She teaches material effectively. Notation is VERY important in probability! Difference between lower case fx(x) and uppercase Fx(x) represent 2 totally different functions! So other criticism that she deducts for notation is unfair. shes good teacher. Shes generous with partial credit when you get problem wrong. She curves grades end of semester
6,958471,2.0,3.0,"When studying for quizzes and tests, she tells the class to &quot;go for the understanding&quot;. But when grading, she'll take points off for semantic errors even when it's clear the logical steps and answer are correct. She is incredibly condescending and impatient when answering students' questions in class. And she teaches almost directly from the book."
7,958471,3.0,5.0,"She comes off as extremely elitist and demanding, but apparently she's actually nice in office hours. She does examples from the book... not really a good indication of what's on the test. She MAY make you feel like an idiot for asking a question; she has responded with comments like &quot;An 'A' student would know the answer to that question.&quot;"
8,958471,5.0,4.0,"Professor snider is a very good teacher. It is a hard class,  but I learned a lot. I sat in the front row and really tried, rather than complaining about the professor (many people enter with bad attitudes). Her class was not bad at all. Office hours are really helpful! I was in there every chance I got. She was not condescending, but very nice."
9,958471,3.5,4.0,"Tough class. None of the professors were exceptional. Most of the comments about Prof. Snider are fairly accurate, though I don't think she intends to be condescending when answering questions, but her tone comes off that way. Definitely very helpful in office hours (go!). Teaches from the book a lot, but explains it well if you ask questions."
10,958471,4.0,4.0,"111 is hard, but not impossible. Just go to class, pay attention, do the homework, and ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM! It's also important to do a lot of practice problems to figure out the hard/odd ball problems, but Snider does a good job teaching the basics. Definitely better than Pisano or Guadani."
11,958471,3.5,5.0,"What to say&#63; You will find many similarities b/w all ratings of Snider and Giffen (name before married). Uses exact examples out of book, examples out of class way easier than the test questions, fairly condescending (i ignored it). She goes over her examples well so that you can understand it but it is too simple. You will have to teach yourself."
12,958471,2.0,5.0,"The intimidating atmosphere created is one where it is not only hard to focus while working on a quiz/exam, but intimidating to ask questions.  The book contains numerous problems that you can't learn from reading the book. Since she teaches from the book, your only hope is office hours; if they conflict with your schedule, pray to God for a D-."
13,958471,1.5,5.0,"She is THE WORST PROFESSOR here at Uva. If you ask questions, rather than answering, she makes you feel incompetent. In lecture, you can literally finish her sentenses by reading the book. The book is also TERRIBLE (and she teaches directly out of it). She doesn't care whatsoever about her students. See Daria Giffen for more reviews (her old name)"
14,958471,2.0,5.0,"Took this in the summer. Three weeks of pain. She reads the book for you and writes out the chapters on the board. She seems almost annoyed when you ask a question. You begin to feel that there are ONLY stupid questions. There is no simple explanation or real world example of anything. Tip: If it's a proof, it's almost certainly on the test."
15,958471,1.0,5.0,Just copies from the book during class and treats her students as though they are ignorant for having asked a question.
16,909325,3.5,1.0,"At first, classes would be really interesting group discussions about death. As the semester went on, it kind of became more of a lecture with very little participation. You could probably get away with skimming readings. Papers were graded in a super annoying way, but were easy to get an A on."
17,909325,4.5,2.0,He is a fantastic teacher. Gives great insight to the course and is clearly very intelligent. also funny and sweet in an old man kind of way. 3 papers (pretty short/broad topics) and participation are the only parts of your grade. He is awesome and so is the class. Easy 2 credits!!
18,909325,5.0,1.0,"Awesome class, awesome teacher. If you go to class, participate, and write decent papers, there's no reason you shouldn't get an A. Easy grader on essays."
19,909325,5.0,2.0,Rick is fabulous!
20,909325,5.0,1.0,"TAKE THIS USEM!  It was basically 2 hours of discussion on Death and Dying, but the time would fly by.  We got into some of the most interesting, totally off-topic discussions and took and amazing field trip to a funeral home.  Easy A too, just a fre easily graded papers."
21,1507348,1.5,4.0,"Bao Laoshi is a great Chinese teacher, making the classes more enjoyable with cultural notes and clearly explains grammar and sentence structure, which are one of the most difficult parts of Chinese. I have learned so much from her and am confident that 201 will not be as difficult had I had another teacher."
22,1507348,5.0,2.0,"Bao Laoshi is the greatest Chinese teacher ever.  I learned so much in this class.  Although the workload was intense she motivated us to work through it.  I will now go on to the next level with a strong foundation in the language.  Sadly, i believe, she is only here for one year..so take her in the spring if you can!! it might be your last chance"
23,1499158,5.0,3.0,Incredible TA. He is very helpful.

27,868378,4.0,4.0,"Su was an amazing prof.  He worked really hard to make sure students understood the material, and he graded his own exams, instead of having a grader.  He gave partial credit where deserved,and spent most of 4th hour doing WeBWoRK--which helped with the overall grade.  I would say of all the Calc II classes, Su's probably was one of the best ones."
28,868378,3.0,4.0,"Not a very good teacher. Doesn't give you examples with NUMBERS, instead, he'll give you examples with letters and symbols. Very confusing, and the material is hard enough!!!"
29,745506,2.0,4.0,"Professor Michener is a professor in the true meaning of the word. He is cordial, he explains his material well, and he tries - in his way - to be engaging and to keep students' attention in the class. Unfortunately, his class structure and constant clashes with the textbook cause a lot of confusion. Prepare for long studying hours if you take him."
30,745506,4.0,4.0,"Michener is a good lecturer. He takes care not to throw terminology out there without explaining it first, especially when it's related to statistics as many students needed a refresher. He also tries to make the material more interesting, which isn't so easy to do with Econometrics."
31,745506,4.0,3.0,I really enjoyed his class. He is extremely passionate and opinionated about this subject so he can be a bit demanding. But overall he got me interested in a difficult and somewhat dry subject
32,745506,1.0,5.0,"Hardest class I've taken at UVa. Rated the second hardest class at the University. Failed every test, but the curve was very helpful. He has a dry sense of humor, but had a few good jokes here and there! Be ready to be stressed."
33,745506,3.5,3.0,"Michener really loves what he teaches and tries to get the students interested in an otherwise dry subject. Econometrics is not meant to be easy or fun, but Michener makes it a little more tolerable with his stories and applications of the theories. Make sure you give a lot of time to the homework, and you'll do fine."
34,745506,4.5,4.0,"Material is somewhat dry but I actually learned a lot in this class. Grades come from homeworks with groups, midterm, and final which are all pretty reasonable. If you put in the effort, show up to class, and read the handouts, you should really succeed. Not an &quot;easy&quot; class by any means, but definitely manageable and better than the other 372 optio"
35,745506,1.5,5.0,"Worst professor I've ever had at UVA. He rambles on about useless conspiracy theories and shows &quot;funny&quot; youtube videos and clips from Comedy Central. Tests ask specific, meaningless questions that involve memorizing useless acronyms. He assigns random articles and expects you to remember every insignificant detail about them. Avoid him at all cost."
36,745506,2.0,4.0,Boring and monotonous.  Also just seems cold and not very nice.
37,745506,1.0,5.0,"Holy crap, this guy sucks.  He goes way too fast, he rambles, homework has nothing to do with tests or quizzes.  When you ask for help, he doesn't care.  Grading is harsh."
38,745506,3.0,2.0,"a nice old man who wants students to listen to his stories and share his interest in the material. if you can tolerate math or statistics at all you will like his class, and its not as hard as everyone says it is. recommended."
39,745506,1.0,5.0,"No point in going to lectures, the textbook is a far better teacher. I just sat in the library with the textbook for three days and gained more than all the lectures for the course. Homeworks are more like learning how to use the Excel and Minitab than learning any statistics. Take STAT 212, I hear it's better."
40,745506,1.0,5.0,Drop that ****
41,745506,5.0,4.0,"The class is very demanding and very structured. The grading system is very fair. If you have work hard for it, you can get high grade; but you will fail very miserably if you are the lazy type. I enjoy being in the class and the professor does try his best to prepare every lecture. Very intense and condense, but yet in a clear manner."
42,745506,1.5,4.0,"Lectures can be interesting but he'll lecture on the mistakes politicians or NASA make with statistics, the homework is done through Statistics software (Minitab), and the tests are paper & pencil. Essentially SELF-TAUGHT. Be prepared to teach yourself statistics."
43,2301989,4.0,3.0,"In class, she kinda isn't the best. (often elaborates on parts you understand, shows you something but then immediately the answer without giving you a change to think it through. small scribbly handwriting on chalk, etc.) BUT: She is VERY outgoing and very willing to help you out. Has deadlines but will give credit if your willing to work for it."
44,2301989,1.0,4.0,"CS 1113 with professor Asma was a nightmare. This class was filled with many unnecessarily hard homeworks/classworks/tests, she didn't teach us what we needed to complete labs (TA's had to teach us), and she did not know how to lecture. Office hours are helpful and she is knowledgeable/a nice person, just a bad teacher. Extra credit helped a lot."
45,2301989,4.0,3.0,Prof Asma is a really awesome professor once you get to know her. Go to office hours and she will help you with anything. Such a sweet and genuine lady!
46,2301989,2.0,3.0,"AVOID ASMA FOR ENGR 1620! Look, she's nice one-on-one. However, that alone is not enough to make a class. Much more busywork than other 1620 sections with draconian high-school rules: no phones, mandatory attendance, no talking. Yes, she'll dock your grade. Endless group work (not hard, just way too much of it). In the end, frustrating and futile."
47,2728004,5.0,2.0,Professor Tolchinsky is an amazing person. She always looks out for us and praises us even if we are struggling. The homework isnt awful and our essays arent super long (around 1200 words max). She also takes time out of the beginning of class to check in on everyone and if you email her she is extremely respectful
48,368714,5.0,5.0,"Tough class with several hundred pages of reading/week. Tests were exceedingly difficult, but she makes up for it by grading relatively easily on the papers. If you do the readings and participate well in discussion, she will notice and you will reap the benefits. Learned more in this class than in any other class I've taken. Amazing professor."
49,368714,5.0,4.0,"Professor Meyer is without a doubt the greatest history teacher i have had the pleasure to learn under. She is passionate about Roman history and has ingenious ways of igniting that passion in her students. From mock court cases, to the incredibly entertaining &quot;Game&quot; she uses effective pedagogical practices. Could not rate higher."
50,368714,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor. Meyer is certainly tough - expect 100-200 pages a week and come to class ready to participate (or be glared at). She may seem intimidating at first, but is really accessible and helpful if you ever need to talk. I actually think she's a very fair grader, not to mention a genius and expert in her field. Classes always enlightening"
51,368714,4.5,4.0,"Meyer's a tough prof, but that's what you should expect from UVA. She knows her stuff and is really passionate. I found her lectures clear and her discussions enlightening. Get ready to read and participate."
52,368714,2.0,5.0,"Prof Meyer has inspired me, or at least inspired me to warn all students that come to her class that its ridiculous. HIEU 3041 was terrible. Her tests are a test of endurance versus knowledge and she is more picky on papers than any prof I've ever had. Lastly she is also the least helpful prof I've had, I always felt like an annoyance."
53,368714,4.5,4.0,"LOVED!!! Professor Meyer is an absolutely fabulous lecturer and the material was fascinating. She loves what she teaches and she makes everyone else love it too.  That being said, you will work your tail off. If you love learning ancient history and are up for a challenge, this is the class for you. One of the best professors at UVA"
54,368714,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Meyer is so passionate about her subject matter and likes to have fun with it! She is demanding and expects her students to put in the work so don't take this class if you are looking for a slacker class. She is amazingly helpful if you go to her office hours, she loves it when you come and ask her questions!! I loved this class!"
55,368714,3.0,4.0,"Professor Meyer is a nice person, and enjoyes what she is doing, but she is probably one of the worst teachers I've had at UVA.  Her tests are hard, but not so you will learn.  She likes to ask very obscure questions to try to stump you.  Anyone can draw up a hard test, it doesn't mean you are a good teacher.  Nice person, poor teacher."
56,368714,5.0,5.0,"Professor Meyer is a great professor and runs a great class. There is a decent amount of reading, and tests are hard, but you learn a lot. She is always available for help outside of class. Definitely worth the while."
57,368714,3.0,5.0,"The teacher is very knowledgeable of the subject. If you are incredibly dedicated to the class, you can succeed. Although, there is a gargantuan (understatement) amount of reading material and information you will be expected to retain. The time put into this class is not worth the 3 credits. This is not a class to be taken lightly."
58,368714,4.5,4.0,"Professor Meyer is an absolutely incredible lecturer!!! That being said, wimps and slackers should avoid this class. If you are willing to work, Professor Meyer can teach you hordes about how Rome worked and about the various influences that contributed to its fall. Try her class if you want a challenge. A's are not impossible."
59,368714,5.0,5.0,"Excellent Lecturer, always interesting, well organized, difficult, but she always lets you know what she expects"
60,368714,2.5,5.0,meyer seemed disinterested in her students. t.a. bauer was unimpressive.  too much BORING reading for a three credit classe. final felt more like an endurance test than an exam.
61,368714,1.0,5.0,"this class and professor made me go from loving Rome and it's history to hating it more than anything. have mercy on yourself and do not take anything by meyer, unless you want to work work work and be unsatisfied. i literally get the chills when i see anything that reminds me of the semester i took this awful class"
62,368714,1.0,5.0,"This teacher/class is HORRIBLE. DO NOT TAKE IT. I AM WARNING YOU. i hate this class more than i've ever hated anything, and i was INTERSTED in Rome beforehand. teacher is WAY to bad"
63,368714,4.5,4.0,"Very good lecturer who holds my attention with a narrative approach to history. Keeps us late most classes which is inconvienent if you have a class right afterwards. Expects a ton of reading and tests require lots of writing in 50 minutes, but questions are managable"
64,368714,5.0,3.0,Lots of reading but interesting readings and very clearly taught and good lecturer.
65,368714,4.5,5.0,The course load was EXTREMELY demanding but lectures were very clear.  Overall I got alot out of the class.  However I would not recommend it to those who do not have alot of time to commit.
66,368714,1.0,5.0,No Comments
67,368714,5.0,4.0,"A Meyer class isn't easy, but it's fun if you put in the effort. Prof. Meyer will make you earn that grade and if you have any inkling of interest in Rome, you will come out of it all very satisfied in the end. But her classes are very difficult, and if you just want an easy grade, go elsewhere. HIEU 204 experience largely dependent on the TA."
68,368714,1.5,5.0,"Unless you read Livy for fun, you are making a huge mistake in taking this."
69,368714,2.0,4.0,Wouldn't wish this class on my worst enemy.  Tests inherently unfair in nature (i.e. midterm consisted of 10 IDs of a pool of 160 possible); lectures mind-numbingly boring; TAs horrible.  I have absolutely nothing good to say about this class.
70,368714,2.0,5.0,"The workload for this class is so intense, so many IDs, pop quizzes make this an utter nightmare, and the worst part is that you don't even learn that much compared to &quot;easier&quot; classes...find something else to take if you are smart."
71,368714,4.0,5.0,"Over-rated...She has basically memorized all of her lectures, but they are not particuarly interesting unless you are already familiar with the subject. Heavy, soul-crushing reading (except for Suetonius) and pop quizzes make for a difficult experience."
72,368714,4.0,4.0,"She is a great professor. I'm not going to lie; it is a tough course and you need to work for your grade. The mid-term was hard. Grades are midterm, final, and 7 page paper (two to choose from-one EC) A lot of reading, but if you keep up with it, it isn't too bad.  Great lecturer. Happy I took it."
73,368714,4.0,5.0,Lectures were easy to follow and Meyer seemed very interested and enthusiastic about the subject.  Lots and lots of reading made the class pretty hard though.
74,368714,4.5,3.0,"Ms. Meyer is an cool professor. Her lectures are interesting and if you somewhat enjoy the material, you'll stay awake. Usual grading is MIDTERM, FINAL and a 7 page paper (2 for extra credit). Tough, but fair. A little effort will get you atleast a B+. I recommend 204 over 203, TAs are better."
75,368714,4.5,3.0,"Meyer is really interesting--a great lecturer.  Her tests are tough but fair.  There's no curve, so don't expect any breaks.  Lots of reading, but worth it if you like history."
76,1777748,5.0,2.0,"CELESTE IS MY WORLD! She's sassy, brillant, and full of poetic expertise. You will not only grow as a poet but as a person! this seminar of 15 people became my favorite one I've ever taken at UVA, and I came into it actually hating poetry. You learn so much, and you won't regret your decision. Say yes to Celeste."
77,1777748,5.0,2.0,Celeste is an incredibly smart teacher and very helpful both in and out of class. She made the whole class comfortable with each other during workshop. This class was a positive experience especially thanks to Celeste. She is wonderful.
78,1777748,5.0,2.0,Best class ever!!!! Celeste is awesome! You are missing out if you don't take this class!
79,1777748,5.0,2.0,Best class taken so far at UVa! Celeste's got it all. Disclaimer: don't take the class if you don't have a sense of humor--it would go wasted on you.
80,1777748,5.0,2.0,"You'll finally find out what poetry is. Celeste is an amazing person who makes everyone in class feel like they belong there. If you lack depth, humor, or sassiness in life, DEFINITELY take this class. If you don't, couldn't you use more anyway?"
81,1777748,5.0,1.0,"LOVED LOVED LOVED this class. If I could take it again, I would. Celeste is such an amazing teacher, and she's always available for help. If you love witty, sassy, hilarious, and funny comments - take a class that Celeste teaches."
82,1777748,5.0,2.0,Celeste is amazing! She always makes herself available for extra help and is really invested in her students' work. Highly recommend.
83,147545,3.0,1.0,Technosonics is a farce. I can't even attempt to take this class seriously. Burtner Alternates between playing random noises and saying the word &quot;oscillator&quot; with various mispronounced computer science terms. But it's an easy A.
84,147545,4.0,1.0,"Ecoacoustics was a really awesome class. You have to approach it with an open mind and you are exposed to some really interesting music. Professor Burtner is an expert and he's definitely passionate about the subject. Not the hardest class you'll take, but highly recommended."
85,147545,5.0,2.0,"Don't know what the guy below is talking about with this class.  It was a great class that really broadens your horizons.  Some parts are a little strange, but you learn to appreciate strange music.  Fairly easy and really fun."
86,147545,5.0,3.0,the class of a lifetime
87,147545,4.0,1.0,"not the class of a lifetime, unless you're going to grow up to be a digital composer or something. very boring, kind of pointless, and learning how to use music software is cool and fun but the class sucks, and discussions are worse becasue you have to do readings that really suck. the only true easy-A i've had at UVA, though, so that's notable."
88,147545,5.0,3.0,The class of a lifetime
89,1024107,4.5,3.0,I'm not a math person at all.  I found the class really hard at times but I also went to office hours almost every week.  I found Jason to be very helpful during office hours and I grasped the material better after talking to him.  The first day of the class I panicked because I didn't understand anything but I ended up with an A-.
90,1024107,3.0,4.0,"bad teaching.... not helpful at all, its a teach it yourself class."
91,1024107,3.5,2.0,"Though the lectures can be a little boring, he teaches the subject well.  Plus he curves the tests so the class is pretty easy."
92,1024107,2.5,4.0,"I regret that I didn't switch out of this class. I mean, I took the class in high school, but he just made the simplest things so hard to understand. He seems so bored and his voice will send you to sleep. I kept getting more and more confused the longer I was in there. I really feel sorry for anyone who hasn't had prior experience with the subject"
93,1024107,1.5,2.0,"lectures are mind-numbing and will have you looking at your watch every five minutes.  EXTREMELY rigid in teaching - basically no class engagement whatsoever, and a ton of time spent on &quot;proofs&quot; of simple concepts rather than working through useful examples.  dry and tedious.  webwork is a pain.  however, it's an easy A if you go to class and study"
94,1024107,1.0,3.0,His lessons are all crammed together in a hour and fifteen minute class. It's so fast-paced that you never really fully understand anything. He depends immensly on the book and is not at all flexible. And the absolute worst part is that his voice always cracks and gets pitchy.
95,1024118,4.5,2.0,"Turker is a great teacher. He really knew the material he was teaching. He gives a lot of effort to help us understand the material; he always answers questions after class and in office hours. He promptly replies to e-mails when questions are asked that way. His grading system is so fair. Although he speaks quietly, you can understand him."
96,1024118,4.0,2.0,"Turker Ozsari is one of the best teachers I have had at UVA. His teaching methods are extremely effective and easy to follow, confirming his grasp of the material. He shows genuine interest in both the topics he teaches along with the well-being of his students. Ozsari makes himself exceptionally available to his students, especially by scheduling "
97,1024118,1.0,4.0,"Horrible teacher.  I completely disagree with anyone who said he is a great teacher.  He may be smart, but when it comes to explaining how to do things he is awful.  He is a fair grader and gives a lot of partial credit.  If you decide to take his class make sure you sit in front because he talks very quietly and writes very small."
98,1024118,5.0,1.0,He's a Genius
99,1024118,5.0,4.0,"great teacher, extremely intelligent and determined that everyone in the class will finish this course with the full understanding of the material. always there for his students. thank you, you have made my semester successful!!!"
100,1024118,4.5,1.0,"He is seriously the BEST teacher I have ever had at UVa! I had no interest in calculus at all when first entering the course,but his willingness to help and all his bonus opportunities made it worthwhile. And his grading system is awesome! Even if you do not do well on the test, there is still opportunities to make an A or B. HANDS DOWN the best!"
101,1024118,5.0,1.0,"turker is the guy who taught me how to bridge the probability, algebraic geometry and representation theory and I got the fields medal two years ago with his amazing help especially in his office hours."
102,1024118,5.0,1.0,"Turker has the fairest grading system I've ever seen in a class.  He also gives lots of incentives to study more and succeed better.  You'll get a lot of bonus point in his class if you give some extra effort, so you'll end up with an A even if your exams are not so good."
103,1024118,5.0,2.0,"Turker is an exceptionally brilliant and amazing guy, have never seen him coming to class with lecture notes, a chalk is enough for him to teach."
104,1024118,5.0,3.0,"I feel very lucky to take calc class from mr. ozsari.  his main contribution was to provide the motivation and intuition behind the material we were learning, so everything made much more sense when i read the material after lectures.  he was also very helpful with infinitely many office hours, i was able to meet with him whenever i had question ma"
105,1024118,2.0,3.0,I did not enjoy this math class at all (and I am capable of truly enjoying math).  I basically ended up teaching myself everything from the book.  His lectures are incoherent.

107,1024118,1.0,5.0,He's a nice guy but his teaching methods are both ineffective and incomprehensible.
108,925821,5.0,2.0,I loved Professor Seidel. She is such a kind person and her advice about outlook and mindset were really transformational for my classes going forward. Her office hours were easily accessible. Quizzes were worth 60% but werent too difficult.
109,925821,4.0,2.0,"Dean Seidel is an amazing person. She genuinely cares about her students' well-being and how we are absorbing the information. After each unit theres a paper we have to write to make sure we understand the concepts. Each unit last for about 2 weeks. Her lectures can be all over the place, so its important to pay attention, and go to office hours"
110,925821,1.0,5.0,Roundabout lectures and vague instructions.  Would not recommend at all.
111,925821,2.5,4.0,"I would not recommend this class to anyone that does not have any interest in the topic. The professor is a really nice quirky lady however, it can sometimes be overwhelming. She teaches big concepts which are easy to understand after you get the hang of it. The lectures tend to be disorganized."
112,925821,1.0,3.0,"She is disorganized and has a vague way of rambling through her lectures, jumping from topic to topic. I did not appreciate her ""quirkiness."""
113,925821,4.5,3.0,"Once you learn her teaching style, this class is great! At first I didn't understand her ""conceptual"" teaching method, but I quickly picked it up. She and her course materials are accessible to ensure that you learn and succeed. Seidel cares so much about students. Take the class, go to the class, and love the class!"
114,925821,5.0,1.0,"Professor Seidel is awesome. She's very nice and inviting. Ask questions if you need to. Material is easy. I didn't have to touch my book at all, and I haven't once. The book is a good reference if you need to go over something you don't understand. Again, ask her questions if you need to. This class is lecture-based. Go to class!"
115,925821,4.5,2.0,"Don't let the class freak you out at the beginning, it actually turned out to be quite easy. Although most of the information is the same as in AP/IB bio classes, Professor Seidel makes you learn the larger concepts and apply them rather than the minute details. She is very quirky, but definitely wants all her students to succeed."
116,925821,4.0,4.0,"She's one of those few professors that truly care about her students. Dean Seidel has a quirky, funny personality, and is always willing to help. She remembers your name once you go to her office hours enough too! Class is difficult; she emphasizes understanding and asks you quiz/test questions in her own way. Phenomenal human being. Received a B."
117,925821,5.0,3.0,"Awesome prof, she genuinely loves biology and it shows in her ability to teach. She cares about her students and is very approachable if you have a problem. Tests are fair and allow for application of knowledge rather than repeating memorized facts. Definitely recommend."
118,925821,4.5,4.0,She is an incredible teacher. Not only will she know every students' name but she truly wants them to succeed.  She goes out of her way to make sure that her students are not just memorizing but actually understanding and enjoying the material that she is presenting.  Having her has been an incredible blessing as I am now more prepared for A&P.
119,925821,5.0,4.0,"I can say that this was the best class I've ever taken. Seidel is  so enthusiastic about what she teaches and it makes you want to learn. It was a bit hard to adjust to, but it really helps you learn to think. She really cares about her students, as well. =)"
120,925821,5.0,4.0,"awesome, awesome, awesome. By maybe the 2nd week she knew everyone's names (56 people).  So passionate and gets really excited when students are excited. Likes to jump up and down to prove a point : )  So interesting and learned much more from her than I had in 4 Bio/ Anatomy classes combined."
121,925821,3.5,3.0,"Seidel is insane in a good way.  I have heard it said that she is like Miss Frizzle from the Magic School Bus, and I agree. Sometimes her lectures are too disorganized to follow effectively, but parts of her lectures help you understand and remember the material. She cares a lot about her students and the material is interesting."
122,925821,3.5,5.0,Professor Seidel is a very passionate teacher. She also cares very much about each and every student. I met her for one on one help every week and she was always glad to extend that extra little bit of assistance. Overall class was very hard. You won't pass without reading the book. Her tests are extremely difficult and hard to understand.
123,925821,3.0,3.0,"Enthusiastic. Stresses the APPLICATION of bigger concepts, instead of memorization. Provides study guides and offers review sessions prior to quizzes. Would recommend referencing textbook for more detailed information she skips in class."
124,925821,4.5,3.0,"Ms. Seidel was a very enthusiastic and energetic professor. She was always available for any questions that you had. Her tests are slightly harder as they tend to be VERY wordy. However, overall it gives a good overview of the human body and common diseases (not into the nitty gritty, always the &quot;big picture&quot;).  I recommend it."
125,925821,4.0,3.0,"Remind one of Miss Frizzle from the magic school bus, and is just as enthusiastic.  She is more than willing to aid anyone outside of the classroom. Likes to point out the athletes in the class. :) The quizzes are a bit out there. She intorduces new concepts on the tests (quizzes) that you have to really think about and &quot;think outside the box.&quot;"
126,925821,4.5,4.0,"Sandra Seidel is an amazing professor.  Her lectures are always very enthusiastic and very difficult to sleep through.  As said previously, attendance is a huge factor in your grade.  The first quiz seems to be really difficult but once you can see the style of her tests improvement follows.  A very useful class geared to application problems."
127,925821,4.5,4.0,"This class is not an easy A, you have 3 &quot;pop&quot; quizzes that she tells you about before hand and 3 &quot;quizzes&quot; that are really tests.  If you read the book and attend lecture (which is mandatory and verified by daily notecards) you should do well.  She is a very engaging teacher and always willing to talk to you if you don't understand."
128,925821,5.0,1.0,"Okay, I never had her as a professor, but i did have her as a dean.  She is, without a doubt, the BEST administrator i have ever had the pleasure of confronting (my grades weren't so great--she did not give up on me as many other &quot;advisors&quot; have. &quot;not college material&quot;, my ass.).  She truly cares about students."
129,925821,1.0,5.0,lectures are disorganized and impossible to understand.
130,925821,4.0,4.0,She is so knowledgeable of the subject. Biology is her passion and she does anything to get students interested and to make them understand the material. It requires reading (if you choose to do it) but reading the book helps. She goes over the material pretty thoroughly. You may find her kind of crazy but you'll never get bored in the class.
131,925821,5.0,2.0,"She is really passionate about the subject, and this is one of the most useful classes I have taken.  Reading the book before tests and quizzes helped a lot; her questions are sometimes vague, but there are a lot of grades in the class, so messing up on something won't totally ruin your grade.  She is also extremely quirky and knows everyone's name"
132,925821,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor!  Cares about students, takes time to use various media to make lecture interesting and helpful to all types of learners.  Always available to help students.  visit her office often even if you are doing well.  She helps you think about things in a different way.  approachable.  quirky. makes you interested in the topic"
133,925821,4.0,4.0,"Ok she is really cool and can make the lecture fun.  But beware, she is slightly weird and her tests and quizzes can come from anything!  Do all the reading and know everything because she can ask the most specific, random question, or be really broad.  The material isn't hard, it's just tricky to figure out what she's going to quiz you about."
134,925821,4.5,3.0,"She makes class so much fun! She's really passionate about biology, which makes the rest of the class really excited about it."
135,925821,5.0,2.0,"This class was fabulous! Lectures were always so engaging, she knows EVERY STUDENT'S name (even though it's a class of 120 or so), and the material is so interesting.  Hardly ever any homework outside of tests and quizzes, which aren't that bad.  I loved this class!"
136,925821,5.0,2.0,"Seidel is a really passionate about teaching, and about the material. She's really friendly and makes an effort to get to know every student, if they are willing to let her. She is easily approachable and always willing to help. Lectures are very clear and easy to understand, and test are very straightforward critical thinking questions."
137,2326655,5.0,2.0,"This class was clearly not made well for the online format, but I could tell how much Profe Romero cared about the class she was teaching. I wish I could have taken this class in person, and I strongly recommend doing so - great professor!"
138,2326655,5.0,3.0,I took spanish 2020 with profe romero and i loved her class!! shes extremely helpful and kind and has the best interests of her students in mind. would highly recommend choosing her class as she makes it very clear that shes there to help you succeed and cares more about your understanding than a grade.
139,737410,5.0,3.0,"chill professor- cares about students, knows markets well"
140,737410,3.5,3.0,"He gives you the slides so you don't have to take many notes, but attendence is mandatory. One midterm and one final, both take a ridiculously long time.  Overall, not a terrible class but you definitely need to study for the exams."
141,737410,4.0,3.0,I think he teaches the fundametal stuff very clearly.
142,737410,1.0,5.0,"Not very helpful or understanding. Tests are unreasonably difficult, and he's not very approachable."
143,737410,2.0,4.0,This class was HARD but it's required so you're stuck. It was a 7 week class so everything was very rushed. He's not the best at explaining things but if you work hard and show him that you're committed you can do well.
144,2744471,2.0,1.0,"She is very friendly and nice, but she doesn't know how to teach. She went over important concepts really quickly without giving an example and spend lots of time on meaningless things. She rarely replies to your emails, too. I do not recommend taking her classes unless it's CS1110 because the class is easy and you can learn it without her. "
145,2744471,1.0,3.0,"This professor was horrendous. Be ready to sit through her classes, as she flies through a hundred slides in twenty minutes while you learn nothing. All of my learning happened outside of class through the assignments. Professor Morrison merely read off of slides, and never made an attempt to explain any of the core concepts in depth."
146,385187,3.0,5.0,This class is a hit or miss you could get an A or a C by doing the same amount of work so honestly just ball out and take your chances the lab reports and then go off on the final.
147,385187,1.0,5.0,"Undoubtedly absolutely brilliant and an equally terrible professor. The entire grade is the final, and that final is the most ridiculous test I've ever taken. Doing well in this class requires ignoring all other work and solely working on this class."
148,385187,4.5,5.0,"The class is incredibly interesting. However, you need to be ready to really commit 10+ hours to it each week. Go to the Head TA's Recitations. Go to your Lab TA's office hours. Go to lab lecture, even though it might be your only class on Friday. And most importantly, attend the final review session by the Head TA. Work hard, do well."
149,385187,4.5,4.0,"Donald Hunt is a tough professor, and organic lab is a hard class.  Your TA points seem arbitrary, your lab reports don't necessarily determine your final grade (instead it's a really hard final), BUT Hunt wants everyone to do well and is incredibly patient and helpful in person.  Tough class, but a great guy."
150,385187,1.0,5.0,The worst instructor ever. Got my worse grade ever. Incomprehensible and random grading. Never know what your final grade until its over.
151,385187,4.5,3.0,"Many say Hunt is cruel. Let's face it guys, Orgo lab is hard on its own. If you take the effort to go to Hunt's office, he is more than willing to help you. The bottom line though is if you're willing to spend LOTS of time working on reports, studying & understanding concepts, etc. then there is no reason why you shouldn't get a high rank & an A."
152,385187,1.0,5.0,"He is the worst professor I've ever had, and an even worse person as a whole. He is unfriendly, unhelpful, and not respectful whatsoever."
153,385187,1.5,5.0,I earned an A in the Orgo lecture and put more than 12 hours per week into this lab course. The final was like a foreign language in that the material was nothing like either the lecture or the lab notes/book. One has to wonder about this guy when on the first day he happily announced that he failed his own daughter. Avoid him at all costs!
154,385187,3.0,5.0,Hardest Class I've taken. If you're not 100% sure you're pre-med don't take it. The disparities between different T.A.'s is absurd. The only redeeming quality is that Hunt is very helpful if you go to see him.
155,385187,3.0,5.0,"Hardest class I have ever taken.  Grading seems unfair + the final was ridiculous.  I received an A and my tips are to go to lecture, since sometimes he answers lab questions in class + browse the assigned reading if something is unclear b/c the explanations there can be clearer. Class= tolerable if you figure it out, work hard + you can do it!"
156,385187,3.0,4.0,"I had a question about the material and was terrified to talk to him because he puts up a very unapproachable front, but once we started talking he was very nice, and even insisted on giving me back points on my lab (which I didn't even ask for).  Tough course, but it really got me interested in organic chemistry!"
157,385187,2.5,5.0,"Seems unapproachable, but not necessarily true. Very modest about his intelligence. Course is the hardest I have ever taken.  Spent 12-20 hours a week in the class.  Final exam is nearly everything. Study or find yourself with a C or lower. That said, got an A last time, expecting another A.  That said: be ready to commit hours to this class."
158,385187,2.0,5.0,"Nosferatu teaching chemistry, but works very, very hard to make lab happen for all 400+ students. The weight is basically backloaded to the final exam. I was first in my lab with a B for the course due to my exam grade. Memorize those mechanisms or end up a shell of a man like me, doomed to wander the cursed earth in search of n-Butyl bromide. :}"
159,385187,1.0,5.0,A very disappointing class.  Grades definitely don't reflect amount of work required.  Ends up ruining a subject I actually find interesting.
160,385187,2.5,5.0,"A very bizarre sort of class in the long run. First of all, let me state that I've never tried harder for a grade, pulling 12+ hour lab reports on a regular basis. That doesn't really matter for this course, however, as your grade boils down to your place on the final exam distribution. This is a game of chance, as everyone fails. Questionable."
161,385187,1.0,5.0,"Very difficult and time-intensive course.  Most students spent 8+ hours on lab reports and post labs weekly.  The final is exhausting, and the payoff for hard work is minimal.  GO TO YOUR T.A.'s OFFICE HOURS EVERY SINGLE WEEK.  Lab lecture was boring and not well-attended, but it was useful for retaining information for the final."
162,385187,1.0,5.0,GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN! TAKE IT OVER THE SUMMER! do not make the same mistake that all of us here have made
163,385187,2.5,5.0,Pretty much everyone in this class dislikes Hunt.  He is a tough professor.  The material he covers is difficult and is crammed into a 1 hour lab lecture section.  It is essential that you work hard to understand each lab as it comes for the final exam (your entire grade).  See a TA each week; APRIL RICHARDSON IS THE BEST!
164,385187,1.0,5.0,"Lab lecture was a complete waste of time, with Hunt doing nothing more than reading over the notes we already had in a monotonous voice.  The grading system is completely convoluted, and I would recommend avoiding the course until he retires, if at all possible"
165,385187,3.0,5.0,He is a tough teacher because he wants to prepare his students for any future lab/research work in chemistry. Most of your grade pends on the final exam. I would recommend recording his lectures because he talks fast and the recordings will also help you with your lab reports. Makes you apply material rather than memorizing;memorizing=F on  final.
166,385187,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely awful. completely unapproachable. 0 personality. grade determination is absurd: you are ranked in your section by your lab report grades, then everyone takes the final, and if 5 ppl in ur section got As, the top 5 ranked ppl will get As -- even if they failed the final. take over summer!!!!"
167,385187,1.0,5.0,"evil sociopath, could care less is this class ruins your gpa & future. i thought i could get a decent grade, although friends told me to take it over the summer, definitely got a big fat C although i worked my a** off. postlabs make no sense. if he was stranded in a desert without water and i had a bottle, i would rather water a cactus"
168,385187,3.0,4.0,"Hunt knows what he is talking about, but he's not very approchable.  If you make sure u understand every lab as you go, instead of crammin at the last minute, u'll be ok..because ur grade is almost entirely dependent on the final.  Just remember: Everyone fails the final, just be sure u don't fail it too badly, and u'll be saved by the curve!!"
169,385187,2.0,5.0,"Grades really did all rest on the final, which was pretty ridiculous and all on specific details from the lab- not even general concepts."
170,385187,1.0,5.0,"If you wanna call youself premed at UVA, this is your gauntlent. Its hard but better than gen chem lab. Lab report format allows mistakes in procedure that dont affect your lab grade in a major way. BUT, its all about the final. So study. You can teach this stuff to yourself. Also depends on how good your TA is. Like all labs."
171,385187,1.0,5.0,Terrible teacher.  Total d-bag.  Worst professor I've had at UVA.
172,385187,1.0,5.0,Prof. Hunt is the most unapproachable professor I have encountered at the University.  I had to give him my testing accomodation and he just stared at me and then tried to argue with me about it.  He thinks we have graduate level knowledge of organic chemistry.  This class is rediculous.  Even the TAs hate Hunt and dont understand some of the labs.
173,385187,1.0,5.0,His grading system is completely unfair. Please save yourself the exhaustion that goes into trying your best and take this course elsewhere!
174,385187,1.0,5.0,he goes really fast in lectures and he doesnt really seem to give a crap about his students. I asked him early in the semester if I could change my exam date because it interferred with another class and he goes &quot;well that's just not my problem&quot;.
175,385187,2.0,5.0,The whole grade rests on the final. The person that said you need to study more is exactly correct because Hunt will not teach it to you. You will be hard pressed to find one person that walks out of the lectures getting something out of them. I could've studied for ten hours per day the whole semester and still barely passed the test.  Ridiculous.
176,385187,5.0,3.0,"he's not so bad.  the labs are interesting second semester and his lectures notes are really clear.  he has review sessions before the exams, so that helps a lot.  you people just need to study more!"
177,385187,1.0,5.0,"This is ABSOLUTELY the WORST class at this University. You have to put a ton of work into it, and it doesn't pay off at ALL. It is graded EXTREMELY unfairly, and your entire grade rests on the final. Take it at another school, and save yourself and your gpa."
178,385187,1.0,5.0,"Quite possibly the worst professor at the university.  Unhelpful, deathly boring."
179,385187,1.5,5.0,"He's a pain, difficult to follow in lecture, only at the end of the year did it get slighlty interesting. Watch the attendance drop from weeks 1 and 2 to weeks 8 and 9. Everybody shows up the last two weeks to cram for the exam, and honestly those are the only classes worth attending."
180,385187,4.5,4.0,"Dr Hunt has been teaching for longer than I've been alive, and he knows his stuff. Chemistry, biochemistry, biology, immunology, pathology- he knows them all. The class IS hard and time consuming, especially the final, but if you study and really understand the experiments, you'll do ok. TAs are helpful; so is Dr Hunt if you go and seek him out."
181,385187,1.0,5.0,"evil, evil man"
182,385187,1.5,5.0,he's a drone
183,385187,3.0,4.0,Hunt is sooooo boring in lecture it's not worth your time.  The TA's help a lot more.  The tests are ridiculously hard and confusing but you just have to gut it out.  Not fun and I'm glad it's over.
184,385187,1.5,5.0,"scared the living daylights out of me on the 1st day. flies through lectures in a drone, never pausing to let you catch up. impossible final. arrogant and condescending view on the students. very smart guy, but it doesnt make him a good teacher."
185,385187,5.0,3.0,"i love this man he's so funny and brilliant he knows every single thing in the world..bio, orgo...he DOES deserve the nobel prize...CELLS CHASE BACTERIA!!!! that is so amazing"
186,385187,5.0,2.0,"Though it may seem odd, I have found this man quite helpful and clear. I do not know why he is dreaded soo much. If you go to his office hours, be yourself (if you like laughing, then laugh), this man will help you. He has helped me so much, even as to give me research positions in medical school!!"
187,385187,1.0,5.0,by far the worst and most horrible teacher on the surface of the earth. please do yourself a favor and stay away from this class. go to another school and take the course. it is very much worth it. only the wise listens.
188,385187,1.5,4.0,"Treats everyone like grad students. Doesn't even put effort into simple things, such as getting attention; he will just whine."
189,385187,1.0,5.0,"Easily the worst professor I've ever had.  Horrible teacher, lectures were monotonous and unhelpful, yet you have to go to get the postlab questions and if you just leave you'll look like a retard, so you're kind of stuck there.  And he's a ****bag.  Honestly, if you don't have to take him, don't."
190,385187,1.0,5.0,"By far one of the worst professors ever.  Lectures are incredibly boring, and the final is just ridiculous.  He makes every experiment sound impossible.  The only upside to this class were the TAs, most of whom sympathized with the students and helped out a lot."
191,385187,2.0,5.0,poopyhead-sooooooooo mean.  Wants you to understand chemistry he probably doesn't even understand.  Expects too much from beginning orgo students-scary.  I'm terrified for the final-TERRIFIED
192,385187,1.0,5.0,"Horrible human being. Makes me sick to look at his face. Doesn't say anything helpful, just drones on the the most monotonous voice ever. Sometimes made class 2 hours long. (It's scheduled for 1 hour a week.) Rescheduled final exam because he thought he could. Deserved not to win the nobel prize."
193,385187,1.5,5.0,"he is a hunter. although he was a nobel prize nominee, he is not a good instructur. first thing he does is scaring his students and making them understand that they are not going to be able to pass the course. don't risk it, don't take the course with him.."
194,385187,1.5,5.0,"Lectures seem helpful at the time. Then you try to write the lab report and postlab question and realize it was worthless.  Expects you to be able to understand the innerworkings of the labs you perform, without him explaining them at all. He'll ask for quantitative analysis when he has only done "
195,385187,2.0,5.0,No Comments
196,385187,1.0,5.0,"Sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks.  Very mean, very unhelpful, final was a killer."
197,1024173,5.0,2.0,"I took his USEM Righting Unrightable Wrongs and loved it! Professor Dukes i great! He's so nice and really made an effort to get to know everyone in the class. Very friendly and kind - he brought cookies to every class :) We did a lot of really interesting, engaging things. Never made you uncomfortable or nervous."
198,1024173,3.5,1.0,"1daysem. thoughtful, good lesson plans. We got free pizza from UMS :) But, I had to do a make-up assignment afterwards and he set up a meeting with me and another girl and asked us both to bring a friend so we could do a role-play with four people but when I came, he was in a meeting and the other girl never showed up. We waited around for an hour."
199,90293,5.0,4.0,"Professor Barnett is a wonderful lecturer, and you learn so much in this class. However, this class requires a lot of hard work and you must read the book and keep up with lectures to do well."
200,90293,2.0,2.0,I thought his class was pretty pointless. I know nothing about South Asia and I don't feel like I got a thorough understanding. I only learned through readings that highlighted the same themes over and over. He would go on rants and would not call on me because its a big class. So I didn't feel like my participation was accurately portrayed.
201,90293,4.0,3.0,I will say Prof.Barnett is a very passionate lecturer. This class was a seminar so there was only like 17 ppl in the class so everyone was req to talk about the readings extensively. Be aware readings are about 160-200 pages a week and sometimes the readings are dense. Also very picky about writing style.Overall great class most ppl got an A or A-.
202,90293,3.0,2.0,"Overall a good class. His lectures are pretty unorganized and its almost impossible to keep up, but that was never really a problem grade-wise, especially if you choose his take home exams, which I highly recommend (you can use the internet). The Reading is kind of a lot if you choose to do them, but even those proved to bu unnecessary. Recommended"
203,90293,4.0,4.0,Great guy. Always keeps class interesting.
204,90293,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING CLASS! Amazing professor. His lectures are interesting and detailed. You need to take good notes to do well on the tests, but he makes life as easy for you as possible. It is not a hard class to pass. If you attend and pay attention you're good to go. He's incredible."
205,90293,1.5,4.0,"There was a ton of reading and the class was very fast paced. Lectures are interesting, but you HAVE to take good notes if you want to get a good grade. This is a tough course, but Barnett tries to make it as easy as possible. He's pretty flexible so you don't get overwhelmed by the material. Overall, I really enjoyed this course. Very interesting"
206,90293,4.0,2.0,"Excellent professor.  A man with a passion for a people.  He isn't one of those social-cause posers who do it because it is academically fashionable.  He cares enough to go to asylum hearing as an expert.  Actions speak louder than words.  I enjoyed his class immensely, and I hope to do a research project under him next year."
207,90293,4.5,3.0,An excellent professor with a true passion for Southeast Asia. Reading the material is essential and all that is necessary for obtaining a high grade.  Highly recommended!
208,90293,5.0,1.0,Taking this class was an excellent decision--the material is interesting and Prof Barnett is so helpful and passionate about it.  This class is a true seminar--you are constantly discussing and learning from each other. Very laid back--highly recommended!
209,90293,5.0,4.0,"Prof Barnett is one of the most dedicated people to his field that I have come across. His sense of humor and passion for the subject really made this class wonderful. It was really chill-a very informal seminar setting. You do have to keep up on the reading though, as the class was structured on group discussions. Snack time was also a plus!"
210,90293,3.0,4.0,"Amusing, sometimes tedious lecturer with a passion for the subject. Tough, random grader - did all the readings, took detailed notes and got a C while others who did nothing got A's. Would recommend him, but not for this course. Take HISA 100 instead."
211,90293,4.5,2.0,"He's extremely approachable and very passionate about this class.  Lecture/Discussion can be challenging as he often allows the class and himself to go off on tangents.  Not heavy reading, but plenty of discussions on the reading."
212,90293,4.0,3.0,"Barnett is a cool guy although his lecture style/word choice is quite weird.  Watch out he grades the maps really specifically.  Take-home tests are long essays, take forever and grading is random.  I dont do most of the readings until before the exams and I dont take notes, got b+."
213,90293,3.0,4.0,"Was not what I expected at all. Don't take if you do not have any interest in the topic because he is hard to follow even with the outline. Also, the exams are difficult despite being take home. They are long, complicated essays. DO NOT take if you are not an paper/essay person."
214,90293,3.5,3.0,"I found the class discussions to be honestly intriguing. Barnett only augments the intensity of the already astonishing material. You definitely learn a lot about how to write-or rather, how *not* to write. Barnett is quirky but funny (and very intelligent). I recommend this class because it is a experience much unlike any other class room setting."
215,90293,3.5,2.0,"Hard to follow lectures sometimes because he pauses in the middle of sentences. Midterm and final were difficult (although take home and open book) because they were very long, lots of writing and graded pretty hard. Didn't really need to do the readings though."
216,90293,4.0,2.0,"He's pretty cool...you get to choose which format you wanna take your exams in. I didn't read all semester and i got an A- on the midterm. The maps were kind of graded weird, but oh well. He's sometimes hard to understand in class, but will repeat things if needed."
217,90293,5.0,2.0,"Very refreshing lecture style, goes on lots of tangents which is helpful during a 75 minute class period (reduces stress and actually makes it easier to learn), take-home tests for the most part (lets students decide), and always brings enthusiasm to the class"
218,90293,4.5,1.0,"His was a very interesting and extremely easy class. There were three midterms (vocab tests) worth 10% each, and participation was 30%. He's very knowledgable about the topic, but is disorganized and does not follow the syllabus too well. Other than that, was a great class overall. And the end-of-semester banquest at Maharajah was delicious!"
219,90293,4.0,2.0,"I love Professor Barnett! I have never gotten bored in his lectures despite not being THAT interested in some of the topics. Sometimes he speaks a little fast and throws in a lot of Hindi/Sanskrit vocab that is hard to understand, but he is always willing to explain. I would recommend this class and him to anyone."
220,90293,4.5,3.0,"I have a teacher-crush on this man.  He is sooooooooo awesome!!!  I learned a lot in this class (it's very loosely structured which was kindof disconcerting at first, but definitely grew on me)...prof. barnett really knows his stuff.  and yes his sarcasm and humor are fabulous!"
221,90293,4.0,3.0,"He is a good lecturer and livens things up with plenty of humor.  The material in 202 is much more interesting than 201.  His tests are open book and open notes, and he doesnt grade them too harshly.  Only problem, as mentioned below, is he doesnt date his syllabi, so its easy to put off the reading"
222,90293,4.5,1.0,Very knowledgable and helpful
223,90293,2.5,2.0,"While he is very knowledgable on the subject, he throws in too many Hindi/Sanskrit(&#63;) words into his sentences which makes some sentences hard to comprehend. While you should take this class, be advised it can put you to sleep. Also openly very liberal. If given the choice, I'd take it again."
224,90293,4.0,2.0,"Never met such a professor! Very flexible to your needs. A cool, sarcastic comic side he has. A very good discussion professor! Immense knowledge about south-east asia, including local dialect."
225,90293,2.5,3.0,"Great material, but the structure is whack.  The syllabus is not dated, leaving it up to his discretion.  People were supposed to do 10 minute reports, and ended up talking for 30-45 minutes.  That was ridiculous. Other than that, the class was great."
226,90293,4.5,2.0,"Great class - amazing how much you will learn, but done in a totally innovative way. He has it very loosely structured, great speaker, great advice giver. Sometimes a little disorganized, but I highly recommend it."

229,90293,4.5,2.0,"hilarious professor, take his class"
230,1827005,1.0,5.0,"The 1800 sequence community is very snobbish and elite. Not diverse at all and is a culmination of lack of diversity in admissions. 90% of the students are rich and white. Serbulea assigns more busy work than worthy assignments, and assigns iClickers during class as if students won't show up for class. Oh btw, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 am. Beware"
231,1827005,5.0,4.0,"Like you will hear from many, Professor Serbulea is very intimidating at first, but she really does care about what she teaches and the students she has. Organic chemistry is not easy, but she does a very good job of setting students up for success. Lectures are great, exams are rough if you do not take the time to study, and homework is not bad."
232,1827005,5.0,5.0,"She says &quot;study chemistry every day.&quot; This is not a friendly jest. Worst grade I got in college... would take it again 100%. Amazing professor, so eager to teach. It is a rare opportunity to test your limits to the breaking point. She is an amazing professor and, if you put in the work, it will still be paying off years from now. Commit to it."
233,1827005,5.0,5.0,"Serbulea might seem scary at first, but she really cares about each student's success. Her class is very tough, but she is a decent lecturer and if you put in the work, you'll do well in the class. Grading is extremely fair and the feedback you receive on exams is valuable. TAs are great, use the textbook, it is very important."
234,1827005,5.0,4.0,"Serbulea is the best professor I've had at UVA to date. Yes, she's scary at first, but if you work hard in class and spend time learning the course material, she will take note of your hard work and appreciate it. Go to office hours, do the homework, and go to TA review sessions for the best chance at doing well in the course."
235,1827005,3.0,4.0,she goes on and on in lecture for so long and yet there was so much I had to learn on my own
236,1827005,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Serbulea is by far the best professor I have had in all of undergrad. She seems tough at first, but she offers so many opportunities to improve your grade. Her tests are tough, but fair, and there are always extra credit points available. She explains orgo in a way that makes sense and it is very do-able to get an A or A- if you put the work in"
237,1827005,4.0,4.0,"Serbulea seems really cold at the start of the year, but really does care a lot about her students. She is very organized (weekly homework, starts exactly at the same time every day, etc.,) and is good at explaining things but stays on one topic for a little too long. Lectures can be a little dry, but Serbulea is clearly very knowledgable."
238,1827005,4.0,5.0,"Do not take the accelerated Organic Chemistry if you're not prepared to commit yourself to learning it -- you've got to spend a solid 15 hours a week outside of class to really have the comfort that you need to succeed in this class. Aloof at first, Professor Serbulea truly does care about the success of her students, but don't waste her time."
239,1827005,4.0,4.0,"Overall, a very good professor. She teaches you all the important things you need to know in lecture but expects you to know everything in the textbook (except for specifically excluded sections). All material listed in the syllabus is fair game for the exam. Although it is important to stay on top of things as she'll teach you stuff day of exams."
240,1827005,3.5,5.0,"She is a really great lecturer. She makes everything so understandable in class, but then the exams are like NOTHING you've ever seen before, I mean straight up impossible. She's very structured (mandatory weekly homework) and timely, but she's unapproachable. I would never go to her office hours for help because she's scary. Many clicker questions"
241,1827005,2.0,5.0,"Professor Serbulea is probably the worst professor I have had at UVA to date. She is cold and unapproachable. When you go to her office hours, she demeans you for not knowing what you got wrong on a test and makes it seem like you missed the easiest thing in the world. Her lectures are pretty clear, but she still fails to clearly explain everything"
242,1827005,3.5,4.0,"The class is overall very well structured and her lectures are amazing. I learn a lot during class and she really helps solidify my understanding of the subject. However, one on one, she is not as approachable as some teachers. She tends to be condescending and impatient, which can rub some people the wrong way."
243,1827005,2.0,5.0,Expect not to know what you're doing the first few weeks. You will have to work a lot.
244,1827005,4.0,4.0,Serbulea is an amazing professor who really wants her students to do well. She's funny and engaging. But you do have to put in the effort to do well. Definitely recommend taking her class for orgo
245,1827005,4.0,4.0,Dry lectures would have more sleeping students if not for caffeine and pre-med anxiety. Presents material deeply and clearly.
246,1827005,1.5,5.0,"She is good at explaining things and her lectures are clear. Her clicker questions are fair, her tests are very difficult, and she does not curve. Serbulea is very mean person. If you try and ask her for help she will knock down everything you say in the most condescending way. Probably the most unapproachable teacher I've had at UVA. "
247,1827005,5.0,4.0,"Organic chemistry is hard, but Serbulea does a wonderful job at elucidating the material in lecture and making the chemical logic of reactions make sense. As someone who took McGarvey for CHEM 2410, I ended up with a better grade in Serbulea's class even though she only curved a few points. Reading the textbook isn't necessary, but do the homework!"
248,1827005,4.5,5.0,"Professor Serbulea is a difficult but very fair teacher. She goes through the lectures very thoroughly, and her lectures and exams are based off the textbook. She may be intimidating, but if she sees that you continually go to office hours and ask questions, she will remember and appreciate you. Exams were difficult but fair, and I recommend her!"
249,1827005,1.0,5.0,"The absolute WORST professor I have EVER had!! Her lectures are useless, but you have to go because of clicker questions. The homework has nothing to do with the lectures and sometimes you can't even find help in the text. She has no clue what she's doing, she stresses the most unimportant things. Avoid her at all costs!"
250,1827005,1.5,5.0,like the previous commenter said she moves very very very fast through all the material. There is no curve ZIPPP NONE at the end so your exam grades are what averages to your final grade = NOT ideal for orgo. I took McGarvey for 2420 and ended up getting a better grade for the same amount of effort because of the huge curve
251,1827005,3.0,4.0,"She moves quickly; there's almost no time during class to recuperate and gather your mind. The average of tests usually was above 70, so she feels like there's no need to curve. However, the tests aren't particularly easy. Some kids are just much smarter than you'd hope (as a cut-throat pre-med). Study LOTS and do the Sapling online homework!"
252,1687760,4.5,2.0,Marie was a very fair grader and was always willing to her students get better. She kept class as interesting as it could be for an ENWR
253,1687760,4.5,2.0,"This class has been really great. The books we've read are interesting, and Marie is good at picking-up common themes amongst them. She is also a very fair grader and is very helpful when it comes to writing papers for the Second Writing Requirement. However, enthusiasm is a must for this class, or you will probably hate it."
254,1687760,5.0,3.0,"Marie is a very nice, helpful person. She does not assign too much work and keeps discussions very interesting and engaging."
255,1687760,5.0,2.0,"Marie is a really cool professor. She doesn't give a lot of work, keeps the reading reasonable, and is really nice. Usually in the English department but offered class in MESA this semester."
256,2015444,3.5,1.0,Prof. Ronayne makes the class interesting and provides a lot of in depth material to read. he is a fairly easy grader and doesn't assign insurmountable assignments. There were three papers no more than 5 pages long.  My only complaint is he doesn't post grades for assignments right away and is slow to respond to emails regarding coursework. 
257,2351329,3.0,4.0,"Overall just an ok experience. The material is not easy, especially if math is not your strong suit, and Ryals doesn't do a lot to help with that. Taught as a reversed classroom, so you watch recorded lectures outside of class and do practice with a group during class. Hw on webwork could be tough sometimes and the tests are pretty hard."
258,2351329,3.0,5.0,"She is a lovely person, very understanding and always on time for her office hours; I know I am not the best critical thinker, but I always study hard to make up for it. Everything was fine for me until the first exam, open-note, it was nothing like the homework. If you are fast at solving new problems, I think this class might suit you well!"
259,1941731,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Calamita is an absolutely amazing professor!! She is so sweet and does a great job teaching Italian. My Italian improved so much as a result of taking her class, and she inspired me to be an Italian minor! Would highly recommend taking this class with her."
260,1941731,4.0,1.0,"Francesca is a great Italian teacher. She definitely knows the language since she's a native. The class usually has a lot of assignments, so make sure you stay on top of everything. Fair grader. Show up to class and study and you will be fine! Attendance definitely matters! "
261,1941731,4.5,2.0,"Italian was her first language, so she has no problem understanding the class."
262,1269987,5.0,3.0,"Joe is really laid back and makes the material pretty easy to follow.  His teaching style is clear, and he's extremely helpful outside of class.  He's kinda awkward sometimes, but only in the best of ways and his corny jokes only make the class even more enjoyable.  THe first midterm is pretty easy, but watch out because the second one is tough."
263,1269987,4.0,3.0,"Joe was a very laid back teacher. He laughs at akward times, but it's funny. Calculus is hard anyway but going to his office hours (and sometimes the entire class would be in there to warn you) he would help you with your homework. Very helpful, really cool guy. The kind you wouldn't mind getting a beer with."
264,737513,1.0,5.0,I've sent him 3 emails and he doesn't respond.  Worst major advisor ever.  What am I supposed to do&#63;
265,2294009,5.0,4.0,Good.
266,2294009,5.0,2.0,great
267,2294009,5.0,3.0,great hands on data science class
268,2294009,5.0,3.0,Incredible teacher.
269,295166,2.5,5.0,"I came into this class with an amazing high school record in Calc 1 and 2.  I found out Calc 3 is nothing like high school or the AP, especially with McCrimmon.  He never gives concrete examples or uses actual numbers in class, which makes the homework, webwork, & midterms very difficult. The TA is helpful but can't save you. I discourage taking it"
270,295166,4.5,4.0,"Prof. McCrimmon is a great professor to take with, especially for a hardcore math class like 331. I really enjoyed his relaxing and enlightening teaching style. His grading was pretty strict but that was only for the improvement of the students. At the end, he gave a generous curve to the whole class. So if you are gonna take 331, take with HIM!!!"
271,295166,2.5,4.0,"He was definitely a good person, decent sense of humor. He was very forgiving with his grading (huge curves) and almost always extended deadlines. However, he is VERY hard to follow in class because he never gives any concrete examples and likes to go off on confusing tangents. He is very abstract and vague, but makes up for it with his leniency."
272,295166,1.5,3.0,funny man but homeworks are absurd. he is extremely abstract and understanding the material (and being able to do the math) does not mean you will do well in the class. he expects you to memorize proofs word for word and be able to answer true/false questions using them.
273,295166,1.5,3.0,"Sure he's nice, but a good professor he is not. He tells you all that you need to prepare for the class, but when you go, he just confuses you in his explanations of everything. He goes on a trip of his own, and very rarely comes back. His TA sucks; he is just as bad explaining as is McCrimmon. The class is not bad, just avoid taking it with him."
274,295166,3.5,3.0,"He is a nice professor that loves to help. I, personally, don't work well with his teaching style in class, but I do understand him very well at office hours. If you are confused, go to his office hours. McCrimmon is more than willing to help. He is very kind and enjoys what he does. He is more than willing to devote extra time to students!"
275,295166,4.5,2.0,"He is definitely strange, but funny in class. He has a different style of teaching that throws some for a loop until you get used to it. Makes you think about the theory and the problems and apparently some people don't like to think (thus the poor comments).  Be advised that he often makes up his own names for theories that don't have names."
276,295166,4.0,5.0,"Had him for APMA 308 too. 551 was EXTREMELY hard and I didn't always get his explanations, but he'd at least give us a handout with anything we'd need to know on the test. I ended up getting an A even though I didn't totally understand what was going on. He's REALLY funny, nice, and helpful! I sincerely enjoyed taking two semesters with him."
277,295166,3.0,3.0,hes ok
278,295166,1.0,5.0,Damned Schmoo.  Avoid this class with him and take it with Holt instead.  He is a nice guy but very very strange.
279,295166,5.0,1.0,"Greatest Professor to live in the face of this planet. Funny, Kind , and always willing to help. Total Comedian in class. HMMMMM...SMHOOOO!!!! This man is a total **** in every sense of the word. Sign up for this class. You wont be disappointed."
280,295166,3.5,4.0,"He's a nice guy, and helpful if you go to office hours.  However, I found his style of teaching VERY CONFUSING.  If you like seeing actual examples with numbers, not just theory, you will be very confused."
281,295166,4.0,3.0,"I found his teaching style irritating and unexciting. He's got a bunch of wierd mannerisms and quirks that do not add to his teaching ability. Going to his class helped, but not greatly."
282,295166,5.0,3.0,"HE's a sweetheart of a guy, tells corny jokes to make you laugh, willing to help. Will not let you get behind with his quizzes and homework all the time. Lots of outside work, but well worth it, minimal studying for exam because you keep up so well."
283,295166,5.0,1.0,"He's a genuinely nice guy who wants people to do well. He will go out of his way to help anyone that really wants to learn.  He's also a funny guy, and his interesting sence of humor actully made me enjoy the 9:30am lecture."
284,295166,5.0,2.0,Nice and clear in class.  Very very helpful in office hours and makes himself very available.  Tests and homeworks are fair.
285,295166,2.5,1.0,"He's a very funny guy with a unique teaching style. You either get him, or you don't. I would suggest sitting in on a class before signing up to see if you're on the same page. The homework and tests aren't bad at all."
286,295166,3.5,3.0,"Relatively easy if you go to office hours, but he sucks at explaining in class.  Nice guy with relatively easy tests."
287,295166,4.5,3.0,"A genuinely nice guy who wants people to do well. He will give help to anyone who asks. He makes the class more entertaining because he's funny, too."
288,295166,5.0,1.0,The homeworks are not hard at all. Maybe the person below should try going to him for help rather than blasting him on the internet. He really wants people to understand and do well.
289,295166,1.0,5.0,Could not for the life of me keep up with the class. His homework is way too hard for his lectures and has these dumb quizzes everyday.
290,295166,5.0,2.0,his jokes are corny but hes easy and good

296,286979,4.0,3.0,"Professor Elson is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about linguistics. You need to attend class to understand the material, especially if you've never taken a linguistics course or aren't that interested in it (like me). Graded on two take-home tests and a final. As long as you put in effort it's not a difficult class."
297,286979,3.0,2.0,Professor Elson was a horribel lecturer and his whole class was lecturing. He did not offer many opportunities for students to include their own thoughts or talk to other classmates about the content. I did not do a single reading and think that I am going to get an A in the class. All 3 assignments in the class were take home tests that were easy.
298,286979,4.0,3.0,"Decent professor. The only notes he gives are in-class handouts, so class is mandatory or you don't get the info. We could miss up to 3 classes, but he doesn't take attendance every class. Assignments are ambiguous, but he's mostly checking that you have the main idea and you tried. Not a hard class if you show up and somewhat pay attention."
299,286979,3.0,3.0,"Tough-love type, likes old school pedagogy, and grades are based on improvement and effort- but he's not for everyone. He's very opinionated and will go off on random tangents. Sometimes it's endearing, sometimes you want to tear your hair out. You'll learn A LOT but your enjoyment will depend on how well you tolerate the tangents."
300,286979,4.0,3.0,"Elson is an old-school professor who is very organized and knowledgeable. The subject can be dry if you are not that into linguistics. Expectations on homework were somewhat unclear., but it's not hard to get a decent grade, and the workload is low. We basically just had to do 4 assignments and a take-home final."
301,286979,3.0,4.0,"Very crabby and sometimes acts like he is the smartest guy in the world, but he definitely knows what he is talking about. He takes all your notes for you and just wants to teach - doesn't care about grades. He will give you an A or A- based just on how you've improved/learned the course material. Take for easy A, but can be tough to sit through"
302,286979,2.0,5.0,"Definitely means business in regards to his cell phone policy. Used the phrase ""cell phones off and away please"" a dozen times every class. He seems intimidating, but he's not so bad. The class is mixed with a graduate level course, so definitely not an easy A (or B). I didn't take the discussion section, and I suffered because of it."
303,286979,3.5,4.0,"Old School, but remarkably intelligent. Expects his students to be adults. Will need to go to office hours to get above a B."
304,286979,4.0,3.0,"&quot;Cell phone OFF AND AWAY&quot;- Elson everyday. Obey it. Otherwise, it's a good class if you're interested in Linguistics. If you go to his office hours you'll see how WILLING he is to make sure you understand the material! Even in class he shows it. He's funny how he goes on his tangents but tangents are created for you to relax :)"
305,286979,4.0,3.0,"Intro to Linguistics with Elson was good - he is a prickly old guy, but he has a sense of humor and I don't believe he could truly dislike a student. Show up, turn your phone off, and do the work. Be attentive and neat, and you'll do fine. He definitely cares about the subject and the students. He'll help you understand; that's what he's there for."
306,286979,4.5,3.0,"You will learn a LOT. Not really interested prior to class, but he is an awesome lecturer and always available to talk to you about subject. Extremely helpful. I'm not inclined to go to class when not mandatory, but I almost never miss this class. He's passionate and well-informed about his subject. Highly recommend this class."
307,286979,2.5,4.0,This class will show you exactly how uninteresting linguistics is.  Don't take unless you want to listen to 50 minutes of Elson spewing pure vitriol 3 days a week.
308,286979,4.5,4.0,"I'm not sure where the negative comments are coming from.  I worked my butt off in this class and the pay off was clear.  You learn A LOT, regardless of interest in the subject and Elson cares so much about his students.  Total availability for any questions or concerns; experience is clear.  Take this class expecting to work and you will succeed!"
309,286979,4.5,4.0,"Despite a frequent scowl and stringent cell phone policy, I really enjoyed Elson's class.  He's a good lecturer and has interesting views; he's very willing to review.  He also has a voice kind of like Woody Allen's."
310,286979,5.0,4.0,"Don't listen to what these other people have to say! Elson was on e of the most effective teachers I had as a first year. This is due to his 30+ years of experience! He's extremely clear in lecture and always summarize the material at the beginning and the end of class. His grading is very fair, and his demands are actually really reasonable."
311,286979,3.5,5.0,"An amazingly nice guy who bends over backwards to help his students.  He, literally, has an &quot;open-door&quot; policy for assisting his students and never seems rushed when you apporach him and is eager to explain tough material until it is understood.  I expected him to be a first-class **** but he was nothing of the sort and earned my respect."
312,286979,5.0,4.0,"Very difficult class, but if you're willing to learn, which should be the goal anyway, you'll get a ton out of this.  Very receptive to helping students.  Some find him very critical, which he can be, but it's really only to get you to study and work hard.  He expects all of his students to want to do well, and you need to work for it,"
313,286979,2.5,4.0,"If the course were about being an arrogant, picky professor who grades based on standards that he never makes clear, then he'd be the best professor I ever had."
314,286979,1.5,5.0,"Elson is pompous and outdated. DO NOT TAKE this course unless it is required of you for your major. It is tedious and not worth the effort.  In the end, any knowledge you may have gained is completely useless.  Elson himself admits that the course hasn't changed in 30 years.  If that isn't enough warning for you...good luck. MOST USELESS CLASS EVER"
315,286979,2.5,5.0,Don't bother...the hw assignments don't prepare you for the final. The books are too expensive and you'll ruin your GPA.
316,286979,1.0,3.0,"AWFUL! Don't take the class unless you're a linguistics major and it's required. I'd recommend Languages of the World (Anth) for a good intro linguistics class. Impossible to get an A. Grades on a rubric without telling you what's required. Boring and tangential lectures. Outdated texts, outdated professor."
317,286979,2.0,2.0,"This teacher is fond of taking off points for ommitting things in assignments he never told you to put down.  He is very whiny, not incredibly bright, and he teaches trivial minutia in lngs 325."
318,286979,5.0,4.0,"A genuinely nice guy. Cares about your understanding of the material, so take advantage of office hours. He'll help you out and he's nice to talk to. This class IS DIFFICULT and it's hard to get an A anything, but you'll come out of it will better analysis skills. His &quot;nitpicking&quot; is for the student's best interest. Why be here if you can't spell&#63;"
319,286979,1.5,4.0,Extremely picky and repetitive. Prepare to lose half a letter grade on assignments for spelling words like &quot;occurence&quot; or &quot;precede&quot; incorrectly.
320,286979,5.0,1.0,PEEN!
321,286979,4.0,4.0,"Great professor! He pays attention to details and is a perfectionist, but he's incredibly intelligent and it shows in his teaching. HIs classes are not easy, but you learn a lot"
322,286979,2.0,2.0,"Professor Elson is extremely repetitive, and boring.  He's nit-picky, especially about tiny little details and has turned me off from Linguistics completely. He can be whiny, complains, is very arrogant, and not particularly helpful. Don't take his Intro to Linguistics class."
323,286979,5.0,4.0,Mr Elson is a professor I will never forget.  He's old school - just chalk and words.  His criticism of modern education is original and ingenious - you'll leave the course with a completely new perspective.
324,286979,2.5,3.0,"This is my least favorite class I have taken in all my time at UVA. I have never met a more unpleasant, arrogant, whiny, and full-of-crap professor."
325,286979,3.0,2.0,Incredibly redundant.
326,286979,4.5,3.0,"Presents information clearly, but is often repetitive. Very picky when grading exams (long, essay style, but they are take-home!). Though once you figure out his style, the class is rather easy.  I highly recommend the TA (and now grader) Blake Galbreath."
327,286979,2.5,3.0,"AVOID HIM - uses pointless and expensive books, does not give out a real syllabus, gave no exams (or assignments) before drop date, boring, not AT ALL concise, extremely repetitive.... on the upside, does very amusing & bad southern accent impressions"
328,286979,5.0,2.0,"very clearly presents (and reiterates) material.  the assignments are not very easy, but not really hard either- and they're kinda fun.  He has a fun and dry sense of humor that comes out on occasion.  great class!"
329,286979,1.5,3.0,rude yankee
330,286979,2.0,2.0,bombastic and repetitive; could be much more concise
331,286979,3.0,2.0,not too hard but soooo boring
332,1245444,4.5,3.0,"The class was extremely engaging and well-structured. I found her to be a bit of a tough grader, but it's only because she expects quality. I always looked forward to attending class and came away feeling like I had a very good grasp on Mediterranean history. The readings she chose were fascinating. You should absolutely take a class with Rowe!"
333,1245444,3.5,3.0,"I really enjoyed it! Subject material was interesting, and class was engaging"
334,1245444,3.0,1.0,"Basically recites the textbook in a very abbreviated manner.  If you want to pass the class, doze through class and take a few notes.  If you want to actually learn, skip the class and read the textbook.  I recommend taking this class because you will learn a lot of history and most cetainly get an A.  Also it's so easy and you don't have to attend"
335,1245444,3.0,3.0,"Not that hard of a class. Three 2-3 page papers and then one paper 6-8 pages. One midterm and one final. Lectures can be extremely boring and seem identical to what you read in the textbook. She can be monotone, which put me asleep a lot, just get a good TA."
336,1245444,2.0,3.0,One of the professors I have ever had.  It doesn't seem like she knows the material and can't answer students' questions confidently.  Do not take this class with her -- it is an experience in fact regurgitation
337,1245444,3.0,4.0,No Comments
338,1450253,2.5,4.0,"Brilliant guy, but often during lectures forgets that not everyone is a philosophy graduate student like him. Get ready to work for your grade and make time to meet him at his office hours."
339,1450253,5.0,2.0,Love this guy!! great prof. knows his stuff
340,352530,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Bouchard is a genuinely warm and extremely sincere person. He had inspired me to pursue literature and philosophy. I would say this course is life-changing for me: it makes me rethink relations, identity, and love, and also how reality is structured in terms of these concepts."
341,352530,5.0,2.0,He the most caring professor I have had. He really wants you to do well/is a very fair grader. There is a good amount of reading but the books are interesting and very easy to get through. The papers aren't long and he will help/give you more time if you need. He can be a little hard to understand at first but its worth getting used to. Take it!
342,352530,4.5,2.0,"This may sound corny, but Prof. Bouchard had really inspired me in Religious Philosophy and I genuinely look forward to his classes every other day. One of my favorite classes I've ever taken at UVA. Well-prepared, always answers questions and encourages class participation."
343,352530,3.5,2.0,"An interesting class, especially if you like reading and essays, over textbooks and multiple choice. Professor Bouchard is insightful and quite funny, though the class could get a bit boring and wasn't as structured as others, and sometimes he seemed to expect students to read his mind to answer in class questions.  Still, recommended."
344,352530,3.5,5.0,"Bouchard can, at times be difficult to follow, but I adjusted fairly quickly.  He really knows what he is talking about, and is very caring about his students.  Only take 360 is you are serious about theatre or religion, but 216 is much more accessible."
345,352530,3.0,3.0,"He has a speaking deficiency, but you get use to it. Great teacher, very passionate about the subject, and tells great corny jokes. You can tell he cares for his students too.  It is a lot of reading, 1 novel every 1-2 weeks, but if you're interested in religion and literature, this is the class to take. Highly Recommend."
346,352530,3.5,3.0,"Bouchard is genuinely kind and often mildly amusing, but the lecture often seems to drag--get the dozing off thing a lot. Material is interesting though. Tests are take home, but do not procrastinate on them. Discussion is good and books are sometimes enjoyable. Recommended with caffeine only."
347,352530,2.5,4.0,"Professor Bouchard knows his information extremely well. I often leave lecture feeling like it was over my head, but clarification in discussion sections and by asking him questions solves that problem. I recommend sitting close up front, as he is sometimes difficult to understand."
348,352530,2.5,2.0,No Comments
349,352530,4.5,3.0,"Excellent teacher -- kind heart.  He addresses some complex ideas, so at first it may seem that he is not organized, but when you see what he is doing, his style is all the more inviting.  Highly recommended."
350,352530,2.0,4.0,"Worst class I have taken at UVa.  Some good books but most are boring and about bizarre religious concepts...a whole book about the relationship between I and You, come on! Too much reading, horrible take-home exams, hard to understand him or the concepts he teaches.  Jason Danner is a cool TA"
351,352530,4.5,3.0,"A kind man, and a good teacher"
352,352530,4.0,2.0,very engaging and a really kind person
353,352530,1.0,4.0,boring
354,352530,5.0,3.0,"Prof Bouchard is one of the best teachers at UVA.  He is enthusiastic, caring, and intelligent.  I am glad that I had the chance to study with him."
355,2162967,5.0,2.0,"Sandro is a great guy who cares about his students not only passing, but also understanding Italian. He was funny and took care to explain things we didn't understand, though he refuses to speak English I understood everything he taught us. I would definitely take this class again!"
356,2162971,4.0,3.0,"He's a PhD student so I think he felt as if he had to grade more harshly. Also it was his first time teaching and he wouldd try to teach us things FAR beyond a beginner's level class and would get angry at us for not speaking, but didn't understand that we didn't speak because we didn't know what was going on. All in all I still loved the class."
357,1351964,5.0,2.0,"Gates is very understanding with late work and genuinely wants you to do your best, even if life gets in the way of passing work in on time. She's a very lenient grader on tests and the class is pretty easy in general, but you still learn so much. A lot of participation is required in class, but in my experience it wasn't intimidating. Fave prof!"
358,1351964,4.0,3.0,"She's pretty nice and very understanding when it comes to turning in assignments. She also clearly wants you to do the work to learn it, not just for the grade."
359,1884447,3.0,3.0,"The recession may be good for my health, but Dr. Ruhm's lectures are certainly not."
360,1573152,4.0,3.0,"Great guy. I learned a lot in his class, though his tests are a bit challenging."
361,1573152,2.0,5.0,I failed his class. He's a nice guy and kind of funny but he's too busy to set up meetings with. He doesn't really care much about who you are. 
362,1573152,5.0,1.0,"This guy wins. If you ahve to take Psyc 3005, make sure it's with Morris(Avoid Freeman at all costs.). You can ace his tests with 1 hour of studying."
363,1573152,4.5,1.0,"Morris is very friendly and he makes PSYC 3005 easy. To be honest, his slides are monotonous and repetitive with lots of summary sections and worked out examples but it makes studying for exams easier. His tests are very fair & averages are high. The mode on 3 of the 4 midterms was an 100. Also, you can drop one of those or even the final."
364,1573152,5.0,1.0,Morris is an awesome professor. Really cares about his helping students learn and understand the material. I dreaded this class coming into the semester but it was a total breeze. The material is pretty boring but Morris cracks corny jokes that lighten up the mood of lecture. One of my favorite professors at UVA.
365,942378,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely loved ECON 4160 with Professor Miller. In my opinion, she's always very clear and she's funny, too. I would recommend this only to people who like economics, though."
366,942378,2.0,3.0,Not a great lecturer. Problem sets are a good indication of what's on the exams.
367,942378,2.5,4.0,"interesting subject material, difficult midterm and problem sets, easy final. basic level of competency in calc I/econ 301 sufficient."
368,942378,5.0,4.0,"Very interesting class, but the straightforward lectures aren't adequate preparation for the sometimes challenging homework and test questions. Doing well in 301 and having some measure of aptitude for econ should be enough to get you through this class. Familiarity with calc 2 is essential for the analytical portion of the course."
369,1786157,1.0,5.0,"Do NOT take this class unless you are a NATIVE speaker. If not, you do not stand a chance. Prof Kim does not know how to teach Korean, and her expectations for a 101/102 Korean class are totally unrealistic. She is literally the worst professor I have had at UVa. Save yourself and your GPA. Take Japanese or Spanish instead."
370,1786157,4.0,2.0,"This prof. is good & nice, but don't get on her bad side. Homework is moderately hard. Tests are fair. Just be careful of the time, because you might not finish if you go too slowly. There are 4 exams, 2 quizzes/week, homework almost every day, and the final written/oral. If you're interested in Korean, take it; otherwise, it'll be hard."
371,377135,3.0,3.0,"My first ever college course as a visiting student in Summer 2015. His material really opened my eyes &amp; the professor was certainly knowledgeable &amp; competent, but after attending several years of community college he seems pretty average in retrospect, don't fall behind on readings or lectures."
372,377135,5.0,4.0,"Final exam is 50% final grade. Best lecturer I've ever had to date. This class makes you work for it but it's worth it; you come out of this class a more perceptive and empathetic person. The subject matter is of course extremely heavy, and was really hard emotionally."
373,377135,3.0,5.0,V3ry hard grader
374,377135,4.0,3.0,My favorite professor this semester.
375,377135,3.5,3.0,Very into what he's teaching. His voice draws you in and you can't help but pay attention. Only 3 papers and one midterm. Very manageable. 
376,377135,5.0,2.0,"The class was pretty easy as long as you kept up with the reading (there was kind of a lot of it, but not unmanageable). Professor Rossman is really knowledgeable and passionate about the subject and I think that both of the TA's in my class seemed really nice. They didn't grade very hard at all."
377,377135,4.0,3.0,His lectures are pretty interesting. His knowledge on Russian history truly is extensive and impressive. And you really don't have to read the textbook if you attend his lectures and read the packets.
378,377135,3.5,5.0,"Tons and tons of reading, prepare for 90+ pages of PDF files every other night. It was a shame that the readings were so redundant. Also, your TA  grades your exams and your papers, and also participation grade. The class was worthwhile, but I would definitely not take it with a very full courseload."
379,377135,4.0,4.0,this was a great class. Rossman is one of those people who you listen to and just feel yourself getting smarter. He knows a lot about the subject and the class is always interesting. I would DEFINITELY recommend it! it's worth the work
380,377135,3.5,4.0,Awesome class. Great prof. Tons of reading. Go to class take good notes and you should be good for exams. You have to write several short papers. TA's are anal so watch out for them.
381,377135,2.0,3.0,"Prof. Rossman definately knows what he is teaching, there is no doubt about that whatsoever. However, he made this class very dull. I was a little disappointed, especially because the readings for the class were very engaging, yet he talked about the topics with no enthusiasm/passion."
382,377135,4.5,3.0,"Great Class. If you go to class, you dont need to read the textbook because through the review sheet and class notes, youll be fine for exams. Lectures did get a little dull later in the semester, but I learned so much about Russian history."
383,377135,5.0,3.0,This class was awesome. Rossman did a great job keeping the subject from getting too depressing without losing any of its seriousness. Readings were helpful.(There is A LOT though!) TOTALLY RECOMMEND!
384,377135,4.5,3.0,awesome class! rossman is extremely knowledgeable on the subject! just do the study guide.. i never opened the books at all (or saw the movies). GREAT CLASS!
385,377135,5.0,3.0,"This guy is awesome. Clear lecturer, gives a review sheet, and extremely knowledgable on the subject. Take this class!"
386,377135,5.0,3.0,"Ask him to give the final review sheet out earlier, cause its an assload, you will learn about Russian History and he knows his stuff, just attend lecutre and pray to god you can write for three hours cuz that final is like woah !"
387,377135,3.0,1.0,you can ace this class without going to lecture or reading the books..all you have to do is memorize the study guide.
388,377135,4.0,3.0,"he was a very helpful professor, gave out study guides before exams and it was not entirely necessary to read the material, just go to lectures.  they are pretty interesting because he's very knowledgeable and is pretty interested in russian history and all that..."
389,377135,4.0,3.0,rossman knows his stuff. goes along well with powerpoints. you can still do well without attending all lectures.
390,377135,4.0,2.0,"Great lecturer and reall knowledgeable about the subject. His enthusiasm diminished later in the class, but still more interesting than a lot of professors. Not too harsh on grading and his sweaters in 90 degree weather kept me amused."
391,377135,4.0,2.0,"Very very good professor at the first half of the semester, then once we left Stalin and Khrushchev he began reading from a sheet that he prepared before class.  Became very boring and monotonous and seemed as though he stopped caring.  Good introduction to modern politics of Russia. but by the end lecture became very very tedious."
392,377135,1.5,3.0,No Comments
393,377135,4.5,4.0,"Definitely an expert on subject. Clear, interesting, organized lectures with powerpoint outlines."
394,377135,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Rossman's lectures are clear and concise, and he teaches with enthusiasm and finesse."
395,377135,4.0,4.0,"knows his stuff, very enthusiastic about russian history, class is moderately easy if you attend class"
396,377135,4.5,3.0,"If you are interested in Russia, this is your man, he really knows his stuff and will present more than one side of the argument.  Overall a very good teacher."
397,2441531,5.0,3.0,"SUCH a great professor. I took Professor Sohail for French 2020 and she was one of the kindest professors I've ever had. She's extremely understanding, provides great feedback, gives lots of opportunities to learn, and is always willing to help. I absolutely recommend her to anyone else needing to take French."
398,1163586,5.0,3.0,Dr. Bennett is awesome! I knew nothing about Biomechanics but he made the class fun and easy to learn with his laughter and charisma. Must take him!
399,1163586,5.0,3.0,"Took Bennett for KIN485 at SFSU. He was really laid back, I appreciated his accessibility as a professor, as well as his humor and his real-world applications. Biomechanics is a heavy subject, but he definitely makes it bearable and interesting. Stay on top of the HW and the quizzes, and you should be good. I would recommend him!"
400,1163586,5.0,2.0,Professor Bennett is a great guy and a really cool teacher.
401,1163586,3.5,1.0,"Professor Bennett was a good teacher for Intro to Engineering, his class was really chill and he helped a lot when you needed it."
402,1360196,5.0,3.0,"I had Professor Floyd in the Spring for another class that was held asynchronously and it was really good. He has clear expectations and asks you questions to push you to think outside the box. I am taking this class with him again as I like the subject matter. As long as you try, he will help you."
403,1360196,5.0,4.0,"Great lectures and lots of fun &quot;tidbits&quot; in class that will make for an enjoyable and rich semester! However, he seems to be book enthusiast (what good Historian wouldn't be?) so get ready to read a LOT! Each submissions is returned with great feedback and he works with you as long as you want to keep learning! Take at least one of his classes!"
404,1360196,5.0,4.0,"He's probably the best professor I've had - and I'm in my last semester (in BIS).  He's not an easy grader, but if you have a legitimate issue during the semester, he's extremely kind and understanding.  Definitely always knows what he's talking about and clearly spends a lot of time prepping for class. Highly recommend."
405,1360196,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Not the easiest class, but Prof. Floyd was always available for office hours. Very helpful and always willing to go the extra mile for his students. Even if you're not a history major, I would highly recommend taking one of his classes."
406,1360196,4.5,2.0,Excellent professor. Lectures are clear and he's very helpful outside of class as well. Highly recommended. This was my favorite class this semester.
407,1360196,5.0,2.0,Fantastic professor who kept me engaged with both interesting lectures and assignments; I would highly recommend the class to anyone with an interest in European History.
408,1360196,5.0,2.0,"Jane Austen - great class, great readings, interesting assignments, great professor."
409,1360196,4.5,2.0,"Floyd is great. I took this class and I'm in a seminar with him this semester. Not an excessive amount of reading, class isn't too hard, and learned a lot. He's really clear and keeps class from getting too boring.The only bad thing about this class was the 9am MWF slot."
410,885073,5.0,1.0,"Literally the best professor at UVA. Had her for 4 semesters straight. After just 2 years of Chinese with her, I went to China for a summer, and they were astounded by how exceptional my chinese was. "
411,885073,3.5,2.0,"She's not too bad, but expects a lot out of you. She can be a little harsh too. She teaches pretty fast, but if you do the work, not too bad."
412,885073,3.0,2.0,"very kind, easy weekly tests, wants you to learn"
413,885073,5.0,3.0,"when she makes corny asian jokes, she giggles. it's cute!"
414,885073,4.5,3.0,"Content not too difficult, but challenging- introduces  formal literary language vocabulary- volume/pace of the words/style taught kinda fast.  Good class though, knows her stuff, but always very professional, never come to her with personal problems unless they are serious familial/life-death issues that conflict with Chinese class"
415,885073,2.0,2.0,B-A-D class is not hard but she operates under the pretense that it is.
416,1007964,5.0,1.0,"German is very friendly and enthusiastic about what he does. He is honest and helpful. If you ask for help he won't let you down. He is easy going and doesn't have any crazy rules for his class (like some other professors do). As my last word, TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
417,1007964,5.0,2.0,No Comments
418,1007964,2.5,2.0,"It is hard to understand him because he does not speak English. There is definitely a language barrier. He was fine as a teacher but he gave me a 0 for participation. After that it went all down hill. I got A's on 3/4 of my tests and ended up with a B-  in the class because, of what I thought, of him"
419,1007964,4.5,1.0,Great teacher!
420,1007964,5.0,3.0,"German is a really great teacher. He is extremely professional and organized, but funny and creative too, which helps a lot.  He really does all he can to help the students to learn."
421,1007964,5.0,1.0,"Awesome, laid-back guy... realizes that people have obligations that extend beyond Spanish class and is flexible with you if need be. Makes class interesting."
422,1007964,4.5,2.0,"Great professor. Approachable, helpful, and loves his students. I took him in SPAN 202, and am taking him again next semester in 314."
423,1007964,5.0,1.0,"Excellent teacher, highest qualification, 'buena gente'."
424,1007964,5.0,2.0,"He is so animated and really cares about his students' understanding of the language. He does activities that are outside the box. If you are someone who will participate in class, he will like you immediately, no matter if you are the best student in the class or not."
425,2449764,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher. She always has interesting activities to practice in class (e.g., pictionary, heads up, jeopardy, videos) and is very approachable. She knows this class is a lot of material, and she will prep you as much as possible for each exam by giving you *very helpful* advice on what to study. She is constantly reminding you of deadlines."
426,2449768,5.0,3.0,"Class was great. Professor clearly knows her stuff. Very encouraging. She is big on discussion so be sure to read and be ready to talk. I took her as a senior, wish I could have taken more classes with her."
427,2449768,3.0,1.0,"I took my COLA 1500 with Dean Smith fall 2018. Her background is in English and writing, so this is the flavor all her classes will have. She values class discussion more than anything else, and most of class was spent with open conversation. She is pretty set in her views and mostly wants to hear her own words regurgitated back in papers."
428,885106,4.5,3.0,"Prof Bailey is great at inspiring students to be good practicing engineers by modeling the behaviors of a good engineer. He is consistent and clear in his teaching style, although sometimes not as clear when he communicates his expectations. It's not uncommon to get to the end of the semester and have no idea what you will actually be evaluated on."
429,885106,4.5,4.0,"Bailey's section was definitely one of the hardest. There really isn't a lot of material to learn, but the semester-long group project was rough at times, especially as a beginning engineering student expected to solve a real engineering problem. As frustrating as it was, though, the class was definitely worth the effort and I got a lot out of it."
430,885106,5.0,3.0,bailey's intro classes are definitely the hardest out of all the intro engr classes. but in the long run i think it will definitely pay off. its not hard to understand just alot of work. overall he's an excellent teacher who's very helpful inside and outside of class and really wants to get to know you
431,885106,5.0,3.0,"Professor Bailey is an overall great person. He is very helpful and wants his students to be successful in the work world. His class is the hardest of the engineering classes, and most of the work takes place outside of class. The amount of work sometimes makes people wish they were in another class. His class is recommended though!"
432,885106,4.5,2.0,"Professor Bailey is great. He's really nice and helpful, and he's someone you can go to with any kinds of questions. The days he lectured in SYS 334 were good (especially compared with Ellen Bass). Sometimes SYS 455 is boring/pointless. He's great as a capstone advisor as well."
433,885106,4.5,4.0,Reid is a really fun professor. He seems to really enjoy teaching this class. Don't give sloppy presentations and put slide numbers in your ppts.
434,885106,3.5,2.0,Much more work than other ENGR classes!!! Fairly easy class but the lectures are boring and don't really help any. Most of the work is done outside of class on ur own time.
435,885106,2.5,3.0,The classroom time is pretty pointless.  Most of the work for the class is done outside in groups.  This work can take hours upon hours leaving little time to get stuff done for other classes.  Our class always seems to be doing way more work than the other ENGR classes.
436,885106,4.5,2.0,He's a great teacher.  He's very involved and loves what he teaches.  His class is one of the few I actually look forward to going to.
437,2736498,1.0,3.0,"Online classes with Suad were... interesting. I don't think she was prepared for Zoom. Lessons were very disorganized and nobody really knew what was going on. At least it was just intro, so we were okay. Discouraged a lot of people from continuing, though."
438,2736500,2.0,1.0,"Priya was one of the most boring lecturers I've had at UVA. Her engagements course Making Sense of the Senses, though very easy to pass with no concrete work outside of class, was the opposite of engaging. I passed every assignment with an A and was marked down for my final grade for &quot;participation&quot;. Make sure to talk in class and show up"
439,2736500,5.0,1.0,"Priya cares a lot about upcoming STEM students, but believes all students could and should care about science. Very kind and invested in students."
440,2056564,4.0,2.0,"He is a good teacher. I do not understand these bad reviews? LIke yes you need to go to class, but that is the same with every other Spanish Class. Pop Quizzes happen in every Spanish Class. Blame the Department , not the professor. Hes very funny and brings in activities outside of the normal textbook."
441,2056564,1.0,3.0,He didn't seem to care about us or the class at all. Not a fair grader and takes him literally months to return work. Does not promote an environment of learning at all.
442,2056564,1.0,3.0,he is disorganized and unprofessional and doesn't care about teaching
443,2736505,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ramazani is a supportive and intelligent professor. You can tell he really values the voices of his students. He grades papers very quickly and gives extensive feedback on them. No matter your interest in poetry, Ramazani will undoubtedly introduce you to new works and make you appreciate them. I'd take this class again if I could!"
444,2736505,3.0,4.0,"Professor Ramazani is an amazing person and very good prof, very respected at the university. However, he gives very little expectations for writing and is a VERY hard grader. Despite my best efforts I think he did not care for my writing style, and I was never able to push into the A range for him, which was very frustrating"
445,2736505,4.0,4.0,"Jahan makes poetry very interesting, and tries really hard to make content current and applicable to everyday life. His focus on Black art and artists in Fall 2020 was a huge eye-opener for me (white student)."
446,1458563,5.0,4.0,Peter Gray's facilitation of the Capstone Project provided the MSMIT program's most realistic simulation of real-world experience. Peter challenged us to think logically and dig deeper to create a compelling strategic business case and an effective presentation. I truly benefitted from his coaching and could immediately apply the skills at work.
447,1458563,5.0,3.0,Peter led the strategic management module of the MS MIT program. I would definitely take any course that Professor Gray offered - he clearly has a firm grasp on the material and has plenty of examples for how it is applied in the &quot;real world.&quot; He also takes the time to provide substantive feedback and answer ?s both during and outside of class.
448,1458563,5.0,4.0,"I had Prof Gray for Fall 2020/Spring 2021 ICE. Systems was challenging at times, but also the most helpful for future classes/jobs (process mapping, tableau, big data). I appreciated Prof Gray's clear communication style and ability to explain the most of complex topics. His pushback and feedback definitely made me a sharper thinker."
449,1458563,1.0,4.0,Prof. Gray is difficult and hard to please. He hates almost every idea from students and will find problems in anything. He is not helpful and I learned very little from his class. He also is in charge of the block and makes ICE pretty miserable. You better hope you are not in his block!
450,1458563,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Gray taught &amp; managed the Capstone Proj. for MS in MIT. He gave excellent lectures on Innovation &amp; Tech. Mgmt. He also managed &amp; supervised all student teams that spent 4 months on the Proj. His regular feedback was detailed, highly relevant, &amp; motivational. He wanted all students to succeed. You have to work for him, but it is worth it."
451,1458563,5.0,4.0,"The best professors are the ones who push you beyond your comfort zone because they believe in your ability to achieve great things. Peter believes each of his students has the ability to do great things both in and outside the classroom, and he creates an incredible learning environment that brings out the best in every MSMIT graduate. 5 stars!"
452,1458563,2.0,3.0,"Professor Gray is really intelligent. However, when asks for clarifications and answers he rejects the students when they ask question. Other professors are welcoming compared to Gray."
453,1458563,1.0,2.0,"Peter Gray communicates well with students, but he's not up to the standard of other professors at his dept at least. The class is easy enough, but you will feel like you are wasting your time, which you are. I wish I could have dropped this for another, more useful course."
454,1458563,5.0,3.0,"Peter had a deep knowledge of his subject matter, enterprise strategy.  He was always available and helpful with ideas and commentary to help the class improve.  The course was tough, but a ton of fun and applicable in the real world."
455,1458563,5.0,4.0,"Peter provides clear expectations, a readiness to support you, and active communication.  His instruction and enthusiasm for the material on business strategy helped me appreciate the content and be successful in one of the most difficult classes of the MS MIT program."
456,1458563,5.0,4.0,Professor Gray was one of the most knowledgeable and effective instructors of the MSMIT program. His enthusiasm & experience in the subject areas of business strategy and innovation are outstanding. He surely urges students to dive deeper into their research which results in a more profound understanding of the material covered in in the program.
457,1458563,5.0,3.0,"Peter easily intertwines business strategy concepts & complexities with relevant case studies that create a robust and enduring foundation of knowledge. His expertise extends beyond a linear comprehension of strategy and reveals the impacts and dependencies of business networks and behaviors. His classroom is engaged, interactive and energizing."
458,1458563,5.0,4.0,"Peter Gray is an excellent instructor. He is crystal clear in making his expectations known. His lectures are interesting and on point, providing very useful guidance for formulating and discussing business strategy. This was one of the most valuable of all the grad classes I have taken. He is not ""easy"", but you will learn a lot from him."
459,1458563,5.0,4.0,Excellent professor.  Brilliant and engaging.  One of the best professors I had in graduate school. Whenever I think about strategy in my career Peter Gray's lectures always come to mind and they are very useful.
460,1458563,5.0,1.0,"Peter Gray is an excellent professor and I highly recommend him and the MSMIT program at UVa's McIntire School of Commerce. He has a good sense of humor and his classes are very enjoyable. He communicates business strategy very well, and is very accessible and willing to help. I learned a lot from him that is definitely improving my career."
461,2695577,5.0,3.0,"Prof &quot;AZ &quot;is phenomenal and makes the environment welcoming and supportive opening candid conversations that made learning ASL easy and fun. She is not only knowledgeable and highly skilled in ASL, she is good at teaching it and makes students feel comfortable . During this online transition, she left a positive imprint on me and the entire class,"
462,2687390,5.0,4.0,Amazing lecturer! Honestly one of the most engaging Ive had at UVA!
463,2687390,4.0,4.0,"Keara is a fantastic lecturer!! She does a great job of making them engaging and actually interesting. Shes also a fair grader and as long you do the readings, you should be fine."
464,2687390,2.0,4.0,"Such an unnecessarily tough grader. If your social beliefs don't 100% align with hers, don't expect a good grade on anything. Doesn't make her expectations completely clear, and grades as if you're in a grad school level course. Don't take her class unless you're able to completely dedicate your time to it."
465,1909153,4.5,1.0,Great lawyer! Engaging and fun.
466,1868222,5.0,2.0,"Barlow is incredibly kind and understanding, and also asked really interesting questions during class discussions. She specializes in baroque Spanish lit and gender studies, and readings and discussions are both related to these. Class was not too difficult, but a steady stream of work-- daily readings and comments as well as 3-4 longer papers."
467,909776,4.5,3.0,"Melissa was great!She was always helpful and explained all of the concepts very clearly and consistently. Her grading can be a bit ridiculous, but she was mostly fair. All in all a great instructor!"
468,909776,5.0,2.0,"Melissa is by far the best TA I've ever had, and I've had really great TAs!  She was able to explain the tough theories so clearly, and she'd bend over backwards to help us.  She's nice gradewise, but very tough in that she really makes you engage the material and ask questions (not answer them!).  This class wouldn't have been so great without her"
469,909776,5.0,2.0,woooooooo melisssa
470,1278423,3.5,4.0,"Everything on his exams are on the study guide, but he is basically asking you to memorize each chapter in its entirety and remember roughly 200 terms on his second and third exams and to be able to write out their definitions since his exams are all free response. Difficult class and not worth it if it's not your major. "
471,1278423,3.5,1.0,"He's SOOOO boring, but his tests are so easy. Basically just know key terms, and follow his study guides. You may have to study a decent amount to make sure you know the material, but tests are very very easy."
472,1278423,4.5,1.0,Pretty easy and fair teacher.  Lectures can be boring because he just describes the textbook pictures.  Not too bad overall though.
473,1278423,3.5,2.0,"Lectures are boring, and he does ruin the material, but you can skip the class as long as you keep up with the reading.  He is very helpful if you have any questions."
474,1278423,2.0,2.0,Made the class SO BORING.  Hands tests back about 3 weeks later.  Unclear and drones.  Stay away from this class.
475,2613723,1.0,2.0,"Awful prof. She doesn't have good best communication skills and English seems to be her second language. She rambled for the entirety of class and covered about half of the syllabus material over the semester. I didn't learn any calc 3. Horrible prof, would not recommend"
476,295387,5.0,1.0,"Professor Taylor is an amazing teacher, he has had a very experienced work history in mathematics and understands math very well. His teaching style is very laid back, he will accept the classwork assignments if you forget to turn them in. He is also very helpful and will give you one on one help if you ask him. He even let me redo a test question."
477,295387,4.5,3.0,i would take every class with dave if i could!  he rocks!
478,295387,1.0,4.0,GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!
479,295387,5.0,2.0,He is a very good TA. Very clear and helpful. He makes sure no one gets left behind. More than willing to answer questions. Quizes were pretty easy and al but one were take-home. I felt very well prepared for exams. I highly recommend taking Dave's class!
480,295387,5.0,1.0,"He's clear and will always help you. Go to his office hours, he will explain to you exactly how to do the problem if you can't get it. He will answer questions via email the night before webwork is due. He really cares about the class and wants everyone to do well."
481,295387,2.0,2.0,"Yes he grades easy, but he can't teach.  Very annoying personality and makes a lot of mistakes."
482,295387,5.0,1.0,Dave is a really good professor.  He's so good that I dont even use my textbook for any references.  If you copy all his notes you should be set.  He gives plenty of examples that will clarify questions.  When you email him questions he responds promptly and is easy to understand.Now calc is easy!
483,295387,5.0,1.0,"Dave is the man, he explians everything very well and does his best to make sure evryone gets it, works with you with schedule issues and home work prob and responds to e-mails like a champ"
484,295387,1.0,3.0,Horrible!
485,295387,4.5,1.0,Lots of chances for extra credit.  Tests are fair and in class quizzes are mostly easy unless you had exceptional trouble with a section.  Nice guy who is always there to help.
486,295387,5.0,1.0,Does everything he can to help students perform well in his class.  Fair grader too.  Take his classes.
487,295387,5.0,1.0,"First of all, Math 121 is an easy A.  Dave is probably one of the easiest graders and he explains everything very well.  Sometimes he can be dorky.  I recommend taking any class with Dave."
488,1794527,5.0,4.0,"This was one of the most entertaining, informative classes that I've taken. Prof Jesse leads interesting discussions about the material and really makes you think about your points, allowing you to draw connections that you might not have otherwise been able to. As long as you work hard and try to improve, you'll succeed in his course."
489,1794527,5.0,4.0,"really wonderful class. every book on the syllabus was great, and while there was a good amount of reading, it was always reasonable and enjoyable. his feedback on papers was also very helpful, and in class discussions were always productive. i got a lot out of some books i would have otherwise thought were average. one of my favorite classes."
490,1794527,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bordwin is everything you could want in a teacher. He draws out the best from those around him by expecting a lot and being very clear and helpful in getting you there. There's plenty of reading for this course, but the work level isn't unrealistic. Im a much better writer and reader after taking a class with him."
491,1794527,5.0,4.0,"Rt the previous comment. Best professor I've had at UVA -- took two classes with him and enjoyed both thoroughly. He's super enthusiastic and fun, also really smart. His classes are demanding, but rewarding. Teaches well and at a high level."
492,1794527,5.0,3.0,Best professor I've had at UVA. This class made me want to be an English major.
493,1794527,5.0,3.0,"I took Jesses course on Writing About Musicals and discovered a newfound respect for the subject in all its interpretations. He made it very clear in the beginning what his expectations were and how to succeed in his class. Dont worry about grades. So long as you put in the effort in participating and keeping up with readings, youll get an A."
494,1794527,5.0,4.0,"I learned so much about art and writing from his class. I came out knowing so much more than when I started, but I feel like I really internalized the material instead of just being told. I'm definitely a much better writer than before because he had high expectations, and I wanted to rise to the challenge and really meet those expectations."
495,1794527,5.0,4.0,"Intellectually stimulating, very fun professor, really teaches you something useful for the rest of your life. Doesn't always make himself available, if not contacted persistently. He might sometimes forget that we're not English majors, and can be very demanding in grading arguments. Only take his class if you're open to LEARN, and be rewarded."
496,1794527,5.0,3.0,"Jesse is an awesome professor, though sometimes tough on grading. I just took his ENWR- Writing about musicals- and was fascinated on his ability to analyze literature and bestow wisdom onto his pupils. 10/10 would take again, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like any musicals other than High school musical."
497,1794527,2.0,3.0,"From day one, Professor Bordwin pulled a bait and switch. His class was listed as an introductory course, but he changed the topic and taught the class as if it was a higher level course. His lectures were more like round table discussions, and his criteria for the few grades he gave was, and is, a mystery. He is engaging, but not a good teacher."
498,1794527,2.0,4.0,"Jesse's ENWR topic - musicals - was interesting, but we did SO much reading during the first half of the semester. Jesse rarely gave actual grades back (in some cases, did not give grades back for certain assignments AT ALL) and was vague in his feedback. He graded very harshly for an intro writing class and only gave us three writing assignments."
499,1794527,5.0,2.0,Jesse is the man.
500,1794527,4.5,3.0,"Intimidatingly intelligent, exceedingly attractive, overall one of the best TAs I've ever had. Go out of your way to take his class."
501,1794527,5.0,3.0,One of the most instructive and passionate T.A.'s I've ever had.
502,590307,1.0,5.0,"He reads of lecture notes a written a over a decade ago, exams are based mostly on memorization, material is not taught, just expected that you know from prior knowledge"
503,590307,1.0,5.0,No Comments
504,590307,1.0,3.0,Brad Cox is a ****.
505,590307,2.5,2.0,"Well, he's willing to help, and he wants his students to learn the material...but he can't teach. His problem sets are invariably poorly worded. He basically flashes transparencies up, states the problem, says &quot;if you follow my steps,&quot; then gives the answer. Teaching by example, especially without showing steps, is a bad idea."
506,590307,2.5,3.0,"I know that Prof. Cox cares about whether students learn the material, but I feel that he was relatively ineffective in conveying course material in lecture."
507,590307,3.5,3.0,"Good class, topics can be rather confusing by default, but lectures well.  Knows a lot about many of the big wigs in the field.  Solid class."
508,2220516,5.0,2.0,"Kind, funny, adorable Dutch accent, tries to learn students' names in a 130 student class, engaging lectures, uses lots of videos in class to keep things interesting. Make sure  you do all the assignments listed in the syllabus- there's not that many, but easy to forget bc they're not all directly related to class. Only skimmed book b4 midterm"
509,926189,4.0,2.0,The 3 tests for this class were easy. As long as you attend class and recitation and take good notes you'll do well. She only puts powerpoint summaries online so it's important to go to lecture but not required. The group project wasn't fun but it wasn't hard. Points are given in recitation so you have to go to that. Overall an easy class.
510,926189,4.5,2.0,"She is incredibly charming and engaging. She speaks really quickly so you have to pay attention and take notes on a laptop, but being in her class is worth it. She's adorable and very fun to listen too."
511,926189,4.0,2.0,"This Intro to Archaeology class is mostly lecture-based. You will do well if you show up to lecture and take notes. She talks kind of fast so it's best to have a laptop for notes. She gave us very in-depth study guides before the midterm and before the final. The midterm has a lot to do with agriculture, so focus on that."
512,926189,4.5,3.0,"I took this class just randomly and I am now IN LOVE with archaeology and the Incas. The class is entirely lecture based, so if that is not your thing, don't take the class. I personally don't mind lectures and Arkush is very passionate and knows what she is talking about so class is rarely boring. Bring sure to bring a laptop for notes(she's fast)"
513,926189,4.0,1.0,"I really enjoyed this class.  It was easy and the reading wasn't necessary as long as you go to class.  Also, the information was interesting.  Take it!"
514,926189,3.0,1.0,"I haven't attended a lecture since the midterm over a month ago because all of the information is in the text.  Very easy class, has a group project, also."
515,926189,4.0,3.0,"Good lectures, better discussion sections. Reading is basically optional if you attend lecture. She has a great personality. I would take another class with her. Not for those who can't pay attention to a lecture."
516,926189,3.0,4.0,"The class was not at all what I expected, being an archaeology major. She presented her notes well, I rarely used the text book. However, her notes and tests don't match. The test was extemely hard and the mid term mostly reflected a few class lectures on agriculture not archaeology, the final was easier and made more sense."
517,926189,1.5,4.0,"Arkush is boring & lectures as if everyone is in elementary school. She turns around with difficult multiple choice tests and pop quizzes to account for attendance in a huge lecture class. This is not an easy class, even though she treats students as if it should be.  The work this class reguired is not reflected in my grade. NOT recommended!"
518,926189,1.0,4.0,NOT recommended
519,926189,4.0,1.0,"Arkush probably isn't the most interesting lecturere in the world but whenever I tried to talk to her about a paper or project, she was more than helpful!  The content of this class is really interesting and she presents it a clear, concise way.  Which to some is boring, but if you're interested in this topic, take this class!"
520,926189,3.0,3.0,"She read her lectures straight from her notes, spent most of the class with us doing group work, and gave pop-quizzes. Her tests weren't that bad, but you do need to know the details. Don't bother buying the textbooks - you only need them for &quot;reference.&quot;"
521,926189,1.0,4.0,"Horrible class, horrible teacher. Material was semi-interesting, but she did not present it well at all. She is a poor speaker; all the lectures were given in monotone as she recited from her notes. She gives the same answer no matter what question she's asked, and is rarely available for extra help. I would not recommend this class."
522,926189,4.0,2.0,"A good teacher, but a little nervous at times. She had us do activities in class that could be fun. The class is pretty easy and interesting."
523,393710,4.5,4.0,Great Teacher and a good class. Makes it very interesting and if you need help he has great advice and can be very helpful.
524,393710,4.0,4.0,"Good teacher, you will pass tests if you just study the slides from class."
525,393710,5.0,3.0,"How do I love Howie&#63; Let me count the ways...He's an engaging lecturer with a great sense of humor and a lot of knowledge to share. He tells you the first day that you don't need to buy the book unless you want to, holds fantastic review sessions and gives fair (but not easy) tests. I loved this class."
526,393710,1.5,4.0,"I was not happy with the way he taught- everyone else claims he was clear, but I found him to ramble on and on about graphs and skip very quickly over information that would be found important- and proved to be important- on his exams. I know I'm not the only one who felt this in the class."
527,393710,5.0,2.0,"Great class, great teacher, great atmosphere!  I loved 320.  You must study and go to class to do well (duh) but you learn so much more than other Environmental Science classes taught at UVA.  Epstein makes himself readily available and his enthusiasm helps make the class fun. Not the easiest EVSC 320 class (Smith is) but it is REALLY worth it!"
528,393710,5.0,4.0,"The class is hard, but Epstein presents the material clearly and is very available at office hours. It's a requirement for evsc majors- so don't take it just for credits. Overall, I learned a lot and I'm glad I took the class."
529,393710,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic.  Lectures are well-organized, he posts powerpoints online.  Very helpful and more than informed on his material. Plus he's a nice guy with a good sense of humor and cares about his students.  Usually two tests and a final-  YOU MUST STUDY -but they are very fair and he has review sessions.  Attendance is a must to do well. Very worth it."
530,393710,5.0,3.0,Very knowledgeable about ecology.  Lectures were very well presented and easy to understand.  Also had a good sense of humor which made the class entertaining. Also helpful and easy to get a hold of.
531,393710,5.0,3.0,"Really listens to the students, and makes material very clear.  Very good tests."
532,1958390,5.0,3.0,"I had Tony for this ethics class and he made the class really fun, and helped us understand the material even when lectures didn't. I'm taking him again for sure!"
533,1958390,4.5,3.0,"Tony get's lost with digressions and stories sometimes, but he gave me and my roommate as much attention as we needed almost at any time. He was a great TA to have my first semester of college."
534,1221115,3.0,5.0,"If youre taking PHYS 1050, please do not.  Professor Neu is very nice in person and has cool lectures, but the tests are actually impossible and he warns you at the beginning that only about 20-30% of people get an A.  The first midterm average was a C-, and it was open note if that tells you anything. Do not recommend at all. Youve been warned."
535,1221115,3.0,3.0,"While I think Professor Neu is hilarious and has a lot of energy, he can get a little lost when explaining physics concepts. He will spend a lot of time on derivations when they really don't matter that much in the overall class. He is very helpful and will do anything he can to help a student and I respect that a lot."
536,1221115,5.0,3.0,"An icon. An amazing professor and person. I had him for PHYS 1010. Super manageable course (with effort), but you still learn so much. Never was stressed. Lectures are entertaining have at least a couple demos from shooting someone on a rocket to throwing eggs on the wall. 10/10 every time. 10/10 recommend. Not even a physics fan but no regrets!"
537,1221115,5.0,3.0,Professor Neu is hands-down the best science professor I've had. He genuinely seeks to get to know his students and is always willing to discuss improvements in class and offer additional extra credit opportunities. One of the best professors at UVA!
538,1221115,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Neu is the best teacher I have ever had, he is super funny, very inspirational and gives great extra credit opportunities. Also he always ready to help."
539,1221115,5.0,3.0,"Looking back, Fundamentals of Scientific Computing is one of the most important courses for a physics undergraduate. Learning to code for the first time is hard, as is learning Linux and how to interact with the OS using a terminal - but Neu does a great job.  I do wish we had done some scripting."
540,1221115,5.0,3.0,"I HATE physics. It is incredibly difficult for me. Neu put extra time aside to help me, and his lectures were clear and engaging. I got my first and only A in physics from him. He uses clickers and homework to help boost your grade (significantly), so it really is possible to succeed. Go to his office hours!"
541,1221115,5.0,4.0,"Despite my never ending struggle with physics, Professor Neu's wit made me look forward to class everyday.  He made the material engaging and gave me a better understanding of physics than any other could. If you put effort into homework and go to tutorials you will get a 100% on homework which will help your grade if physics isnt your strong suit."
542,1221115,4.5,5.0,"I can tell he is an expert in this area, but the course contains so much and he moves so fast that it is very challenging for me to catch up. He is good at teaching, though, very engaging and funny, and if not I was so gonna fall asleep every class."
543,1221115,5.0,2.0,"Professor Neu is brilliant. He is hilarious, engaging, and loves to do demonstrations. All of his demos are interesting and really helpful in understanding course material. Tests are not too hard and you are allowed a ""cheat sheet,"" but you really need to pay attention in lecture and prepare well for them."
544,1221115,5.0,1.0,"Overall awesome professor, one of the best I've had at UVA. Very funny and clear during lectures, if you get a chance to take him for a physics course definetely recommend him!"
545,1221115,4.5,2.0,"Fun Lectures, teaches the material is an interesting and engaging way."
546,1221115,4.5,3.0,"Young, excited, knowledgeable guy. He was nervous at first, but got the hang of the class, using engaging demos to draw in the class. Favorite part of the year&#63; Using aquanet, a lighter, and a 2-liter soda bottle to make a rocket. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT use much aquanet if you try this at home!"
547,1835520,3.5,2.0,"Course ideas are taught well, but structure of course and continuity of ideas are on the lower side of average. Still one of the more enjoyable classes I've taken and I'm not a language buff by any means. Would recommend"
548,1835520,5.0,2.0,best professor ever
549,1999368,4.0,3.0,took PLIR 4500 Coercion and crises sum. 2014 and he was pretty awesome. I didn't think I would like the subject of the class but he made it interesting. Also he is a TA and it was his first time teaching and he is better than some the professors that I've taken for politics classes. There aren't any tests but there are some papers.
550,2695694,5.0,2.0,She is a very kind and understanding woman. She cares about her students and is willing to help whenever it is needed. Assignments were easy and she is not a tough grader. 
551,2695694,5.0,2.0,"Professor Smith was really nice, and very engaging, which was super important during COVID."
552,1024534,5.0,3.0,"Come to class, do the work, prepare for the quizzes.  Yes there's a quiz basically every class but they are useful to get ready for the midterm and final. If you need help, ask, Professor Smith is approachable. He's a great guy and you can tell he cares about his students, he even brought candy the last lecture. Plus he's cute ;)"
553,1024534,4.5,3.0,Professor Smith is genuinely one of the nicest people on this earth. He's really passionate about what he teaches and his door is always open if you need help. He actually cares about his students and listens to feedback. I worked with him doing research and he sent me an email before the first test for this class wishing me good luck. 
554,1024534,5.0,1.0,"Don't know what the other poster is talking about. Jim Smith is a nice guy, very straightforward, and willing to help students. Is he a little quirky&#63; Yes. But that's a refreshing change in E-School. Water for the World gives you some valuable context with your problem sets. His jokes do bomb sometimes, but that happens to the best of us."
555,1024534,2.5,3.0,"a very unreasonable prof, the class is easy but he is very weird, tries to be funny but fails horrible, just a very goofy person"
556,385561,5.0,3.0,Prof. Lomasky is really a gem and is so hilarious. Even in zoom he was so sweet &amp; tried engaging with students despite a sea of black boxes of most people's webcams off. Even just one person unmuting their mic seemed to make his day. He is very sarcastic but only in good humor and loved answering questions. I would retake this class just to see him
557,385561,3.0,3.0,"In my huge lecture class, I don't think he knew anyone's name, but he remembered many of us based on traits like major or things we said in class, which was kind of nice. If you give him a reason to tease you, he will remember all semester. I found his voice sometimes difficult to understand. Beware of lots of reading and pop quizzes."
558,385561,1.0,4.0,"Honestly I would never recommend taking Intro to Philosophy with Lomasky. Personally, it was a terrible experience. He is an incredibly mundane lecturer and totally lacks enthusiasm. It became exhausting to stay awake in class. Even if you read the assigned readings, you still might not pass the reading quizzes. Also, the TA lead discussions suck"
559,385561,2.0,4.0,"While Lomasky is an interesting looking guy and has lots of tangents, the class itself is not that great. Hard to get an A and lectures do not help much."
560,385561,2.0,3.0,Moral and Political philosophy could be interesting and accessible if it weren't taught be Professor Lomasky
561,385561,5.0,2.0,"Oh man, Lomasky is unlike any professor you will EVER take. He is a hilarious combination of incredible intellectual quickness and old-man craziness. The quality of the lectures did vary from class to class, but I can say that I was never, ever, bored in a lecture. Don't give hm a reason to make fun of you, because he will- he smells weakness."
562,385561,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, forces people to understand the historical and academic context of ideas and forces people to look beyond just what is in the text.  I have never had a better philosophy professor and I have had quite a few."
563,385561,2.5,2.0,"Awesome class. People who call this a waste of time must really be brain dead. If you like political philosophy, and wondering what our society should be like, its an awesome class. And Lomasky is the man. Extremely sarcastic. You have better luck questioning before you believe what he says, but if you give him some sass back, he loves you for it."
564,385561,3.5,2.0,Waste of time.
565,385561,2.0,3.0,"As others have said, Lomasky is very entertaining but really doesn't teach anything. The readings are good, but I have to disagree very strongly that he &quot;knows everything there is to know about philosophy.&quot; I read some of the same readings in 153 with brewer, and we went much deeper into the content. That was a 100 level class for non-phil majors."
566,385561,2.5,2.0,"If you actually enjoy deep, thoughtful discussion about philosophy, then this isn't the professor for you."
567,385561,5.0,4.0,he rules
568,385561,2.5,3.0,"Funny and amusing professor-- but overall not a very focused class... discussion often times diverges far from the topic and connections between the reading and discussion aren't always apparent.  Paper comments were not helpful at all and takes forever handing them back.  Not a terrible class, but not the best PHIL either."
569,385561,4.0,3.0,Great lecturer. Very funny. Makes class enjoyable to be in.
570,385561,3.5,3.0,"this guy is a riot. if getting taught by a dude who looks like he's a roadie for zz top interests you, take loren's class, whichever one. pretty much knows everything there is to know about philosophy, and makes it funny (intentionally or unintentionally)."
571,385561,3.5,3.0,"A brilliant, funny, and unusual man. He is a great teacher and very open to new ideas. However, keep up with assigned readings- he doesn't tolerate apathetic students. Pretend as though you love UConn basketball!"
572,385561,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Looks like an ancient Greek philosopher, and knows just as much. Very smart, very funny, take him in whatever he teaches."
573,385561,5.0,2.0,"Awesome teacher, very interesting.  Looks like Santa Clause, talks like he's underwater."
574,385568,5.0,5.0,"O'Brien is an amazing professor with a LOT of knowledge. He's funny, interesting and entertaining.  I learned a lot in this class although it was very difficult.  My TA was awesome too! See if Charles Aaron Flynn is available"
575,385568,2.5,5.0,"O'Brien is a very funny professor who is also very smart. I felt like I learned a lot in this class. It's important to have a good TA for this class, because that affects your grade a good deal. I feel like his class is a good preparation for those who want to enter law school. The final is a ****, the moot court being a lot of fun."
576,385568,2.0,3.0,He completely ruined the class for me and has been by far the worst professor I have ever had. The class material is interesting and I would strongly suggest taking it with a professor other than O'Brien.
577,385568,2.5,3.0,"By far the most pompous, unctuous, name dropping professor whose class I have had the misfortune to take. Lecture material would be interesting if he didnt pepper it with weak and insipd jokes in an attempt to connect with his audience. His was the most painful class I have ever had to sit through."
578,385568,4.5,3.0,"Great Person, very humorous, keeps class interesting, makes the supreme court easier to understand. Midterm, Paper, and Final, and of the three the midterm is the hardest."
579,385568,4.5,3.0,"O'Brien is a very funny man.  Lectures are interesting.  He makes the notes available on toolkit which is nice.  There are a LOT of cases, however, so that part is hard.  The moot court is really fun.  TAs would probably make a big difference: make sure you have a good one.  Join a study group and brief the cases.  You should be fine.  Fun class."
580,385568,5.0,4.0,"Professor O'Brien is highly knowledgable and a gifted lecturer.  He is also funny.  The class covers controversial issues, and O'Brien gets this positively gleeful look in his eyes when he talks about**** and drugs.  He gets the same look when he talks about the impossible-to-finish midterm and the MC questions only one student has got 100% right."
581,385568,5.0,2.0,Quite a bit of reading but still a great class.
582,385568,3.0,3.0,No Comments
583,385568,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting and funny guy, passionate and enthusiastic about his material. He talks about the ongoing current events of the Court in class. Cases can be convoluted to read but he breaks them down well. Has a liberal bias but makes light of it and doesn't interfere much with his teaching."
584,385568,4.5,2.0,"Good class, knows what he's talking about. Has a sense of humor and often cracks up at his own jokes :P. Good class if you're interested in learning more about the political system and different cases. You MUST read."
585,385568,5.0,2.0,"This is a really fun course for future lawyers. It totally got me hooked on legal issues. O'Brien is the funniest lecturer there is, he always had the class laughing, and he's really smart."
586,385568,3.5,4.0,"So smart.  Knows it all.  It's like a law school class (I'm in Law School now), so be prepared to read.  BRIEF THE CASES!  Don't treat it like other classes, it's not.  Test's are not easy.  Great TA's.  Moot Court is awesome.  It really mimics law school in a lot of ways.  He is an imminent scholar"
587,385568,1.0,2.0,No Comments
588,385568,5.0,3.0,"Very interesting, passionate about law.  Knows a lot of Supreme Court justices."
589,74277,2.5,3.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS ONLINE. While the course in general isn't that bad, if you take it online, you'll have to read the entire textbook, watch all the lectures and still not have much of an idea of what's going on. He's a good guy and the demos are cool, but a lot of the times he just reads off the slides and only asks conceptual questions in class."
590,74277,2.0,4.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. The homework is very easy but it does not prepare you for his tests. He does provide chapter questions with answers but once again they are useless because they do not prepare you for the tests. I am learning nothing in this class. Huge mistake taking it. The text book is one of the worse modern physics textbooks I have used
591,74277,1.5,4.0,This guy is very unhelpful and teaches his class in a disorganized fashion. Gave us about 5 multiple choice questions per 100 pages of reading so you really have to get lucky to get them right. I wouldn't recommend him.
592,74277,4.5,2.0,"He is a good teacher, and of the three first year physics teachers he is head and shoulders above the others."
593,74277,1.5,4.0,"Absolutely awful.  First year engineers will never want to see physics again after a semester with this guy.  Seems to have good intentions, but is totally unclear in class and flies through powerpoints at a zillion miles an hour.  He is, however, helpful if you go to office hours, but lecture will just give you a headache..."
594,74277,2.0,5.0,"Very unclear in lectures. Flies through the material, as if you already knew it. Demos are cool, but the teaching is just almost nonexistent. You will struggle in this class 142 unless you previously had a good Physics teacher or get tutoring."
595,74277,4.0,2.0,"This class isn't too hard. You just have to do the pre-lab and a post lab quiz. There isn't a final, you don't have to write lab reports and the questions are usually not that bad. The class is competitive though with the average normally around a B+."
596,74277,4.5,3.0,"He was just in charge of organizing the class, TA's were the actual teachers, but he wrote the lab manual which was very clear."
597,74277,3.0,2.0,"Great demos, lectures are decent, tests aren't bad if you're confident w/ math. Not a good source of help outside the class though, having a friend to study with is key."
598,74277,2.5,3.0,"He's pretty good at teaching the concepts and has excellent demos, but the tests are hard unless you do tons of practice questions in class.  I asked him for help once during office hours +, because I was confused on a couple problems, he became frustrated + told me I should have gone to a community college.  Good lecturer, but a jerk nonetheless."
599,74277,3.0,4.0,"Not the best lecturer, but gives excellent demos. It's obvious that his passion is physics, but he struggles at teaching the concepts and principles in a clear light. The class itself is probably harder than it should be, but still interesting."
600,74277,3.0,1.0,"True, not great at explaining everything, but he does get a kick out of physics and I found the class entertaining and EASY."
601,74277,4.0,2.0,"Teaches straight from the book, leaves lectures online, posts exams online, gives you cheat sheets for exams.  Overall, a nice guy and an easy class."
602,74277,2.0,3.0,"He is a great guy, but he is horrible at explaing things.  The problem sessions are more helpful than his class and the only reason to go to class is to take the reading and conceptual quizzes cause the lecture notes are online.  Overall, the class is a bore."
603,74277,4.0,3.0,"Not the most helpful guy in the world; expects everyone to be as smart as he is.  However, a nice guy in general and very knowledgable about his field.  Can even, on occasion, be extremely funny.  Has hot daughters and is married to an astronaut, so he's got to be somewhat cool."
604,74277,2.5,4.0,"Excellent demos, but explaining leaves a little to be desired. Powerpoint presentations not all that helpful, but conceptual quizes are usually useful."
605,74277,3.5,3.0,"good demos, ok teacher, nice guy"

607,74277,1.0,4.0,"confusing, funny demos, bad at explaining"
608,74277,1.0,2.0,"Extremely unclear.  Loves using demos, but stinks big at lecturing."
609,74277,1.5,3.0,No Comments
610,74277,1.0,2.0,"NOT CLEAR, doesn't know what he's doing, and not helpful"
611,893480,1.0,3.0,Seems like he's just trying to get through the class
612,893480,3.5,2.0,"He is one of the most helpful and approachable teachers I have had at UVA.  His lectures are generally easy to follow, but can be a bit confusing at times."
613,893480,4.0,3.0,He's very helpful when you go to his office hours and he tries his best to help you understand as much as he can. You just have to let him know when you don't understand something or when you need help he's not going to know if you need help if you don't ask for it.
614,893480,1.0,4.0,"This class is the biggest waste of time ever.  The book is badly written, and Day is a terrible lecturer.  I'm sorry, but it is not possible to teach physics using poorly designed Powerpoint slides...  He assumes that his twisted explinations are 100% understood and moves on talking a mile a minute before anyone can raise there hand to say &quot;Huh!&#63;&quot;"
615,541232,4.5,4.0,"Mr. Kelly is one of the best teachers I've had at this school.  I HATE writing but I enjoyed his class.  He is a very sweet man; he let my brother (who goes to a different school), who wants into journalism audit the class.  I learned so much in this class."
616,541232,4.5,3.0,"He's a fantastic teacher. He is very critical, but you learn from his critiques. I feel like my writing definately improved because of this class. He's very very nice and he's leniant with turning in late papers. It's a great way to fill your second writing requirement because all you do is turn in about a page of writing a week."
617,541232,4.5,4.0,He grades very hard and expects you to know things about news writing grammar and style even though he doesnt teach them. He is a nice guy though and very lenient w/ late/missed assignments. I would def recommend this as your 2nd writing req unless you love writing lengthy history analyses.
618,541232,1.0,5.0,"HE makes you hate LIFE..he is critical..and gives everyone a hard time.  He is so picky, and grades upon his personal preference...AVOID..but you will have to work hard to get a B."
619,541232,1.5,1.0,"The class is pretty simple, but extremely boring.  It sucks sitting through such a boring class for 2 hours once a week, but the out of class work isn't bad at all.  It's just about 7 two page papers, and one final that is a little longer."
620,541232,2.5,1.0,"I dont know how he is able to take such an interesting topic and make it SO incredibly boring. The class is incredibly easy, you just have to write your crappy paper every week and youll do fine if you dont go insane litening to his boring talks"
621,541232,2.0,1.0,"Prof. kelly is SO old and boring. This class was a terrible waste of my time. BUT it is an easy A. You have to write little two page papers about every other week, but they're short and graded easy. A gut seminar. No exam, just longer paper."
622,541232,4.0,1.0,"This class was really fun. Not a whole lot of work, just write short papers for each class. Prof. Kelley is obviously an expert and has written tons of books on the West. Just make sure to edit your papers and get your facts straight and this class is a breeze."
623,541232,1.0,1.0,This class is simply awful... and I hear it's not that way when taken with other professors.  Kelly has absolutely no concern for students in the class.  You'll spend time learning how to type a sentence on the computer. The course is both an embarassment and a let down for UVA's english dept.
624,221750,3.0,5.0,RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!!!!! THE HARDEST CLASS I EVER TOOK IN MY LIFE....I DON&quot;T USUALLY DO PROFESSOR COMMENTS BUT I'M TRYING TO SAVE SOMEBODY A BAD GRADE......RUN AND DON'T EVEN LOOK BACK YOUR NOT MISSING ANYTHING
625,221750,1.0,3.0,"Class was mandatory, but we were graded on a extremely literal summary of articles. Translation, THERE WAS NO NEED TO GO TO CLASS!!!If you put in anything outside of the article for the paper, you would be graded low."
626,221750,4.0,3.0,"His accent is kinda funny but completely understandable. One of the most passionate professors Ive had, also very eager to clarify anything"
627,221750,4.5,4.0,Prof. Sihlé is an amazing anthropologist with a lot field experience with Tibet.He is open and preceptive to all his students.  Also very funny and extremely helpful when you talk to him in his office hours.  I don't know why people don't like him.  I'm looking forward to taking another class with him.
628,221750,2.0,5.0,VERY DIFFICULT CLASS. His lectures are difficult to follow. Do NOT take unless you have an anthropology. Laptops in class are helpful. Papers are hard to write. Midterm is fairly easy though.
629,221750,4.0,5.0,"Even high achievers will find Dr. Sihle's class difficult. The readings are lengthy, tedious and often incomprehensible given Sihle's lack of introduction to basic Anthropological concepts. The Grad students seemed to be the most suited to the class. Sihle dives in too fast and too deep for undergrads that have no experience with Anthropology."
630,221750,1.5,2.0,"He manages to make a very interesting subject very boring.  There's alot of reading, but you don't really have to go to class.  he makes completely senseless diagrams (but I'm starting to think that that's an anthropologist thing).  BUT if your a good ****ter, you'll do fine in the class."
631,221750,1.0,4.0,ughhhh.
632,221750,1.0,3.0,Whoever gave a high score probably know how to kiss up and did so successfully.  His homework is expected to be largely hagiographies of the authors he supports (if you expect an &quot;A&quot; that is).  Don't question him; he gets very defensive.   Very nervous little fellow.  If he knew how to relax and learn from his students it would help him a lot.
633,221750,4.0,4.0,"One of the few teachers with true sincere expecations of students.  This may seem difficult on entry level students, but its worth it if you are serious about the subject.  He expects students to actually think for themselves, another very difficult thing to the average undergrad today.  The experience is worth it, and a great prep for grad school."
634,221750,2.0,4.0,"He had unrealistic expectations for a 200 level course. His lectures were boring, and all the readings were from about 3 authors. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES.  And I pity anyone who had him for 301... ouch."
635,221750,1.0,5.0,"HE SUCKS IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY, DONT TAKE HIM EVER!"
636,221750,4.0,3.0,"I don't know what these people are talking about. Don't let them scare you... he has a cute but clearly understandable accent, and is very leaneant in his deadlines for HW (at least he has been this semester.) He's an all round nice guy."
637,221750,1.0,5.0,Most of his readings were uninteresting and his lectures were unengaging.  He had extremely high expectations for an entry level anthropology class.  Don't expect to be anything but confused if you take a class with him.
638,221750,1.5,5.0,"Very boring, very confusing with very unrealistic expectations.  Loves to go on tangents about random, self-important anthropologists.  A nice enough guy, but not a great teacher."
639,221750,1.0,4.0,"Dull as hell (awful subject, made no attempt to make it interesting or engaging at all), and unclear about the material and what he wanted from us.  I'll chalk up part of it to his inexperience & cultural differences.  W/o Carrie, all would have been lost"
640,221750,1.0,4.0,"class is confusing. Ambiguous, gets stuck on minor details."
641,221750,1.5,3.0,"new professor in '03. boring, poor timing, caught up in mostly useless details. French with a British accent so listening to lecture takes a bit of effort.  i.e. categories is coat-egg-ri-tees.  his TA, carrie heitman was a blessing."
642,1499712,4.5,4.0,"Anuj was tough in the beginning, the class is not simple but if you do choose to participate and engage in the class, you can learn a lot about the topic (war and terror) but also learn how to shape/re-shape your own ideas- something quite rare in a class especially ENWR 1510. "
643,1499712,1.0,5.0,I took his War on Terror class and it's not good.
644,1499712,1.0,5.0,Not good.
645,1499712,2.5,4.0,"The class was War & Terror.  It was extremely hard to get a good grade in this class.  Professor Kapoor only handed out articles which criticized America so it seemed we were only given one side of the story.  It was also tough to understand what he was asking of in his papers.  However, I feel I did improve my writing."
646,1499712,1.5,4.0,"A very hard class if you are not into history, politics, and the wars in the Middle East.  A lot of reading and he is a very tough grader on papers."
647,1499712,2.5,5.0,"His class is really hard, especially for international student."
648,1499712,3.0,4.0,"Anuj teaches Violence/Nonviolence ENWR course, and this class proved more difficult. Learning about things like problem frames, good reasons, and style in writing was very difficult to use in writing. He explained it, but a lot of the kids still had trouble grasping it. Very interesting material, cool movies, slightly difficult. Requires effort."
649,1860161,4.0,2.0,"Very helpful and nice! If you try you will do well! He genuinely wants his students to be able to succeed and will not overwhelm you with work. You will learn a lot from him if you listen to his lectures, study his powerpoints, and read the book. I AM SO GLAD I TOOK THIS CLASS WITH HIM!!!!"
650,524873,4.0,3.0,Great class
651,524873,5.0,3.0,Very good at giving back feedback. There is quite a bit of reading and listening to do for the class. You write about 4 paragraphs a week. Great lecturer.
652,524873,5.0,3.0,"One of the most brilliant theorists I have ever known.  The content is very difficult, though the grading scheme is very affirming.  The meat of the course was focused on the Mozart piano sonatas, which was pretty cool.  No exams (thank God), just homework (70%) and a final project (30%)."
653,524873,4.5,4.0,Very enthusiastic and helpful.
654,524873,5.0,3.0,"Brilliant, interesting teacher with a unique sense of humor. I highly recommend taking any of his classes."
655,524873,4.5,3.0,"Great guy, good lecturer, very enthusiastic and funny in his own way. Take theory with him!"
656,524873,4.5,2.0,"Hilarious, very intelligent. Definitely knows what he's talking about, but be warned that some of what he says might go over some people's heads."

658,524873,4.0,2.0,Puri is a great prof and really hilarious.  An excellent new addition to the music deptartment.
659,221782,5.0,4.0,"Absolutely incredible professor. I took Professor Cushman's class on the recommendation of another professor at UVA and it turned out to be my favorite of the semester (by far). He's engaging, insightful, and brilliant. His feedback and attention to students is thoughtful and thorough. Take any class you can from himyou won't regret it."
660,221782,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors in UVA's much-famed English department - and that's saying something. Extremely well read, outgoing, funny, and brilliant. I noticed that he would be mid-sentence in seminar, but if he saw a hand of a student, would stop and call on them. Take a class with him before he retires. I bet you'll love it."
661,221782,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Cushman is hands-down the best professor I've ever had. He is incredibly knowledgeable (he has a PhD from Yale) but also humble & kind. I once took a law school class that was mostly about the environment, just because he co-taught it. Don't expect an easy A, go to as many office hours as you  can, listen to his advice. You won't regret it."
662,221782,5.0,3.0,I love prof. Cushman.
663,221782,5.0,2.0,"Professor Cushman is one of the most brilliant, insightful, and engaging professors I've ever had. He is extremely knowledgeable about the material, and presents it in fascinating, well organized lectures. I absolutely loved being in his class. He's also extremely helpful and welcoming in office hours, and is so easy to talk to!"
664,221782,5.0,4.0,"I had Cushman for World Short Story on Semester at Sea and he was absolutely amazing.  He challenges you to be better by not adhering to standardized grading devices.  By far one of those unique teachers that blends knowledge with personality. Lots of knowledge, and great personality."
665,221782,2.0,1.0,"What a pompous, overyly prescious egomaniac! Couldn't stand him, found his lectures uninspiring, and his knowledge and enthusiasm the material very limited. Any energy or effort he exerted was to make us think he was cool or clever, of which he is neither. Avoid, unless you want your love for criticism stabbed in the heart."
666,221782,5.0,3.0,Professor Cushman may be the greatest professor I've ever had. He really turns a small class into a community (I was lucky enough to have him as a section leader) and I learned a LOT in his class. Definitely get to know him in a smaller class. He's really a fantastic guy.
667,221782,4.0,4.0,I disagree with people's ratings of Cushman. I thought he did an excellent work explaining the prose and poetry we read for class. He taught the class with Levenson and was every bit as charming as he was (in his own way....they were quite the duo actually). It was apparent that he had a lot of passion for the material and made class exciting!
668,221782,4.5,3.0,"I was lucky enough to have Cushman as my wonderful discussion leader! He was enlightening, funny, and completely personable. He is willing to help all students and genuinely cares about our lives outside the class (many discussions centered around our well-being overall and what he could do to help us). I highly recommend taking a class with him!"
669,221782,5.0,3.0,"i disagree WHOLEHEARTEDLY! Cushman is amazing, my favorite professor at UVA. He is engaging as a section leader, really wants to hear everyone's voice, allows us to talk in colloquial language, using pop culture references to all texts we study. Most comfortable and engaging discussion i've EVER had!! He's so cool and funny, too. LOVE HIM."
670,221782,2.0,3.0,boring lecturer. huge ego.
671,221782,3.0,3.0,"boring, arrogant, and a lackluster poet."
672,221782,5.0,3.0,Superb!
673,221782,1.0,4.0,"A rotten, boring poet.  He should stick to criticism."
674,221782,4.5,3.0,No Comments
675,221782,5.0,2.0,awesome  (and do the summer London program as well; you won't regret it!!!!)
676,221782,5.0,2.0,Great professor!!!!
677,221782,3.0,2.0,not very interesting professor. kind of bland. I think he's more interested in his own writing and in his family.
678,270941,5.0,3.0,"Kershaw is a pretty engaging lecturer, and he seems to be a reasonable guy, though I didn't have any personal interactions with him. However, as is usual, the TA grades everything, and he was pretty terrible, which soured my experience with the course. I'd recommend Kershaw if you're genuinely interested in the subject he's teaching."
679,270941,2.0,4.0,"4 essays and discussion participation. Prompts were vague, uninteresting, and consequently a terrible chore to right. My SIS grade is in, yet prof didn't even open a gradebook option on Collab. Very unclear grading criteria. Between boring prompts and unclear expectations, this was the most annoying course I've taken to date. Disappointed."
680,270941,4.0,3.0,Professor Kershaw is really passionate about what he's teaching and that makes the course exciting. I found his Birth of Europe class interesting so that helped and I also had a great TA who was basically just a carbon copy of this guy with worse hair.
681,270941,5.0,2.0,"Great lecturer, but I'm not sure how much fun it is for people who aren't really interest in the time period.  That being said the grading is pretty lenient and both Kershaw and Anderw Sorber (the TA) are great guys who really care."
682,270941,1.5,5.0,"Hated this class. Birth of Europe was interesting, but the papers and exams were impossible unless you already have a general knowledge of european history in the 1st - 10th century. It says no pre-req, but honestly, without knowing anything before this class is pure hell. Readings were insanely long and you Had to read them or fail"
683,270941,2.5,5.0,"This class is ridiculously difficult for the course level. Kershaw is entertaining, but his lectures are all over the place. There is way too much reading. In general, Kershaw's expectations are just ridiculous. This is one of the hardest and least enjoyable classes I've ever taken. Which is a shame, because I really wanted to like it."
684,270941,4.5,3.0,"The class is great and he's obviously passionate, but my TA was a very harsh grader and it was a lot of work to figure out what he was looking for in my essays and on tests."
685,270941,5.0,2.0,"BEST. CLASS. EVER!!! I loved him. I absolutely loved the class!! There are a lot of readings though, so you need to enter the class with an interest in history. Once you got that, Kershaw will fascinate you and make you want to attend lectures because of his enthusiasm. Grading is done by TAs though and the course involves 4 mandatory essays."
686,270941,4.0,2.0,"Fun, relatively easy class. Grading is done by TAs; he doesn't really do any of it. Lectures are entertaining, he's one of the people that is passionate about what he's teaching and it shows. He keeps it interesting and makes jokes to keep your attention."
687,270941,5.0,3.0,"I'm long gone from UVA, but this guy sticks in my mind to this day as a fantastic lecturer and professor. If you go to his office hours, he'll talk about anything with you. If somehow a passion of yours comes up, he'll want to know about it, even if it's unrelated. Really awesome guy, wish more people in academia were like him."
688,270941,5.0,1.0,Prof Kershaw is exciting.  He explains the material in a way that no one could find boring.  he makes jokes all the time. unfortunately he plays a small role in the grading of the course so your experience in this class will probably depend on the TA you get.
689,270941,2.0,4.0,"Kershaw is really excited about the subject. BUT, his lectures are a bit disorganized. He hops around from subject to subject and because he has an accent and speaks sooo fast, it's hard to hear what he's saying and there is definitely not enough time to type or write it all down. Also, there is a TON of reading for this course!"
690,270941,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Kershaw radiates a love for history, and infects us all with it. He looks like a Spartan, has an amazing accent, and is tons of fun. Very interesting class."
691,270941,4.0,4.0,"He's an energetic lecturer who kept class interesting. Lots of reading. Essay topics are only vaguely related to lectures, tho - he gives a few extra hundred pages of &quot;suggested&quot; reading for each essay topic that you basically need to do to get a decent grade. TAs split up the grading, so you had no idea who was going to grade your paper or exam."
692,270941,4.5,2.0,"Kershaw is a fantastic lecturer, but make sure to go to discussion and have a good TA as well, because they grade everything."
693,270941,5.0,5.0,kershaw is probably my personal hero. end of story.
694,270941,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors in the department and at UVa in general. Amazing.
695,270941,5.0,1.0,Kershaw&gt;You
696,270941,4.5,3.0,"Awesome class, engaging lecturer. This really is one of the best history classes I've had. I'm not even interested in Medieval history a whole lot and I still enjoyed it. That being said, it is challenging. HIEU 314 is quite a bit of reading and writing. Not an easy A, but fun and fair assignments."
697,270941,5.0,2.0,Kershaw is God.
698,270941,5.0,2.0,Professor Kershaw is far and away the best professor I have had at UVA.
699,270941,4.0,1.0,"Class is extremely broad, covering Mesopotamia all the way to the Renaissance superficially. Discussion sections are mandatory but extremely useful. Test format is very fair and include term and sources identification. Papers are graded hard but are eventually fair. Go to class so you won't have to read so much but be prepared to memorize for the A"
700,270941,3.5,3.0,"Kershaw=awesome! I had to take this class and was not enthused, but he made it interesting and fun with his witty British humor."
701,270941,4.0,2.0,"FANTASTIC professor. Don't actually need to read the textbook, just pay attention in lecture and discussion and know the primary readings. Tests are ID's (posted online every week) and primary reading excerpts. It's not hard to pay attention either. Easy, fun class."
702,270941,4.5,4.0,"Kershaw is the MAN!!! He is a great lecturer.  Although the course is pretty tough (2 in class essays, 3 out of class essays and 3 exams) it was definetely worth it.  He makes the class funny and engaging, it's hard to believe I was in a class of 200.  MAKE SURE TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSION THOUGH, which is 30% of your grade."
703,270941,4.5,2.0,"Absolutely loved the class!  Kershaw is great--so much energy, all the time.  And he cracks jokes in the middle of class-but make sure your cell phone is off.  I like him so much that I made him my Major advisor.  TAKE ANGLO-SAXON! it's great!!"
704,270941,5.0,2.0,"Kershaw does a great job bringing some very old news to life.  His enthusiasm is legendary.  Go for the adrenaline drenched lectures, and see the curious world of old England open up. There is a lot of reading and writing, and participation in discussion section is mandatory, but the grading is more than fair."
705,270941,4.5,2.0,"I loved going to lecture because of his animated and engaging teaching style. He's so interested by what he teaches and he's excited about it, but not in an annoying way. He's amazing. Lectures aren't mandatory but he made me want to go to class. The work isn't too much, either, especially if you get it over with early. Loved him. Sweet accent, too"
706,270941,4.5,3.0,"I really enjoyed this course.  It was fun to go to, not difficult and interesting!  It was history on fast forward."
707,270941,5.0,4.0,NICE DUDE
708,270941,5.0,2.0,"Amazing and entertaining lecturer.  Easy and simple grading.  2 Tests, a final, and three essays.  Relatively easy and interesting class."
709,270941,4.5,4.0,Prof. Kershaw is amazing! His lectures are always interesting and full of energy. He really knows how to grab one's attention. I loved taking Western Civ. with him and it doesn't hurt that he's British...drool!
710,270941,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. Knows everything there is to know about his course and explains it very easily to his students. Highly recommended,"
711,270941,4.5,2.0,"the subject matter is really not interesting, but he keeps his lectures upbeat and attention-grabbing. the paper topics are really straightforward. the 2 exams are not hard at all if you have your notes to study from"
712,270941,5.0,3.0,fantastic teacher.  Every good thing people have mentioned is true.  Take this class.
713,270941,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors at the University.  I don't care if you hate history, he'll make you love his class.  Every student should be required to take his course."
714,270941,4.0,3.0,"Great lecturer, very excited about material.  Wonderful stories, very engaging."
715,270941,5.0,2.0,"Awesome teacher, made class entertaining and interesting"
716,270941,5.0,2.0,"Great lecturer! puts in wonderful stories and anecdotes. energetic, bounces around and has the ability to get the class interested in spam. very accesible and friendly. love his classes. great guy overall."
717,270941,4.5,3.0,Very funny and enthusiastic professor.  Exams and papers are challenging but fair.
718,270941,4.5,1.0,"Amazing lectures, easy + straightforward test format.  If you go to lectures reading is mostly unncessary, plus you can listen to his lovely British accent.  My future husband!"
719,270941,5.0,3.0,Awesome lecturer
720,270941,5.0,2.0,"Awesome lecturer, very hot. Definately had my attention throughout the semester :)"
721,270941,5.0,3.0,"He's very into this stuff, which makes for great lectures... he paces around and gets really excited!"
722,270941,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor.  Great class.  Extremely exciting...will make any science major want to major in history.

726,270941,4.5,3.0,"great lecturer, very passionate"
727,270944,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed this class. Professor's Kinney is quite harsh in terms of marking your work and her tests, especially the final, are worth a lot of your final grade. That said, you do learn a lot, and if you do the reading and the assignments you can get an A without too much stress."
728,270944,1.0,3.0,Lots of awkward silences in class. Asks very specific questions and expects you to guess what she's thinking. Terrible for discussion. Avoid! (My number rating came out wrong below: this is the right one.)
729,270944,4.0,3.0,Lots of awkward silences in class. Asks very specific questions and expects you to guess what she's thinking. Terrible for discussion. Avoid!
730,270944,4.0,3.0,"Professor Kinney is an incredibly intelligent woman and I enjoyed her class even if there were times that I felt it dragged on a little bit -- if you love English, though, you should definitely consider taking one of her classes."
731,270944,5.0,4.0,"I LOVED this class. Clare Kinney is absolutely amazing. She solidified in my mind my desire to become an English major at UVA. There are pretty hefty readings assigned before each lecture, but I thought the material was interesting so it was never painful. She posts lecture outlines on Collab so note-taking is really easy."
732,270944,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Kinney is the only prof I've ever had who doesn't just make you think critically about the material - her lectures make you FEEL it. Elocution is simply in her blood and she can give you chills. Her critiques WILL improve your work if you're actually smart enough to listen to her. If not, you're losing out on a wonderful learning experience."
733,270944,1.0,5.0,"Agree with the rhymes with rich comment. If you are taking the independent study, hope you get Levenson. She is a mean spirited and sad person. She has to put down others to prop herself up. If she doesnt like you, watch out! But its k, she'll be reading my books in a year  :) her attempts at discouragement go nowhere !"
734,270944,1.0,1.0,"If you want constructive criticism like this: ?Your paper gives the impression of a ?Monster Download? effect,? ?you go off on tangents,? ?And the 100s of footnotes are a real giveaway,? ?In the end, this is a huge jigsaw puzzle of data??take Clare Kinney. She picks her favorites and is as irrational as they come. PLAIN BAD PROF. just sayn!"
735,270944,3.5,5.0,"Class was interesting at first but soon became a chore and a little overwhelming. Good class to take, but whether or not you'll enjoy it is questionable."
736,270944,3.0,3.0,I was pretty disappointed with Kinney's lectures. She likes to read/act out the Shakespeare dialogue: really promising the first class but got old when there was absolutely nothing substantial in lecture material. She basically reads quotes and rehashes what happened in play you just read. don't recommend for those looking for engaging classes
737,270944,1.0,5.0,"She politicizes graduate classrooms and only acknowledges her super-acolytes. I saw her demean a Rhodes scholar during class. She lectures runners on running, Germans on Germany, physicists on physics. She affects expertise in everything. Acknowledges questions on nothing. Dishonest, mean, hyperpolitical."
738,270944,1.5,5.0,How to put this in polite terms&#63; It rhymes with rich.
739,270944,4.0,4.0,"Her lectures are prepared down to the word, making every sentence a gem of information. The reading happens in manageable slices so long as you do the assignments when they are due. Her tests are fair. She and others will call them nit picky, but overall they are manageable. Also, there are many bonus point opportunities."
740,270944,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Kinney was, hands down, one of the best professors I've ever had.  Yes, you will work hard, but she makes you think and inspires great work.  Take her as soon as you can."
741,270944,5.0,4.0,Kinney is the reason I am an English major! She is extremely intelligent and draws out connections that really bring the works she teaches together in a way I never would think of.  She makes herself very accessible and works with you to help you improve as a student.  I have taken four classes with her and would gladly take more! Love her!!
742,270944,1.5,5.0,"Although I thought most of the formal aspects of the class were okay--organized, not excessively heavy coursework, etc--the professor personalized more than most. Given that fact,the class was weird, and she displaced her anger against students, especially unusual students."
743,270944,1.5,5.0,I attended the lectures and did all of the reading but I did worse than I expected (hoped).
744,270944,4.0,3.0,Enjoyed the class but not easy by any means. Midterm can be tricky... meticulous notes are necessary for success.
745,270944,4.0,3.0,"Great professor! Her tests are not ridiculously hard but if you want a good grade, do read the material and attend all lectures and discussions."
746,270944,2.5,4.0,"I don't know if it was just a bad semester for her or what, but every time I interacted with Kinney, she was really rude!  Her tests are unnecessarily detail-driven and don't really promote critical thinking, which is sort of what being an English major is all about. Lectures are okay. She's funny and knows the material. But this class is a pain."
747,270944,5.0,4.0,"GREAT PROF! Organized clear lectures, funny as heck, doesn't suffer fools, but fair. Kind of hard but not impossible on tests and papers. Class is very useful for the major and with her you actually learn a ton."
748,270944,5.0,4.0,Great lecturer and manifestly all-around brilliant woman!
749,270944,5.0,1.0,"Great lecturer, funny too.  Pay attention and you will be fine.  Her accent is awesome.  Take any class that she is teaching."
750,270944,4.5,4.0,"She's a great lecturer, very passionate and knowledged. The final is a nightmare though, and Shakespeare gets old after a while."
751,270944,4.0,2.0,prof kinney is AWESOME.  i don't know what these people are complaining about - if you have a half a thought you could pass the midterm without studying.  all you have to do is pay attention in lecture (which is not hard at all).  highly recommend this class
752,270944,4.5,3.0,"Highly recommend - even if you're not an English major (like me). If you're going to take Shakespeare, take it with Kinney. She's a lot of fun, and her lectures are brilliant, well-organized, and insightful."
753,270944,4.5,3.0,"GREAT professor! She's so intelligent and witty, and her lectures are always well-organized and interesting. The midterm was fair - I studied only a little and did really well. All you have to do is do the reading and go to lecture and discussion. Anyone who says they didn't like this class probably should have put more effort into it."
754,270944,4.0,2.0,"Yes, easy and helpful, but she is the most boring & irritating professor I have EVER had. I fall asleep EVERY class. Midterm was just bad-didn't test intelligence, but only the ability to remember small details. I feel dumber for having been in this class. Shakespeare is rolling in his grave. Her accent is also horribly annoying."
755,270944,5.0,5.0,"Amazing wonderful challenging prof. Knows everything but is witty and puts it together for you. Do not try to slide by, she will zap you, but go in there and give it everything you have and have the best experience you'll ever have in a college class."
756,270944,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors I have ever had in my life and I am now in graduate school. Incredible lecturer.
757,270944,5.0,3.0,"She's amazing!  Knowledgeable, engaging, clear; she cares about her students, and you will be a better person for taking anything with her!  ... Plus, the Brits are hilarious."
758,270944,5.0,3.0,Very engaging and very funny professor.
759,270944,5.0,4.0,"Awesome professor-- she really cares about all her students and will push you to do your absolute best.  She is very willing to meet you outside of class to discuss papers or other issues you may be having.  Although her grading may seem hard, she is really just trying to get you to do your best."
760,270944,5.0,3.0,"She is so brilliant, so eloquent, so poised, and so funny.  Her readings of Shakespeare alone were enough to make the class worthwhile - she could easily be a professional stage actress.  Instead of proposing a single analysis, she usually offers several alternate interpretations, and let you decide"
761,270944,5.0,4.0,"Kinney is brilliant!  Her lectures were entertaining, well structured, easy to follow, etc.  We had TA's b/c it was so large, but she was more than willing to discuss papers and readings during office hours.  She's just a warm, good humored Brit :)"
762,270944,2.5,3.0,"Be warned...if you don't accept her theoretical stance on the material, you're asking for a poor grade.  She has no patience for alternative points of view."
763,270944,5.0,4.0,Most excellent.  Smart and courageous.  No patience for the lazies.
764,270944,5.0,3.0,"Very engaging lecturer.  Very articulate, and her British accent works well with the material."
765,270944,5.0,4.0,awesome lecturer
766,1401445,5.0,3.0,This is the second time I've taken one of Maria's classes. She's a lot fun and really cares about her students. Her lectures and discussions are great.
767,1401445,5.0,3.0,"Definitely take Maria's discussion sections and classes.  She's really nice and fun, but she knows her stuff and knows how to teach."
768,1802856,5.0,2.0,"Audrey is awesome!! I would tell anyone to take an ENLT with her. The classes are relaxed, but you learn a lot from the books she assigns. She is very fair with grading and assigning reading! Take her class!!!"
769,1802856,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Golden was a fantastic professor. She engaged the entire class every class, and actually helped us understand and take in the material. She is kind and accepting and teaches writing well. We can all say that we truly LEARNED in this class. Definitely my favorite class so far at UVA. Miss this ! Take her class on Literature of Civil Rights."
770,1802856,5.0,3.0,Audrey was such a cool professor! She was really nice and straightforward about everything. She was also very good at eliciting good discussions from us. Overall it was my favorite class.
771,926314,4.0,4.0,"one of the few professors that uses the chalkboard and his own notes, he knows his stuff, copy everything down the information will be useful on problem sets.  Put in the time and effort and you'll get a lot out of his class."
772,926314,3.5,2.0,"Survey of Smart* Technologies.  This was a cool class with an interesting format involving a lot of discussion of smart technologies and the ideas behind them, as well as an in-depth look at modern research efforts in the field.  A good class with only 2 big assignments (paper and presentation) with a few paper reviews.  Would take again."
773,926314,1.5,5.0,Terrible.  Lectures are super boring and Stankovic supplies zero energy.  Good if you want to schedule a nap in your day.  Virtually nothing from the semester's  tests/homeworks showed up on the final exam so good luck studying.
774,926314,1.5,5.0,Horrible.  Clearly doesn't want to be there (one of his grad students has confirmed this).  Could make the class interesting if he had a different attitude.
775,1835630,4.0,2.0,For a COLA class it definitely kept my interest and was something I looked forward to every Tuesday. Class discussions were reassuring as a 1st year and the class really had a community type feel to it.  He's an interesting guy but is strict on coming to class (if that's a problem for you beware). Daily journals were fun and a blessing in disguise.
776,1835630,5.0,3.0,"Really good class. Professor's a bit strange, but its a good sort of strange, and you want to go to class everyday. The class won't have you thinking much about economics, but itll have you thinking more critically about the world and your own life. Id recommend for anyone looking for a class where you'll really get to know your fellow classmates."
777,1835630,5.0,3.0,"What a professor! I highly recommend A Buddhist Approach to Development. Truly an inspiring person, worth spending time with, and definitely worth learning from. If you are interested in Buddhism and or Development, this is an alternative take on perhaps the more straight-forward Buddhism courses or Development courses offered."
778,8817,4.5,2.0,Lectures were boring at times.  The class is easy as long as you read the book.  Most test questions came directly from the book so you have to read the material closely.
779,8817,3.5,3.0,"The actual content of the course is interesting, but lectures can be boring. Atchison is a very nice guy but can go on tangents and doesn't seem too interested in the content. The online resources are very helpful if you look into them. Make sure to take the online practice tests before tests."
780,8817,4.0,2.0,The class is easy and can be interesting depending on the topic. The class is very introductory and does not go into details..
781,8817,4.5,3.0,"I was really skeptical at first, but Prof Atchison is really nice and friendly! very approachable and understanding...we had a hard time staying awake in the morning & he let us take a break/stand up, etc. if u have to take comm180, take it w/ him, not kemp! tests r based off reading & are kinda hard if u dont do the reading"
782,8817,2.5,2.0,This class was just boring and the fact that he required attendance made it miserable.
783,8817,3.0,3.0,everything is the same with the textbook but he requires attendance for a 200 people class and you need to sign...
784,8817,4.5,3.0,"I took the summer class. It was the most informative and entertaining class! He is tuned to his students' feelings. He gives us breaks if he sees we are tired. He tells witty and really hilarious stories to wake us up. The class really gives you a lot of knowledge you will need later. He is very particular about the exam responses. But,great class!"
785,8817,4.0,3.0,"Easy to die of boredom during lectures. However, they are not mandatory and the tests are extremely simple because all of the questions come straight from the book. Make sure you read closely though, because a lot of the questions are very in depth."
786,8817,2.5,1.0,"don't need to go to class, though he is terrible for asking a question on the final about the color of his damn sweater on one of the days in class... tests are all based on the book. great material though"
787,8817,4.0,2.0,"The curriculum was revised for the '07-'08 year, and I guess it is fairly easy and straightforward now. Not the most interesting lectures in the world, but there are worse classes out there. If you read and study the chapters, your grade shouldn't be too shabby."
788,8817,2.0,5.0,"Ok. in the 07-08, the class was changed drastically--new book, no mandatory discussion, no cumulative final. basically this class is pretty easy. in class all he does is tell stories that LOOSELY follow the material so i suggest going to class when you feel like BUT STUDY THE BOOK BEFORE THE TEST AND YOU'LL GET A B OR HIGHER NO DOUBT!"
789,8817,4.0,4.0,"I took the class for the COMM-school requirement and it killed my interest. The prof makes the subject very hard and even when I learned something, it was always on my own or with the help of other students. Therefore, form a study group and work together! It really helped for the final for me and they are the only reason I didn't fail."
790,8817,3.0,3.0,"He made it very clear that he did not want to be there teaching this class. Lectures are useless - just read the book, your knowledge of the textbook is the only thing thats tested. Overall one of the worst classes I've taken"
791,8817,3.5,2.0,"Everyone seems to hate him, but I really liked Atchison as a teacher. He has a dry sense of humor, his monotone made me fall asleep almost every day in class, but the boring subject matter didn't help either. I liked the accounting section, which is Atchison's specialty. Besides that, tests are purely book based and are straight memorization."
792,8817,1.5,3.0,"Literally, the most boring person I have ever met.  If you have the 8:00 class, get out of it.  ASAP.  This is a terrible class.  Just don't take it.  Please."
793,8817,2.5,4.0,"i had the 8am class through waitlist and it sucked!  try really hard to get the afternoon session, even though i don't think that will help you out of boredom in the class.  lectures were long and posted on toolkit.  lots of formula memorization.  but i guess if you're precomm you have to take it.  good luck staying awake! marketing section was fun"
794,8817,3.0,4.0,"Not toogoodoverallMarketing isOK.Fin. stmt.section isn't helpful,considering that COMM201covers everythin COMM180covers about f/s,with no assumption of prior knowledge,and esp.since virtually everyone taking COMM180 takesCOMM201.Tests are unreasonable,considering that lecture material and book probs are basic.Not horrible, but it needsimprovement."
795,8817,3.5,3.0,"Take the afternoon session if possible.  If you take the morning session, go to the afternoon one except for test day."
796,8817,2.5,3.0,"Didn't like the class.  Material could have been really interesting.  Atchison is unenthusiastic.  If you are considering the Comm school, the class is certainly survivable but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.  We mostly focused on a firm's finances, not all aspects of running a business, although there was a section of marketing."
797,8817,1.5,3.0,the purpose of the course is to deter people from applying to the comm school...terrible professor who makes things very unclear and speaks like a broken machine...most boring and USELESS class i've had...illegible handwriting...all useful stuff in class are in powerpoint slides or on toolkit. just go to lindgren's marketing classes.
798,8817,4.5,4.0,"Professor is very knowledgeable on the material and subject as a whole, however he seems uninterested.  Just as the #2 in the country McIntire School is highly competitive, so is COMM 180: The tests are very hard. Anything above 3.3 in this class is very respectable."
799,8817,1.5,2.0,boring lectures.... dull and so not interesting... not easy to get an A.... strange question for exams.... however... this is a comm school prerequisites.... you have to take it anyway... just remember to take the afternoon class.... at least you wont have to wake up for nothing
800,8817,2.0,2.0,"You have to attend classes in order to do your quiz, but other than that he lectures based on slides only. Explains fairly well when asked, but he doesn't seem that passionate about the material. Better than Petit however. This class has its material all over the place, and needs to be more organized and methodical."
801,8817,3.0,3.0,"Nice professor that knows a lot about the subject but lectures are really quiet, repetitive and boring; plus they're all online, which makes it even harder to attend/take notes in class"
802,8817,4.0,4.0,good personality. boring class. the material is hard to follow due to a bad/confusing textbook
803,8817,2.5,2.0,"Ok, but we don't do very much in class. Pretty boring"
804,8817,4.0,3.0,Got better as the year went on. had some funny random comments.  overall a good teacher for such a large class.
805,8817,4.5,3.0,"took this class after accounting. Class is unecessarily hard due to an unhelpful textbook, and efforts to generalize on financial statements. Atchison is amusing and preferred over Petit, but its hard for me to see someone doing well in this class without an accounting background."
806,8817,5.0,3.0,"he is a really friendly and caring professor. the subject is broad so you might want to keep up with the lecture materials. he is goofy and funny. overall, a fun professor!"
807,8817,3.0,3.0,"Very broad subject matter, some of it quite boring.  He kept me awake and was quite knowledgable but does go off on tangents.  Often guest lecturers.  Tests are very hard but curve is HUGE so don't worry too much.  Remember, nobody in the COMM school gets &lt; B."
808,8817,2.5,2.0,"The class is not that difficult.  However, Prof. Atchison is not a good professor. He goes off on wild tangents a forgets to cover material that will be on the test.  He doesn't care about teaching.  He even told us he didn't care about his evaluations cause he had tenure. Take the other prof."
809,8817,3.5,2.0,"You must study for the tests to do well. However, he curves the tests and definitely helps you get the best possible grade for the semester. For example, he will drop a mid-term to your advantage. Not a hard class if you keep up with reading and put in effort."
810,8817,3.5,3.0,"There is a lot of reading for homework, and the tests are very hard.  But he curves to your advantage which is nice.  Class is definitely boring though."
811,8817,4.5,4.0,"Nice/funny guy. Big curve, hard tests, lots of memorization of random equations.  But, having taken COMM 201 before this class, pre-comm people, I will say this: It only gets harder. Even having taken 201 before, this class was still hard. Go to class, do the labs, make a B."
812,8817,4.0,4.0,"Atchison has great intentions, he truly wants every student to succeed (hence curves), but there is no denying that the material is hard.  The marketing section is beyond easy, but he flies through the accounting sections.  If you're COMM school, you ahve to take the class...just make sure you study"
813,8817,4.5,3.0,"Atchison is cool.  He cares about his students a lot and cares about the class.  He knows what he's talking about and I really recommend this class.  The material is a good intro for the COMM school as a whole; it gives the whole spectrum of subjects.  Take this class, it is definitely worth it."
814,8817,5.0,3.0,"Atchison is the best! He's so nice. Don't get discouraged with low test scores, because he truly wants his students to do well and so he curves more than generously. Definitely take him, it's not bad at all."
815,8817,2.5,5.0,"Atchison is a really funny guy and has great stories, but the accounting part of the course can kill you. Looks easy at the beginning, but gets hard VERY fast. Study hard."
816,8817,1.5,5.0,This class may seem wasy in the beginning but it gets difficult very suddenly.  GO TO CLASS.
817,8817,3.0,2.0,"More about accouting than any other aspect of business, does not really give you a full perspective of what business entails.  Boring material.  Atchison is funny and entertaining.  Computer labs are relatively easy but also boring. Curves are high"
818,8817,2.5,3.0,made you memorize too many useless accounting equations.  his stories kept things interesting though
819,8817,5.0,3.0,"Atchison is an awesome guy; he always these hillarious tangents during his lectures, yet never fails to give you a good grasp on the material.  Tests are hard because there is lot of material, but he makes every effort to give you a good grade"
820,8817,4.5,3.0,"he's an awesome, funny guy...but he really underestimates the difficulty of the tests.  he tells you not to worry, and that the tests aren't hard, and students often end up feeling as though they weren't prepared.  Very interesting class though."
821,8817,3.5,4.0,"he is a really nice guy and funny, too, which is a plus. often talks off tangent, but that's what's keeps you awake. subject-wise... the material is extremely broad and the connection from one chapter to the next is not clear."
822,8817,5.0,3.0,No Comments
823,8817,3.5,4.0,so funny in class but tests are really hard.
824,8817,5.0,3.0,The tests are pretty tough but he makes the class so much fun and very interesting.  It makes it a lot easier to learn the otherwise difficult material.
825,8817,5.0,4.0,"cool cool guy, tough tests though"
826,8817,2.0,1.0,"Easy class, but be aware: he often makes standards appear lower than they are."
827,8817,3.5,2.0,Super Nice Guy....really bad subject to teach
828,8817,5.0,3.0,Atchison's the man for all things Finance
829,2081394,3.0,2.0,"Overall, I wasn't a fan of the class.  A class called ""Disaster"" sounded much more fun than it is, but that is more of my fault.  Class was 2.5 hours long with a 5 minute break in the middle, so difficult to keep attention in for the whole time.  READ THE ASSIGNED READINGS.  Doesn't matter for lecture much but the final is 100% based on readings."
830,2630261,5.0,3.0,"I took her Lectures during Covid19, so the format might be different when we resume in person. She is a really sweet person who is always excited to teach. Her class was interesting and you can tell she just loves her job, which always makes a class infinitely better. We had to write two papers in this class and read 15 pg papers for homework."
831,2630261,5.0,3.0,"She is a great professor who cares passionately about her course material and, even more-so, her students. She is very accessible to out side of class to help with papers and often it will pay off to ask for her advice. Writing philosophy papers is quite different than your run of the mill college essay."
832,213625,4.5,4.0,"QA is not the most interesting topic, but Gasman explains things well and is always willing to help."
833,213625,2.0,4.0,QA is an important topic but it is soooooooooo boring. She's a very nice woman but I had serious trouble staying awake. She is great at answering e-mails quickly.. though sometimes you're not clear.
834,213625,2.5,4.0,"Gasman is interesting...She's a great lady, but really can't teach.  Try and get on her good side, which will at least make the class bearable.  Be prepared to spend a LOT of time on homework assignments, and to get frustrated.  There's no way of avoiding this class- just try to enjoy her sense of humor if you can :)"
835,213625,3.5,3.0,"She doesn't teach the topics very well, but the class is very easy to get an A in, mainly because she will give you the answers if you just go to office hours. She's a very easy grader and just wants you to show enthusiasm about the subject. QA assignments take FOREVER but they aren't necessarily difficult."
836,213625,1.5,4.0,i have nothing positive to say. just awful
837,213625,3.5,1.0,"She is not the most organized, but she is very nice and willing to help.  Most complaints are due to the SPSS program, but it really isn't that difficult to learn if you are decent with computers."
838,213625,2.0,3.0,She is a very nice person. The only problem is she doens't know how to teach.
839,213625,1.0,4.0,She grades inconsistently and arbitrarily. She is confusing and makes no sense. Everyone works in the lab all night trying to make sense of her assignments. Stay away if you can.
840,213625,1.5,4.0,the most confused professor ever! Very often does not make any sense. Is amusing at times because of her quirkiness but that isnt incentive enough to take the class. Avoid of possible.
841,213625,3.0,2.0,"terrible, makes mistakes all the time in class and usually looks confused; if you know anything about statistics you can do cicles around her and the material - most difficult part is getting to know the software"
842,213625,1.0,1.0,Avoid at all costs.
843,590464,5.0,2.0,The professor is great ! Every word on class is useful ! (if you listen carefully)and extremely helpful on office hour !
844,590464,4.5,2.0,"Zoran was a great professor! He was always very helpful in office hours and lectures were normally easy to understand. He had a good sense of humor. There were quizzes every week in discussion which came from the homework and the midterms and finals were fair and not too difficult. If you have to take Calc III, I recommend taking it with Zoran!"
845,590464,3.0,3.0,Moderately easy course. Familiarity with linear algebra is recommended. The tests are like the HW. An OK lecturer but I thought his lectures made the material slightly more difficult than necessary. I recommend copying the HW as they tend to not return it before exams.
846,590464,4.5,3.0,He is very helpful. Go to the class...because the lecture is much clearer than the testbook.
847,590464,4.5,2.0,"Zoran is a great teacher.  He always makes himself available plus his accent makes lectures more interesting.  Besides being helpful, he is a really funny guy."
848,590464,3.5,3.0,"Very nice professor, but you can actually struggle quite a bit if math. is not something you're really confident about. Definitely do homework and attend lectures, though his hand-writing is pretty illegible. He holds review sessions right before tests; attend these review sessions, as actual tests are similar to the practice tests. Nice, overall!"
849,590464,4.5,1.0,"Zoran = easy, nuff said. Take Diff Eq with him. Besides the easy part, he is a cool dude and makes being up at 9:30 tolerable."
850,590464,4.5,1.0,"Zoran is a character, and I totally love his accent. He says funny things in the class like occassionally and those will make you laugh a lot."
851,590464,3.5,2.0,His tests are very much like his homework and even more like his practice tests (which makes the class easy). Very approachable at office hours.
852,590464,4.0,2.0,"He is a bit of a space cadet, but not an extremely hard teacher. Very willing to help. I wish I had had him more often."
853,590464,4.0,1.0,HW and Tests are really easy and very similar.  Study hw problems and you should do great.
854,590464,3.5,1.0,"A little spacey, young guy, really nice. His lectures weren't too hard to follow, but it was one of the easiest A's I've had in math. The tests were extremely, extremely similar to the homeworks (I remember I didn't understand one concept at all but just memorized the hw problem and aced the question on the test). Easy A if you do the work."
855,590464,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Grujic is a fun guy. Kind of spacey at times, but generally has a good idea of what he's doing. Very helpful at office hours and very approachable."
856,590464,3.5,2.0,Not that hard- as someone said the test questions are similar to hw...which is how it *should* be anyways- i learned a lot just by figuring out all the hw problems. smart (obviously)and pretty nice guy too
857,590464,5.0,1.0,Zoran Grujic is one of the best professors I've ever had.  The rest of you people on the board are all morons if you can't appreciate his style.
858,590464,1.5,3.0,He is so boring! And he has no idea what he is talking about.
859,590464,2.5,2.0,"Lectures are unstructured and hard to pay attention to. He just kind of stands at the front of the class and mumbles, and he has REALLY bad handwriting. Tests are usually very similar to homework problems. It's not hard to do well in his class if you can stay awake during lectures."
860,983684,1.0,4.0,Not helpful at all and assigned busy work like it was a high school class. I'm not sure what universe the people who left the positive reviews are from. Avoid at all costs.
861,983684,5.0,3.0,"She is one of my favorite professors in the environmental science department at UVA. I highly recommend her. If you put in the time and do the work, she will reward that and you will get a good grade. Her class is generally laid back and she doesn't expect you to do a ton of work in order to do well."
862,983684,5.0,3.0,"Super sweet teacher and very helpful, but tests are really hard- lots of short answer essays with not a lot of time- probably boring unless you're already somewhat interested in geology, required for evsc majors. Attendence not technically mandatory, but there are often in class activities that count for participation points"
863,983684,3.5,3.0,"herman is really cool and fun, she has a great sense of humor and passion for the subject. BUT you have to reallllllllyyy be interested in the subject, otherwise it's just incredibly boring and not worth it at all. and, as the post below me said, the longer assignments are graded pretty damn hard. evsc people, go for it. otherwise, don't."
864,983684,3.0,2.0,"boring sometimes, but shes fun and the class was good, the longer assignments were graded hard, but other then that hw every week wasn't to bad"
865,983684,4.5,3.0,"Sweetest prof in dpartmnt. Herman rly goes out of her way 4 her students. Class like mix of kindergarten (demo of erthqke waves by evry1 holding hands; jeopardy games) and grad course. Tests r all shrt aswr, time constraint. Wants concpts, not memrzatn. class avg = 80%. But prof extrmly clear, knwldgabl about her sbjct. &lt;3ed her 4 geology over bigs"
866,983684,1.5,5.0,"Terrible. Not helpful at all. I don't know happened but her tests were not open notes or open book. They were just hard. When approached for help, she said, &quot;study harder&quot;. I very much regret having her as a professor. Ruined my semester!"
867,983684,4.5,2.0,No Comments
868,983684,5.0,1.0,"Great lady who is very passionate about her teaching. Her class can get a little boring but she is so nice/kind you have to go. Easy class, lots of easy homework and open note tests. And there are no books to buy!!"
869,1860230,5.0,2.0,"Professor Berstein is a good instructor. Although she is kinda wordy sometimes and try to make jokes which I don't think are very funny, you can tell you really care about her students and put in a lot of efforts in the teaching. As for the class itself, sometimes it can get boring, but overall it is a worth taking class."
870,1041040,5.0,3.0,She's very helpful and the class is fun.
871,1041040,4.0,3.0,Lydia is very nice and approachable and is always willing to help outside of class. She does expect a lot out of you but only because she believes in your potential! Fun class. The work is fun and you really get to explore a lot of software and make it your own.
872,1041040,4.0,4.0,Lydia expects a lot out of you and definitely does not give out A's easily. slightly frustrating when she didn't know some of the material herself & then expected proficiency out of her students. you don't receive any grades for projects until your final grade. still an interesting class - i enjoyed the photoshop more than flash
873,1860253,5.0,1.0,"I like Audrey. She makes students comfortable and relaxed to take this class, and thus very active. We did fitness in classes too but even that part is fun. When she lets us play games she always joins us. She is more like a friend than a teacher to me."
874,2368167,5.0,2.0,"Gave excellent and extremely interesting lectures with stories from her own experience. Definitely reading heavy, but skimming will likely be enough since the exams are only multiple choice. Would completely recommend this class as you gain a whole new perspective, take especially if you are considering a career in healthcare."
875,2368167,5.0,3.0,"Professor Tidey is really sweet. We always talked about very interesting topics, and I would recommend her for Medical Anthropology. Such a sweet professor."
876,2368167,4.0,4.0,"Professor Tidey teaches this class wonderfully! She is very interested in Medical Anthropology and tells relatable stories regarding the topic at hand. She assigns very interesting readings, but they can be pretty lengthy at times; well it is an Anthropology course. I believe this was her first time teaching this course and I would say that she did"
877,172717,4.0,1.0,I am extremely interested in international development and enjoyed the class. I didn't like that we went to pre-historic humanity and went into gender inequality towards the end of the class. She gives extra credit and is an easy grader. She is interesting. We had a development conference that was nice. She is so approachable! Take advantage!
878,172717,1.5,1.0,"Rae may be smart, however, her abilities do not include teaching. She repeats herself constantly and treats students as if they are stupid. Once you have read one of her articles you will know everything you are supposed to know for the course."
879,172717,2.0,2.0,"Prof. Blumberg is very smart and her theories are fascinating.  However that does not translate too well in the classroom where she tends to be scattered, disjointed, and can talk forever about the same topic (overkill).  While I got several good theories out of SOC of Development class I wish I could have just read her book instead."
880,172717,3.5,3.0,Rae was an interesting woman. She's a bit scatter minded and repeats herself often but the class is not bad. The material is interesting as to it pertains to your life. It puts things into perspective.  Know her theory because that's essentially the entire course-- society related to her theory. Read the stuff on the syllabus.
881,172717,4.5,1.0,"It's easy, but she talked about herself, complained about &quot;Southern blue collar workers with less than a high school education&quot; (direct quote)that go to &quot;lousy rural schools&quot;. At least part of the test is multiple choice (because some kids are to dumb for essays according to Ms. Blumberg)."
882,172717,3.5,2.0,"I honestly thing she is  nice lady, she is a bit awkward though but it makes class funny. I;m not going to lie lectures are boring but it an easy class.  Your grade is comprised of section, two tests, and a six page paper. There is no final :) Lots of reading but she gives extra credit and its not hard to get an A"
883,172717,3.5,2.0,"Very interesting lady with some great stories to tell. Lecture is not mandatory and can be kinda boring at 9:30 in the morning. DO THE READING!!! Your grade is made up of he midterm and the final (both are basically reading quizzes), and a 6 page paper. Over all, easy class, fairly enjoyable"
884,172717,4.5,1.0,"Very intelligent and influential sociologist. However, lectures are dry and I can never sit through a whole session without zoning out. Easy class if you have a lenient TA."
885,172717,4.5,2.0,"Rae is a genius.  This is the best class I've had at UVA.  She is so knowledgeable and respected in the field of sociology.  I learned more than I could have imagined in the class, and enjoyed lecture a lot."
886,172717,4.5,1.0,easiest class ever. shes crazy but she tells good stories
887,172717,5.0,2.0,"Took 2 of her classes and almost identical in terms of the readings/assignments. She offers 3% to the final grade just for turning in 3 article summaries. She also has a midterm/final review session, where she gives you a lot of the questions that will be on the exam. She had the final exam during last day of class (not a 3 hour cummulative exam)."
888,172717,4.5,2.0,Oh blumberg...she rambles a lot and talks about allll her stories of traveling to every continent etc etc...she can talk forever...her lectures consist of about 75% stories and 25% test material...fairly easy class.  its one of those classes you walk out of laughing cuz she's so crazy
889,172717,3.5,2.0,"Blumberg's lectures are pretty dull, but the class is easy. She tells a lot of stories from when she was in 38 different countries and blah blah blah-- but none of it ends up on the tests. She's very nice and means well... I just don't enjoy her lectures. If you are looking for an A though, I would recommend this class."
890,172717,3.0,1.0,"This is an easy class, but the lecture is really boring, and hard to know what she is talking about. But, the TAs are really helpful and clarify everything."
891,172717,5.0,1.0,"I have taken two classes with her.  Her lectures are not that interesting, but he class is very easy and if you act like you are interested then its an easy A.  All of her classes are the exact same."
892,172717,4.0,2.0,"Prof Blumberg is a wonderful, incredibly knowledgeable and fair teacher who goes out of her way to make sure her students succeed.  Do the reading and you will do well."
893,172717,3.5,2.0,"She is weird, to say the least, but means well. Very passionate about the subject and knows her stuff. Tons of reading but it is definitely unnecessary to do it all - just skim. When it comes down to it, most of the material is common sense. Lectures can induce sleep - she rambles incessantly. TAs a little overzealous. Pretty easy class overall."
894,172717,3.0,3.0,"This class has a very heavy reading load. The material could be interesting, but lectures are very boring. There are a lot of extra credit opportunities, but the tests are a bit confusing. I would not recommend this class."
895,172717,5.0,3.0,Professor Blumberg is extremely nice and the class takes effort but eventually you're learning the same things over and over again.
896,172717,3.0,3.0,"She is a genius and she knows it and by the end of the class you know it.  There are lots of great books, but I wouldn't take the class unless you already know the topic."
897,172717,2.0,3.0,"It's like what's been said before, this professor needs a huge ego deflation. To be honest, this just seemed like a course built around her own thesis only. My single biggest beef with the class actually was the fact that trying to get her (or ESPECIALLY HER TA'S) to respond to emails is like pulling teeth!"
898,172717,1.5,2.0,"Incredibly intelligent and incredibly unclear.  Although she gives out lots of E.C., she has to in order for everyone to do alright in the class - exam questions often have multiple answers.  She's very nice, but she needs an ego deflation.  Also, she developed her own language - seriously.  It's like wingdings; I saw her write in it once.  CREEPY."
899,172717,3.5,3.0,"Good God. This class made me dread the 2PM hour. Yes, she's intelligent, worldly and generous with EC, but she's also eccentric, technically-challenged and ALWAYS late. The latter group outweighed any of her good qualities. Her lectures was just too boring- try another SOC class."
900,172717,3.5,2.0,"The class is inconsistently interesting...Some days amazing, others really repetitive.  She tells some really interesting stories about her travels and research.  Lots of extra credit!"
901,172717,2.5,1.0,"The hardest part about her class is going to it. She's scatter-brained and all over the place, talking more about what countries she's helped to &quot;fix&quot; than about the material. If you can manage to go consistently, you should get fine grades. It's really a gut, that bores you into struggling."
902,172717,3.5,1.0,"scatter brained, yes, but interesting theories and she has a lot of experiences. very easy so it's worth it."
903,172717,2.0,1.0,"Dear God. This class was absolutely worthless. I learned nothing that I didn't already know, and it was very difficult to pay attention due to the boring subject matter.  Discussions were dreaded. Do not take with Blumberg.  She is very nice and approachable, however.  Also, extremely easy (Ex Cred)"
904,172717,2.0,2.0,"WRETCHED class.  One of the worst I've had at UVA.  The lectures are 95% useless and you can get to class 15 minutes late because there are inevitably &quot;technical difficulties.&quot;  In someone elses hands this could have been a cool class, but Blumberg is no good. (She does do lots of extra credit!)"
905,172717,1.5,4.0,"Worthless class.  No one including the TAs knows what's going on.  The whole semester is wasted on teaching ONE theory--Blumberg's--and it's not even interesting.  Syllabus is inanely crammed with reading, TA discussions aren't helpful, because they're not sure what to cover.  Avoid if you can."
906,172717,5.0,3.0,"She fits the stereotype of the scatterbrained intellectual, which makes her a very interesting lecturer.  She has years of personal experience in developing nations.  This gives her the ability to teach the subject matter in a way that goes beyond a textbook."
907,172717,2.5,1.0,"Yes, she was biased, but I agreed with her viewpoints.  I did learn a lot, but she was scatterbrained.  Kind of got sick of hearing how she went to Northwestern, how she traveled to 34 countries... Not very approachable either"
908,172717,4.5,1.0,"Yes, she's liberal, and yes, she teaches her own theory.  Still, I think she has something to offer and is fully willing to discuss matters out of class, related or otherwise.  Also, it's a fairly easy class, even if you don't do the readings."
909,172717,1.0,4.0,"Lectures are NOT coherent, NOT open to students, and VERY biased.  This class is worthless."
910,172717,4.0,2.0,"Spacey and entertaining, provides us with jokes...Teaches only her own theory, but hey, we learned in her class that that's all that matters!  How can you not like Rae Lesser Blumberg, the world traveler with three last names&#63;"
911,172717,2.0,4.0,Very biased and VERY liberal.  Most of the class is on her theories and books.  My worst class this semester
912,172717,1.0,1.0,"If you get Rae as your advisor, change as fast as you can.  She is so scatterbrained and obnoxious if you need help.  Strangely, she gave me a hug at graduation..."
913,172717,1.5,3.0,"Very boring, biased.  Class should be easy but becomes difficult by being immensely boring.  TA's are even worse."
914,172717,2.0,2.0,Authoritarian in her leftism
915,172717,2.5,2.0,"HIGHLY liberal, very often this bleeds into her lecture in the form of not presenting both sides of issues or omitting facts about statistics that would change interpretation."
916,754356,2.5,5.0,"Nick is a nice guy, and he tries to help students but Calc 2 is just a hard course. I found that homework was impossible even when I thought I understand his lecture. And girls come to his office hours just to flirt with him which takes time away from those who are really there to learn. He isn't very clear and his exams are too hard. Not recommend"
917,754356,5.0,4.0,"Great instructor; I didn't apply myself nearly as much as I should have. His jokes are great, and he made me look forward to a morning summer class. Very easy to get along with, and his enthusiasm for mathematics is contagious."
918,754356,4.5,3.0,"Nick was an awesome teacher! If you get a bad grade it is because you didn't study. I got an A- in that class. The material can be sort of tough but if you don't understand, he is ALWAYS available and helpful in office hours. I recommend him! Plus to me he was an easy grader"
919,754356,2.5,5.0,"He's a cool person, but as a teacher, he really sucks. He works a whole problem, then realizes that he made a major mistake. So then erases it and starts all over. Thus, you won't go over many practice problems. Don't take this class unless you want to get a bad grade."
920,754356,4.5,4.0,"Nick Hamblet is such a GREAT teacher!! he is very helpful. He explains things very well, and tries hard to make sure you understand. he can explain things in so many different ways to help you. he's funny too - i enjoyed his jokes and he has a lot of enthusiasm for math. it can be hard to get a perfect grade on hw but u learn a lot in his class."
921,754356,5.0,2.0,Nick is so kind a guy!Take his class!
922,754356,5.0,5.0,"Test averages are pretty low, but Nick is very nice and helpful. Manages to be patient with the kind of students I would have lost patience with. And has some good jokes."
923,754356,4.0,5.0,"He is really nice and kind of funny, but confusing at times. Go to office hours!"
924,754356,5.0,4.0,"Don't take unless you have to, but Hamblet is a really good teacher and can be kinda funny. I had no previous calc experience, and I regretted not doing 121, especially since I didn't need either course, but Hamblet made it worth it"
925,754356,5.0,3.0,"Nick Hamblet is a great teacher. He makes sure that you understand completely. He can rework a problem in multiple ways to help you understand. He is always so excited about what he is teaching, which helps you pay attention. Be prepared for some really corny jokes that make the class go by just a little faster than usual."
926,754356,5.0,2.0,"Good Guy, Dry Humor at times, but great clarity, always has u prepared for test and is more than willing to help"
927,754356,5.0,1.0,"AMAZING TA. Great teacher, exaplains everything really well, makes calculus pretty easy, and he tells corny jokes, If you are going to take applied calc take it with him!"
928,754356,3.5,3.0,"He's a generally good guy, but has some trouble explaining some of the concepts.  He obviously hasn't had much experience teaching, and occasionally a topic will go uncovered in class that you'll have to read the book for or go to his office hours for.  His office hours are great, and he is very willing to help out anyone willing to come by."
929,754356,4.5,2.0,Probably one of the most helpful guys I have met. He's a funny guy. class is cool. Homework not too bad 4 (book) problems & 15+ webwork problems each week. Easier than it sounds. He also has high test averages.Good TA Definitely Recommended.
930,754356,5.0,2.0,"Nick is great. He really wants you to do well. I think he worked harder to get me an A than I did. If you have to take calculus, definitely take it with Nick. Work load is a lot lighter than other sections and he tells awesome nerdy math jokes. :)"
931,1049277,1.0,5.0,"She has been so far the worst professor I had, and by that her class was the first in which I had the worst grade.The writings assignments were OK, but her grading ridiculous. She made that class even hard but not being prepared for the assignments. Overall, worst class I have taken so far!!!!"
932,1049277,2.5,5.0,"By far the worst professor I've ever had. I went to her office hours multiple times for every paper (many of which she didn't even show up for). For each paper I always got to the point where she would tell me that it was great and very well written, and I would still get a B on it. She expects graduate level writing to get an A. Ridiculous grading"
933,1049277,2.0,4.0,Berne is probably the worst professor at UVa. STS 1500 is a complete joke. The questions on the midterm had nothing to do with understanding of the material but rather it was all memorization. The papers are also a joke as the feedback they give you is completely useless and the grading does not make any sense at all.
934,1049277,5.0,3.0,My favorite professor of all time! She respects her students.
935,1049277,4.5,4.0,"Actually, Professor Berne is an amazing teacher. What I realized though is that if you are engaged, you benefit greatly and do well. The students looking for an easy ride or resentful because the course is required, don't do so well and want to blame the teacher. She really challenged me to think critically and that has helped me tremendously."
936,1049277,3.5,2.0,Prof Berne is very passionate about what she is teaching. That said the lectures are somewhat interesting but more importantly - required. Honestly your grade is impacted more by who your TA is then by her.
937,1049277,2.0,3.0,"Berne comes across as a new age Hippie (probably because she is). The lectures are dreadfully boring and 75 minutes long. The reading is terrible and the assessments are geared toward memorization rather than critical thinking. Prepare yourself, for this class is the worst I've taken at UVA"
938,1049277,1.5,5.0,"Interesting discussions in class, however she is very obviously biased in one direction (far to the left) and rarely backs up her ""facts"" with statistics.  Convoluted, arbitrary test questions don't help.  If the class weren't graded so harshly it might be a good class, but unfortunately its not."
939,1049277,4.0,4.0,"Professor Berne teaches STS 1500, and let me tell you that this class is a joke.  I am upset that I had to take a class that was pointless and was difficult.  I wouldn't even call Berne a professor.  She does nothing in the course, and ensures that very few people receive an A.  During the course of the semester she lectured a total of 4 times."
940,1049277,5.0,4.0,"Prof Berne expects more of her students than other STS profs, but she gives back just as much! There's lots of reading and its almost always talked about in class discussions but she's very understanding about deadlines. She's very passionate and her choice in topics made me feel like I learned something from STS. Probably my favorite prof ever."
941,1049277,2.5,2.0,"Despite the dismal nature of STS 401, Berne manages to keep the class interesting by having group discussions on socially important issues.  Keep in mind this takes away from thesis time however.  Conclusion:  Recommended"
942,8897,5.0,3.0,"Take both 341 and 342.  I was not in the COMM school, I was a politics major, but these were by far the best classes that I took while at UVA.  Wheeler is great at explaining things and the material is very interesting.  JUST DON'T MULTITASK! HE WILL FLIP OUT.  And he gives you fair warning that it makes him mad, so no excuses."
943,8897,4.0,3.0,"Wheeler is the greatest professor at this University. The class is almost exactly like Comm Law I. It talks more about property law which personally I liked Comm Law I better. But Wheeler still makes the class a lot of fun and interesting. Pretty easy, just follow the lecture notes that he sends out for exams."
944,8897,4.0,4.0,"Wheeler is a great professor and really loves teaching law. He only uses the board to lecture from, but he uses a lot of great examples so that you really remember this stuff. He gives a oral exam at the beginning of every class, but it's really easy as long as you go to class. The midterm is pretty hard, but the final pretty easy."
945,8897,5.0,2.0,"Comm341or342-WORTH taking in your college academic years; I learned the most useful, practical, realistic, creditworthy information in this class with Wheeler."
946,8897,5.0,4.0,"Wheeler is a little weird, but passionate about law and teaching. I think that learned more from my two semesters with him than any other class at UVA."
947,8897,4.5,4.0,"His class is very useful, he is extremely entertaining, and a great lecturer. Most importantly, you learn about all sorts of things that directly affect your life. BEWARE, do not try to multi-task in class. He get very angry. If you take notes on a laptop, don't check your email, he has spies. Email him to be a designated note taker to use comp"
948,8897,4.0,2.0,Professor Wheeler is one of the most self-important professors i've had. He has a nervous breakdown any time a student does anything unrelated to his class and storms out of the room.  His class is interesting but its unfortunate that thinks its necessary to be so unreasonably strict about meaningless things like doing crossword puzzles or reading.
949,8897,4.5,2.0,"Great Professor, very entertaining!!! Extremely knowledgeable. 341 and 342 were my favorite classes @ UVA."
950,8897,5.0,1.0,"the material isn't necessarily easy for everybody, but the grading definitely is. look at the grade distribution for this and for comm 342 on the course forum... and then take both classes. in 342, i had a 101 average going into the final, but i still think that i got more out of these classes than i have out of most (and im not in the comm school)"
951,8897,3.0,2.0,"Wheeler is crazy. Literally. He'll flip in class if you read... even if you think you're being sneaky HE WILL SEE YOU and his reaction will scare you. It makes him pretty unapproachable, but luckily the subject matter is great. His lectures are interesting. Dont buy book- take good notes."
952,8897,5.0,3.0,"Wheeler is awesome - but for anyone yet to take him, some advice - under NO circumstances should you read the newspaper in class, because even if it's somewhere where you think it's hidden, it's not - and Wheeler will unexpectedly flip out and you and the rest of the class will be scared. people make this mistake every year, so don't let it be you."
953,8897,5.0,1.0,"This class is awesome...a must take.  Fun and interesting lectures, and more importantly very very easy.  Wheeler is awesome"
954,8897,5.0,1.0,"Best classes every - got an A in both sections and all I did was show up and take notes.  Judging the UVA moot court teams is fun too!  Not sure that it will prepare you for law school, but Wheeler's still great!"
955,8897,5.0,3.0,He was absolutely one of the best. And I know how to folk dance because of him!!!
956,8897,5.0,2.0,"Take it, take it, take it"
957,8897,4.5,1.0,"One of my favorite classes here, he always keeps you interested with funny examples and stories."
958,8897,5.0,2.0,Really really fun guy.
959,8897,4.0,3.0,No Comments
960,8897,4.5,2.0,Very instructive
961,8897,5.0,3.0,Great all around... one of the best prof's i've ever had. But he misleads you with his midterm... just get the old exams and it's an easy 100.
962,8897,5.0,1.0,Useful material; great storyteller = presents lawsuits in fun interesting manner; do not read the Cav Daily in his class ;)
963,8897,5.0,2.0,"A  must take  class, even if you're not in the COMM school or going to law school."
964,8897,4.5,3.0,great teacher. funny as hell.  always kept me awake.
965,8897,5.0,2.0,Fantastic class.  Entertaining and actually useful material.
966,8898,1.0,1.0,"This class was USELESS.  We had a room filled with 40 extremely accomplished people, but I got nothing out of the class because Brown could not facilitate a good discussion.  He is very condescending, and only puts forth an extremely liberal viewpoint. I could have read the assigned books on my own and learned just as much as I did from the class."
967,8898,3.5,2.0,"Took him for the USEM Ethics in Modern Society...and came out with mixed feelings about him. He is not the best discussion leader, which makes the class pretty boring and quiet. He thinks he has the right opinion on everything and is pretty condescending when someone disagrees. He's not all that bad though...nice at heart maybe&#63;"
968,8898,1.0,3.0,He's the most condescending teacher that I've ever had.
969,8898,5.0,2.0,"Brad Brown is one of the better professors around.  He has a genuine interest in his students and an interest in a variety of business-realted topics.  An awesome sense of humor, a friendly disposition, and so on.  His classes are interactive, informative and dare I say it... fun.  Take all of his classes, you won't regret it.  Good advisor too."
970,8898,5.0,1.0,Brad is the principal of the International Residential College and we love him.
971,8898,5.0,1.0,"Take this class. If you are at all interested in the USEMs, take this class. It's so easy and for the most part, everything you talk about is interesting. Really like the easiest class and the nicest guy ever. Dry sense of humor."
972,8898,3.5,2.0,Really  nice guy.
973,8898,5.0,1.0,"Very nice and helpful.  Class was interesting and not too hard, just the way a USEM should be :-)"
974,8898,4.5,3.0,"He was a great teacher, easy to talk to and always willing to help with anything you need.  He's the coolest guy ever!"
975,1655511,5.0,5.0,Have you every wanted to feel so stupid and incompetent just from reading lab manuals? Well this class would be perfect for you. This is an undergraduate course that assumes the knowledge of someone with a PhD from Harvard...
976,1655511,3.0,5.0,"This is the first time Dr. Lehmann has taught the lab course and as a result there were a few difficulties. This class is extremely challenging however Dr. Lehmann is very accommodating and understanding when we voiced our concerns &amp; difficulties. The labs are very complex yet the grading reflects this. Overall, a tough class but effort is rewarded"
977,1655511,1.0,5.0,"It is literally impossible for him to clearly explain something. If you ask a question, he will not answer it. It seems physically impossible for him to explain something. Keep away. Keep as far away as you can."
978,1655511,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I've ever had, by far, and I'm in grad school. I mean just take something else, you're not going to learn anything."
979,1655511,2.0,5.0,"Most of the time, it seems like you walk in and out of his class having learned nothing. He definitely will make time to help you outside of class, but it is still difficult to understand his explanations of the materials. He has a hard time of explaining the basics and dives into the more advanced topics immediately. He goes on lots of tangents."
980,1655511,4.0,5.0,Dr. Lehman is a challenging professor but is very accessible inside and outside of class. Really cares about his students.
981,1655511,1.0,5.0,Never explains anything. Examples are horrible. Assumes you know everything without having taught you anything.
982,484061,5.0,4.0,"My favorite professor I've had so far at UVA. His lectures are insightful, entertaining, and engaging. I learned a lot from him about Criminal Justice as well as life. Would definitely recommend."
983,484061,4.0,3.0,"Professor McConnell is an excellent speaker.  His lectures are engaging and interesting, and he has a great sense of humor.  There are four exams total, including a non-cumulative final.  It definitely helps to do the readings, which can be a bit long, but worth it.  I wouldn't say this class is an easy A, but with a good effort, it can be done."
984,484061,4.0,1.0,"Fave professor ever. I wish he taught more classes, I'd take them. He is HILARIOUS. The best part is he actually explains things very well, clearly, and concisely. Tests are pretty easy; they consist of multiple choice, truefalse, and short essay questions. You don't even need the books as they reiterate what he already teaches in class."
985,484061,4.5,2.0,McConnell is the best professor class I have had at UVA. Lectures are really entertaining and easy to understand. The reading isn't really necessary if you go to lecture but some of it is interesting. A really great class! 
986,484061,5.0,1.0,"Just go to lecture, take good notes, and cram before the test. Easy A! "
987,484061,4.0,3.0,"used to be an easy class, still is manageable but they added 5 true false and 2 essays to the exams. not an easy A but is still interesting"
988,484061,4.0,1.0,"really easy class-don't buy any of the books, just attend lecture! Prof. McConnell is awesome! He is so weird and nervous/awkward but hilarious! He will keep you engaged although criminology itself is not as interesting as it sounds. Highly recommended and an easy A!"
989,484061,5.0,2.0,"Legendary professor. I was definitely a bit nervous at first, as he seemed a bit goofy and absent-minded, but man, he turned out to be one of the most riveting lecturers I've had. Has a way of making everything he says interesting, and I never really dozed off or found myself extremely bored in his class.  Wish I could have him again"
990,484061,5.0,2.0,Awesome man!!!!
991,484061,4.5,2.0,"My absolute favorite class and professor so far at UVA. Only tests (short and pretty easy!), no papers, and although there is heavy reading, it's generally interesting stuff. He is hilarious and riveting as a lecturer; you will never be bored! Take this class, you will not regret it."
992,484061,3.5,2.0,"Take this class! Best lecturer I've ever had. Literally all you need to do is attend lecture, take notes and you're done! PERFECTION."
993,484061,5.0,1.0,I absolutely loved this class! Professor McConnell is hilarious and class is always interesting! He's honestly my favorite professor at UVa and I recommend this class to everyone!
994,484061,3.5,1.0,"This was one of my favorite classes at UVA. McConnell is a really exciting lecturer who knows his stuff. There is assigned reading but it isn't necessary at all. Exams are 25 question multiple choice and if you go to lecture everyday, it's an easy A. I'd recommend this class to anybody."
995,484061,5.0,2.0,"Weird, goofy guy, but funny and is probably the best professor at UVA. Everything he says is important.  If you attend lecture you don't have to read the book."
996,484061,3.5,3.0,"Goofy guy, interesting subject"
997,484061,5.0,4.0,"Bob is an amazing professor, makes the subject really interesting (I absolutely loved his lectures) but his tests on the other hand wasn't as easy as everyone makes it out to be.  There are only a couple multiple choice qs and an essay for each test- you really have to know every minor detail in his notes to do well on the essays."
998,484061,3.0,3.0,"This criminology class is said to be easy, but I find it somewhat difficult. You should do the reading to reinforce his lectures and make sure you go to class!"
999,484061,4.5,3.0,"Loved the class. He is a great teacher who makes the material interesting for anyone. Not necessary to do the reading, but it helps. However, your grade depends on your TA some are harder than others."
1000,484061,5.0,2.0,"He's an awesome professor, absolutely hilarious! Reminds me somewhat of Jim Carrey. Course material is really interesting and he's very good at relating it to everyday life. Lectures are a must as all the exam questions come directly from lecture material. Possible exam questions are given out before; it's easy to prepare. My favorite class!"
1001,484061,4.5,2.0,"I loved this class! His lectures were so much fun to listen to. You definitely do not need to read the book, dont even buy it. He says in his syllabus nothing that isnt in the lectures will be on the test... This class was so interesting and Bob was so much fun!"
1002,484061,5.0,1.0,"Easiest, most interesting class I have taken at UVA. Tests are taken directly from his lectures, which are delivered in a preacher-like cadence (in a good way: mostly enthusiasm). I didn't read a page of any of the textbooks and got an A. Straightforward if you attend the lectures, highly recommended!"
1003,484061,5.0,1.0,"This teacher really knows his stuff!  The class is interesting and he is really funny.  This was the only class I have taken thus far that I really wanted to go to.  Easy A if you go to class, and review notes before the exam.  It is a must take for any UVA student."
1004,484061,4.0,2.0,"Awesome class.  He's a little strange, but entertaining.  Go to class, and it's an easy A."
1005,484061,4.5,2.0,"Bob's lectures are very enthralling. He is a very dynamic person and the material is fascinating. The readings aren't necessary at all, but make sure to study for the exams. Also, coming to lecture is VERY IMPORTANT. All the material for the exams comes directly from the lectures (which are fully orated, no power point). Overall, great guy!"
1006,484061,4.0,2.0,he's pretty funny.. lectures easy to follow and the tests were straightforward if you study
1007,484061,4.5,3.0,"He's an amazing professor.  His tests require that you pay attention and understand the material, as should be expected.  Lectures are by far the most interesting I've heard."
1008,484061,4.0,3.0,really interesting class!!
1009,484061,4.5,4.0,"tests were too tough, but he's a great guy!  lectures were great fun, even if they were a little dry (not his fault).  i'd take a class from him again, for sure (aside from the tests, obviously)"
1010,484061,3.0,2.0,"Only theories, pretty boring.  Tests are kind of hard, it depends a lot on your TA.  Hes a funny lecturer though.  Readings are the same as the lecture."
1011,484061,4.5,3.0,"Hes a great lecturer, and keeps things intersting.  The tests are not bad, you just have to pay attention to differences.  The good thing is... you either go to class or read the book.  Its Supplementary! I enjoyed it.  Easy Grade."
1012,484061,4.5,2.0,"Overall good class.  Material was very interesting. The tests are a bit challenging, but if you know your theories and the casual logic you should be straight.  McConnell really gets into it so makes for a good lecture at 9am.  Lectures are sometimes unclear, but hes always there for questions."
1013,484061,1.0,4.0,"Wow-incredibly horrible class.  When 2 people of 150 make perfect scores on this midterm, the average grade is a 65, and no curve is added, something is terribly wrong.  His craziness detracted TOTALLY for the class.  As had been said, Sara did help with this class, thank heavens."
1014,484061,4.0,3.0,"I thought the class would be more interesting...but it's mostly boring theories.  This dude's crazy though, so it's okay even at 9 in the morning.  Sara is the best TA and the tests aren't too bad."
1015,484061,5.0,3.0,Tests are okay...not awful but not really easy either.  Know you're definitions.  He's an amusing but odd guy who keeps the class interesting with random tid bits about his life.  My TA (Sara) absolutely rocked and made a 2 oclock discussion on fridays worth it!
1016,8925,5.0,4.0,"Professor Overstreet is far and away the kindest, most sincere, dedicated, well connected Professor at UVA. Bottom line is he loves teaching and loves his students. He is the best teacher I've ever had in my life and I am not alone... all of my other classmates agree. Those who noted that his class was useless are worthless and selfish students."
1017,8925,4.0,3.0,Memorable professor who truly cares and draws on his relevant business and life experience in his teaching.
1018,8925,5.0,1.0,the best professor I ever had
1019,8925,5.0,4.0,Whoever said &quot;he is a useless professor&quot; was pretty likely a useless student. Overstreet is one of the best professors at the University of Virginia. And certainly the best connected comm school professor.
1020,8925,2.0,4.0,"Tough curriculum, nice professor.  You have to speak up and drop by often with good questions to get attention/noticed... which helps with your grades... if you're a wall flower, take another class."
1021,8925,1.0,1.0,He is a useless professor.  Want a good grade&#63;  Suck up.
1022,8925,5.0,3.0,"George is one of the rare professors who truly cares about his students. I can't say enough about him. Your learning is largely self-directed. You have to want it, and you have to give your all. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better mentor at UVA."
1023,8925,5.0,4.0,Prof. Overstreet is an incredible teacher.  His  class is not easy though.  Anyone who would give him a poor rating is likely a slacker who was too arrogant to work hard.  Find a group of his past students and ask their opinion.

1025,656095,3.5,4.0,"I had her for my majors seminar.  She did a really good job of gathering ideas from everyone in the class.  The readings she chose for the course packet covered a wide range of perspectives and were extremely enlightening. I really enjoyed her class. I RECOMMEND HER! She loves to teach. Go to office hours! It makes her really happy, and is helpful."
1026,656095,4.0,3.0,"Professor Alexander is friendly and engaging.  She cares about the material and her students.  She is pretty good at communicating.  Her grading is fair (not extremely harsh or easy). She is not extremely strange, but she is a little bit quirky in a good way.  I definitely reccommend her class!"
1027,656095,4.5,2.0,"Amazing professor! Keeps your attention during her lectures. Uses props, shows videos, encourages field work within the Jewish community. Readings are manageable and interesting. She is great during office hours as well. Go visit her!"
1028,656095,5.0,3.0,"Alexander is amazing...lectures are super interesting, papers are interesting and usually short, grading is very fair. Plus she really goes the distance to open up world of judaism to students - inviting guest speakers, bringing in props, organizing events, etc Dont miss her classes"

1030,484065,5.0,3.0,She did a great job giving the context behind the architecture so it felt like you were hearing stories rather than data. Don't know why her reviews are so average because I thought her lectures were really good!
1031,484065,2.5,3.0,Not the best lecturer but usually fascinating if you're already interested.
1032,484065,5.0,4.0,"Rome, Venice, Istanbul was a very interesting class. The lectures were fascinating, and I really learned a lot. The readings were tough to get through though. They were scholarly articles that just got too detailed and convoluted at times. But Professor Brothers were very nice and helpful. She even brought us cookies for the final!"
1033,484065,5.0,4.0,Enjoyed her lectures alot; she's an extremely helpful lecturer
1034,484065,3.0,1.0,"Cammy's class is pretty straightforward.  Go to class and glance through the readings before tests and you'll be fine.  She wants you to do well, so as long as you're willing to play the game you'll be fine. Not the best lecturer, but not the worst either."
1035,484065,4.0,3.0,"Cammy is a delight. She gets flustered easily, but her lectures are enjoyable. She gives a bit of reading, but it's not bad. I enjoyed the class a lot."
1036,484065,4.0,2.0,"this class wasn't too bad as far as 9am classes go, it didn't put me to sleep everyday like waldman's. cammy makes jokes and keeps the lectures somewhat light, which is good. her tests aren't too bad either, it is mostly memorization of slides and essays that she gives you ahead of time"
1037,484065,3.5,1.0,"Prof Brothers was fine. That's really all there is to say. She wasn't inspiring, but as far as 9 am classes go, she's pretty good at keeping you awake. She gives a well balanced view of history and there isn't much work."
1038,484065,5.0,3.0,Her class was very interesting. She made the lectures easy to follow and her sense of humor made the 9am class fun to go to.
1039,484065,4.0,2.0,"This class is fairly easy but you just have to put a lot of effort into reading as well as preparing for the exam which is basically all memorization. Professor Brothers is very kind, the only critique I have of her is she tends to stray some in lecture, but that's where TA's help."
1040,484065,4.5,3.0,"Very approachable, lots of reading but not required unless you really want an A, only one major research paper due at end of semester, otherwise mostly memorization for slide identification."
1041,484065,3.5,3.0,Cammy is great.  She is funny and lively and helps you through the 9 am class.  Easy to follow format.  Tests are graded pretty hard by the TAs but she is always available to talk and there arem any extra credit opps.  Not as much work as expected from a 4 credit class.
1042,484065,1.5,3.0,"she is not a good teacher, very unsure of herself"
1043,484065,4.0,3.0,great class. very nontraditional way of lecturing. more oriented towards change in style and design rather than history and dates and the nit pick boring stuff. ta's are pretty bad. cammy is very dynamic and peppy and cute. evreyone should take the class.
1044,484065,4.5,4.0,The final project and exams are really hard and require a lot of work - but Cammy's lectures are interesting and I feel like i learned a lot.  I wouldn't recommend taking it unless it's required for you or you have a really big interest in learning about these buildings.
1045,484065,3.0,2.0,Very lively
1046,484065,4.0,2.0,"not too bad of a class. come to lectures (very important). don't really have to read the actual text. some ta's are better than others. cammy tries to make class interesting, always says funny things and tries to keep your interest. not much work to do either other than outside readings."
1047,1319651,5.0,3.0,"She's super sweet, and very approachable.Her class was very interesting because he topics were fresh and recent."

1049,1254116,3.0,2.0,"Had Professor Foutz for two Marketing classes. She is kind of eccentric and goofy, but nice. Her Marketing sessions as part of ICE were pretty fun, and the content / readings she provided were interesting. She tends to pick favorites in the class, and will often invite these students to serve as research assistants / tutors for her kid."
1050,1254116,5.0,1.0,"I have not taken a class with Professor Foutz. I have, however, worked with her as a graduate assistant. Professor Foutz really cares about people and will go well out of her way to help if she can. That being said, she's the kind of person you want to be around. She is clearly knowledgeable in marketing and I'm sure a great Professor."
1051,1254116,5.0,1.0,Great teacher!  Made me really interested in marketing.  Has fun research projects and gives great examples of what to and not to do in real life. A+++
1052,942823,3.0,3.0,"Material focuses on the biology of DNA and the history of the field of genetics.  5 closed-notes, out-of-class tests and a participation grade.  Asking questions in class, doing presentationsdebates & answering iClicker questions get you participation points. Tests were somewhat difficult. Thought it would be an easy A but I might get a B."
1053,942823,3.0,2.0,"Fairly easy class, but boring. Take it if you need to meet a requirement, not to learn interesting material."
1054,942823,3.0,2.0,"BIO 1050 is an easy class to fulfill a math/science requirements. You've got to memorize and know the vocab to do well, but he posts all his powerpoints on Collab so you really don't have to go to class unless you want participation points."
1055,942823,4.5,2.0,Professor Adler's lectures can be dry and disorganized sometimes but I started going to office hours and Professor Adler is really interesting. He is more than willing to explain things in office hours and it is a lot more helpful than the explanations in the lecture. If you go to office hours your grade will improve!
1056,942823,2.5,3.0,"BIOL 1050: Genes and Citizens is ultimately a biology class for non-biology majors. Take this for a relatively easy class in order to fulfill a math/sci requirement- NOT if you are looking for an interesting course. Lectures are boring and not mandatory. Tests are manageable if you study. All in all, minimal work and you can still get a B."
1057,942823,4.5,3.0,"I took a lower-level class with Professor Adler. He was nice, and class was really chill. Sometimes he goes too fast and the material is disorganized, but his slides has lots of info and he posts them online, so it's fine. Tests were very fair and straightforward."
1058,942823,1.0,3.0,"What an awful professor. He doesn't teach, just babbles endlessly. He has a ton of slides every class but skips the ones with all the information to spend half an hour talking about dogs. And his son-in-laws pet dog. And pretty much anything you don't need to know for genetics."
1059,942823,1.5,3.0,"Just a bad teacher.  He has no method and just rambles.  Oftentimes he gets caught up in his own words and will move back and forth between &quot;yes, no, yes, no, yes, no&quot; to the point that he thoroughly confuses his class...My PHD student of a TA didn't know what he was talking about half the time.  Read the book."
1060,942823,2.0,4.0,This teacher is very monotonous in lecture and not helpful at all in office hours. You really need a good TA for this class to get through it.
1061,942823,2.0,5.0,No Comments
1062,942823,2.5,1.0,"He's pretty clear in class, but also boring.  Not very good at answering questions--often doesn't really understand what he's asking.  Second test was really easy!"
1063,942823,1.5,3.0,Never absorbed a word he said in class. Extremely boring and unengaging.
1064,2220782,1.0,4.0,"He clearly knows his stuff, but comes off as arrogant and dismissive if you don't master the material as quickly as he would like. Needs to understand that no one likes ancient music as much as he does.  Also, needs to change his schedule, he was too occupied with his other jobs to concentrate solely on his students."
1065,246516,1.0,4.0,Simply the worst professor I have ever had. Whether it was yelling at a student for half an hour because the student had multiplied x*y instead of y*x without seeming to realize the two are the same or claiming she could not give higher than a B because she had not assigned enough work to justify it I have never seen a prof more incompetent or mean
1066,246516,4.5,5.0,"The best professors I ever had. Harder than heck, no doubt about it, but outside of the classroom I found her very helpful. She demands the very best of people and will not settle for less. That being said, by the end of the semester everyone produced better work than ever. She's teaching a lot more than the material. Took 4 semesters with her"
1067,246516,4.0,5.0,"Bass is reasonable; gives us real-world examples with practical applications; she's tough, but does it for our good; she was helpful to me and is an asset to UVa; she has more funding than prof. in the department."
1068,246516,1.0,5.0,"Given that so many students find her useless in teaching and unhelpful outside the classroom, the school really needs to find someone to replace her in order to maintain the quality of the education Systems Engineering students experience"
1069,246516,2.0,4.0,Pretty useless half of the semester.  We could have covered the same amount of material in two weeks.  It was too repetitive.

1071,2597621,1.0,4.0,"I would be extremely wary of taking any of Professor Nair's classes. He gets super behind and by the end of the semester you've got all the work that has been pushed back from the start of the semester. He also doesn't return grades on time, and is very late with them. Unless you  like writing paper on paper on paper, DO NOT take the class. "
1072,2597621,5.0,2.0,"Took Classical Islam and it was wonderful! He is very insightful and the lectures were interesting. There were no weekly discussion posts, or small tedious assignments. our grades are compiled from 4-5 total assignments, but aren't too bad. If you need any extensions or help with any course work, he'll definitely help you out!!"
1073,2597621,4.0,3.0,"I learned a lot in this class. Professor Nair is a really intelligent, friendly guy. However, he can sometimes be long-winded in his lectures and tends to get sidetracked, which can make things a little confusing. There's quite a bit of reading assigned, but the overall workload is pretty light."
1074,246517,3.0,4.0,"I understand that this was Prof. Schoppa's first semester of teaching online, however, if this class is the same format next semester, I do not recommend that you take it. Your grade depends on the TA . The grade structure is 30% midterm, 20% discussion, 50% final. The exams require that you do ALL of the readings. ALL OF THEM. Asian historydull."
1075,246517,4.0,4.0,"Professor Schoppa's PLIR 2030 course was very intriguing. It inspired me to pursue a career in foreign affairs, and I know have a great background in east asian politics. The midterm was a lot to study for, but only was 5 IDs and an essay. Your TA decides your fate - make sure you don't have daily reading quizzes. Go to office hours! Inside scoop"
1076,246517,3.5,2.0,"Interesting intro class, he is a very funny guy you can relate to.  Make sure to do the reading for the essay-style exam."
1077,246517,4.5,3.0,"Currently in Comparative politics with Schoppa and I love it. I knew nothing about the subject when I started but I've learned a LOT. His lectures are interesting and very clear cut. Definitely attend class b/c his online notes are choppy. Don't buy w/the textbook, you'll never use it. DEFINITELY BY THE ARTICLE PACKET you'll need it for everything!"
1078,246517,3.5,3.0,"The class itself is alright. There are days where it can be very boring though. The required readings were the longest, driest readings I have ever attempted and I quickly lost interest on them all. Good guy, but could make the class more enjoyable."
1079,246517,1.5,5.0,"This professor is absolutely the worst I have ever had. I took his class on semester at sea. Even though it was a mandatory class for all participants (even those who had no prior knowledge in political science), the exams covered upper level material. 100/300 people failed and he unfairly curved the failing half because he &quot;couldnt fail 100 people"
1080,246517,4.0,2.0,"There's lot of reading, but this is a pretty good class. Attendance isn't mandatory, but try to keep up with the readings. JOIN STUDY GROUPS: they will save you when it comes to the midterm and the paper. Intensity of the class really depends on the TA. Some are MUCH more intense/hard than others, but you learn more."
1081,246517,4.0,5.0,"Such a nice and happy man! His first few lectures were very captivating, but the difficulty and sheer volume of the reading really brought down my enthusiasm. I would not recommend this course for first years who have never taken a politics or international relations course. TAs make you or break you."
1082,246517,4.5,3.0,If you are interested by any means in east asian international affairs then this is a great class to take.  There is a lot of reading but Schoppa does a good job in conveying course material and is a good lecturer.  I knew quite a bit before coming into the class but I learned so much more.  I really enjoyed the class.
1083,246517,4.5,2.0,i've never seen a happier man. expects students to participate (i took a class w/ about 20 some people). he's very helpful and interested in your success in his class. assignments were not difficult for a grad level class. big assignment is a paper which you have the whole semester to do--the final was take home.
1084,246517,4.0,3.0,Grades seem very arbitrary - picked out of a hat almost.
1085,246517,5.0,3.0,"I liked how to tried to present a balanced view. He is a liberal/constructivist, but at least he makes an honest *attempt* to be fair to the realist views in his lectures and gives them merits as well."
1086,246517,3.5,2.0,Lots and lots of reading for a 200 level class but depends entirely on your TA. Powerpoint slides are pretty important and lectures are pretty clear.
1087,246517,4.5,4.0,"Very interesting course material, but lots of variation in lectures.  UK, France and Brazil sections are great, but China and Japan (especially Japan) get pretty boring, mostly because Schoppa is a Japan specialist and dives into minutae.  All in all, however, a very worthwhile course."
1088,246517,2.5,4.0,"DO NOT take this class, especially if you have no background. Taught like a 400 level, readings are too hard, monotone, boring lectures, exams are too hard for material concepts. TA's are good. This class will lower your GPA b/c grading is Tough."
1089,246517,5.0,2.0,"I really liked this class. Yes, it's a 101, so a lot of material is covered, but he does a good job of blending theory and information. His style of lecture can be a little awkward. At least he's clear, and the material is awesome."
1090,246517,3.0,4.0,Schoppa is very monotone and sometimes i get lost in his words because he doesnt seem to be excited about his subject matter.  He is very lively but I wouldnt recommend taking this course if you dont have an undying love for politics.
1091,246517,4.5,4.0,"Schoppa does a great job of making the class interesting and delves deep into the countries we discuss.  The only problem is that the tests are not graded loosely at ALL like one would think a 100 level course would, and there is not grade adjustment at the end, making one wonder WHY&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;"
1092,246517,4.0,2.0,"It's a 101. The material is basic, dense, and somewhat topical. Weekly readings for section are more interesting. Schoppa does his best wiht this intro course. 15 pg paper wipes out 2nd writing req. pretty easily. Exam/paper/grading isn't bad if you know your TA, he/she is grading you, duh."
1093,246517,2.0,4.0,What should have been an interesting lecture comparing government and institutions was turned into a complete disaster. The tests are too hard for a 101 level course. The midterm average was below 80 and there is no grade adjustment.
1094,246517,4.0,3.0,"the teacher is not very lively but knows his subject. it's a very intersting class if you love international politics. the exams are not so bad and TAs (at least shebnem ) are always available. by the way, there is a 15pages minimum term paper."
1095,246517,4.5,3.0,"The material was really interesting, and he did a good job of presenting it clearly. I liked this class a lot! There is a good amount of writing, but nothing you can't handle."
1096,246517,4.0,4.0,"He's not the most lively of professors, but he presents things really clearly.  This does fulfill the second writing requirement, so there's a 15 page paper.  Exams weren't too difficult.  Basically, this will be hell for you if you don't like politics, but I really liked the class."
1097,246517,2.5,4.0,"The material was interesting but the professor was not. He seems to think this is not a 101 but a 400 level by the work he assigns, completely not congruent to the level of the course. The 15 page research paper was ridiculous and TAs too hard."
1098,246517,3.5,3.0,The class is still interesting even though professor Schoppa may not be the most enthusiastic.  He still does a good job explaining the material.  Really the only compalint is that a 15 page research paper is a little much for a 101 level course.
1099,246517,2.0,4.0,"Schoppa manages to take an interesting subject like comparative politics and turn it into a bore with his lecture style. Also, the tests are graded fairly strictly, and a 15-page term paper is assigned for the end of the semester."

1101,2597624,5.0,2.0,"Easy class. This is pretty much just an architectural/art history course, so don't expect to learn much about urban planning. Professor Sewell is passionate about the material and really kind. Skim the readings for the first couple of weeks and don't bother with them after that."
1102,1565433,5.0,2.0,"Francesco is the best professor I have had at UVA. He reminded me why I love math. I would recommend him to anyone, no matter how slight your interest in math, because he will explain the topic well and do everything in his power to help you understand. He's a great guy."
1103,1565433,4.5,3.0,"I loved Matucci. Math is dry, but he's a funny little guy; you can't help but to like him. He goes kind of fast to get through everything and is sometimes unclear, but if you ask/go to office hours, he goes over it until you understand which is nice."
1104,1778426,5.0,2.0,He ROCKS! Michael is easily my favorite TA I have ever had. You have to do the work and participate in discussion but he makes you want to. He loves what he's talking about and explains topics you don't understand in a really easy way. Plus he's funny and super interesting. HE IS THE BEST
1105,1778426,5.0,3.0,"The epitome of passionate; this professor is well spoken, energetic and intelligent. His discussions are stimulating so make sure you read the material! Clever and kind- I'd definitely suggest his course!"
1106,1778426,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. Clear, always answers questions and makes sure you got it. Fair grader. Cherry on top: he's really handsome."
1107,1778426,5.0,2.0,He's basically THE BOSS. be sure to do the readings and take notes in order to participate in discussion. fair grader. has a sense of humor which is a plus.
1108,295680,4.5,1.0,"I thought his COLA was by far the easiest class I've had at UVA so far. Just a 6 page paper as a final and you were good to go. There were only about 4 to 5 actual lectures where he'd actually lecture, the rest were basically guest speakers. He's a great advisor and is ready to help anytime."
1109,295680,5.0,3.0,"I love Professor Burnett! He manages to make organic chemistry interesting and manageable. Everyone told me beforehand that I should be afraid of organic chemistry, but he manages to make the course interactive. He is by far and away one of the most dedicated professors I have ever had, and he genuinely seems to care about his students."
1110,295680,2.5,4.0,"The only negative thing that I can say to expect upon taking the lab is the grading scale. My TA even described it as unfair, but that she had to follow it anyway. There is no room for mistakes, and even when you don't make one, they will create one anyway. This class inspired me to take all other Chemistry elsewhere."
1111,295680,5.0,3.0,I love Dr. B!
1112,295680,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Burnett treats it like it is: you learn the stuff and your fine, if not, that's fine too.  Class is NOT required. I really appreciated his straightforward style and how he didn't take it personally that I seldom went to class but still did well. When I did go, I found his lectures spot on."
1113,295680,3.5,5.0,"One of the nicest and friendliest professors I have met at the University. Although his teaching style may be difficult to grasp, he ensures that students understand the material...but you first must seek the help and Professor Burnett ensures that you receive it once you do. Genuinely cares for students' success."
1114,295680,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Burnett is honestly one of the best professors I have ever had. His teaching style really works over the long term - at first you may be confused, but the tests are clear and after a while you realize that he's really made you LEARN orgo. He's also one of the kindest and most caring professors I've ever had. Wish there were more like him."
1115,295680,3.5,4.0,"Burnett talks quickly, but he is very friendly and the tests are almost always clear. At the beginning of first semester, I was lost and would have rated the class poor, but I actually think organic chemistry is somewhat interesting now!"
1116,295680,5.0,4.0,"Burnett is great, he goes more than the extra mile in caring about and helping each student, he really is the nicest and funniest professor."
1117,295680,4.5,3.0,"Well, SOMEBODY had to give the guy a chili pepper.  He's great!"
1118,295680,4.5,3.0,Burnett is wonderful and SO nice and helpful- always available and will do anything to be flexible and help you out as long as you are attending class and putting forth a good effort.
1119,295680,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Burnett is an amazing professor.  His dedication to teaching is evident in everything he does.  He is demanding, but will help you in any way he can to better understand the material.  I would highly recommend taking orgo with him!"
1120,295680,4.0,3.0,Professor Burnett is the best professor I've had at U.V.A. I hate organic chemistry but Burnett simplifies things and teaches them at a human level. I had to do a lot of work to get an A but the fact that an A in orgo was possible speaks for Burnett's talent. He loves his students more than anyone I've seen. Take Burnett.
1121,295680,4.0,4.0,"I am not really good at organic chemistry, but Professor Burnett is the best of the bunch.  He gives lecture notes, some homework sets, and somewhat weekly quizzes.  That helped in keeping me on top of things, but do the practice tests and suggested problems from the book."
1122,295680,5.0,3.0,"There's not much I can add. I really don't like orgo, but Prof. Burnett is the best you'll get, and probably one of the best professors at UVA. One suggestion: don't just rely on the notes he gives you -- I did that in studying for one test and got a D. Use the book too."
1123,295680,4.5,3.0,"I've never written one of these, but considering the care Professor Burnett put into his teaching to ensure that I understood a topic so difficult as organic chemistry, this is the least I should do. He's an unbelievable teacher - the kind you hope to have (but rarely do) in college. Do whatever you can to get into his class - you'll be pleased!!!"
1124,295680,5.0,1.0,Professor Burnett is perhaps the best professor at UVA.  Truly cares about his students both in and out of the classroom. By far the best to take Organic Chem with.
1125,295680,5.0,4.0,"A great professor, and a great guy.  Funny, dedicated, thoughtful, very understanding and helpful. Wouldn't have survived organic chemistry without him."
1126,295680,3.0,4.0,Burnett is amazing. If you don't have him for orgo you ARE missing out. There is a lot of material but it is not that hard. The test are straight forward but I would recommend studying days in advance. Burnett makes the class worthwhile though. He cares about his students and in turn you come to REALLY care about him. A crush&#63;&#63; maybe :)
1127,295680,5.0,2.0,"This guy is brilliant! He loves his students and actually will talk to them outside of class. He has great notes that he posts before class for you to follow. The homework and quizzes are a quick and an easy A. The tests are fair and as long as you do the work (hw, quizzes, practice problems) you will do fine. I even got an A+ in the class."
1128,295680,5.0,3.0,"professor burnett is great!! he is definitely the best orgo teacher at UVA. he is an awesome teacher who clearly has a passion for what he is doing, also he is very concerned about his students!"
1129,295680,5.0,3.0,Professor Burnett is a fabulous teacher. It's really fortunate that he's teaching because a lot of top universities don't allow great researchers to do so. It's a testament to UVA's greatness  that providing the best possible education to their undergraduates is a top priority. Allowing Professor Burnett to teach clearly reflects this desire.
1130,295680,4.5,3.0,"By far the best orgo professor EVER!!! He is very clear and tells exactly what he is looking for. He is not the type to try and trick you and will do anything to help you understand the material better. He memorizes the names of every single person in his class (about 100 students) and before I even had met him, he called me by name. He's Great!"
1131,295680,4.5,2.0,Professor Burnett went out of his way to make sure every student had the resources he or she needed to understand and do well in organic chemistry.  Anyone who did not do well really did not put in the time that the course demanded.  He also went out of his way to secure a job for me next semester.
1132,295680,5.0,4.0,"Basically, Dr. Burnett is the magnanimous man. I have yet to meet a teacher that cares more for his students. On top of that, he is an excellent teacher. Dr. Burnett made Organic Chemistry very tolerable (still tough to say fun) by being a clear communicator, funny, charismatic, and informative. He's an excellent teacher and an even better man."
1133,295680,4.5,4.0,"Professor Burnett really cares about his students. He wants you to do well--he's not the kind of person who tries to trick you either. Despite all that, Organic chemistry is hard and you will have to try, really hard. The nice part is, you're fairly evaluated and you have a great teacher, and that's pretty motivating."
1134,295680,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Burnett is hands down the best professor I've ever had. He taught a lecture of about 150 students, yet knew every student's name. He is helpful and breaks down all the concepts into simple ideas that are easy to understand. If you ever take organic chemistry at UVa make sure you have Dr. Burnett. You'll do great on the MCATs."
1135,295680,5.0,2.0,It is easy to see that he enjoys what he does.
1136,295680,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Burnett is one of the kindest, most caring professors I've ever had. I enjoyed his class much more than other classes with more interesting material just because he is so great. I highly recommend him."
1137,295680,4.5,4.0,"So helpful and kind!  Very easy to talk to and very interested in helping his students as much as he can.  If you have to take Organic Chemistry, he's a great professor to have."
1138,295680,5.0,3.0,"Burnett is by far the best professor I've had at UVa. He is passionate about teaching and wants students to really understand the material. I started the semester dreading orgo, but I'll admit that it is actually my favorite class, largely because of him. Fantastic professor!"
1139,295680,5.0,4.0,"The trend of the comments on this site speaks for itself. Dr. Burnett is fantastic and you couldn't ask for a better experience in orgo.  If you're taking orgo, take it with him"
1140,295680,4.5,3.0,Burnett is a great guy. He makes an otherwise boring subject rather interesting and tolerable and will do anything to be available and give the students all the help they need.
1141,295680,5.0,3.0,"Professor Burnett is the best teacher I have had at UVA thus far. He takes a genuine interest in his students, and makes a very intimidating subject matter manageable. He is always willing to help his students do the best they can and is so friendly and understanding. Thanks for being the best, Professor Burnett!!"
1142,295680,5.0,5.0,I agree w/ 6/28 down there.  Burnett made an intimidating + challenging course not only manageable but interesting. Wonderful and dedicated teacher.  Do what he says + you will get an A no problem.Talk to him if you are ever confused b/c he is very approachable and will find a way to get you to understand the material no matter how lost you are.
1143,295680,5.0,5.0,"Great professor. Crystal clear explanation. If you want to do well in this class and are willing to put in the time, it is possible. No NMR!"
1144,295680,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Burnett, I hope you read this. You are one of the few professors at UVa who has a genuine interest in students. You are kind, intelligent (brilliant), helpful, and charismatic. You took the time to address the thoughts and fears we all had on the first day of class and at times throughout the semester. You are a true professor. NEVER CHANGE."
1145,295680,5.0,2.0,Burnett is the man!  He and his other brother Darrel are pretty funny.  He actually cares about teaching students and not about simply ranking them.
1146,295680,4.5,3.0,"One of the best professors at UVA, hands down. I never write reviews, but his teaching impact on me compels me to let others know how great of a teacher he is! Makes hard concepts understandable, but like others have said, you'll have to work hard to do well. Take him if you can!"
1147,295680,4.0,4.0,Dr. Burnett is an excellent teacher and always willing to help his students. He wants you to succeed and will work with you to make sure you can.  He makes organic chemistry manageable and even enjoyable. I would recommend him to all premeds.
1148,295680,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Burnett is the man.  He's extremely helpful, there's no curve or normalization in his class so you don't have to worry about other competing pre-meds. He wants everyone to do well and makes the course as fair as possible. It's an Orgo course so obviously its gonna be tough no matter what, but if there's anyone I'd take it with, its Dr. Burnett."
1149,295680,4.0,3.0,Great teacher!  Extremely helpful and always takes time to answer any questions.
1150,295680,4.5,2.0,"Professor Burnett is fantastic.  He teaches organic chemistry for content mastery, not to weed students out of an already difficult program.  He loves his students and loves teaching.  Sometimes a bit confusing, but great nonetheless"
1151,295680,4.5,2.0,Approachable. Do the textbook problems and you will be successful.
1152,295680,4.5,1.0,"Professor Burnett is one of the most dedicated teachers I know.  He mumbles a bit, and occasionally can be a little confusing, but most of the time he is really very good, especially at explaining hard concepts.  He does a good job of providing a solid foundation in orgo.  Easy-to-fair exams. Extremely approachable, helpful, and highly recommended."
1153,295680,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Burnett takes difficult concepts in Organic Chemistry and makes them easier to learn and more enjoyable than they otherwise would be. He prepares you well for exams but make no mistake- you WILL have to work hard to do well in his class. Highly recommended based on his knowledge level, enthusiasm for the material, and approachability."
1154,295680,4.5,1.0,"He is extremely approachable--go to his office hours.  He sometimes goes into too little detail in lecture.  Most probable reason for popularity is the ease of his exams.  Hard work can and will earn you an A.  All in all, recommend Gerrans for a true orgo experience, but recommend Burnett for the good time."
1155,295680,5.0,4.0,"Professor Burnett is one of the best professors at UVA, because he makes a really difficult subject funny and easy to learn. He has a really good grasp of what is important to remember and what's not. His class is the only orgo class you should consider."
1156,295680,4.5,2.0,"Professor Burnett has an amazing ability of knowing the names of ALL!! of his students, even if they have never talked to him! This is just one small way he shows how much he cares about his students. The material was tough, but he really breaks it down in an easy to follow note packet, which by the way he handwrote himself.. Great Professor!"
1157,295680,4.0,2.0,Gives great lectures. Very helpful in office hours and very approachable. Would love to see more professors like him at UVA
1158,295680,5.0,2.0,He takes a hard subject and makes it easy to follow. His dedication to his students is unparalleled. You must take him for something.
1159,295680,4.5,3.0,"This class is a little tough because there is a lot of information to learn, but Professor Burnett makes it the best that it can possibly be. He loves the sbuject, so he makes the class fun and interesting. He is extremely helpful, always prepares us for the exams, and is very concerned about our progress."
1160,295680,5.0,3.0,The most dedicated teacher at UVA. All material is taught clearly. He teaches the important stuff and provides a great foundation for future tests (MCAT). Must take his class!!!
1161,295680,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher and a great guy. Is very approachable. He is always willing to help his students. He gives you quizzes and homework, but these help you do well on his exams. He teaches the big picture and lets you figure out the small detail on your own."
1162,295680,5.0,3.0,Professor Burnett is awesome! He is extremely helpful and really cares about his students. He is definately the best orgo teacher at UVa. Do the hw problems b/c a lot of the same questions come up on tests and quizzes.
1163,295680,4.5,3.0,"I cannot imagine that organic chemistry could get any better.  Dr. Burnett is a great professor, he always willing to help, he is extrememly laid back, and he truly want the best for his students.  I highly recommend him."
1164,295680,5.0,2.0,"No questions, he is probably the best chemistry teacher I have had. His tests aren't a &quot;memorize and you'll ace it&quot; kind of thing. He wants to make you think a little. Tons of help is available if you need it, and his problem sessions are very helpful as well.Weekly quizzes and homework. DO THE OPTIONAL PROBLEMS, they help immensely"
1165,295680,4.5,3.0,"Wonderful professor who really does want you to understand the material and do well in the class. His tests are fair if you do the assigned reading and practice problems. Also, his office hours and one-on-one help is invaluable!"
1166,295680,5.0,2.0,"Professor Burnett is by far the best Organic Chemistry teacher at UVA. Definitely choose him, if not Gerrans is not a bad choice either. Both are excellent, but if you have a choice-- Burnett is your man."
1167,295680,5.0,4.0,Professor Burnett is amazing!! He's funny and extremely helpful. There are weekly quizzes and the tests are 50% from the hw. He has multiple office hours and will change grades if you present a good arguement. Definitely the best orgo teacher.
1168,295680,5.0,2.0,excellent
1169,295680,4.5,3.0,"I heard great things about Dr. Burnett before I took the class, and my experience exceeded my expectations. Utilize his office hours and recitations and do his suggested problems while he is on that particular chapter. Remember, orgo is tough, and his tests aren't easy, but they are fair. He wants to see you do well!"
1170,295680,4.5,3.0,"Professor Burnett is amazing!!! Any pre-med student knows that Orgo is tough, but Burnette makes it enjoyable and possible. He actually cares about your grade and understanding, so if you need it he will meet with you. But don't think he's a push over, because he can get fiesty if he wants....TAKE BURNETT!!!!"
1171,295680,5.0,2.0,"Hands down, one of the best professor’s I’ve had here."
1172,295680,4.5,3.0,"Professor Burnett is hands down the best professor I've ever had for a science course! He hands out notes so that you only have to listen during lecture. There is weekly homework & quizzes but they only help you learn the material for the test.  Tests are challenging, but very fair. Take the time to do the weekly work; it's well worth your time"
1173,295680,5.0,3.0,Best professor I've had so far.  He is very clear and always available for help if you do not understand something.  He is also very fair and really cares about his students.  Would recommend him to anyone who really wants to learn and do well.
1174,295680,5.0,3.0,"Burnett is the best chemistry professor, no contest. He has several TAs who all have office hours on top of his office hours on top of several recitation sessions (not required) each week. He gives you his notes so all you have to do in class is listen and make sure you understand. There is weekly hw and quizzes along w/ 2 exams. He is amazing."
1175,295680,4.5,3.0,"He is a very nice guy and just wants you to do well. He doesn't try to trick you. His tests are from the book. Basically, he knows that people learn differently so that if you don't go to lecture or whatever, you're not in trouble (at least in this class), and you can learn organic chem. from the book. He's very fair and practical and a NICE guy."
1176,295680,4.0,3.0,"The lectures were fairly clear, with a few notable exceptions, and the tests covered only materal gone over in class. He was fairly difficult to get ahold of during his office hours, but usually, eventually, show up. The grading was fair, and if it wasn't he was willing to discuss it."
1177,295680,3.5,2.0,"like early class time 0800s and 0900s....very helpful in person with class and advising for majors. tests are reasonable, and are easy if you have just studied enough"
1178,295680,4.5,2.0,"Very good teacher. Helpful. Test are challenging but fair. Must know the material. Lectures are interesting, not much homework. Most of grade is in tests and final. Overall: Loved him!!!"
1179,295680,4.0,5.0,"Fast talking new-yorker but he is very willing to help. Overall I think he is one of the best orgo professors compared to what my friends say of the others. Great guy, I recommend him."
1180,295680,5.0,1.0,his class is so easy.. i got an A+
1181,295680,1.0,5.0,"Semester grades were curved DOWN, not UP."
1182,295680,4.0,2.0,"When he does lecture, its quick 25 min max and usually throws in a few jokes. The lab itself is annoying but not that hard."
1183,295680,1.0,4.0,Professor is IMPOSSIBLE to reach by ANY means.  Doesn't care about students (never visits any of the labs).  The grading criteria is very high schoolish and is mostly all or nothing.  Lab manual is extremely unclear (but its not his fault).
1184,295680,4.0,3.0,"Since Prof Burnett only lectured twice all semester, its better to describe the class itself (really nice guy though).  The lab is impossible because it is based on the quality of results, but there'a a curve.  Easy compared to other lab classes."
1185,1221381,1.0,3.0,"Professor Uzzell is one of the most troublesome individuals I have encountered in my academic career. Not only does she give harsh, critical feedback, but purely on an ideological basis rather than a structured one. I believe there is a fine line between constructive criticism and ad hominem, baseless attacks. Would not recommend."
1186,1221381,5.0,3.0,Absolutely amazing professor. Professor Uzzell is a fantastic lecturer who will make you will leave each class feeling smarter than when you entered. BY FAR the best professor I have ever had.
1187,1221381,3.0,4.0,"Professor Uzzell made an introductory course miserable and difficult. Her expectations surpassed what was expected fo typical introductory students to the subject, which often left students disinterested and unmotivated. Very displeased with the way this course was taught."
1188,1221381,2.0,5.0,"For context, POL 100 is an intro-level government class. Professor Uzzell was an incredibly hard grader and expected students to write papers as if they had her level of understanding. She does give substantial comments on rough drafts but they are harsh and often condescending. Coursework is heavy. Not pleased with my decision to take this class."
1189,1221381,5.0,4.0,Professor Uzzell is great. You read a ton for each class but the discussions are incredibly valuable. The class size is small which allows for you to really get to know her and the rest of your classmates.
1190,1221381,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Uzzell is an great teacher. She had a way of making a potentially boring subject (&quot;American Political Tradition&quot;) very interesting and engaging through in-class discussion and activities. She  is an excellent lecturer, and is very helpful with essay comments and feedback. You WILL have to do all the readings, or risk making a fool of yourself."
1191,1221381,4.0,5.0,"A very interesting class that requires a lot of thought and a fair bit of reading. I got a lot out of it--it aided in my understanding American Politics and I thought the paper topics provoked thought. She's harsh on papers, so support your argument, and reading is pretty crucial for the actual discussion."
1192,525073,4.0,3.0,He's smart and pretty damn funny sometimes.  The stuff he talks about goes outside the class and can be useful for real life and writing for other subjects. He's the man
1193,525073,4.0,2.0,"I took ENWR 1510 in the 2009 Fall semester. Mr. Lawson is a great teacher. His office hours are helpful and he's funny in class. He is interested in what he is teaching and makes the class interesting. He may come off as being awkward at some times, but once the year begins, he is really cool. He is only a grad student, but he is a great teacher."
1194,525073,4.5,3.0,Go to office hours and he WILL help you become a better writer. He is a very enthusiastic teacher and it was a good course.
1195,525073,2.0,4.0,No Comments
1196,525073,3.0,3.0,"Lawson wants to help you.  He is a student of writing, himself and loves to see you take an interest.  If you go to his office hours often your grade will be gold, and you might even learn a thing or two.  Take this class"
1197,525073,4.0,2.0,He is a really nice guy and very helpful. He also does not take things too serious.
1198,525073,5.0,2.0,Lawson teaches an interesting class and is extremely helpful when you talk to him outside of class.
1199,525073,2.0,2.0,"material blows. makes you feel like your in 8th grade. he tries though, occasionally slpis in a joke. although sometimes theyre awkwardly unfunny. the class wanders is random directions sometimes that can bore the hell out of you. its not hard if you find a reason to give a****."
1200,525073,5.0,2.0,"he dresses cool, original gangsta"
1201,525073,5.0,3.0,This guy is amazing! He's a grad student and he's asolutely adorable! He's super helpful and easy going and cracks random jokes in class. If you don't like your first draft he'll let you re-do the entire thing and help you with it. Definitely take his class!
1202,1655571,5.0,2.0,"Excellent. Ms Wohlafka has an AAA+ attitude. With the notes she prepares before class, her lessons are organized, clear, and she is always 100% prepared for lessons."
1203,2147094,5.0,2.0,"Lisa is one of the best professors out there. She wants students to understand the material, so many of her papers are reflective. She is extremely knowledgeable and passionate, and very approachable."
1204,2147094,5.0,2.0,"Lisa is one of the best professors in the WGS department. She is so funny but it's also clear that she holds vast knowledge and passion for her subject. She fosters fascinating discussion, treats her students as her equals, and requires very little work in order to do well. She just wants you to be present and provoked, and to respond."
1205,2147094,4.0,1.0,One of the best professors I've ever had! Cares so much about what she's teaching and knows a ton. As long as you turn in the few easy essays and go to class you should get an A. No tests.
1206,1786651,3.0,4.0,"Carrie's sweet, her homework is not. My main issue with this course is how much busy work there was. Very time consuming homework assigned everyday but it's online so you can go back and touch it up before she sees. Tests aren't tricky, she posts multiple kinds of study guides on collab but doesn't really advertise them. Definitely utilize those!"
1207,1786651,3.5,3.0,"Carrie is very nice and approachable. In office hours, you are not required to speak Spanish. She is very enthusiastic, and though I did not enjoy learning Spanish, she was a pleasure to have as a professor."
1208,1786651,5.0,1.0,I had Carrie for both SPAN 2010 and 2020 and i can honestly say she is one of the nicest professors i have met. She really enjoys what she does and really wants you to succeed as well. I highly recommend taking any spanish class with her.
1209,1786651,5.0,2.0,Bramlet is awesome. She teaches with a lot of enthusiasm and makes the class go by pretty quickly. Not a tough grader and very easy to talk to. Definitely recommend her for spanish
1210,1786651,4.5,1.0,Bramlet's love of Spanish is contagious! She wants everyone to succeed and grow in both their writing and speaking skills.  The tests are insanely easy if you study the material and do the practice test on Collab.  Take this class!!!!
1211,2335514,5.0,4.0,"Huang Laoshi is the best professor ever. He really cares about each and every student and wants everyone to succeed. Chinese is difficult to learn but Huang Laoshi makes it really fun. The workload might be tough, but it is worth it to be able to take his class."
1212,385827,4.5,2.0,"She was an awesome professor. Her office hours were very helpful and she explained the material very well. She gave iclicker extra credit for the exams, which was very nice. I would recommend her class. Because of her I decided I wanted to be a psych major!"
1213,385827,5.0,2.0,"Loved the class, she is very outgoing and engaging.  Posts lectures online before the class so that as she is talking you can take more detailed notes that help with the exams.  I would recommend this class and her for any other classes!"
1214,385827,5.0,2.0,"She is a a great teacher.  One of the best I have ever had. I had no interest in psychology before I took her class, and I would honestly take another.  There are 3 tests and a final.  She drops the lowest test grade.  You get a free 100 test grade if you go to class and use your clicker.  Just read the book and go to class, you will be fine."
1215,385827,4.5,3.0,"Very helpful when you need help. The textbook is so dull... why did she pick this one&#63;&#63; Explains the theories clearly. Lecture is kind of dry, but she has a clinic when she's not teaching, so it's great to hear a therapist's point of view, especially when learning about therapy. Very kind, and has fairly easy midterms, but a super hard final."
1216,385827,3.5,2.0,Lectures are a bit boring but the topics are really interesting. There is a lot of reading assigned in this class but not all is crucial. Tests are not that hard if you understand the topic and you are able to APPLY it. Reviews given by the TAs are unnecessary. Try to go to class to get the iclicker points and read before exams and you'll do fine.
1217,385827,1.0,5.0,"Worst prof i had at UVA. very very boring lectures. Test are about on par with psych program. Study a little, get a B."
1218,385827,2.0,2.0,"This subject is probably not what you think it is! It sounded interesting to me but was mind-numbingly boring. To her credit, Llewellyn is VERY fair, and it isn't hard to get an A in her class (by studying the powerpoints and using the book only to clarify certain theories). But the class truly is painful to sit through just to get clicker points."
1219,385827,4.5,4.0,"She tests on her lecture and the book, sometimes using small details, but she is willing to throw out questions if enough people get them wrong.  She talks like she is in her profession, as a psychologist, soothing, and to help explain she will give examples or act.  She takes questions during class, offers a little extra credit for those with a D+"
1220,385827,3.0,2.0,She's nice and her class is easy but very hard to sit through to the end.  This has got to be one of the most boring classes I've ever taken at UVA.  I was really interested in personality psyc at first- way to suck the life out of the subject.
1221,385827,5.0,4.0,it was one of the best courses that I've taken at Uva. I think psyc majors should take psyc 240 from mrs llewellyn before taking psyc 101. i highly recommend it. her lectures are very clear
1222,385827,4.0,4.0,"This class is NOT as easy as people make it sound. It is a hard class and you DO need to attend class, becasue there are questions on the tests about what was discussed on lecture. THE TA Joanna Chango was terrible. She was the worst and did nto know what she was doing at all! There is no point in going to the review session!"
1223,385827,4.5,2.0,This was one of the best courses I've taken at UVa.  It was small and extremely interesting.  I'm pretty sure everyone in the class got an A too. She's fantastic in a small setting!
1224,385827,3.5,1.0,"Very easy class, the lectures are a little boring as they come straight from the powerpoints which you can find online.  Tests are pretty straight forward just make sure to go over the powerpoints"
1225,385827,1.0,1.0,"Yes shes nice...but runs a horrible class, Easy to get good grades...not so easy to stop yourself from wanting scream during lectures.  Poor lectures, worse text and she refuses to post past exams online.  Terrible class, do not take it if shes teaching it."
1226,385827,4.0,2.0,"Good class, easy A with minimal effort. Lectures are pretty boring, she just reads off of power points that are toolkit, not too much reading, basically if you skim the reading and look over lecture slides you'll do fine. She even gives outlines on the reading..And extra credit up to 10 pts/ test (there are 3 and 1 is dropped)..Easy class"
1227,385827,4.0,1.0,"Easiest class I have yet to take at this University -- I got ABOVE a 100 on every test and exam, and put in less work than I do in any other class. With that said, only take this course if you have to, because it is insanely boring ... I mean it, be ready to fall asleep every single day. Joke. Absolute joke."
1228,385827,4.0,1.0,Great class. She's really nice and genuinely interested in the course. 2 out of 3 mc exams with mc final. Easy if you go to class and do the reading.
1229,385827,5.0,2.0,"Prof Llewellyn was a wonderful teacher. The class wasn't that difficult and she would drop questions from tests if too many people missed them. She even started doing extra credit quizzes so you could get additional points on your test. Lectures can be wordy, but they're posted. The final was cumulative so be sure to study!"
1230,385827,5.0,1.0,"Incredibly easy class; I got an A+ with pretty minimal effort. She is an impressively boring teacher. But the subject matter was interesting, and she is certainly a very nice lady who wants students to get something out of her class. The textbook was terrible, I never used it. Easy psych class if youre interested, but dont expect to be entertained."
1231,385827,4.5,1.0,"easy class. lecture was painful though - i stopped going after the first month. plus she posts her lecture notes on toolkit so theres absolutely no motivation to attend lecture. she gives extra credit quizzes often though, if you go to class. you also get to drop your lowest test out of the 3."
1232,385827,4.5,2.0,"Very easy class to get an A in.  She gives out extra credit papers, takes out questions the majority of the class missed on the test and gives you better grades, gives extra credit quizzes every class, and drops the lowest test grade. She makes the subject very interesting with her stories, and she's a very sweet lady."
1233,385827,4.0,2.0,"awesome class.  extremely easy.  gives a lot of extra credit with quizzes @ the end of class and ex. credit papers you can write if youre doing bad.  3 tests & a final, & you can drop your lowest test.  hard not to get an A if you pay attention and study a little.  very nice woman as well.  makes class interesting with her stories."
1234,385827,2.5,3.0,I found it hard to go to class and often fell aspleep when I did. Lecture notes are put on Toolkit so don't freakout if you miss lecture. Your grade comes from 3 tests and a final. The class topic is great!She seems like a really nice lady and her personal stories from being a clinical psychologist are somewhat intersting.
1235,385827,4.0,1.0,"Although it is hard to stay awake in her class, it is a good introductory psych course. It's not as interesting as it could be, but I can tell she made improvements this semester with power-point presentations and personal stories. She is very nice, and the class is extremely easy...even if it is a little boring."
1236,385827,4.0,3.0,"this class was hard to pay attention in.. she was very helpful in boosting your grade (she offers a lot of extra credit and lets you drop one test grade), but i was overall disappointed in the class"
1237,385827,3.0,2.0,No Comments
1238,385827,2.0,3.0,"She is really boring and unorganized. This was the worst psych class I've taken, social psych and child psych are a lot better. It's really hard to make yourself come to class and stay awake."
1239,385827,2.5,4.0,"I was originally interested in this class.  Her lectures, however, killed that.  Bring a pillow to class, your neck won't be so sore.  And don't bother studying for the tests they have nothing to do with what you've learned.  Enjoy."
1240,385827,3.0,4.0,"I'm sure that she's a very nice person, but this class was so hard to make myself go to.  Her statements are clear, but very boring because everything is presented on a Word document that she scrolls down.  Very disappointing class."
1241,385827,4.0,4.0,"lectures are very long and cover a lot, but if you go and pay attention they will cover almost everything on the tests and you won't have to read the textbook(which is awful)"
1242,385827,1.5,2.0,"Subject was interesting, but she killed any interest in going to class, I rarely left with any enhanced understanding. She helped to understand extraneous reading, but I basically just studied the textbook and ended up w/ an A-(one good thing: xtra credit for course eval)"
1243,385827,3.5,2.0,"True that it is boredom.  The online notes were helpful, the textbook was clear, and if you express concern she will often put a summary of the journal articles online.  She even offered extra credit for course evaluations."
1244,385827,1.0,5.0,Llewellyn is an excellent doctor.  She treated my insomnia very well.
1245,385827,4.0,3.0,"I don't find the material to be interesting at all...but the lectures are nice and easy to follow albeit a bit wordy...grades take forever to get posted even with two TAs...nice lady, however."
1246,385827,2.5,4.0,The lectures are pretty boring (hard to stay awake).  The tests are pretty difficult (focus a lot on the reading not just lecture).  She is really nice and willing to meet with you if you have trouble though.
1247,385827,3.0,3.0,"Most of the time, the lectures are very boring.  I struggle everyday just to stay awake, especially because her lecture notes are presented in word documents.  The tests are even worse- MC, but she somehow manages to make it so hard with trick questions."
1248,385827,1.5,3.0,"Her lectures are very boring. She puts the notes online, but they aren't organized. The text book is not hard to read, but the other readings are confusing and uninteresting but show up a lot on the tests. Take the class with someone else."
1249,860968,2.0,5.0,Professor Kittlesen uses slide shows during lecture but each slide is full of pictures. You have to pay attention in class because he will state an important topic for you to know and will not repeat it unless asked. Lectures are 3 times a week. The tests are very difficult and the hw questions are not similar at all to the concepts on the test. 
1250,860968,5.0,5.0,Professor Kittlesen is caring and funny. I just hated his tests. They were incredibly hard for me and they were very application based. I love him as a person and as a caring professor but his class was really difficult for me. He still gets a high rating but I would recommend not expecting an easy A.
1251,860968,3.0,4.0,"His tests are heavily based on his lectures. If you miss the lectures, you are set up to fail. He is a nice professor and if you have questions he answers. The class is mostly based on the tests (70% of your grade) and they are hard. I went to all lectures, office hours, but the tests were just hard. Homework is extensive and does not help much."
1252,860968,4.0,4.0,"Dave is a really good professor - the class material just isn't the easiest. Also, I'd recommend going to TA's office hours as opposed to his since they are less packed."
1253,860968,4.0,4.0,"Professor Kittlesen is a very caring instructor and it is obvious that he wants to do what he can to ensure his students succeed, but the exams are pretty difficult even if you attend all lectures and study a lot. I found that the best study tactic for the exams is listening to the lectures a second time through the recordings he posts."
1254,860968,4.0,3.0,"Kittlesen teaches somewhat &quot;to the test,&quot; but so as to facilitate your success in biology as a whole. He tries not to discourage you even though there's a lot of information. Also, no groupwork (besides lab), which is nice."
1255,860968,5.0,3.0,Kittlesen is the most caring professor I've ever had. He really wants to help you understand the material and is very patient with confused students. You need to put in the work for this class as it is challenging but Kittlesen really wants you to succeed.
1256,860968,1.0,3.0,"He refuses to accommodate for students, even if they have accommodations through SDAC. He does not care for his students and is unwilling to fix his grading errors. His office hours are hectic and unhelpful. If you actually enjoy biology I don't recommend taking it with him because you will learn to hate it."
1257,860968,3.0,4.0,"Professor Kittlesen is a nice guy, but his class is hard. His exams were very difficult even if you study and pay attention in class. He doesn't put any information on his slides so you have to make sure you get the information he says in class. Read the textbook and take notes."
1258,860968,4.0,4.0,"the best thing to do is record the lectures and go back to write everything down. there's no info on his slides, everything is in his lecture. never went to office hours or read the textbook, but you def should. exams aren't too difficult if you put the work in to study."
1259,860968,5.0,2.0,"Awesome lectures, he explains everything meticulously, so make sure you attend! Ask lots of questions and pay attention to the learning objectives, and you'll be fine for the tests. Also, don't forget to do the mastering bio..."
1260,860968,5.0,4.0,"Dave is wonderful! He makes biology really engaging and gives lots of information! His tests are challenging, and lectures are super important. Sometimes there are test questions that are only based on things from lecture rather than the textbook. Regardless, he is very good at teaching the material and with some extra effort, anyone can do well!"
1261,860968,4.0,4.0,"Kittlesen is a great professor, very kind, and clearly cares about his students and the subject he teaches. This bio class is definitely very hard, and you should go to lectures as much as possible to fully understand the material. Sometimes he does use very specific examples and can go a little fast during lectures, but overall great professor!"
1262,860968,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor. Best lecturer I've ever had.
1263,860968,5.0,5.0,Dr. Kittlesen was a very attentive professor! His dad jokes and witty personality made the content-heavy lectures more engaging and manageable.
1264,860968,4.0,4.0,"Kittlesen is such a kind person and an engaging lecturer. He presents info in a logical way, but it is often incomplete. For that reason READ THE TEXTBOOK before lecture, especially if you didnt take AP Bio or AP Chem (I didnt take either and felt disadvantaged.) Exams are tough as hes all about trick questions. Hard work but would recommend!"
1265,860968,5.0,3.0,"This class is pretty much an extension of AP biology so if you took that class in high school and did well, you will have an easy time in this course (highly likely to get an A). He is very understanding, approachable, and easy to talk to. You will not get tested on anything that was not in lecture (even if it shows up in textbook)."
1266,860968,3.0,4.0,"Sometimes the wording for test questions was really confusing. Make sure to really pay attention to lectures, even small examples. Sometimes lab material is on the test. If you are interested in pursuing bio, take this course... but if you are planning to take this as a &quot;fun&quot; course, I wouldn't recommend."
1267,860968,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Kittlesen really made online lectures funny and interesting, and it was obvious he put lots of effort into them (showing demonstrations, getting kids involved, etc) While he did take several measures to correct for online learning, his tests were EXTREMELY difficult, and I think in-person labs would have helped. Take notes on TXBK BEFORE lec!"
1268,860968,4.0,4.0,"Kittlesen is an awesome professor, no question. But unless you're interested in biology and ready to put a lot of time into the course material, maybe reconsider."
1269,860968,4.0,4.0,Sherpa Dave was a fun professor to learn from! He obviously cared about the material and his students. You have to go to lecture and will probably need to record them on your phone because he slides are just pictures. He has office hours three times a week - USE THEM! He will help you do well if you make the effort to reach out to him.
1270,860968,4.0,4.0,"Dave is easily the nicest professor that I have had at UVa. He was a super kind guy and was always open to having office hours. He gives office hours in a small group, and the questions asked end up recreating the lectures from the previous class. Great way to get anything clarified that you are confused about. Dave is always accessible and excited"
1271,860968,5.0,4.0,Sherpa Dave is an amazing professor that was very available outside of lectures and was always on top of providing supplemental material to help students learn. Make sure to read the textbook because it is very material heavy and he doesn't post words on his slides so you have to be sure to listen carefully or record the lectures.
1272,860968,5.0,3.0,"The way the material is presented in this class is ideal for someone with some Bio background. Dave is a really great guy, and presents material in a logical way but it is sometimes incomplete. You may need to supplement lecture with reading if you didn't take AP Bio. Keep up with lab and go to class and you'll be fine."
1273,860968,4.0,4.0,"Lots of tests and they are very specific, with lots of trick questions"
1274,860968,5.0,4.0,"WHAT AN ICONIC PROFESSOR! David Kittlesen such an engaging, kind, and qualified professor! Excellent professor, interesting lectures, fair grading, Dr. Kittlesen is my favorite professor at UVA!!!!!"
1275,860968,5.0,4.0,"Kittlesen is my favorite UVA professor, his classes are tough but he is so accessible before and after lecture and with office hours. He is hilarious and printing out his powerpoint slides before class for notes is extremely helpful. Great class, legendary professor"
1276,860968,5.0,4.0,"Prof Kittlesen is very entusiasti in terms of teaching. He knows the subject and likes to help his students. Just be patient and READ the textbook before class, will help a lot."
1277,860968,4.0,3.0,"A very engaging lecturer, makes BIOL 2100 an entertaining class. There is usually 10-25 pages of reading from the textbook and an online assignment that takes 30-60 minutes for each class. Additional studying before tests can be quite time consuming. Kittlesen is a fan of complicated/&quot;trick&quot; questions on quizzes, so assessments can be difficult."
1278,860968,3.0,4.0,Standard introductory science class. Textbook reading and lectures go hand-in-hand so in your best interest to do the reading (10 pages) before coming to class. Tests are weighted heavily at 75% and are pretty tough even while keeping up with reading. Just show up to class and do reading and you'll be OK. 1.5% extra credit from iClickers help alot
1279,860968,4.0,4.0,"Some of his lectures can be rather difficult to get through, and toward the end of the semester he can start to depart from the textbook a bit. However, his enthusiasm towards teaching is much appreciated, and he will often curve his exams upwards a couple percentage points. Additionally, he has office hours three days a week."
1280,860968,4.0,4.0,4 Tests are most of your grade. I took in the summer and found myself trying to catch up on basic chemistry concepts and therefore found it hard to keep up. Consider taking chemistry or reviewing basic chemistry on khan first. Definitely retaking.
1281,860968,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Kittlesen is really cool and tries to make lecture interesting, but he ends up talking about things unrelated to test material. The textbook is your life preserver in this class, but even if you read it from front to back, you'll still probably miss some questions on his test. This class is a typical pre-med weed out."
1282,860968,1.0,4.0,"Worst professor I have had at UVA by a long shot. It is difficult to see why people love him, because he does more to confuse students on the material than help, forcing students to learn the book thoroughly. However, he hardly follows the book late in the semester, ""teaching"" unimportant details rather than material relevant for an intro course."
1283,860968,3.0,5.0,"Very difficult class that I have ever taken. I passed, but it was so difficult. He does have interesting lectures and wants students to ask questions."
1284,860968,4.0,5.0,Great Guy with a very hard class. Makes his lectures very interesting and funny
1285,860968,3.5,3.0,"Kittlesen is a great professor!! The only thing I struggled with taking his class is the exams -- the exams are very tricky. Even if you know the materials A-Z, it is highly possible to be missing a few questions because the wording is tough. Other than that, it is an easy class. Bio lab was easy and short. Not much homework except mastering bio."
1286,860968,5.0,3.0,Dave was my favorite professor this semester. He's a GREAT lecturer and makes the material really interesting. I would say DEFINITELY read the book and attend lectures and don't belittle mastering biology assignments. Do those carefully it will help you tremendously.
1287,860968,3.0,4.0,"Kittlesen really cares about his class and his lectures are always very interesting and inspiring. That being said, his teaching style is often hard to follow, I would normally leave class with more questions than I had before. It can also be quite difficult to determine what the important parts of the class and material are. "
1288,860968,5.0,4.0,Dave is an excellent teacher and he really cares about all of his students. He is super passionate and he works very hard to make sure people are understanding the lectures and the material. He makes you truly master the material in order to get an A. For each test I studied a  week in advance on Sundays and you MUST read the textbook to get an A.
1289,860968,3.5,3.0,"Lectures are pretty optional if you've had any sort of biology class beforehand, as he usually doesn't end up covering a lot of important material during class. The tests were fair imo. He seriously needs to work on organization, however; he assigns online homework at what seems like random intervals and sends about 7 emails a day."
1290,860968,4.0,3.0,"Awesome professor! It is a tough class, but he is really into the subject matter and does a good job explaining everything overall."
1291,860968,4.0,3.0,"Very approachable. Good class. The information can get a little lost in the rest of your priorities, but office hours are a good opportunity to ask questions and get to know him. Your TA in lab can only be very helpful. "
1292,860968,4.5,2.0,Professor Kittlesen is an amazing guy.  He's passionate about what he does and is willing to help whoever needs it.  Pre class reading quizzes are tough and reading is a must.  He also will introduce topics not covered in the textbook in class and many times they appear on exams so attendance in lecture is a must (plus there are clicker questions)
1293,860968,4.0,4.0,"Dave has a great personality, and he makes biology engaging. However, make sure you read the chapters and take good notes cause the exams are HARD! He has preclasses or these ""quizzes"" to test your knowledge on the readings. He also has these extra credit opportunities with the iClickers so those helped bump up the grades. It was a weed out course."
1294,860968,4.5,4.0,"Dave is a great lecturer, very interested in the material and approachable.  His grading process is very clear and he gives a good curve on his tests (which you NEED to study for).  A bit tricky material but he explains the textbook well and is definitely available for help.  I wouldn't take it if science isn't your forte bc it is extensive work."
1295,860968,3.5,3.0,"If you need to take this class, it's actually not that bad.  Kittlesen is a really great professor and is incredibly enthusiastic about the course (so sad to not have him for second semester bio!).  He gives online assessments for each reading that you can work on with classmates, so those are nice grade boosters.  Exams can be tricky w wording."
1296,860968,4.0,4.0,"I took this class as a first semester first year, not knowing what I wanted to major in.  This class is demanding, and the tests are extremely difficult. However, Professor Kittlesen is an amazing professor and makes it all worth it! If you take this class and work as hard as you can, you will be okay (and actually learnknow bio)! "
1297,860968,2.5,5.0,"I loved Kittlesen but barely scraped by with a C. DO NOT take this class unless you need it for your major (looking at you, premed). Lectures tended to not be that useful because he would analyze some obscure case that seemed to be not very related to the textbook, which was what the content for most of the exams tested on."
1298,860968,5.0,4.0,"Kittlesen is super enthusiastic about the class, which really helps. You feel almost bad for not paying attention in class. It is a hard class, but Kittlesen was a great professor so if you are good at biology, you should be fine."
1299,860968,3.5,4.0,"Dave is really funny and engaging in lectures! He goes into more depth on the concepts covered in the textbook, so YOU MUST READ THE TEXTBOOK. And study a lot for his tests, they aren't the easiest. "
1300,860968,2.5,1.0,Kittlesen's lectures were pointless and I skipped every single one. I ended with an A for the class and went to approximately 2 lectures. HUGE curve on the tests. 
1301,860968,3.5,4.0,"Must do BEFORE Lecture: Study and understand assigned readings, then take Collab Quiz. Look over powerpoint. During Lecture: Write downrecord everything he says, regardless of if you understand it or not. It will make sense later. Both bio lecture and bio lab were reading-lecture-dependent. Don't wait until the night before the exam to study!!"
1302,860968,5.0,3.0,"This man is a great professor, simple as that. He describes everything to a great detail and makes sure students understand crucial points. Tests in this class can be tricky since they test your understanding rather than how well you memorized. However, when I didn't understand something from the reading, the lecture was sure to clear things up."
1303,860968,4.0,4.0,"Great professor! Difficult class, but if you do your readings and study you will do just fine. "
1304,860968,5.0,4.0,Dave is great. He is engaging in lecture and is always open to questions. Whether you're on the pre-med track or just looking to fill the natural science I would recommend Dave all the way. 
1305,860968,5.0,2.0,"He was FANTASTIC. There's so much information in this class but he helps you tie it all together and he makes it really interesting. I would have never ever dared to skip a class, but I also never wanted to."
1306,860968,5.0,3.0,"Read before class, make flashcards, and sit in the front rows. If you do all this, his tests aren't really that 'tricky' or hard. He's a great professor with a lot to teach you!"
1307,860968,5.0,4.0,"Amazing lecturer, but very very hard tests. Course demands complete understanding of topics addressed. Definitely a pre-med weed out course."
1308,860968,5.0,5.0,K-Money in da house!!! Kittlesenis awesome. He is genuinely interested in the subject and I get the feeling that he really enjoys his students. He is very approachable and helpful during office hours. His class is difficult and once you get used to his test you realize that he is more than fair. I have nothing bad to say  about him.
1309,860968,4.0,4.0,"Dave is a wonderful professor, who is very helpful if you seek him out. Office hours are an excellent supplement to class, because lectures are very large and seem to be a bit scattered. This class is VERY hard, but well worth the effort."
1310,860968,4.5,4.0,"After the first test, it gets hard. You MUST pay attention to the lectures; when you get into the nitty-gritty of genetics, it will be challenging. Do the reading before class or you might get lost. Anyways, I managed a C+. Not great, but I don't regret it because the information was valuable."
1311,860968,5.0,3.0,"Kittlesen is the best teacher I have ever had. I managed an A in the class and was concerned because I had not taken a bio course since 9th grade. His tests aren't easy; they demand understanding, not knowledge. The sooner you realize that the better you'll do. Challenging course. But then again, if it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you."
1312,860968,1.0,3.0,This class was awful. The book was helpful and you think that you have a good hold on the material but the test questions are incomprehensible. He does not explain things well at all.
1313,860968,4.5,4.0,"David Kittlesen is outstanding. First of all, he's an immunologist, so he's brilliant. And second, he is hysterical and makes lectures so engaging. This class certainly had difficult material, but I ended up doing well because Professor Kittlesen was so helpful and made even the driest and most challenging subjects interesting."
1314,860968,4.5,4.0,Kittlesen is one of the absolute BEST professors I have EVER had at he University of VIrginia. This man has a deep desire to actually TEACH and cares about his students. Actual teaching is a rarity in the sciences at UVA. He is encouraging. He  encourages you to think about something and figure it out yourself in office hours. LOVE KITTLESEN.
1315,860968,5.0,3.0,"Kittlesen is a brilliant professor. His lectures tie concepts to practical application. Take good notes in class, read the book, and go to office hours. The test focuses on applying your knowledge, so memorizing won't help, Some test questions come from the textbook, so you have to read. You'll actually feel like you learned biology."
1316,860968,5.0,3.0,"First worthwhile class I've taken at UVA.  Kittlesen keeps class interesting and clearly has a passion for what he's doing.  Tests are hard, and require applying knowledge to new situations but his curves are generous.  Read, understand the book, and go to lecture and a B or higher isn't too difficult."
1317,860968,3.5,3.0,"honestly kittlesen is a great bio teacher but its premed bio- not made to be easy and its not.  gotta go to class and take good notes.  gotta read the book but even then at least 30% of test q's are based on pure analysis.  make sure you understand this stuff, as memorizing just wont cut it."
1318,860968,5.0,2.0,"Dave is a legend. He's a brilliant man who makes class fun with his classic examples, anecdotes, and sidecracks. He's very helpful and I'd recommend his class to anyone who finds Biology interesting! There is a lot of hard work involved, but it's good to know that you have someone like Dave to help you along the way!."
1319,860968,3.5,5.0,"Toughest class I ever took, but it was worthwhile. STUDY for the exams a week ahead. GO to class everyday. DO the readings. DON'T memorize and think you're gonna get away with it. REALLY make sure to grasp the concepts. Class gets exponentially harder. It's doable. Don't fret if you don't get an A or A-. I barely managed an A-. It's UVA."
1320,860968,4.5,4.0,I love kittlesen.  he is the most interesting teacher i have ever had in my life.  i highly recommend this class.
1321,860968,1.5,5.0,"Kittlesen is so hard and his lectures are very unorganized. Sometimes he is cool, but his tests are very difficult and hard to study for. He tests you on how well you can take tricky exams and not on whether you know the material. I know it is a big class, but really the average of the class should not be like a C."
1322,860968,2.0,5.0,"This was the most DIFFICULT class I've taken as a 1st year. I haven't taken bio since 9th grade, so that didn't help. Dr. Kittlesen is a great human being, funny and caring. BUT his exams are extremely hard and tricky. You truly have to understand the material like the back of your hand, no lie, unless you're already apt at bio. Received a D."
1323,860968,3.5,5.0,"this class is hard. if you want to be successful, read all the assigned chapters, go to lecture, take good notes (it might help if you record his lectures) and the read the chapters again. iclickers make attending class mandatory. don't get behind on the readings. it's a pain having to catch up and lectures don't make any sense."
1324,860968,5.0,3.0,Kittlesen is just awesome. Most biology teachers are not as interesting but Kittlesen is. Most likely (and easily) the best professor in undergrad bio.
1325,860968,4.0,4.0,"Attendance is a MUST. Reading the textbook is also important if you want to get an A. He's one of my favorite professors. Take a class with Kittlesen if you can! The tests do require more than rote memorization, but I think that's how classes should be."
1326,860968,5.0,4.0,The greatest professor I've had so far at uva.  It's unbelievable how intelligent this guy is.  What a legend.
1327,860968,5.0,4.0,"The best professor at UVa in my opinion: he's always willing to talk to students, emphasizes understanding rather than memorization, and is a amazing lecturer. Immunology was an fascinating class, the material was advanced and the tests were challenging, but definitely manageable. Take one of his classes if at all possible."
1328,860968,5.0,5.0,"Immunology is very interesting but very hard. Kittlesen is incredible, though! He knows that the material is tough and tries his best to help everyone understand. He also tests you on your deep understanding of concepts rather than straight memorization- makes it harder, but it is more worth it in the long run."
1329,860968,3.5,5.0,"Kittlesen is so dedicated to Biology, but for me, his test were very tough, we had to understand deeply. And the questions were very specific. I did not get good grades on this class."
1330,860968,4.0,5.0,"Kittlesen is an amazing teacher. He is delicated to his subject and makes his class very interesting. One fallback is that his tests are impossible! Reading the text, and coming to classes is NOT enough. You should really connect everything together and get the big picture."
1331,860968,2.0,5.0,His tests are terrible. After the first test you'll question where to even begin studying. Attend class or you'll never have the information you need. He puts way to much emphasis on random topics and makes an intro bio class the hardest/worst class I've taken at UVA
1332,860968,3.0,5.0,"His tests are not easy; you really need to understand the material. Lectures and readings aren't particularly helpful. I found Kittlesen to be an entertaining teacher, but the class was way too difficult for a lab section."
1333,860968,3.5,3.0,"Kittlesen's weekly lab lectures weren't enough to cover the things that we were tested on; they were just basic overviews.  Weekly work consists of attending the lab lecture and answering the clicker questions, notebook prep, lab manual questions, and actual lab work.  The lab itself is fun, but the tests were hard.  Know how to apply concepts!"
1334,860968,3.0,4.0,It was the standard intro bio class with the usual powerpoint slides.  Lectures were easy to follow if you looked for the main ideas and not get lost in the many somewhat useless details.  Kittlesen has really tricky tests.  Going to office hours helps if you don't get bogged down in the confused chaos of other students' questions.
1335,860968,4.5,3.0,"Really a stickler about grades -- 89.495 = a B+ (trust me, I know) and he's the only professor I've had that offers an extra test only if you had a legit excuse to miss another one. (Its not a makeup -- he gives you a comprehensive final, which others don't take.) Great guy though. Lectures are fast but interesting if you can keep up (not easy)."
1336,860968,3.5,2.0,"Lectures can be boring, but he relies heavily on the textbook.  I did the readings in the few days before each exam and pulled out an A.  It's an introductory class though, so the curve is pretty standard.  Might be harder for non-science people.  Clicker qustions are extra credit, you get half a point just for answering."
1337,860968,2.0,5.0,he makes an introductory level biology LAB course incredibly difficult by giving an impossible midterm and final!  he doesn't want kids who were exempt from the general bio lecture course who are taking the lab and lab/lecture course to get off the hook easily!  i would absolutely never reccomend him! avoid at all costs!
1338,860968,4.0,3.0,"He's a nice guy and lectures aren't awful. His tests are tricky though. Memorization is not enough for this class, you MUST understand all of it. If you study, you can do well but you must put a lot of effort into it. Using mastering bio was helpful to get a better idea of what the test questions would be like. Final isn't cumulative which is nice."
1339,860968,4.5,1.0,"He is an enthusiastic professor who I found very approachable and entertaining.  His tests were fair and straightforward and curved rather generously. With regards to the people complaining about the tests, I'm not really sure what they were expecting."
1340,860968,2.0,4.0,Take his exams seriously if you want to pass! You might have to tailor your study habits a little bit to prepare for his exams. His exams are very tricky! Read the text or else you will be lost.
1341,860968,3.5,5.0,"His tests are ridiculously difficult even if you go to lecture and read all the chapters. He is a very entertaining and nice guy, but office hours are always full and he's pretty intimidating. I don't even have any advice on how to study for tests, because I'm still clueless. Anything is game with him... and I mean anything."
1342,860968,4.5,4.0,"Tests can be very very picky. You have to know the material inside and out. It is obvious he loves Biology, and he is very good at explaining the subject. Office hours are helpful -- he is looking to help you succeed. Advice: READ AND STUDY. You have to, or you will fail."
1343,860968,2.0,4.0,"kittleson's class is awful. mandatory attendance enforced by clicker, but the lectures aren't really helpful. lots of repetitive homework; sometimes, you'll repeat the same (very very simple) problem more than five times. for a two-credit class, you'll be working quite a bit, and all the work is either repetitive or confusing."
1344,860968,4.5,3.0,"Good teacher, very patient. Go to his office hours though you may wait for a while to get your questions anwered, because his office hours is always full of students."
1345,860968,4.5,2.0,"Very nice teacher, his lectures are interesting and he does not speak too fast. can ask questions during class. do the readings! important for the exams. Very good teacher for biology overall"
1346,860968,4.5,3.0,Excellent teacher! Loves the subject - this class is entirely centered around discussion; highly recommend this class if you are interested in cancer therapy.
1347,860968,4.5,3.0,"Loves his subject which is kinda contagous. Funny anecdotes semi-intereseting lecture, BUT tests are weird i.e. only 50 minutes alotted (3-4 pages) mix of multiple choice and short answer but very detailed questions takes getting used to and CoNcEPtUaL understanding of material. Read the book, come to lecture pay attention.. u should be g00d"
1348,860968,4.5,4.0,"An intense class,  but one well-worth taking. His course really smashes the notion of biology as inherently &quot;soft&quot; as a science. Don't heed what the self-horntooters are writing about his tests being easy. They're not, really. They require a very solid grasp on concepts from the textbook (an almost no factoids). Not hard to get an A if you read."
1349,860968,2.5,5.0,"He has an infectious enthusiasm for biology. Labs are pretty easy, although this kind of hurts you when they assign the lab notebook. Tests are ridiculously hard. He seems to think that the math is intuitive, and I attended every lecture! Really study the details of the lab manual and online labs for exams."
1350,860968,1.0,5.0,Completely useless teacher. Talks more about himself and his research studies than the course material. Everything was overly complicated.
1351,860968,4.0,4.0,Nice class but I think I liked him more when I took 201. Labs can be tedious since you repeat doing the same thing everytime. Exams are difficult and clicker questions are graded (unlike 201). You get full credits for assignments as long you do them. Hate the idea of a lab notebook since everybody simply directly copies from the lab manual.
1352,860968,4.5,3.0,"He's very good lecturer. Hate his tests, though. They make me feel like I'm in wrong class, taking wrong tests."
1353,860968,4.0,4.0,Good teacher
1354,860968,4.0,4.0,"Good teacher, very interested in what he's teaching but unfortunately I was not."
1355,860968,4.5,2.0,"Cool guy, cares alot about the subject and the students. His lectures were pretty average, tests were fair, albeit a bit tricky. He had lots of interesting things to talk about. However, I was a bit peeved that he was willing to answer any question at any time, including those from people were just trying to suck up and get a reccomendation. Eh..."
1356,860968,3.5,5.0,He is a nice guy and gives interesting lectures but tests are hard! He likes to challenge his students to think outside the box on tests and the answers are not always straight from lectures. To keep you you definitely need to attend lectures and read the chapters.
1357,860968,4.5,5.0,"Kittlesen is wonderful.  He gives great lectures with helpful slides.  His exams are difficult and test whether you memorized a piece of information or if you understand that piece of information.  Pay close attention to the experiments because he loves asking questions about them on exams.  Overall, great corse and interesting material."
1358,860968,5.0,2.0,"He is an amazing teacher. The only reason why some people don't like him is because his tests are based on understanding the topic, not pure memorization of his slides. Read the book and actually listen to his lectures and the class will be easy. He can make any topic interesting and is always willing to help a student out with anything."
1359,860968,4.0,3.0,"He is a great teacher. This is actually my favorite class. The tip about the class is always go to lectures, record if you can, because he always brings experimental assays in exam that he talks abt in lecture, which are not in the book. plus ask as many questions as you can because he is very helpful in explaning his material. Great teacher!!"
1360,860968,4.0,3.0,"Lab was fun, but midterms are tricky. Make sure you read every word in the question or you will mess up!"
1361,860968,5.0,3.0,"This class was by far my favorite class I've taken at UVA. David Kittlesen is a fantastic and enthusiastic professor who will dedicate as much time as necessary to help those who do not understand a concept. His tests are challenging, but fair; he'll review any test questions that caused confusion."
1362,860968,4.5,2.0,"Very hot in a geeky sort of way.  Anyways this class isn't as hard as people are saying.  If you pay attention to lectures and during labs, and don't make dumb mistakes on quizzes/midterms you'll do well.  I thought my high school biolab course was much harder.  Workload was medium intially, but become much easier as course went on.  TA's are cool."
1363,860968,3.0,3.0,"Pretty good, straightforward lecturer overall."
1364,860968,4.5,3.0,"Dave's interesting, funny and the nicest professor i've met. he answers any stupid Qs u ask. exams are HARD but if u like biology u'll definitely love him! the course has a lot to cover so he goes too fast at times. i had hard times following him cuz i seldom do the readings before class...go to class cuz he tests on things not in the textbook"
1365,860968,4.5,4.0,"good guy but desnt know how to teach, exams are out of his lectures and final exams are not cumulative, i made this mistake and was doing the entire course for the final and screwed the final.. read his notes and take don notes also during class."
1366,860968,2.5,4.0,Prof. Kittlesen is a great guy but lacks teaching ability. His tests are rarely a fair and accurate representation of the lecture. The text book is great and suffices for what you do not learn in lecture.
1367,860968,3.5,2.0,"This is not a tough class.  In the beginning of the semester, you'll be fine just reading the book if you've had any kind of bio on the past, but after the first exam, show up to class if you want to do well.  We had to use clickers to answer questions for participation (5% of total grade), so at least showing up helps your grade."
1368,860968,3.5,5.0,"I made a mistake and took this... i was a first year, non-science major.... you do the math... it equaled an F... but i think it would have been better for me if i was ... pre-med... i liked the guy..."
1369,860968,4.5,2.0,He is SOOO AMAZING!
1370,860968,3.5,5.0,"Wow. This class is killer. It's definitely very interesting, but it does require alot of effort. Go to class! The textbook only takes you so far; test questions are derived very much from experimental assays that he talks about in lecture. The name of the game in this class is &quot;BIG PICTURE!&quot;"
1371,860968,3.5,2.0,"compared to kopeny, kittlesen is an amazing bio teacher. yes, his class is harder, but he actually teaches. kopeny sucks. reads straight from the slides. kittlesen makes an effort to apply bio to life...good course and teacher"
1372,860968,4.0,4.0,"He is a great teacher. You have to put in the work outside of class, but he makes the material interesting and as entertaining as it can be...He wants you to really learn the material, not just memorize it, so sometimes the tests can be tricky. I've loved the class. Take him!"
1373,860968,5.0,3.0,Prof. Kittlesen is a great biology teacher.  He makes the material interesting and very clear.  As long as you keep up with the material and go to class you will do fine on the tests.  My only complaint is that some of the questions on the tests were really tricky and that the class was too early in the morning(9am)
1374,860968,2.0,4.0,"the WORST biology teacher I have ever had. He's a 'nice guy' in lecture, but in his office hours he's just as confusing. He makes the effort to squeeze you in outside his normal office hours, but rushes through. Tests are extremely tricky. He thinks he's funny, but not really."
1375,860968,4.0,4.0,extremely nice and helpful...very willing to meet/hold extra review sessions to make sure you understand the material. tests are very tricky and all about applying to real life.
1376,860968,2.0,4.0,"He's a very nice guy and tries hard but not very good at explaining the biological principles. He tends not to use the whole 75minutes a week, which is nice but then you're not learning all you need to know."
1377,860968,4.0,3.0,"A solid teacher.  Good class, tough in the mornings, so hopefully he will have a class later in the day for the upcoming semesters.  Tests are a pain, though."
1378,860968,5.0,3.0,"dr. kittleson is pretty awesome. the tests are pretty hard, but you'll do fine if you study well. great class too"
1379,860968,5.0,5.0,"GREAT Professor.  Hard tests, but it's to be expected.  Extremely helpful in answering questions.  Very approachable.  Go see him in office hours!"
1380,860968,4.5,4.0,"His tests come from lectures, not from the text, which can trip you up if you don't take good notes.  He is very excited about the material and always has a positive response when you ask questions after class, even if they are really dumb.  He is one of the nicest professors at UVA."
1381,860968,5.0,5.0,"Hardest class I've ever taken, but Kittlesen is a great lecturer, and is always available during office hours.  Great professor."
1382,860968,2.5,3.0,"Fun lecturer, but he teaches from diagrams only. Notes are hard to take, and he bounces from topic to topic, leaving students uncertain of the important points."
1383,860968,4.5,3.0,He is so cute and really funny! He is a really good lecturer and makes it pretty fun. Tests are somewhat hard... not too bad after you figure out his style.. but overall really good class
1384,860968,4.5,4.0,"This is a great class. Pretty hard, but well worth the effort. He is a funny guy and helps a lot in office hours"
1385,860968,3.5,4.0,"He is definietly a cool guy, has a lot of humor in the class, but the tests are not easy at all, you have to study the textbook in detail in order to do well."
1386,860968,4.0,3.0,"definitely not easy - study and attend lecture. he does his best to make it interesting, but something about the cracking voice and protein jabber always made me fall asleep. but if you try, you can learn a lot."
1387,860968,4.0,4.0,"I thought this class was challenging, but he was a really fun guy. a few of his lectures put me to sleep, but he definitely tries his hardest to make bio interesting. his tests are a bit harder than what he says- but studying for a minumum of 5 or so hours should do."
1388,860968,1.0,5.0,They are all lying... Hes horrible.  His tests are really bad.  And all he drinks is seltzer water.  His voice cracks and the class is horrible.
1389,860968,5.0,1.0,"Awesome, goes as slow or as fast as you need.  Great guy, even if his jokes aren't always 100% up to par"
1390,860968,5.0,2.0,"Kittleson's BIOL121 class was the best class I took this semester.  He is a clear and excellent lecturer.  Also, he is always willing and able to answer questions~even if they aren't really about what he is speaking about.  Take this course!  The level is appropriate, and the professor is awesome!"
1391,860968,4.0,3.0,"Very entertaining to say the least.  You can tell how much he enjoys what he does.  Tests are hard, but not unclear or impossible.  His lecture notes don't show up much on the tests, so lecture can be boring unless you really love biology."
1392,860968,3.0,4.0,VERY funny!
1393,860968,4.0,4.0,His biology class (first levels) is quite challenging and time consuming...but he is a amazing professor!
1394,860968,3.5,5.0,"Awesome professor who gives awesome lectures. Sometimes he talked a little too fast for my liking but his tests are extremely hard. I have friends who are getting 90s+ on his tests w/o the curve but not me, so I guess it depends."
1395,860968,5.0,3.0,"extremely nice guy but difficult tests. this was my favorite class of the semester despite the tests, and I learned so much"
1396,860968,5.0,2.0,"Amazing class with an amazing prof.  If you have even a passing interest in the subject, you have to take this class!  Kittlesen is approachable and kind, especially if you ask him about him rabbits. Seriously, he knows his stuff and doesn't mind explaining anything you need explained.  Take it."
1397,860968,3.5,4.0,The material is interesting.  His lecture-style puts me to sleep most of the time.  Hard tests but studying should get you a good grade.  He's passionate and extremely knowledgable about the subject.  Answers every question.  Likeable guy.  Not recommended if you're not interested in subject.
1398,860968,5.0,2.0,"awesome prof; excited, willing to explain any and everything, encourages questions. tests are easy, readings are generally unnecessary if you have ANY prior knowledge of biology, lectures are interesting and entertaining. good class for non-bio-majors"
1399,860968,5.0,3.0,He is so excited about the subject that it is impossible not to like the guy.
1400,860968,4.5,3.0,GREAT CLASS
1401,860968,5.0,4.0,"He leads an enjoyable and interesting class.  His tests are very hard but he will curve, don't worry!  Very nice guy."
1402,860968,5.0,5.0,So hard but SO worthwhile.  His intelligence scares me.
1403,860968,4.5,4.0,"Fun guy, makes class interesting. The tests are very hard but the subject matter and class are still very worthwhile."
1404,860968,4.5,4.0,Good guy and very understanding. Will help you if you ask.
1405,860968,4.0,5.0,he is a very good teacher; however his tests are very hard!

1409,1860419,1.0,2.0,Not a good professor. He doesn't really teach and gives false expectations for the class. Very unnecessary busy work. Take this class with someone else.
1410,1860419,1.0,3.0,Arbitrary grader who gives no feedback on assignments graded. Don't take ENGR 1620 with this man.
1411,926542,5.0,3.0,really amazing teacher. very kind and understanding. gives an opportunity for extensions.
1412,926542,4.0,3.0,She's a good professor and is more than willing to work with people outside of class. I would recommend her.
1413,926542,3.0,3.0,"She's a decent professor. The class was a bit boring at times, but at the end of the day, it's relatively easy to get a good grade. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to take another one of her courses, but I wouldn't be against it either. She has a German accent. It isn't a big deal. You'll understand her."
1414,926542,5.0,2.0,"Achilles is a brilliant professor, and this is a really unique course about modern German historypsychologyphilosophy. She's nice and helpful, and her dry humor is great. You MUST do the homework (readingsforeign films with short with responses) and participate in daily discussion, but you'll want to because the material is so interesting. "
1415,926542,2.5,2.0,"Prof Achilles was a good teacher. She is very German and literal with very dry humor, but I kind of enjoyed that. Pretty easy class if you read and come to lectures and very interesting material."
1416,926542,5.0,2.0,"Professor Achilles is a very very good professor, one of the best that I've had. She speaks really well and is very very organized. Tests and midterms are quite easy because she prepares you for them. I definitely recommend taking a class with her, especially the higher level ones because she is much better teaching about Germany."
1417,926542,4.0,1.0,"Manuela was a really nice professor. I was expecting an overview of European History, however it turned out as more of a German history class with bits of Europe thrown in. She is very passionate about Germany. She jumped around and repeated a lot. If you do the reading you will be fine for pop quizzes and midterm/final. I enjoyed the class."
1418,926542,4.0,3.0,"Her lectures are a little repetitive so they can get kind of boring at times. Semi-thick accent but it's usually not too hard to understand what she's saying. Midterm and final are pretty easy, and two 4-6 page papers on broad topics. She has to be the only teacher I've had in the past ten years to still have pop quizzes (pass 5/7 to get credit)."
1419,926542,1.0,4.0,Very boring class.  She drones on and on and stutters which makes it super hard to pay attention or bothering to go to class at all.  If you decide to take the class despite the warning you need to go to class for pop quizzes .
1420,926542,1.5,2.0,"A good, informative class of basic history. However, impossibly boring lectures that are mostly redundant of the textbook. Gives a few pop quizzes on reading - easy points if you do it (and sometimes, if you don't). Assigns quite a bit of supplementary reading, but that's the interesting part."
1421,926542,4.0,4.0,"I did not find Achilles' lectures as interesting as I anticipated since she often read from slides and would focus on events more than general themes of West Civ (but she did not fully exclude the latter).Reading is important, expect quizzes, but she is very nice and helpful even though I didn't love the class.we might have tried to cover too much"
1422,926542,4.5,2.0,"Western Civ was such as great class! She's a really nice teacher... makes class interesting.  She has good stories that relate to topics.  The class is not always just lectures, but a combination of documentaries, movies, guest lectures.  She's awesome and the class was enjoyable.  Not too hard at all. Her exam review guides are crucial! Take her!"
1423,926542,4.5,3.0,Very nice person. Because he lectures are written out she tends to read from it which can be a little droning but you have to go to class for pop quizes. You'll pass if you were conscious while you read. Two 5 page papers. Not a bad class but history isn't my thing.
1424,926542,4.0,2.0,"Great teacher, and class isn't too hard either. Papers which make up majority of the grade require you to do in-depth reading, however. She knows everything there is to know about Germany, albeit she can be a little bias."
1425,926542,3.5,2.0,"Comes across as simple and very easy, but the class picked up half way through the semester. She really knows the material very well and is very &quot;nice&quot;. There's no other way to put it. Drawbacks might be her presuppositions that she enters the class with - she seems to know all the right answers already."
1426,869218,4.5,1.0,"Cool, laid back, helpful"

1428,25448,2.5,4.0,"Gerli knows a lot about a lot, but would often go on tangents seemingly to demonstrate this. I was often unsure what was relevant to the class and what was just him liking to hear himself talk for dramatic effect. He also switched between English and Spanish so not a lot of practice if you're looking to improve the latter."
1429,25448,4.0,3.0,"Gerli is brilliant. He seems to know everything that went on in Europe from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. He is great at pointing out big themes and tying them into other things (art, music, etc.) which is so interesting. My one complaint:he uses English at times and lets us to answer in English so you don't really improve your spoken spanish"
1430,25448,3.5,2.0,"Gerli rocks!  I took him during my first semester here, and I'm taking him again because I think he is great.  He can be a little confusing about the early history of Spain, but early Spanish history is difficult to understand.  Not a super hard grader and he's really nice.  Overall a great teacher!!"
1431,25448,4.5,3.0,Gerli was a great teacher who knew his stuff when it came to Iberia. Yeah he switched between languages but it's a 423 course so it's assumed that your atleast decent in spanish. Those who think the names were confusing just don't have an appreciation of the history of early spain. Just because it wasn't easy doesn't mean Gerli is a bad teacher.
1432,25448,1.0,5.0,"I hated this class.  He would switch from spanish to english to spanish to arabic to spanish throughout the class while slurring everything as if we were all native speakers in all three languages.  This was mainly a history class with a lot of names that sounded the same.  It was aweful.  Just aweful.  Plus, he was really mean if you had a question.  Or tried to answer one of his."
1433,25448,4.0,4.0,Excellent teacher who will make you look at all aspects of your life with a new perspective.
1434,25448,5.0,4.0," Great engaging lecture style , knew everything and anything about the subject"
1435,598909,5.0,3.0,"Arone is the best math professor I've ever had. His accent is goofy but more endearing than frustrating. He truly cares about helping students understand and will go back and teach a topic in an entirely new way if you ask a question. Always very available with office hours/email. The class was difficult and fast-paced, but doable and interesting."
1436,598909,5.0,5.0,I wish all professors were like Greg.
1437,598909,4.5,4.0,"One of the nicest professors I have met. We rushed through some material during the last part of the class, but he is a great professor. Hard work for a good grade."
1438,598909,4.5,3.0,"His accent does not get in the way of understanding material, if anything its kind of fun sometimes!  The class may be difficult if you do not come to class or pay attention in lecture but he is very approachable and helpful after class and responds very well to emails."
1439,598909,3.0,2.0,"Great Guy....Sure he does have an accent but in the end decent work for a good grade, is a good teacher in my book."
1440,598909,2.5,4.0,Avoid like the plague
1441,598909,3.5,2.0,"His accent is strong but you get used to it pretty quick. Really knows his stuff and is incredibly nice, makes it a point to make sure the class understands the material, and will help you out with anything you ask."
1442,1631110,5.0,1.0,"I had her for Applied Calc II and she's really nice and very helpful. She gives partial credit and is really good at explaining concepts. She can actually be pretty funny, too. I would definitely recommend her."
1443,1139590,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Denton is really great at guiding the discussion in a workshop setting. She has limited office hours, but she's good about scheduling appointments to go over your work so you always get the feedback you need. She's also very real and herself around students, which helps the workshop discussion flow even better."
1444,1139590,5.0,1.0,"I took her J-Term class, and even though I heard that taking a two week class can be very strenuous, she made it a very enjoyable experience.  She was very kind and at the same time, did a great job of critiquing me without being offensive in any way.  I would take another class with her any day.  She is by far one of UVa's greatest professors."
1445,1139590,5.0,1.0,Had her for intermediate fiction writing. Denton is extremely laid back and encourages conversation and thought provoking discussion in class. The class was extremely chill but useful at the same time. Take her if you want a freespirited instructor and a pretty easy class.
1446,1139590,5.0,1.0,"She cares a lot about students & goes beyond to make herself available to read your writing and give feedback before you turn it in for a grade.  She selects reading material well and is prepared for class.  In this particular course she opened the floor a great deal to student discussion, and gently guided it.  Easy grades, especially if A- is OK."
1447,1049477,5.0,2.0,"Professor Shobe, even during Covid, is easily the most engaging professor Ive had. The workload is not overbearing by any means and I learned a ton through the course. I would recommend his class even for non Econ majors especially if you have an interest in environmental policy"
1448,1049477,5.0,2.0,Definitely one of the best courses the econ at the University. Professor Shobe is awesome and is very passionate about the content and that is something you can see in the way he teaches. He's approachable and genuinely cares for his students. The course changed the way I look at the world. Absolutely do the readings as they're so worth it.
1449,1049477,2.5,4.0,Shobe is an incredibly enthusiastic and knowledgeable man in his field. His lectures are incredibly engaging HOWEVER the material is all over the place and exams are extremely open ended - shot in the dark. My main feedback is that Pr Shobe should re-collect at the end of every lecture and clearly express what his expectations are for his students.
1450,1049477,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Very helpful, very clear about what he wants you to know. Relatively easy but interesting class."
1451,1049477,5.0,1.0,"Easy class, and I actually learned a thing or two.  Go to lecture, try to stay awake, take a few notes and you'll get an A or A-.  I literally did work outside of class three times for about two hours each: the day before each midterm and the day before the final."
1452,1049477,5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors I have had at UVa.He will completely change the way you look at problems, is very encouraging and helpful. Besides that the course is structured so that you can focus more on learning and not worrying about grades."
1453,1049477,2.0,3.0,"AWESOME professor! He is interesting, enthusiastic, and you will want to go to lecture. Also, it's a good Econ class to take if you are not math oriented. No problem sets, two midterms, and a final. Not bad. Mostly essays on the exams although there is very simple math and graph analysis incorporated. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
1454,2286470,5.0,2.0,"Super kind and personable. Broke down readings into required and optional, so you're never doing more work than you can handle. Also easy to reach outside of class and made homework fun! "
1455,2286470,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Spittler is a great professor, I took her New Testament Christianity class, she keeps a balanced perspective and her assignments are easy to follow and to do well on. I would totally recommend for anyone, but especially if you want to learn more about New Testament Chrisitianity. When I took her class our grade was made up of 12 assignments."
1456,2278285,5.0,3.0,Mahshad comes to class with enthusiasm & material tailored to our skill levels. She is fierce in her speech and sharp in her mind. She invests in every students & keeps it real. Alumni and present students light up when she enters a room for she's motherly. Her love for language is spectacular. Do not leave Uva without the Mahshad experience!
1457,2278285,5.0,1.0,"Mahshad is so sweet and you really learn Farsi in this class as well as the Persian culture. If you show her that you are trying hard and completing your work, you will have no problem in this class. I still keep in contact with her despite finishing the class, and my Farsi has gotten so good."
1458,2278285,5.0,3.0,"I don't know why bad reviews on here but I've taken class with Professor Mahshad for 3 years now and she is a great professor and person overall. She's is very passionate about what she teaches, a quality that is rare to find in professors at UVA. Show her you're doing your best and you'll definitely do well, regardless of being Persian."
1459,2278285,5.0,3.0,"Mahshad is my absolute favorite professor. She makes the class feel like a little family, and is so welcoming. I spoke farsi before coming to class but it has improved so much after her class. I can also read and write now with so much ease. She always made time for me if I wanted to come in and practice reading. "
1460,2278285,5.0,3.0,Literally the most down to Earth and excited teacher I've had at UVA. Def a vibe and highly recommend it! She loves connecting with her students and being close to them in every capacity. I've never seen anyone love their job as much as she does!
1461,2278285,4.0,3.0,"Professor Mohit wasn't a bad teacher. I actually think it's quite shameful that students weren't willing to adjust to her teaching style and that's reflective of the student's character- not hers. Yes, she may not be your average teacher, but she's sincere and willing to be supportive in every manner possible. Put in the work and she'll be there."
1462,2278285,1.0,1.0,"This class is a train wreck. There is no syllabus, no course objective, no textbook. She grades based on personal biases. She does not have a PhD, and she is not properly trained to do what she does. If you want to learn Farsi, youd be better off teaching yourself."
1463,2278285,1.0,2.0,"No, thank you!"
1464,2278285,5.0,3.0,"Mohit is a kind and smart teacher. She will do everything she can to help you learn Persian, and youll learn a lotas long as you put in the work. I havent gotten great grades in her classes because, sadly, I havent always worked my hardest. But shes ALWAYS been willing to sacrifice her time to help me or anyone else who needs it."
1465,2278285,1.0,3.0,Mahshad isnt trained for what she does and that makes things really difficult. Her English is very difficult to understand. I honestly wish that didnt have to take class with her for another semester.
1466,2278285,1.0,1.0,Good thing I dropped out of the class
1467,1647503,4.5,3.0,"She is an AMAZING T.A.! Take her if you have the chance! Really helpful, and truly cares about her students. Also wears a cute outfit everyday no exceptions."
1468,320400,5.0,3.0,The best professor I ever had. He basically designed a class that included the most interesting things about the entire CS curriculum.
1469,320400,1.0,1.0,"The class should be easy if you study with a group. He might be good at teaching CS, but he is terrible at teaching math. He consistently misuses definitions and gives handwavey solutions and proofs. If you ask him questions in office hours, he sometimes gives you the wrong answer, so beware. Easy pass, but don't expect to learn rigorous math."
1470,320400,5.0,2.0,Great class on Udacity
1471,320400,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I have taken in 3 years at this university. His operating systems class uses an in development language called Rust with a buggy compiler and no real world application. His assignments deal with web servers and shells and emphasize learning this language rather than operating systems.
1472,320400,5.0,2.0,Very clear. He ROCKS!
1473,320400,5.0,1.0,best one
1474,320400,5.0,1.0,He Rocks!
1475,320400,5.0,1.0,HE ROCKS.
1476,320400,4.0,4.0,"Took Udacity CS101 with Prof. Evans without previous knowledge. Not easy,but he's a guy who loves to make people learn and empower them, also knows what he's doing and how to get it across. Looking forward to other courses with him!"
1477,320400,5.0,4.0,Very good Prof. It's amazing how he teachs.
1478,320400,4.5,3.0,"Professor Evans expects a lot from his students and often gives us very challenging problems. Sometimes I feel that he is too smart to know that someone might not understand what he is talking about. Despite that, he is very knowledgeable about the subject matter. I learned a great deal from his class and it was also fun to work on the projects."
1479,320400,1.0,4.0,"Worst class I've ever taken. EVER. If you can avoid him, do that. Sitting through lecture is like being tortured. And he's just such an awkward person to be around. He might know what he's talking about, but he certainly isn't very good at explaining himself."
1480,320400,4.0,4.0,"Professor Evans knows just about any question you can ask him. The class is challenging for everyone, it's not as hard for people who have had programming before but still isn't easy.  Class is taught for people with no prior CS experience.  Tough course but is definitely possible to get an A if you put in the time and effort."
1481,320400,5.0,4.0,"I took 3 classes with Dave. He is really the best teacher in the world because he really cares about his students.  I am forever grateful for how much he has changed my college life.  Take his class.  I know it seems like you are going to fail and get an F, but trust me, it will be all right."
1482,320400,5.0,4.0,"Freaking awesome.  Took a hard subject and made it interesting and fun.  Homework assignments can be gruelingly difficult at times, but he and his TAs hold plenty of office hours.  Well-written tests - if you know what you're doing, you'll be fine, but if you don't, you'll get your butt kicked.  Gives lots of extra credit."
1483,320400,4.5,4.0,"I really enjoyed his CS 150 class, which he created and wrote the textbook for.  If anyone is remotely interested in computer science, I would recommend this class - there isn't too much programming because the focus is on computer science as a whole.  Exams and assignments can be challenging, but are open-book."
1484,320400,4.0,4.0,"He really tries to make you learn, and I'm sure he would be fascinating if I was interested in the subject.  All tests were take home."
1485,320400,5.0,3.0,Best teacher in the department. And brilliant.
1486,320400,4.5,4.0,"Excellent professor, challenges his students to rise to the problems he assigns.  The &quot;star based&quot; grading scale motivated me more than any grade ever could."
1487,320400,4.5,4.0,"Very nice and helpful person, but his homework assignments tend to be difficult and time-consuming."
1488,320400,5.0,4.0,"Class contains lots of interesting tidbits. The stuff I did understand I thought was cool to know. The stuff I didn't understand, I wish I could."
1489,320400,5.0,2.0,Really Great Professor!
1490,320400,4.0,2.0,"An odd guy, but seemingly friendly. In the class I took he didn't assign letter grades, instead gave out colored stickers (you got a gold star!  good job!). He's easy, very easy by e-school standards (only A I got there). Very much on the theoretical side of computer science, which was a nice change"
1491,320400,5.0,3.0,"Arguably best prof. in engineering school. Very nice, helpful, and truly wants you to learn. He cares more about effort than performance. If you suck at CS, take this class and try your best even if you can't get it right, he'll give you an A."
1492,320400,5.0,4.0,"so far the best cs professor at uva.  class is not easy, but he is willing to help you and grades lean towards the amount of effort you put in.  very nice and friendly."
1493,320400,5.0,3.0,This is the best professor I have taken at UVA. Challenging material and you will work a lot but interesting and worthwhile. Just read his teaching philosophy which he epitomizes: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/teaching.html
1494,320400,4.5,4.0,Great teacher. Really wants you to do well. Most interesting CS class I've taken at UVa.
1495,320400,4.5,2.0,"fun class, you'll learn a lot.  pretty fast paced, but lots of hlep is available.  prof is friendly, wnats you to do well"
1496,320400,5.0,2.0,"Great class! I learned a lot! Tests are very fair, makes you think! Problem sets are hard -- you have to start early, but he is ALWAYS willing to help!"
1497,492436,4.5,4.0,had her for MSE 3670 too. great teacher and really takes interest in her students. doesnt mind not completing the daily slides if it means answering students questions. 3670 is a really hard class. 4055 is hard too but is easier if you understand some of the material prior to taking the class. Its all really hard material but she makes it fun
1498,492436,3.0,3.0,"nice teacher, really cares about students.  grading is pretty fair the tests are not too bad either."
1499,492436,4.0,3.0,"She's quite, but definitely tries to be a good professor and is concerned about how good of a job she's doing. She wasn't bad last year, and I suspect she'll only get better at teaching. Prof. Kelly is a much better lecturer though-he came in as a substitute once. Tests aren't too hard if you read and prepare-the hardest is probably the 3rd test."
1500,492436,3.5,4.0,"Before you start to judge her, you have to understand that the material she has to teach is less then exciting.  She is not very exciting herself, but she is a nice person.  If you go see her outside of class she is helpful and very understanding.  She also curves...so showing up to class and pretending to pay attention will pay off."
1501,492436,3.5,4.0,"She tries really hard to make the material interesting, but unfortunately fails. If you can stay awake during class and study pretty hard, you can definitely pass. Don't expect anything amazing from her, but she is really helpful if you go to her outside of class. Go to review sessions, it helps lot"
1502,492436,3.0,3.0,"Group work problems during class,crosswords & fill in the blanks (elementary school style),&quot;show and tell&quot;-ish items, games like Trivia Knockout, and real world comparisons and applications... she tries her absoulute hardest,but I can't stay awake.  She is incredibly understanding though and tries t"
1503,492436,4.5,3.0,Her class is SO BORING it is horrible.  Take Kelly if you can.  Shes very insecure about teaching (she laughs at stuff she says) and she can be a **** when people are leaving.  Avoid her at all costs
1504,492436,1.5,4.0,i didn't want to be there in the first place.  it was utterly painful.  the material was lame and so was the instruction.  she just read off her slides...good luck
1505,1287061,5.0,3.0,"Yeagley is without a doubt the best TA I've had--and perhaps one of the best teachers I've had here at UVA.  He expects a lot more on reports, but his office hour is extremely helpful for that.  And his laid back personality serves as a nice buffer between the students and Dr. Chruma, which is quite frankly what got me through the semester."
1506,787358,5.0,4.0,"This class is amazing! Professor Woolfork really cares about her students, and her office hours were really valuable. The entire class is participation-driven (although participation doesn't count for much of the grade), so be willing to participate! This class really changed how I think about race relations in the US. It's really worthwhile!"
1507,787358,4.0,3.0,"P. Woolfork is very funny and personable, which I appreciated. Her insights are great, but I question her open-mindedness when dealing with ideas outside of the realm of what she expects from the class. Quizzes are mostly easy, but sometimes she chooses really annoying, useless questions. Overall a good professor, but could be more open-minded. "
1508,787358,5.0,4.0,"Professor Woolfork is amazing. She is brilliant but also receptive to every single student's contributions to the class. She is also a tough grader, but working with her in office hours will be beneficial to your writing development and grade. If you are an English major, you need to take  a class with her before you graduate. She is one of a kind."
1509,787358,5.0,3.0,GREATEST ENGLISH PROFESSOR VER!!! She really pushes you to produce your best work and she is really helpful in office hours. Make sure you do the reading because there are pop quizzes but they arent hard at all. I love her so much she is now my advisor. 2 take home exams with questions that really engage the readings. i loved her class!
1510,787358,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Woolfork is one of the best professors I have taken in the UVA English deprtment! She is soooo much fun and brought food to class everyday mmmm! She gives you a syllabus at the beginning of the class that specifies exactly what she wants, and if you do that you will do well! A MUST take is you are an english major!!"
1511,787358,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I've had in the English department at UVa.  Got me interested in science fiction, which is a genre I have never explored/enjoyed before.  Really cares about her students and wants us all to succeed.  Expects a lot from us, but projects and assignments were interesting and I actually wanted to do the work.  Take a class with her!"
1512,787358,4.0,5.0,Great professor. Very enthusiastic about the readings and discussions. Not very dependable for anything once the class is over.
1513,787358,5.0,4.0,"The nicest professor/person ever! She expects a lot in terms of reading and writing, but she energizes you to do it all. Her literary insights are incredible and she breaks it down for the average student to fully understand. A must-take in the English dept."
1514,787358,5.0,2.0,"Really friendly, cares about her students.  Interesting discussions.  You need to be a really good writer thoughp-she expects quality work."
1515,787358,4.5,2.0,"Great professor! Very approachable, super nice! Very interesting class! Take any class she teaches!"
1516,2229158,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic TA: knowledgeable, passionate, & kind. He goes on history tangents alot but they're funny & interesting. When I was struggling w/ Latin he helped me almost an hour each week outside class. A bit disorganized @ times but we still got thru all material. The whole class loved him & I still hear some of them talking about missing his class."
1517,754602,5.0,2.0,"Absolute queen, she will make you want to learn. Homework after every class but it's not a big deal. If she is an option for your German class, build your schedule around getting her as your professor."
1518,754602,5.0,2.0,"The best professor Ive had at UVA. I had her for german 1010, 2010, and 2020. Truly a caring, kind-hearted woman who wants the best for all of her students. Could never say anything nearly negative about her. Simply, I love her and she made me love German."
1519,754602,4.0,3.0,She was very repetitive but it in a way that really helps you learn the material. I learned so much German and about Germany in her class. My favorite language teacher ever. Be ready to get called on though!
1520,754602,4.5,1.0,"This class was a breeze. Some of the homework is kind of pointless busy work, but it's easy enough to deal with. She's very kind and willing to help out in any way possible. I honestly can't imagine someone getting below a B+ in her class if they put in at least some effort."
1521,754602,4.5,3.0,Good teacher.  Going to class and doing the homework prepares you well for the tests.  It got a bit tedious at times having class five times a week and work every night.
1522,754602,5.0,3.0,This class is like any other language class but at a faster pace. She teaches well and tests are not bad if you stay on top of your homework. She's got no tricks up her sleeves.
1523,1745837,5.0,4.0,"Professor Khan is a wonderfully caring and also extremely knowledgeable, and fair, professor. Very passionate."
1524,1745837,4.0,1.0,"Professor Khan is actually a great professor. There is a lot of reading assigned, but a student can get away with skimming. His lectures are very interesting and his grading criteria is very clear. Honestly, show up and participate in discussions and you will be fine. (Only problem is he does not believe in giving A+)"
1525,1745837,3.0,5.0,He really knows his stuff. Taught me a lot about Pakistani Tablighis. Really moving information about a culture.
1526,631740,1.0,3.0,"Makes very frequent mistakes in class. Doesn't understand that units need to be converted so that they are consistent with the rest of the problem. The material in the class is easy, but it is difficult to take it because she makes so many mistakes and doesn't use a textbook, so there is nothing correct to reference."
1527,631740,1.0,5.0,The words mean and boring come to mind. Couldn't stand this woman. Take anyone else but her. She needs to take a break and re-evaluate her reasons for teaching. Her presence could turn some potential physics majors and the casually interested student off from physics. That's a detriment to physics and UVA.
1528,631740,2.0,3.0,This class was awful. She yells at the class all the time for being &quot;loud&quot; and refuses to teach. She attempts to do example problems and works them wrong. For the first exam she spent about 30 minutes just passing out the exam. If there is another professor teaching the same class--take that section.
1529,631740,1.0,4.0,Despina was an awful professor.  She was unclear in her lectures and did not know how to teach the material.  She was boring and had no demonstrations (like Thornton does).  She yelled at the class numerous times for being &quot;loud&quot; when I didn't hear a single person talking.  Overall she did a bad job teaching the course. Don't take her!
1530,631740,1.0,5.0,NEVER NEVER NEVER take louca's class.  she's such a terrible lecturer.  the majority of her students don't like her and she doesn't like her job either.  her presence is a tragedy to uva.
1531,631740,2.0,3.0,Do not take Louca's class even if it's a later-time section.  Her lecture notes are illegible and she doesn't help you on the tests.  Always take Thornton's class.
1532,631740,1.5,2.0,"How things work is an ok class, a nice gut to add to your schedule.  Despina though is very montoned, her jokes dont make sense and the class is fairly boring.  Needless to say you dont have to attend class and can still pull a B."
1533,2229191,3.0,1.0,Dr. Zehner was a first time prof at URichmond this semester a did a good job. Lectures were pretty boring over Zoom but so is every Zoom class. You do not need to do the readings. SparkNotes is your friend and then read what you need to write your papers. Only hw is to read. Good guy and tries to make jokes although they are pretty corny.
1534,2229191,1.0,4.0,Knows Latin & ok at presenting new material but wasn't always prepared for class. Sometimes he spent class time trying to figure out the translation himself. Rather unapproachable outside of class. Sometimes condescending in response to questions.  Never posted grades online. Often unresponsive to emails. By far the worst TA I have ever had.
1535,910282,5.0,2.0,"Stefano was a pleasure to learn from.  Knowledgeable about his subject, but willing to listen to other views.  Made class fun, yet challenging."
1536,910282,5.0,2.0,"Class may be a little difficult if you don't know anything about programming, but he is always willing to help you complete the assignments.  One time, he wasn't going to be in his office so he spent about an hour helping me over the phone from his house."
1537,918481,5.0,3.0,LOVE her. i had her this semester at JMU and she was adorable and just seemed like she really cared about the subject. There is a lot of reading and you have to study a lot. her tests were all writing but she tries to help you/ wants you to get a good grade. Not to mention shes funny! Definitely one of my favorite professors so far.
1538,918481,4.0,3.0,"I've read some negative comments on her prior to taking the class, but none of them lived up to what she's really like. Susan explained the more difficult theoretical concepts really well and she was very nice. Overall, her grading wasn't that tough...I ended up getting an A- in class without reading 2/3 of the course packet."
1539,918481,4.5,2.0,"I loved Susan Brewer as my TA for PLCP 101. She did really well at breaking down all of the material, and would go to Waldner on our behalf if she thought it necessary. I didn't think she was a hard grader at all, though. On the contrary, I thought she gave me better grades than maybe I should have received."
1540,918481,4.0,4.0,"i had her as my TA in plcp101 and she was a TA for plir350.  She is really smart and knows the material, but is like everyone says a hard grader.  She is also the hottest TA I have ever had and would have hit on her big time if she didn't have a ring on her finger."
1541,918481,5.0,5.0,you did a great job ms. brewer.  i'm sure people said the same**** about bill nylen when he was a TA (and a professor actually).  it means you're doing a good job.  keep up the good work.
1542,918481,4.0,3.0,"I really liked Susan and thought that she was helpful in explaining the more difficult readings. I would not say she is a hard grader, but she does not hand out A's. I have gotten B+s on everything but overall a good TA who is helpful in breaking down some complex theories."
1543,918481,4.5,2.0,"I don't know why people are giving Susan a hard time.  She gave me an A- on my midterm, so they're definitely not impossible...and that's without me doing 1-2 thirds of the reading.  We had some good debates in discussion and she kept it from being dry review.  I liked her and would recommend her."
1544,918481,5.0,4.0,"I think Susan is a fabulous TA.  She's informative, helpful, and very fair. Also, she's cute as hell, which always helps!"
1545,918481,1.5,5.0,"Impossible.  She's nice, but when she said on the first day of class &quot;I don't give A's&quot;, I didn't switch to a different TA because I assumed they all said that. According to friends in other sections, no one else did. I like Susan personally, but this is a 101 class, and I just don't think she has a right to massacre our GPAs like she is doing."
1546,918481,1.5,5.0,"Brewer should not be teaching a comparative politics class.  Her focus of study is Latin America, not what's important for PLCP.  She simplifies too much in discussion and flat out said on the first day, &quot;I don't give out A's.&quot;  PLCP is not a bad class, Brewer is just an amazingly crappy TA.  She is also very liberal and will grade accordingly."
1547,1082322,4.0,4.0,"She is the best teacher in the Japanese program at UVa. I will admit she is a good lecturer and at explaining grammar concepts. However, she plays favorites and is unforgiving if you miss class (even with a legitimate excuse) and can be patronizing when you ask questions (which discourages students). She should be more compassionate."
1548,1082322,5.0,4.0,"I think UVA has a good JAPN program, and my experience with Kawai sensei was great. First-year Japanese requires a lot of work and one missing class makes a huge difference. However, she is really helpful and gives periodic feedbacks to students.  Definitely talk to her during office hour - she would recommend extra ways to learn better too"
1549,1082322,4.5,4.0,"Really work intensive class (and sometimes effort doesn't always seem to match up to grade), but Kawai-sensei is great! Very caring, quick to reply to e-mails, and makes herself very available to helping students. Goes out of her way to get students involved in the Japanese program and learning Japanese. I'm going to miss her class next semester."
1550,1082322,4.5,2.0,"Kawai-sensei is a great teacher. A little intimidating; she fires questions at you. Tests are boring because they cover the exact material you go over in class and on worksheets, but for the same reason if you pay attention and go over work they are not bad. Laughs &quot;ho ho ho.&quot; Good at hammering sentence structures into your head."
1551,435156,4.0,3.0,"The class was slightly disorganized at first but  soon there were successful attempts to improve on disorganization(ex.lecture slides given before each class).Lectures were interesting(awesome guess lecturers too)& yes the homeworks were hard, but the curve compensated for this tremendously.  This is an extremely bright and underrated professor."
1552,435156,1.0,4.0,"very very disorganized.  gives out difficult HW assignments, and is not very helpful in teaching material to us.  final exam was horrible, left 1/2 of it blank. i would hate him, but he curves grades and gave me decent final grade.  however, i still dont like him for the stress he caused in enduring his class"
1553,435156,1.0,3.0,"Please never take this class. Botchwey is by far the worst professor I have ever had and I am ashamed that he is part of this university. He puts zero effort into preparing for class, and deliberately avoids intelligent questions because he doesn't know how to answer them. The hw is impossible too!"
1554,435156,1.0,4.0,"He is the worst teacher I have ever had.  He has no idea what he is talking about, and stands in front of the class telling us that he doesn't know what anything is, and that if we don't know either, then it's too bad.  This class is a HUGE waste of my time.  He is a complete MORON.  Never take it!!"
1555,435156,1.0,4.0,"Botchwey absolutely sucks... he has no idea what he is talking about... the homework supposedly covers what he goes over in class, and it definitely doesn't.botchwey outs no effort into the class whatsoever.. he is super lazy and tries to distract from the fact that he doesn't know what he is talkin"
1556,787435,5.0,1.0,"Definitely one of the best professors in the department. Super helpful and very sweet. Midterm and Final exams were extremely straightforward: show up to class and you'll do very well. Extremely supportive of papers as well, takes time to make sure students are up to speed. Fantastic teacher!"
1557,787435,3.5,3.0,"Lolordo is a bit odd, but really smart! Not as smart as the TA, Galen Barry, who was actually a genius. His lectures put hers to shame as far as clarity, depth and fluidity. I would recommend the class only if your a Phil major, though it has given me numerous helpful reference points, and the open discussion format in class is great! Good proff.!"
1558,787435,4.5,3.0,"Fleshes out arguments in premise/conclusion form.  Ultra clear in lectures, helpful outside of class, engaging, and intelligent.  One of the best in the department."
1559,787435,3.5,3.0,"The class was interesting and Lolordo was good at explaining.  Tests were appropriately challenging but not overwhelming and overall i thought the class was worthwhile, especially if you like philosophy.  If you do the work assigned you will do fine."
1560,787435,4.5,2.0,"Lolordo truly knows her stuff! Her class isn't difficult if you do the reading, follow her lectures and retain basic concepts for papers and exams. She is also very approachable outside the classroom. She is a whiz at handling class questions, too."
1561,787435,3.5,2.0,"Material could be interesting, but could also be difficult to get a firm grasp of. Even though I sometimes felt like I wasn't sure of the material, though, grading was not very hard and allowed room for error. Lolordo always tried to help clear up any confusion and is a good professor when you get used to her."
1562,50167,3.0,1.0,"She is fun and her class is enjoyable and fairly easy but she is very disorganized. There are 5 graded assignments and she doesn't really give any instruction on how to complete them. She doesn't give information in the syllabus for the assignments either. Wonderful woman, loves teaching, very disorganized"
1563,50167,5.0,3.0,"Very caring, I loved her classes!"
1564,50167,5.0,2.0,"Vanessa Ochs is an amazing woman, and Jewish Weddings is an amazing course.  Opens your mind to different customs, ideologies that you never would have considered.  Challenges you in the best way.  As a professor, Ochs is kind, considerate, and without a doubt, one of the most intelligent people I've ever come across.  Simply fabulous."
1565,50167,4.0,2.0,She is very intense at times; I enjoyed herfor the most part but her facial expressions are sometimes a little judgemental
1566,2229248,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Vargas is insane. Insane in a good way. He knows a lot about economics, and it clearly showed. One time I went to his office hours, and he was able to explain to me thermodynamics relationship to economics. I left his office hours awed. Dr. Vargas is extremely good at what he does and I hope he keeps up what he does. He is a young man and good"
1567,1270796,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! This class is for Shirts to show off how smart he is. Homeworks literally take 12-15 hours every single week. The tests are nearly impossible. All you do is memorize formulas that you will never use ever again. TORTURE
1568,1270796,1.0,5.0,"By far one of the worst professors I have ever had. Impossible to understand. Does not clarify things well when asked questions. He is very eager to want to help, but simply does not have the ability."
1569,1270796,1.0,5.0,I dont even know where to start to describe how GOD AWFUL this class was. The people who wrote the positive review must be michael shirts himself. Literally around 3 am Monday evenings every week in stacks were all 70 people enrolled in 216 doing the redic homework assignments that took 15 hours. However his hair ALWAYS looks good. &lt;3 his hair gel.
1570,1270796,1.0,5.0,"By far the worst professor I've ever had - not helpful, rude, hard, and overall absurd.  I don't know what the 2 comments above are about - maybe from Shirts himself&#63; Out of a 59 person class, 56/59 voted it was the worst class they've ever taken.  It made everyone in my major want to switch out."
1571,1270796,3.5,5.0,Shirts will probably be great after he teaches a few more years. He's a genius but doesn't recognize that not all his students are. He rewards you for working hard and won't give you lower than a C if you put forth a good effort. You literally have to kill yourself to get an A though.  Good luck with this class.
1572,1270796,4.5,5.0,"Professor Shirts is great. As far as the work goes, we will thank him in the end when we actually leave this class knowing as much as possible instead of just sliding by. Its a difficult class but with good reason; its a chemical engineering class for crying out loud!! Hes very helpful, very friendly, and a very knowledgeable person."
1573,9231,5.0,2.0,"Good course! I feel this is one of a few courses that I have learned a lot during these years. The professor is very nice, helpful and most importantly he takes a personal interest in students understanding the concepts."
1574,9231,2.0,4.0,"A little accent to get used to, but good classes in general. Very responsible lecturer."
1575,9231,5.0,1.0,"Wonderful professor!  Lectures are clear and easy to follow.  Very helpful in office hours.  Want students to do well.  Likes to use himself as examples :P quote: &quot;You ask me a question, I give you an answer.&quot;  Good class!"
1576,9231,5.0,1.0,"He is a really nice proffessor. Always care about your understanding of the materials, and try to help you to learn and get better grades."
1577,9231,1.5,4.0,No Comments
1578,9231,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Maybe he can teach other subjects, but Differentil Equations is not his forte. He barely knew what he was saying, let alone trying to explain it to the class. Stay far, far away."
1579,9231,4.0,2.0,"watch out for the accent, but if you can actually hear, he is clear and concise.  also very friendly an helpful... he wants you to do well"
1580,9231,1.0,5.0,bad teacher
1581,9231,5.0,3.0,"I had Tao 2 semesters in a row. He is an awesome professor who really cares about you learning the material. His hw assignments are very reasonable, as are his tests. Controls(402) is the class i've learned the most in in the 4 years i've been here. NICE"
1582,9231,3.0,3.0,"couldn't understand a word, but a fair grader"
1583,9231,5.0,4.0,"very thorough in his presentation of topics, cares about his students"
1584,9231,4.5,4.0,"Good teacher, very nice and helpful, funny quiet humor."
1585,9231,1.0,4.0,I couldn't understand a single word!
1586,1516563,4.0,5.0,"Very helpful if you seek out his help.  He is a pretty bad at dumbing things down, but he will work with you till you understand the subject!  The tests, homework and quizzes are all pretty difficult. Work hard and you'll be fine though!"
1587,1516563,5.0,2.0,I followed him for one year. Smart and active. Best math professor ever met
1588,1516563,1.0,5.0,"I am taking this class at IU-Bloomington.He does not explain concepts clearly. He assigned problems for hw he was not able to solve in class. He is not helpful when you ask him questions and does not get grades back until a month or so after the test. He responds late, or not at all, to email inquiries. Overall, a tough professor to learn from."
1589,1516563,1.0,5.0,I m taking his class calc at IU Bloomington. I used to like Math but this guy is a very poor teacher and has killed my Enthusiasm for Math.
1590,1516563,1.0,5.0,"Couldn't understand what he was saying, hardly went to class because it wasn't worth it. He is nice, but definitely not a good teacher. Switch out if possible. Did well in the course only because everyone did so bad he curved it a lot."
1591,1516563,1.0,5.0,He seems like a nice friendly guy and he seems very knowledgeable about the subject but he cannot lecture to the class he is absolutely awful.  He gets into long problems and doesn't stop for 45 minutes and by the time he asks if anyone has any questions everyone is so lost they don't know where to start a question.  Find another prof at all costs!
1592,484376,5.0,1.0,I loved her! One of my favorite French teachers for sure. She made learning French so easy!
1593,484376,4.5,1.0,Superlative French teacher
1594,484376,4.5,1.0,Helen was the absolute best! She really cares about you as a person. She is so funny and really connects with her students. If you have to take french as part of a requirement TAKE IT WITH HELEN. She's amazing... always pumping you up telling the class how great we are. I want to be friends with Helen. 
1595,484376,5.0,2.0,Absolutely LOVE this woman. I took her at JMU and she is a joy. I love coming to class. She's extremely clear and hilarious. I would definitely recommend her!
1596,484376,5.0,2.0,She is the best. Always wanted people to be a part of class but never forced us.
1597,484376,5.0,1.0,Helen is the BEST! Reviews a lot and emails useful practice sheets before every test. Hadn't taken French in years before 2020 and still got an A. Definitely recommend her section!
1598,484376,5.0,3.0,Helen is the absolute best!! She is amazing and basically I want to be best friends with her. as along as we could speak english to each other! the class sucks but if you have to take it choose HELEN!!
1599,484376,4.5,1.0,"Helen Dunn was a blast to have as a French teacher! She's fun and totally gets the college student lifestyle. Class isn't hard, and she'll work with you for whatever you need. Very flexible teacher. If you have the option to get Helen as your teacher, DO IT!! She's the best!"
1600,484376,5.0,2.0,"Loooooooove Helen!!!! She is SO helpful, so funny, and truly loves her students. She always sets aside time to talk to us each day and yet we always do work and do well on the department tests. She's so fun, so great, and truly makes it an enjoyable class. Get her if you can!! Highly recommended."
1601,484376,5.0,1.0,AWESOME!  She is so cool.  I learned so much French and the tests really are manageable - just do her review sheets/know the vocab.  I ran into her a couple months ago and she is so funny and nice!  DEFINITELY recommended!!
1602,484376,4.0,3.0,"She is an awesome teacher. She sticks to the structure of the book, so it is easy to follow. The syllabus is an EXACT source for each day's work. If the book is not really clear on certain issues, Ms. Dunn clarifies the topic with handouts of her own notes. She is the best and most fun FREN 105 teacher!"
1603,484376,4.0,2.0,Don't take this course if you don't want to hear obnoxious french pop songs every now and then.
1604,484376,4.5,2.0,Mlle. Dunn is so much fun! I love it when she laughs! This class is pretty laid back (she tells lots of stories) and the tests aren't very hard. She tells you you need to know ALL vocab but you don't really need to know it ALL for her tests. The class is fast-paced but it wasn't hard for me because I'd already had many years of another language.
1605,484376,5.0,2.0,"Great. The class is fast-paced, but she doesn't waste too much time on stuff you don't need. Plus the test reviews are freakin money. Go to class everyday cause she gets upset when people stop coming (also because if very few people show up, she'll just hand out bonus points.) Overall a really nice woman and a casual class and not too hard at all"
1606,484376,4.5,1.0,"Ms.Dunn is really nice and wonderful. The class can be pretty informal, she has lots of jokes and anecdotes and tries to make the class fun, although there is too much of doing exercises from the book. I only had (lots of)spanish before the class and I did fine. But if you can't remember 2 chapters worth of vocab per week, think twice."
1607,484376,5.0,4.0,:)
1608,484376,3.0,3.0,"I like Ms Dunn and she is a good teacher. My only problem with the class is the structre of it and how qucikly we go through the material. Its about a chapter every 2 days. If you find 105 easy, you should be in 201, and if its hard, go back to 102. Dunn is one of the best though and makes 105 a realtivly painless affair."
1609,484376,5.0,2.0,"Really great.  I wish Helen taught every class through 202 because I would take from her every time.  Very fun, and takes class seriously.  Do your reading (which is minimal) or you hurt her feelings.  You get out late some times so don't schedule too long of a walk right afterwards.  Test review is tres helpful!"
1610,484376,5.0,1.0,This class is very easy if you've had French in high school.  Do not take it if you haven't had French before.  Mlle. Dunn is really nice and is more than happy to help you out if you need it.  Class is boring though because she pretty much just reads from the book and it meets every day...that's not her fault though.  You'll do fine on the tests.
1611,484376,5.0,3.0,This class was fun and I really liked the teacher.  We had parties sometimes and got to chat a lot together.  It was pretty tough at times but I think I learned a lot.
1612,484376,5.0,1.0,"She definately knows her stuff and she will write nice comments on your essays...class is easy for some1 who knows a good bit of french..dont recommend for beginners..because it is highly accelerated..i didnt like her too much though, i thought she was a little fake but if u can ignore that,thnuenjo"
1613,484376,5.0,3.0,"Nice teacher, fun class.  Hard if you've never had any French before.  I would recommend it, though, if you are interested in taking French."
1614,484376,3.0,4.0,No Comments
1615,484376,5.0,2.0,The class moves very quickly but she is very good at explaining hard concepts.  Wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't had French in high school.
1616,517149,1.0,5.0,"Just a bad teacher in general. His lectures aren't very helpful, his tests are impossible, and his homework grading policy hurts the people who don't cheat or use cramster to find the answers."
1617,517149,1.5,5.0,Highest paid professor in physics department
1618,517149,1.5,4.0,Not helpful at all in office hours. I got a B+ in 1610 and think I think I'm going to fail this class. Don't take it if you're not a physics major! They should not say Calc 1320 is the coreq.
1619,517149,5.0,4.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course, the pace was perfect for me. Professor Poon did an amazing job with making sure the students understood the concepts completely before moving onto more difficult problems. He goes into great detail with the material,and I really appreciated how he genuinely cared about whether or not the students understood or not."
1620,517149,5.0,3.0,"Although the material itself is hard, Poon does a great job of presenting it, much better than phys 231.  You can actually understand him and his tests are  fair, if a little hard.  He is hilarious, best physics teacher I've had"
1621,517149,1.0,5.0,Refused to answer questions.  unhelpful out of class. I only went to lecture to hear his hilarious (unintentionally) tangents
1622,517149,2.5,5.0,"Poon is quite excitable, often spilling out hundreds of words (in his trademark rolling accent) at record speed. Lectures were often hard to follow, which triggered many shaking heads and blank stares among classmates. He offers minimal aid outside classtime, often telling students to just review lecture notes and textbook. Should read the book."
1623,517149,3.5,2.0,"The class material was just plain tough and confusing, though through no fault of Dr. Poon's.  I think that he did a good job of presenting it.  He has an accent and phrases things kind of oddly at times, but I never had any difficulty understanding him.  If that sort of thing makes it really hard to learn from a professor for you, tough luck."
1624,517149,1.0,3.0,Really bad teacher. Trying to understand what was being communicated in class was like trying reconcile the existence of a benevolent all powerful god and the carnage of a plane wreck. It doesn't help that the book he picked only contained information on the first half of the class.
1625,517149,1.0,3.0,"Worst professor I've ever had.  Lecture was usually unintelligable, questions were often not answered, and frankly he was abrassive when out of class help was asked of him.  The text was at the wrong level.  By and large, the class was a complete waste because of him."
1626,517149,4.0,1.0,He's the most enthusiastic teacher I've ever seen. The demos are awesome and they keep you awake in class. Dr. Poon is clearly an successful entertainer for those who have already learnt the material before. Nice teacher!!
1627,517149,3.5,3.0,A pretty standard class with fairly rote material.  He did all right for a class that most people had already taken and weren't paying much attention anyway.  He is really into the material...tries to spice up the class with some fun demos.
1628,721950,5.0,2.0,"She was perhaps one of my favorite professor ever.  Made the class material as entertaining as possible, even though it is fairly challenging. One of the easiest people to talk to and get help from if you don't understand the material."
1629,721950,4.5,5.0,"Her class was the toughest I've ever taken, however, that is really a function of the subject matter moreso than the professor.  I thought she actually tried to make the class as painless as possible.  Prof. Hazelwood is very friendly and helpful.  She also pretty generous when it comes to late work and the final grade."
1630,721950,3.0,5.0,"She's beautiful, extremely intelligent, funny, and silly...but she's been heard on multiple occasions professing her desire to make her class a living hell for anyone who dares to take it. Avoid her at all costs unless you have a true interest in the subject and a lot of free time."
1631,2581536,5.0,1.0,"Rodu was super chill, didn't have to pay attention in lectures but there were occasional quizzes. Coding assignment every week and final project that was pretty flexible and interesting. Good professor, funny guy"
1632,99390,5.0,4.0,"This class is graded based on two midterms and a final, which are timed essay/short answer format. Professor Waldner was enthusiastic about the material, and the lectures were engaging. Attendance isn't mandatory, but it's hard to grasp the material if you don't go. Lots of readings each week, but I read about 60% and still succeeded."
1633,99390,2.0,4.0,"The reading load for PLCP 1010 with Waldner was disproportionately heavy for an intro level class. I say this as someone with a high tolerance for homework. I did more reading for this class than I did for my 3000s level literature class, and it's all dry. Would not recommend."
1634,99390,5.0,4.0,"Professor Waldner was amazing. Not only does he display a passion for the materials he teaches, but he also dedicates a large amount of his time and effort to his students. Without a doubt, you need to work a little harder in this class (reading), but Professor Waldner and the TAs are absolutely amazing and help you every step of the way."
1635,99390,4.0,4.0,"This course has interesting lectures, but STATA can be tough to manage. STATA can be done collaboratively, but cannot give answers. TA's are great and cover all the lecture material. Find a partner/group to study with for the midterm and finals, which are essay based. Overall, Waldner is a great person and cares about his students. Take the class"
1636,99390,5.0,4.0,Dr. Waldner was a great professor and lecturer. He was extremely knowledgable about the material and was obviously passionate about the subject. I found the lectures really interesting and did not miss any but the TA's cover the material fairly well in section so you may be able to get away with missing a few classes.
1637,99390,5.0,2.0,"I have really enjoyed this class so far. For an intro-level class, Waldner is incredibly engaging and likes to focus on the nuances in state-building and political theories. I do not do any of the reading because my TA would summarize it all in discussion so I would just read her powerpoints before the exam. If you pay attention in class, it's easy"
1638,99390,2.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR! He is condescending, goes way too fast, and explains things terribly during lecture. The amount of reading he assigns is absurd and they are not even helpful. I wish I could go back in time and slap myself for signing up for this class."
1639,99390,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor, he's really insightful and makes sure you're on top of your stuff in class"
1640,99390,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor, introductory classes could be tedious but he managed to make it funny and enjoyable. Lots of reading though, most of them are related to the topic yet not really fully discussed during the lecture. Some of his opinions could be quiet inspiring."
1641,99390,3.0,4.0,"There were a ton of readings but the textbook wasn't often used or referenced. I enjoyed the topic so I found the lectures interesting. For people who hated Waldner, I would say they do not like a lot of work. Also, because it was an introductory course, many students showed no interest in participating rather than Waldner being boring. "
1642,99390,1.0,5.0,Waldner is not funny or engaging. He is very arrogant and is not very adept at explaining things. He invents his own concepts and then does a poor job of teaching them. Lectures are painful to sit through. Avoid this class like the spanish influenza
1643,99390,3.5,4.0,"A lot of reading but you can get away with not doing some of them. Waldner is funny and engaging, although he strikes some as arrogant. He is the stereotypical New Yorker. I liked his teaching style, although he did tend to make simple ideas more confusing than necessary. Not a terribly hard class. TAs do all the grading."
1644,99390,2.5,3.0,"Interesting class and I learned a lot, but not what I expected. Way too much reading for a 1010 class. The material seems difficult, but it's really not that bad. Waldner is brilliant, but his teaching style was to explain simple ideas in a very complex way that made it difficult for me to learn. Must put in a lot of work to do well"
1645,99390,1.0,5.0,Way too much reading for a 101 class. Arrogant professor who tries to make himself sound intelligent rather than simply explaining the material. Class is very disjointed and readings very loosely apply to lectures. Tries to be funnier than he is. AVOID THIS CLASS
1646,99390,1.0,5.0,Absolutely miserable. Don't take
1647,99390,5.0,5.0,Dude is stone cold awesome.  His theory that heavy metal transformed autocracies in the Middle East is innovative and potentially testable.
1648,99390,5.0,3.0,"Seems like you either love Waldner or hate him; he rubs some the wrong way.  But he's really smart and a good guy, and can be very, very funny.  He's got a viewpoint, but that's refreshing in my opinion. People interested in development or comparative politics should definitely take a class with him."
1649,99390,2.5,4.0,Readings were long and difficult to comprehend. Tests were harshly graded and trying to do well was based on your TA helping to explain what you tried to read during the week. Teacher wasn't funny but thought he was and loved to stroke his ego.
1650,99390,2.5,4.0,"Waldner is really funny and tries hard to make the subject matter interesting.  Don't love the style of his class though, it gets tedious."
1651,99390,3.0,5.0,"Do not take this class if you are looking for an easy A or for a filler in your schedule or if you're a first year. Waldner was an awesome teacher but the material was very hard, the reading was very dense (and there was a lot of it), and he grades the class like a law school course (the final is 50% of your grade)."
1652,99390,4.0,4.0,"Way too much reading for a 2000-level class. I liked him as a professor and he has a lot of really valuable things to say, but the reading load is RIDICULOUS. If you're passionate about the subject matter, you'll do fine. If you're considering the course for a requirement, I wouldn't recommend it."
1653,99390,3.5,4.0,"he thinks he's really funny and he's usually not. lectures aren't mandatory because if you do the readings you can pass the exam, especially if you get in a study group. he posts the slides but they aren't helpful unless you took notes on what his blurbs of thoughts mean. exams are actually pretty easy; one all-encompassing question, most get Bs"
1654,99390,1.0,4.0,There are no his textbook at UVA bookstore.  We should go to Downtown. HOW COME&#63; His textbook is copies of other professors. Price is $52   .................Somehow there are NO .COPYRIGHT mark. HOW COME&#63;
1655,99390,4.0,4.0,"BEST PROFESSOR EVER! Yes, you will have to work hard in his classes, but our 5 hour J term block classes were simply chock-full of invigorating debates and discussions. He's hilarious and personable, but he WILL PUSH YOU. Expect to EARN a good grade."
1656,99390,5.0,5.0,"This guy is great. Best class I've ever taken. If you don't like it, maybe you aren't motivated. He knows his stuff and makes it interesting and fufilling."
1657,99390,1.0,5.0,"Guy has his own language (not the language of the field).  It's acceptable to him because he's the center of his universe.  Very narrow world view, academic and otherwise.  STAY AWAY FROM HIM."
1658,99390,1.0,4.0,"This professor is incredibly self-centered. He can't get over himself enough to actually teach the material. I got a good grade in the class, but I dreaded having to hear him talk about how much better he is than everyone else. He gives a very one-sided approach to Comparative Politics, forcing what he belives onto you. Don't say no one warned you."
1659,99390,4.0,4.0,This is the best class I've taken at U.Va.
1660,99390,4.5,3.0,"Slides are posted online so lectures aren't mandatory, but I still went to most because lectures were so interesting! Great professor, LOVED this class. Get a good TA; some are much harder than others"
1661,99390,2.5,3.0,The only challenging thing about this course was trying to fall asleep as Waldner continued to force his personal theories about world development on us and snubbing any others.  Readings are 100% useless and will not affect your grade. Pompous and aggravating professor (beware conservatives)
1662,99390,5.0,5.0,"Best professor I had at UVA, hands down... and the only one who got me to read all course material. Waldner probably improved my analytical writing more than all other professors I had combined. [no, I never took an English class at UVA] Be prepared to actually do work and finally be challenged..."
1663,99390,2.5,3.0,"Waldner is entertaining to say the least, but unfortunately he doesn't dictate your grade.  Find a good TA and the class will be fine.  Get a bad TA and you will regret not dropping it."
1664,99390,4.5,4.0,"Waldner makes the dry lecture material thoroughly enjoyable. I didn't want to skip class even though the slides were posted online. The assigned reading is usually unnecesary because he inserts articles &quot;for fun&quot; that never show up on tests or in discussions. As with large classes, TAs control grades, so get a good one."
1665,99390,5.0,5.0,"There is considerable amount of dense, complicated reading in this class; however, the professor is wonderful at elucidating. I found going to the lectures to be helpful as the professor would expound the lecture slides that he would post before each class. Try to have a clear understanding of the material. The professor may seem arrogant."
1666,99390,2.5,3.0,"Take a higher level CP if you are interested in politics - I found the intro scattered, hard to follow, many readings were irrelevant (or LOOSELY applicable to course material). Slides are posted online so there is little incentive to go to class. I wouldn't recommend this course."
1667,99390,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Waldner is such an amazing teacher. He is energetic and also funny, and his lectures are always interesting and engaging. Although the course is rather challenging, because of insane amount of readings, I thoroughly enjoy this class. Highly recommended!!"
1668,99390,5.0,4.0,"Comparative politics may sound a little boring, but he makes it so interesting. He's got a great sense of humor and while he takes the material seriously he cracks jokes and uses hilarious examples in class to get his point across."
1669,99390,3.5,3.0,"His lectures are hillarious and truly interesting. He is a firm believer in his own opinions, and you better not cross them (even in discussion). Overall, though, I loved the class."
1670,99390,5.0,4.0,"I've had him for 101 and now 414 and he has taught me more than any other prof at this university.  incredibly demanding, take 414 only if you're serious about politics, but it will take your understanding of the study of political science to a new level."
1671,99390,4.0,3.0,"Great professor! Makes lectures easy to understand (and posts them online). Examples are applicable to readings and very comprehensible. Jokes during lectures are a little dry, but his efforts to make you laugh should be commended :)"

1674,99390,4.0,3.0,"Awesome class! Dr. Waldner is a really funny guy who makes the subject interesting and easy to understand. Lots of reading, but it's generally not necessary. Midterm and finally were predictable and not too hard. If you have any interest in politics at all, take this class!!!"
1675,99390,3.0,5.0,"Very, very difficult.  A LOT of dense, complicated reading which I could never get through.  Lectures were all over the place and I didn't see the big picture until pretty much te night before the final.  Discussion didn't help much for clarity, but Waldner himself is helpful and a nice guy.  VERY HARD, LITTLE FUN."
1676,99390,4.0,3.0,"Waldner is an amazing professor who believes in the Power Theory in terms of explaining democracy and other political phenomena through space and time. Personally, I was not convinced by his theory at first, but I admire his effort in forming a powerful theory for comparative politics. Get a good TA. I do not know Susan Brewer. I had Chris Ferrero."
1677,99390,4.5,4.0,"Waldner is an amazing and captivating lecturer, so much so that I made it a point never to miss it.  However, the TA selection is very arbitrary, and I also had Susan Brewer, who grades EXTREMELY difficult.  The readings for this class are borderline ridiculous, and I don't understand the need for them all.  Still, it was generally worthwhiletaking"
1678,99390,4.5,3.0,"Amazing lecturer, although taking notes by hand it pretty much impossible.  The reading can be heavy and dense, but I got by pretty well without doing a significant amount of it.  A little intimidating as a class for a first-year, but I warmed up to it.  And I don't know what people are talking about with Susan, I got an A- on the midterm so A's ar"
1679,99390,5.0,2.0,"Avoid Susan Brewer. She is so unfair - doesn't give A's (see her own ratings page) and makes the material more confusing.  Waldner is awesome.  Yes, he moves really fast, but he puts the slides online so you can review them again on your own time. Just keep up with the readings, avoid Susan Brewer, and you'll be fine."
1680,99390,4.5,2.0,"Great lecturer, keeps students engaged. Clarifies readings in class. Talks quite fast but main points of lecture always emphasized."
1681,99390,4.5,3.0,"As mentioned, the readings are ridiculously dense, but Waldner is a tremendous lecturer who makes even the most difficult Max Weber readings understandable. The quiz and tests are very straightforward, no surprised. Elyssa is an awesome TA. Oh, and bring a laptop to class in order to keep up with Waldner's blistering lecture pace."
1682,99390,4.0,3.0,"Waldner is a good lecturer and I personally found the class to be interesting.  However... GET A GOOD TA!  It makes all the difference.  I had Chris Fererro and he was awesome, I would recommend him if he's still teaching.  Readings are annoying but not impossible and not TOTALLY necessary."
1683,99390,5.0,2.0,"One of the easier classes and a GREAT professor.  Sit in the front, take notes in class, and join a study group at the end to get the reading summarized.  The readings are hard and a bit ridiculous, but you dont have to do them if you go to class and take notes and join a study guide."
1684,99390,4.0,3.0,"engaging lecturer,but moves kind of fast through lectures. tests have choices between questions...interesting material."
1685,99390,4.0,2.0,"Great professor. Knows the material, and is able to convey it all easily to the class. Lectures are awesome.  Good amount of reading, but not a crazy amount. Tests are straight forward, assuming you went to class. Highly recommended."
1686,99390,5.0,4.0,"This professor is amazing. Not only does he make the class engaging with his lectures, but if you talk to him outside of class he will help you with anything you could possibly imagine. I went to him after he had been in office hours for 3 hours, and he still made time for me. The readings are difficult and long, but ultimately worthwhile."
1687,99390,2.0,4.0,"Worst class i've taken at UVa.  This guy is so arrogant and unprofessional it's absurd.  100% of the grading is subjective by the TAs, so make sure you get a TA that is an easy grader if for some reason you decide to take this class.  I definitely would not suggest it to anyone though."
1688,99390,4.5,2.0,"I highly reccomend this class! Waldner's lectures are engaging, thought provoking and entertaining. He is funny and doesn't take himself too seriously. Although weekly summaries mean you can't get by without doing the readings, they force you to know the material- which makes tests/essays that much easier to prepare for."
1689,99390,2.0,4.0,waldner is a funny guy and his lectures are interesting. the class makes you think about the world a different way. there is an insane amount of reading though and everything is graded very harshly. if you like witty and sarcastic humor and dont take yourself too seriously you will like this class
1690,99390,4.0,3.0,He's great!
1691,99390,3.0,3.0,"I get bad vibes from this guy.  He is arrogant and somewhat condescending.  Lecture makes me feel like I'm being talked down to.  Tests appear easy but be sure you answer thoroughly!  Readings are tedious.  Lectures can be entertaining, but as he likes to joke that we all want to say, &quot;F*** you, Waldner!&quot; I think half the class often does."
1692,99390,3.5,2.0,Waldner makes the class interesting. He often makes jokes and drops the F bomb. The class isn't difficult at all. Make sure you take good notes. There is a lot of reading.You can study for tests by going over the lecture notes. The only time youll have to incorporate the readings in when you write the 5 page paper. Not to difficult of a class.
1693,99390,2.5,5.0,"ridiculous--this class was made difficult for no reason.  pompous waldner is convinced his class is the only one worth investing time in for, as is apparent by the incredibly large amounts of reading per night, weekly summaries, and on top of that the 3 classes that must be attended weekly.  if you do take this course, don't take it w/waldner!!"
1694,99390,5.0,3.0,The class isn't that hard unless you're lazy and don't do the readings or go to lectures.  The lectures are very entertaining.  Waldner's a funny man.  Pretty nice too.  Only one paper and three tests.  Not bad at all.
1695,99390,3.5,5.0,"Very demanding intro class with tons of reading. He's a good, clear lecturer, might be arrogant but still funny in a snarky way and keeps the material pretty interesting. All essay/writing-related grades."
1696,99390,1.0,5.0,Don't take this clas or this professor.  He thinks he knows everything and that everyone else is wrong.  He tries to teach his own theories in class and his tests are beyond hard.  He is condescending and full of himself.
1697,99390,4.5,5.0,demanding but rewarding!
1698,99390,1.0,4.0,"He didn't care that my TA was a total ****.  I'm not being overly sensitive about it either.  My TA would never call on girls in discussion and if he HAD to he made sure that her opinion was properly ridiculed every time.  Waldner told me to talk to the TA about it, which to me shows a great amount of negligence.  Who wants to confront a **** TA&#63;  Wouldn't that just exacerbate the problem&#63;  At some level, the prof is responsible for the actions of his TAs.  For this, I give him a C-"
1699,99390,5.0,4.0,Great lectures
1700,99390,5.0,3.0,"Yes, he is condescending, abrasive, and very opinionated and will not hesitate to let you know what's on his mind, but that is part of his appeal. He is very much a New Yorker and a nice guy at heart, very very smart though I'm not sure I totally agree with his theories and politics."
1701,99390,2.0,5.0,"Besides being over bearing and condescending, he does not allow for anyone to remotely disagree with his pompous theories.  A self-professed atheist, he openly holds contempt for 'foolish' believers and has some sort of inferiority complex.  Can't stop talking about how Sabato is 'not that great.'"
1702,99390,4.0,2.0,No Comments
1703,99390,4.0,3.0,Very entertaining lecturer and his class gives a very different perspective on government than the usual stuff.  Easiness would depend on the TA IMO
1704,99390,4.5,2.0,One of the best professors I had.  One of the most memorable moments of my college career was when he climbed up on his podium and got the whole class to stand up and chant &quot;Long live the revolution!  Death to capitalist ****s!&quot;
1705,99394,1.0,1.0,JUST DONT TAKE HIS CLASS SOOOOOO BORINGGGGGGGGGG CAN LEARN THE CLASS IN A WEEK JUST BY READING THE TEXTBOOK
1706,99394,1.0,2.0,"I would rather read the textbook than go to his lecture, so boring and dry. This class is not worth my tuition."
1707,99394,1.0,3.0,"Goes through the textbook problem in class that was already in the reading, class makes zero sense. Do not explain well, very boring"
1708,99394,1.0,4.0,Prof. Louis's ethics course is graded arbitrarily and most of the course contents consists of students presenting. No team was given a grade better than a B+ on projects. He is also impossible to get in contact with and regularly fails to respond to emails.
1709,99394,5.0,2.0,"Really great guy if you take the time to get to know him. Can be a little dry, but he is very intelligent especially if you get him talking about subject he enjoys"
1710,99394,4.0,3.0,SYS201 is a boring class no matter who teaches it.  Louis is a nice person and is helpful.  It is hard to hear him sometimes though.
1711,99394,3.0,2.0,"Contrary to the comments below, from my class experience I found him pretty chill.  Also he does alot of humanitarian work on the side.  Overall a nice guy."
1712,99394,2.5,4.0,Didn't speak loud enough... and what's up with giving us all the work for a 1 credit class&#63;
1713,99394,1.0,5.0,if you are in sys you have to take his sys201. the only thing i can say is good luck
1714,99394,1.0,5.0,why am I a system engineer&#63;!! This guy doesn't know how to be COOL.
1715,99394,1.0,5.0,kick him out! nobody wants to see him anymore.
1716,99394,1.5,2.0,I thought everything was fine until he went nuts on my final project. Watch him close and keep a low profile in class. I left the department w/o degree because of the final project SNAFU and a related issue.
1717,99394,1.0,2.0,"Louis is a nice guy, but THE most boring professor you will ever have!  Who needs sleeping pills when you've got Louis&#63;  He's also the most unorganized man, he doesn't know his stuf.  But i heard he was an easy grader, we'll see I guess"
1718,99394,2.0,3.0,"really hard to understnad, talks very quietly.  Pretty boring lectures, but cracked a joke once in a while."
1719,99394,3.0,2.0,No Comments
1720,99394,3.0,3.0,"boring, but still knows his stuff"
1721,99394,1.0,1.0,"Should be teaching home economics, not engineering."
1722,99394,1.0,1.0,Who hired this guy&#63;
1723,99394,2.0,3.0,"monotonous tone of voice , boring"
1724,746572,5.0,4.0,"grades on 1 paper divided into 2 halves. worked great for me. some lectures are unnecessary. if you get a strong start the paper writing is easy. lots of research required to get a good grade, but many of the reading/lecture is meant to give ideas to include in the paper. find a topic and learn how to incorporate class content and its a breeze"
1725,746572,5.0,3.0,"Prof Schwartz is a really nice, funny guy. He's very understanding/accommodating when it comes to needing exceptions or extensions and is super aware of how stressful being a student can be. There's a lot of reading, but the grade is mostly made up by the two paper projects, which focus on a pretty narrow part of the total curriculum."
1726,746572,2.5,2.0,"super easy class!! all you have to do is write like 2 papers, go to discussion and take the final which is super easy and only an hour long. easy A. The prof is a little strange sometimes, but overall a nice guy and really smart. Ill be honest I skipped every other lecture and still got an A. Just do the important readings and you're good."
1727,746572,1.5,4.0,"Class had no general direction, more than half of the grading is a 16 page term paper which is not explained in any useful capacity. Never take this class. Midterm was beyond impossible for everyone."
1728,746572,4.0,4.0,"I had Prof. Schwartz over 10 years ago (power point was not used at the time) and he was the first person I thought to check on at UVA.  His were some of the few classes where I actually learned anything, and he left a lasting impression.  I hope future students will gain as much from his insight and iconoclastic attitude as I did."
1729,746572,4.5,3.0,Great professor.  Knows everything but doesn't make you feel stupid that you dont.  Very available for office hours -- teaches things that are challenging but interesting.  People followed him out of class every day to ask more questions.
1730,746572,2.5,3.0,"Nice guy, but did I really learn anything useful&#63;  No. If you take development hold out for Fatton (I took CP 212 with him and much preferred that class). This guy is very big on obscure facts and Powerpoint presentations so its impossible to draw a cohesive picture. Little/no assigned readings, no final were a plus (Only 30 peeps in our class tho)"
1731,746572,5.0,3.0,"Nice guy, watch for the flying chalk and markers - note: his lectures are not PG13 and four letter words are common..."
1732,1844321,1.0,3.0,"Prof Rowe doesn't allow other takes besides ones that align with her view point, no matter the critical merit. I rewrote papers because my perspective challenged hers. (She brings religion into the classroom, having us use the bible as academic literature, even though the space should remain secular, which often made me uncomfortable)."
1733,1844321,5.0,4.0,Taking Britta's class on Flannery O'Connor was the best decision I made all semester. She is kind and insightful and brings in a lot of her own outside research to contribute to class discussions. She does not hesitate to accommodate students; she grants reasonable paper extensions and offers revisions at semester's end. PLEASE take her class!!
1734,1844321,3.5,4.0,"Britta takes great care to do a lot of research to help expand each student's understanding of the material. That said, I often felt like she was a bit critical with the writing samples. Each student was required to do three a week (at least for the first half of the course). There is no way that each student didn't write 40+ pages for this class."
1735,1844321,4.5,3.0,"She is a fantastic teacher. The material you go over in class is very interesting and Ms. Rowe is very interested in what her students have to say and knows a lot about the topics discussed. It is hard to get above a certain grade on her papers, but she's an awesome teacher!"
1736,1844321,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Rowe is an awesome professor! There are a few readings every week, but never anything too heavy. You have 3 major papers due and then revisions of two of those papers at the end of the course. She is not a tough grader and facilitates lots of interesting conversation. Take her class! Easy A if you do well on the papers."
1737,1844321,1.0,5.0,"She's classes are not interesting at all, and you have lots of assignments to do every week. Also you have presentations and paper revisions, which are hard to get good grades."
1738,1844321,5.0,2.0,"Britta is a wonderful English teacher who knows what she is talking about. She doesn't assign loads of work, only a few major essays. She is also fairly lenient if you have to miss class. Overall, a great experience."
1739,328804,5.0,3.0,Its a hard class but he explains well and he tells you what you do and do not need to know so it really narrows the material well.  Hes pretty straightforward.  Good teacher.  Fair test.
1740,328804,4.0,3.0,Prof. Kawasaki is such a sweet man and he was a great lecturer for the most part.  His test was pretty straight forward.
1741,328804,4.5,2.0,If you do what he tells you to you will do fine.  Read the book and go to class and read his list of terms and know them.  He practically tells you what questions are on the test.  Very helpful in office hours.
1742,328804,5.0,5.0,I love masashi!
1743,328804,5.0,4.0,Fair fair fair. You do what he tells you you will do well.
1744,328804,3.0,4.0,"He has a thick accent which can be hard to understand, but over all he does a decent job and his test is hard, but fair."
1745,328804,1.5,4.0,Kawasaki is cool! He may be quiet and a lil hard to understand at times but a good teacher relays the material to the students.  He tells you what you need to know and it is up to you to familiarize yourself with it.  His test was good and up front.  Study what he tells you & you will do good.
1746,525424,4.0,2.0,"This was a core class, so it is bound to be a horrible class to begin with. His accent was a little hard to understand, but you get used to it. His notes and lectures follow along with the book nicely. Read the book, go to the lectures, ask him questions, and you will be fine. His tests aren't hard and he is helpful outside of class."
1747,525424,5.0,4.0,He is the best professor i've ever seen
1748,525424,1.5,5.0,"I hated the class. He is nice to listen to outside of the class, but class is MISERABLE. I use to love evsc, but because of him I HATE it."
1749,525424,2.5,5.0,"Overall this class was horrible. I really didn't learn that much. I thought it was REALLY hard to understand his accent. His slides were not in depth & he read them verbatum. The tests are ok, but require an analysis (sometimes) of the material. Unless you want an unstructured class with verbatum powerpoints, don't take this class."
1750,525424,3.5,1.0,"Overall I enjoyed this class. It can get boring, but overall I found the class fairly interesting. This class was also pretty easy and also not hard to make up. He posts the slides online, which are pretty much the entirety of the lectures. He's Italian and his accent is a bit thick, so he's a bit difficult to understand sometimes. Recomended!"
1751,525424,4.0,2.0,"Paolo is a great professor!  He's extremely approachable and does an admirable job of wading through the subject matter. The material can be pretty boring but he does a decent job of keeping us interested and constantly asks class opinion.  However, his Italian accent does sometimes get in the way, although it lightens the mood, too."
1752,525424,4.5,4.0,Paolo is a great professor! He's extremely approachable and does an admirable job of wading through all of the equations and derivations required for the subject. The material can be pretty boring but he does a decent job of keeping us interested and it's not too hard to get an A.
1753,525424,1.5,5.0,"He's Italian, so the accent doesnt help much.  But the class is horrible to begin with.  Stay away unless you have to take this for your major."
1754,525435,3.5,2.0,"If science isn't your thing the quizzes and tests can be challenging. However, if you meet with Black he is really helpful. He was very awkward and cute when teaching and always did fun demonstrations. He is also good looking, but sadly ladies he is taken."
1755,525435,4.0,2.0,"Great guy, pretty easy class.  If you need to take Astr 121 for a science credit take it with him.  Pretty easy quizzes and final, homework assignments help you study and boost your grade.  Just go to lecture and you'll be golden."
1756,525435,5.0,1.0,"Fun, easy class. He really is a nice guy, there are weekly homework assignments online, but google can give you most of the answers.  Only three quizzes and 1 final.  Awesome class, and he's hilarious if you pay attention to what he says."
1757,525435,4.0,1.0,"121 with black was a really easy class. You don't have to attend lecture, just go over the slides he puts online before the test and you will do fine"
1758,525435,4.5,2.0,"Black is quiet cool teacher.  He is not trying to stress you out which is cool.  He is passionate about his subject, tests were hard @ 1st but you get better.  He is nice and cute cuz he is quiet & shy in person. I recommend him highly."
1759,525435,5.0,2.0,"interesting no stress class, Black's a real good guy"
1760,525435,4.0,1.0,"Class a breeze.  No tests, no quizzes.  Simple homeworks with no wrong answer.  DONT miss class though, inclass assignments determine attendance.  Just one giant final paper.  Great class to do homework for other classes in.  Nice guy!"
1761,541829,5.0,3.0,One of the most engaging professors I have had at UVA.  A great person who really teaches from his experience and imparts more than just book learning.  What I imagined college professors to be like before I came to UVA.
1762,541829,5.0,4.0,"Absolutely one of the greatest English professors I have ever had in my entire life.  He is a bit challenging, but if you stay on top of the work his classes are some of the most rewarding at UVA."
1763,541829,5.0,4.0,"my favorite prof at UVA - he kept everything interesting and he really knows his stuff. plus, he played blues guitar for us. how cool is that&#63;"
1764,787594,4.0,2.0,"Shushanik is actually one of the best economics teacher I had ever known. She may be a little bit timid, but she knows the material really well and if you engage her with well-researched questions, she will answer effectively. With regards to difficult material, she does structure her reviews quite effectively and thoughtfully. Deserves the best!!!"
1765,787594,1.5,5.0,It seems she does not care. I dont know... At times I felt that she was pretending and trying to come accross as nice rather than trying to teach... well it might just be me...
1766,787594,4.0,3.0,"She is very helpful, willing to give extra explanation, good practice problems and interested in helping students succeed.  definitely a good pick."
1767,787594,1.0,3.0,the worst possible T.A. I couldnt understand anything she said.
1768,787594,5.0,4.0,"Definitely one of the best TA's for econ.  She's hard, but she does a great job of teaching the concepts.  Her classes always did better on the tests than the other TA's sections.  Yes, her name is foreign, but her english is great and she's very helpful.  She is very helpful in her office hours, and ensures that you are well prepared for tests."
1769,1442958,4.5,3.0,"offered extra sessions on kinetics outside class, explained things, all around good prof"
1770,1442958,4.5,3.0,excellent
1771,1442958,4.0,3.0,The textbook and the other reading materials provided throughout the course were very helpful and it is likely I will continue to use them during my other classes and in research. I enjoyed listening to the lectures because it was not just a repeat of the chapters in the book. I like the relation of the material in the book to studies and reviews.
1772,1442958,3.5,4.0,"This was a worthwhile course as I learned a lot about different biochemistry techniques and methods in the lab, as well as bioinformatics."
1773,1442958,2.5,3.0,"It was nice to get an in-depth treatment of DNA, but that is all we got.  Class time could have been used a little better, and it was frustrating to be perpetually behind the syllabus.  Understandably, the expectations were open-ended for a graduate class, but it did make the experience pretty aimless, especially with the literature critique."
1774,1442958,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Mura came across as being somewhat bitter; it was clear that he did not want to do this.  The lectures were somewhat pointless because they were focused on minutia.  The TAs meant well, but it became clear that we were on our own when--on multiple occasions--they told us one thing in lab and marked it down in grading the assignment."
1775,1442958,1.0,5.0,"This professor doesn't know what he's talking about. He's very unclear about what he wants from us. He likes to give pop quizzes (really&#63; in grad school&#63;) really really bad in explaining the concepts. He will take 15 mins to make the ppt works. If it is not working, class is canceled. I learned almost nothing from this class."
1776,1442958,1.5,4.0,"Disrespectful, constantly changes the syllabus, and lectures on the past lab instead of preparing you for the next one.  Doesn't give +/- grades either, which I found annoying.  Lectures are &quot;non-mandatory&quot; in the sense that he tells you that on the first day, but mandatory in the sense that he gave a pop quiz when only 20 students were present."
1777,1442958,2.5,2.0,"Biochemistry class began and was very interesting, with us discussing proteins (transcript, translation, etc), but then he dove in to all of this DNA structure stuff that no one cared about. His grading is very hard. No partial credit. No very clear in relaying concepts in class."
1778,2245778,5.0,4.0,"Professor Lee is an amazing professor and makes his lectures super interesting. Doing the readings is definitely recommended because they help a lot with the essays. Although he is a tough grader, this class was amazing and one of my favorites."
1779,2245778,1.0,3.0,"Find yourself short on sleep? Great news, at 9:30 am, professor Lee will surely put you to sleep! Even if you find the material interesting, Lee's droning voice is sure to bore you, and to make matters better he takes attendance in a 70+ person lecture. Only bad professors take lecture attendance, good professors know students will want to come."
1780,1229975,5.0,2.0,"Professor chruma is an amazing professor. One of the first who really made me understand chem, i had him for orgo 1 and orgo 1 lab and now ill have him for orgo 2. AMAZING lecture style, chalkboard and goes slow. very litrle homework and its not graded by correctness tests are hard but he offers chances to boost grade. READ THE TEXTBOOK!"
1781,1229975,2.0,3.0,A good professor and teaches well but is not considerate at all on a personal level.
1782,1229975,4.0,4.0,Professor Chruma cares about each of his students. He learned the names of everyone in his 200 person lecture and was always available to talk and help students. Organic chemistry is a hard course and you will not get away without putting effort in but if you go to Chruma's lectures and read the book it is difficult to fail.
1783,1229975,1.0,3.0,Professor Chruma for Orgo Lab is terrible! He simply does not care about the students at all. He makes you do so much in preparation for lab and nothing else. I don't know what he gets paid for. The TA you choose is the only thing that matters and mine grades super harshly but doesn't even read the procedure himself! This is a terribly run class.
1784,1229975,5.0,4.0,Hard class but if you put in the effort you should be fine
1785,1229975,5.0,3.0,"Very helpful guy. Class uses collab forum to help answer FAQ that come up while studying. Tests are hard but if you study hard enough and in the right way you can do well. Uses a different textbook from other professors and in my opinion, it's better than the other one."
1786,1229975,2.5,5.0,"OMG. STAY OUT OF THIS GUY'S CLASS. He might be a so called legend with his orgo LABs but heck, his lectures are TERRIBLE. We use an entirely different book from the other classes too (which is x2 expensive). He's an okay guy but no, do NOT take him for orgo - especially 2420 b/c it's worse than the first semester.Go with Marshall at UVa: safest bet"
1787,1229975,5.0,5.0,just remember to study for it consistently!!! every day! this is not an easy subject!
1788,1229975,5.0,3.0,GREAT PROFESSOR. DON&quot;T TAKE ANY OTHER ORGO PROFESSORS AT UVA. He really understand the material and makes it easily understandable to his student. Tests are really fair and not hard at all if you study a decent amount and do some practice from the book.
1789,1229975,5.0,4.0,"Such a great professor!  Gives great lectures, and the quizzes and tests aren't hard IF YOU STUDY FOR THEM.  Warning: it's easy to forget to study for this class, as other CHE classes are much harder.  Just devote an hour or two per week for studying, plus whatever time the homework takes (it sometimes takes a long time), and you'll do beautifully."
1790,1229975,4.5,5.0,"What that guy said.  Possibly the most useful lab class i've taken, but the grade distribution will give you nightmares.  Prepare to sacrifice a lot to get a good grade.  If you have the chance, get Andrew Yeagley as a TA.  By far the most helpful TA I've had at UVA."
1791,1229975,5.0,5.0,"Good news: This is perhaps one of the most rewarding labs you'll ever take. From aspirin to lidocaine to nylon to tetraphenylcyclopentadienone, you'll know a ton of chemistry by the end. Bad news: This is by far the most time consuming, nerve racking, almost unpleasant class the 80s series offers today (~15-20 hrs/week). Be prepared to work."
1792,2352315,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Krehbiel is one of the nicest profs at UVA that I know. She's fun, approachable, and cares a lot about students. Office hours help a lot, and she's funny too. Book necessary, class attendance necessary, but an easy enough class. Participation matters a lot, and there are a lot of paired activities. I definitely recommend her!"
1793,2032834,5.0,2.0,Not a lot of lecturing and no note taking required. Lots of open discussions between students guided by prof. Prof is balanced/fair in presenting political issues and great at navigating controversial/sensitive topics. Prof runs class in a way that helps us listen to each other and express our own views. An expert in the field he teaches.
1794,255184,2.0,3.0,"Gave the whole class an outline of his grading brackets and what percentage corresponds to what grade (generous brackets overall), but come the end of the semester grades did not match that bracket at all and what would've been an 87%  A was really a 93%  A. He manipulated students to think their grades were better than they really were."
1795,255184,5.0,3.0,"Barry Condron is an absolutely amazing professor. You can tell he really wants everyone in the class to do well. Tests were open note, but they were really hard. Optional final to replace one of the 3 tests. Absolute saint of a man."
1796,255184,4.0,3.0,"Prof Condron is a bit scatterbrained and his lectures are all over the place, but this makes them pretty entertaining. Interesting stuff and he has some funny stories. There were a lot of wrong answers on the HWs, so don't wait until the last minute to study using these. Concepts weren't bad, but he does write some tricky/weird exam questions."
1797,255184,5.0,4.0,Dr. Condron was an amazing professor. Its neurobiology so it's a hard course but he makes it a lot of fun and manageable. You can tell he's so passionate about the course. I would take it again in a heartbeat and I wish he taught more classes. He really inspired me and I highly recommend taking this course.
1798,255184,4.0,4.0,"I must say, let alone the tricky hard tests. THIS CLASS IS BY FAR THE MOST INTERESTING CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE. I just can't tell you how captivating this class is. Prof Condron is so amazing. sometimes it doesn't matter what grade you're gonna get in the end, what matters is how much you learned."
1799,255184,5.0,4.0,Prof. Condron was the BEST - he had funny lectures that were also dense with material - and wrote fair and challenging exams. He also let you come by and see a real human brain during exam week :)
1800,255184,5.0,4.0,"Barry is an amazing teacher! Very well respected by his students and he makes learning a lot of fun, you can tell he is very interested and invested in what he's teaching. Tests are difficult, but if you study the power points and listen to the lectures you should be fine. Office hours are great resources and he will give lots of hints and tips."
1801,255184,4.0,3.0,He's a pretty awesome professor. Do YOUR part and you will succeed.
1802,255184,5.0,3.0,"Barry is one of the best professors at UVa. He is SO inspirational to his students, and really cares about what he is teaching you. He is not the common professor who tries to trick you in tests or make them super hard. SO easy to get an A if you do this simple trick: write down everything he says (record lecture) and do the flashcards he gives."
1803,255184,4.0,4.0,"Condron is incredible! If you get the chance, take this class. It's heavy material, but if you like neuroscience you'll fall in love with the class and his lectures. He's very helpful both in an out of class, and you can get away with not reading if you attend class (although I would recommend it). Absolutely wonderful, favorite class by far. "
1804,255184,5.0,3.0,"Condron is my favorite teacher I've ever had! I advise going to every lecture and recording them.. Before tests listen to them again and only use the book to look up things you do not understand. His tests are hard, but straight from lecture. He's also very good about letting students reschedule exams if there is any sort of conflict. "
1805,255184,5.0,4.0,"Never skip a class.  Record lectures if you can and listen to them.  Don't bother buying the textbook.  All his tests are lecture based and multiple choice.  He has 3 tests and final is noncumulative.  Amazing lecturer, has great personal storiesexperience with research which he shares with the class.  Not an easy A, so GO TO CLASS.  "
1806,255184,5.0,3.0,"Barry is by far the best teacher I have ever had at UVa. I REALLY wish that he taught more classes here, but alas his Neurobiology class is the only one. He is super hilarious, and the curve is VERY generous. Make sure to record lectures so you can relisten. You don't really need a textbook unless you're confused on a topic."
1807,255184,5.0,4.0,Condron has been my favorite professor at UVA so far - loved this class! Lectures are dense but still interesting - Condron is a funny guy :)  If you want to do well in this course you MUST attend lectures.
1808,255184,5.0,4.0,"His lectures are jam packed with info but he makes it very succinct and spells out what he wants students to know. He often ended early, but still had more substance than other profs who drone on the whole class time. He seems like a nice guy too, couldn't have asked for a better experience. I'd say to take the course w/prior bio knowledge."
1809,255184,5.0,4.0,"Amazing prof, extremely animated and tries to explain things in ways that you can understand. He extremely passionate with neuro & it's infectious. He never makes it boring even though the material was dense. Funny guy. Be prepared to do a lot of studying, 3 exams only, no hw, 20+ ch, & they are TRICKY but decent curve at the end. Best UVA prof."
1810,255184,5.0,4.0,"The curve was generous, my scores were bad but I got a B-. A lot of material to memorize, but you just have to focus on what's in the lectures. Best way to study was to answer questions he gives you for each lecture. Get someone to do them w/ you, it makes preparing much easier. The info was valuable and interesting! :)"
1811,255184,5.0,3.0,"Barry is great.  He is very passionate about neuroscience and his lectures are extremely fun and informative.  The tests are tough, but the curve is great.  Overall a great professor.  I will miss his class."
1812,255184,4.5,4.0,"He was an awesome teacher, much better than Provencio! Interesting, informative... he definitely made you want to come to class. Essentially, it's a good bio elective. The curve at the ends brings up your grade substantially. Think cell bio and be prepared to study a lot. All in all, this class was great!"
1813,255184,5.0,1.0,awesome prof and so nice!  starts late and ends early...so sad that this course isn't offered anymore.
1814,255184,5.0,2.0,"He ROCKS! He's extremely interesting and excited about his subject. Unfortunately, theyre discontinuing this class but he's a wonderful professor who really knows his material. This class was one of my favourites of all time because of him :)"
1815,255184,5.0,3.0,"Barry is a top bloke and the best science lecturer i've encountered. Articulate, confident and enganging. Never goes over time. The multiple choice tests are relatively difficult, but what makes the subject more difficult is the bell curve. Material is extremely enganging for science majors, ie. diseases, bioterrorist weapons, etc."
1816,255184,5.0,2.0,"This guy is great- so enthusiastic and keeps you interested in lectures. The lecture questions are a great help on the exams, and he made the topic of Biology really interesting for a non-science person."
1817,255184,3.0,3.0,He is very enthusiastic about the topics and is extremely knowledgeable about them. Tests are hard though. Definitely not as clear as I thought they'd be. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about important and modern science issues.
1818,255184,3.0,3.0,Passionate.  Interesting.  Tough test writer.  This is one of those classes in which you just have to be good at multiple choice because studying for the tests doesn't really help.  It's all about how well you can apply the simple material presented in the lectures to challenging test questions in the most logical manner.
1819,255184,4.0,4.0,AWESOME professor.. he is very excited about his lectures and the topics he studies so it's easy to enjoy his class and it's very easy to do well IF YOU STUDY the material!  Barry Condron is enthusiastic and very interesting.. I dont know you you COULDNT love his class! I wish he taught more non-science major courses!
1820,255184,2.5,4.0,"Imaging taking the one thing you hate most (science in my case) and having someone get unbelievably excited about it and jump up and down about it in front of a captive audience for a whole semester... this is my hell, and survival biology."
1821,255184,5.0,3.0,"best professor I had first semester, and it was my favorite class despite it being my worst grade. 5 tests, he takes the 4 best grades. extremely interesting subject matter, interesting lectures. grading is tough though. i got an 81% overall but still a C because of curving. still recommend it, tho"
1822,255184,4.5,3.0,"A great professor, engaging & organized lectures.  Learned a lot about very interesting subjects.  Tests can be difficult."
1823,255184,4.0,2.0,"Best lecturer I've had at UVA. Makes hard subjects extremely clear and deals with events that are in the news. Very funny guy. Take notes on the online lecture outlines and study the practice questions. Huge class, but pretty easy."
1824,255184,5.0,3.0,"Great prof, if you can take any of his classes, especially survival bio, you really should.  i'm a history major, but i still loved the class.  he made it really interesting.  once again, great prof."
1825,255184,3.0,2.0,"Very interesting class, realtes to world events.  Lecture notes often difficult to understand. If you listen in lecture and go to review sessions it is a relatively easy class. Worthwhile if you like the basics of biology."
1826,255184,3.5,2.0,"Nice guy, interesting material, doesn't really explain things well in lecture, tests straight from notes, so if you study, you'll do well."
1827,255184,3.5,3.0,"This is a cool class if you want an easier and more interesting science class. There is no reading- the only work you have to do is study for the exams and you can even drop the lowest. He does talk fast though, but he grades on a bell curve so as long as you get above average you'll get a B!"
1828,255184,4.5,3.0,"Professor Condron is a good, funny teacher who is very interested in his subject.  You get used to how fast he talks very quickly.  Study for the exams!"
1829,255184,5.0,3.0,Awesome prof
1830,255184,5.0,3.0,"Biology was one of my least favorite classes in high school but this class is so interesting and you learn about cool things like stem cells, genetic modification, brain implants and up-to-the-day happenings in modern science. Great great great teacher! I wish he taught other lower-level classes."
1831,255184,5.0,1.0,Barry was the best teacher I had at UVA take survival bio if you can.  Its an awesome class
1832,255184,5.0,4.0,Barry is awesome! This class is the sole reason i switched my major from english to human biology. His energy and love for the subject rubs off on you. take this class.
1833,255184,5.0,3.0,No Comments
1834,255184,5.0,3.0,Great prof!  Keeps class interesting consistently...Definitely a recommended teacher!
1835,255184,5.0,3.0,Prof Condron is a truly great lecturer. This has become one of my favorite classes and i typically despise biology! I would definitely reccommend it!
1836,763100,5.0,4.0,"This is a required course for the major/minor that focuses on an intensive grammar review and writing (6 compositions, grammar exercises, midterm, and final). Prof. is energetic, quirky, smart, and unbelievably kind. She expects you to work hard, but gives you the tools to succeed. You will learn to edit your writing really well and improve a lot."
1837,763100,3.5,2.0,"very sweet, always tries her best to help you understand the grammar, though she can be rather disorganized."
1838,763100,5.0,4.0,She was an extremely effective 201 TA; very approchable and organized. She helped us with any outside questions and offered to meet with us whenever possible. She was personable and funny with a perfect accent. I highly recommend her for any section of French.
1839,763100,5.0,4.0,"An amazing teacher!very helpful. will do anything to help the students so aks questions/go to office hours. very nice and funny, i loved the class!"
1840,763100,5.0,2.0,"Just wonderful!  She only lectured a few times and was more of a teaching/technical assistant for the class.  Great French, really friendly and helpful.  Hope she'll teach a 300 or 400 level course next year."
1841,763100,5.0,1.0,"Smith is such a great TA!! Her accent is amazing! For those who can't tell, she's Brazilian! She speaks like 5 languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese, English and Japanese&#63;) The class is a lot of busy work but I mean, it is French 101 but she tries to make it really interesting by telling little stories about her life in France."
1842,763100,5.0,2.0,"She is one of the best teachers ever! She has a great accent and a great knowledge about the French culture. She makes funny jokes during class and motivates you with compliments all the time. Although the class was 5 days a week, I enjoyed the class every day! Take her class if you are interested in learning French!"
1843,763100,4.5,3.0,Really nice TA with a beautiful French accent.  Prepares practice tests to help students prepare for tests.  Tells funny stories about life in France and cultural misunderstandings between French and Americans.
1844,533736,5.0,3.0,One of the kindest and most thoughtful professors at UVA! Professor Allen is incredibly considerate when addressing all perspectives and his lectures are so interesting. I learned so much in his Adolescent Psychology class that I think about and apply on a daily basis.
1845,533736,5.0,3.0,"Super knowledgeable and kind professor. Three tests + a cumulative final. Lowest non-final test grade is dropped, and you can also replace a test grade with an easy optional paper (did it in a day). He pulls from the readings for some test questions so you do have to do readings. Readings can be dry sometimes, but overall I definitely recommend him"
1846,533736,4.5,3.0,MOST interesting professor at UVA! Knows exactly what he's talking about. Material is extremely interesting esp. when he uses supplemental videos and examples ! Exams include MC & essay--use your TA! Makes it so much easier. Need to come to class to have a clear idea of what he's taking about on his provided outlines. Highly recommend !
1847,533736,5.0,3.0,"Joe Allen is one of the best professors I've had. He is extremely passionate about the subject (Adolescence) and his lectures are interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed this class. The exams were a little difficult, but not unbearable. As are definitely possible if you study."
1848,533736,4.5,1.0,"Interesting lectures and uses a lot of good examples like 90s sitcom episodes. Tests seem tricky at first but if you take good lecture notes, they're not so bad. He also gives a lot options to improve your grade like an optional paper and dropping a test grade, so if you put ion any effort you'll get a good grade."
1849,533736,5.0,2.0,Prof Allen is one of the best professors I've had--so helpful and approachable! He also makes lectures extremely engaging which is hard in a class that early and at that size. You have to go to class and do the reading to do well but it's well worth the effort. I definitely recommend this class to everyone--one of the best I've taken at UVA!
1850,533736,5.0,4.0,"I loved this class and Prof Allen is the man. He is SO nice and SO helpful, and lectures are really interesting. Have to go to lectures and read the book to do well, but the subject is interesting enough to warrant it. Allen knows his stuff and just wants you to now it too! LOVED this class, take it!"
1851,533736,5.0,2.0,He was AMAZING!!! This is a wonderful class and one of my favorite at the UVa.He is very helpful and easy to approach.He used lots of video clips which made lecture interesting.It was worth waking up in the morning.Many of the topics are things that college students can relate to and the tests aren't that bad if you go to lecture and read the book
1852,533736,5.0,2.0,"VERY interesting class. Professor Allen is very knowledgeable about the subject and conveys the information in various manners to ensure clarity (funny video clips, for example). Highly recommend for any student, regardless of major."
1853,533736,5.0,3.0,"Really great guy, and a very good lecturer. He's not the best in the department, but he's definitely up there. Some of the class is sort of common sense, but some of it really is interesting, and it also indirectly teaches you ways to be a good parent. If you want an A, go to class and read the book."
1854,533736,5.0,2.0,He is a very helpful professor. The video clips are awesome and tests aren't hard. I would definitely reccommend this class to anyone--not just psychology majors. :)
1855,533736,4.0,1.0,"Reiterating what everyone else said: amazing person and professor.  Bends over backwards for his students, gives great lectures, readings are interesting as well, tests are easy (in addition to being easy by themselves, you can drop a test AND you can write an optional paper to sub a bad grade).  Wish I had gone more, but it was at 9:30 am."
1856,533736,5.0,1.0,"One of the best classes I've taken at UVA, which is rare to say for really easy classes, but in this one you still learn a lot despite the easy tests. He is a great prof, engages the class- just make sure you go to lecture because he covers a lot that isn't in the book, and you're expected to know it for the tests."
1857,533736,5.0,2.0,Best class I have ever taken. You will want to go to every lecture because the material is so interesting and he is an awesome lecturer. Fun and entertaining videoclips!
1858,533736,5.0,1.0,"The best teacher I've ever had, not just at UVa but ever. Hilarious, brilliant, wonderful lectures I never wanted to miss and was actually sad to see end. Great film clips EVERY class, from Kids to My So Called Life. Very easy tests"
1859,1721584,4.0,2.0,No doubt one of the nicest professors at UVA. Always dedicated to helping students with anything ranging from exams to hw/projects to career advice. Very fun to talk to during office hours. Course material was fairly straightforward and assignments weren't backbreakers; never hard for anyone to get an A. Lectures were sometimes a bit boring though.
1860,443635,5.0,3.0,"A lot of reading for sure, but some are interesting, like the BF Skinner book. He over hypes when he talks, which makes the class very interesting. Has a great sense of humor. I love how we run discussions for seminar. We get to debate everyone including him. Very helpful outside of class."
1861,443635,4.0,2.0,"The topics discussed in the class are very interesting if you like politics. The lectures are clear and make the readings make a lot more sense and his british accent and cursing keeps things interesting. The TAs do not grade easily, but the paper topics are not hard. I tried to skip this class a lot but it was too interesting to skip."
1862,443635,4.5,2.0,"An amazing lecturer, and overall brilliant professor.  He poses sound arguments against+for each of the theories discussed, and ensures that you walk away from lectures with a good understanding of the readings done outside of class.  I would take this course again if I could!  (Also: he gets super excited about the topics, so that's fun to watch.)"
1863,443635,4.0,3.0,Professor Bird is an extremely active teacher with a ridiculous amount of excitement when he teaches. He's fun to listen to and very clear. He puts up slides that make life pretty easy. The readings are dense and grades really depend on your TA. Be prepared to have confusing concepts to digest and take care of them in discussions.
1864,443635,4.0,2.0,"Bird is funny and a very good teacher! His slides are clear and he likes to tell jokes, especially in the beginning of the semester. I was told political theory is supposed to be the hardest intro class, but Bird didn't really make it seem that way."
1865,443635,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Bird is very enthusiastic and gets really excited during his lectures, so they're always interesting. But in all seriousness, he's pretty good at explaining the material. However, the word limit for answers on his tests can be annoying. Otherwise the class was enjoyable."
1866,443635,4.0,4.0,"He is hilarious, loves the subject, test are really clear with no surprises, papers can be a bit tricky so get help from the ta, readings are dense but not necessary because he goes over exactly what they mean in class"
1867,443635,4.5,2.0,"Bird is fantastic. A really great guy who seems to genuinely want his students to learn. Doesn't care for unnecessarily hard grading or trying to trick his students. Straight-forward grading and tests,lively and hilarious lecturer and really brilliant guy. I will be taking him again next semester."
1868,443635,5.0,4.0,"Took his class during his year at Georgetown- I wish we had him permanently! Bird gives entertaining, informative lectures and manages to get the students involved while keeping things low-stress. He made every topic interesting, which is hard to do in an intro gov class. Helpful office hours &manageable workload. Buy his book for help with papers."
1869,443635,4.5,4.0,"Probably one of my favorite professors at UVA. You're lucky to get a spot in his higher level courses, but if you do, it's worth the difficulty of getting in."
1870,443635,4.0,4.0,"Bird is a GOD, the coolest professor I have had, the TAs are awesome too! Take this class, no matter what your major is. He is an entertaining lecturer. I sent him an email at 10pm days before paper was due, and got a response in 10 mins. He even met with me the day before the paper was due (for both papers) to give help on structure and arguments."
1871,443635,5.0,3.0,"Great professor! V. clear and helpful, awesome lecturer, makes political theory interesting"
1872,443635,4.0,3.0,"hes ok but im a bad student sincerely, daniel myatt"
1873,443635,2.5,4.0,"Grading system is ridiculous. 2 papers and one final, each worth 33% of grade. You don't turn the second paper in until the last lecture. Meaning, by the time he has finished teaching the ENTIRE COURSE, you only know 1/3 of your overall grade. Oh, and if you get a bad grade on your first paper, don't expect comments on how to improve on the second."
1874,443635,3.5,3.0,Very knowledgeable but almost to the point of making you feel like he just likes to hear himself talk.  A ton of reading.  Only take his classes if you're really interested in the material.  Otherwise you'll be bored to tears.
1875,443635,5.0,3.0,"Great professor.  Underestimates the coherence and relevance of Plato's metaphysics, but generally well informed."
1876,2581750,1.0,5.0,"Dont expect to get any feedback on anything you turn in.  Turned in an interview protocol in February for review, got the feedback at the end of March after I had turned in the interviews and written another paper describing the process. Thats when I found out what needed to be fixed."
1877,918776,5.0,1.0,"Took his ""Modern Poetry"" seminar.  Literally the best class I've ever taken.  Chris is absolutely brilliant, funny, and engaging.  His enthusiasm is infectious.  Even if you think you have no interest in poetry, take this class!!!  There are 2-page responses due every week, 3 6-page papers, and a final, but he's a lenient grader."
1878,918776,5.0,3.0,Makes almost any subject or topic interesting and understandable. Very funny and will go out of his way to help students.
1879,918776,4.5,3.0,"Very smart guy, very funny, presents material in an interesting and provocative way.  Highly recommend any of his classes!"
1880,918776,5.0,3.0,Incredibly entertaining. Definitely a teacher who is on the students' side. I loved this class.
1881,918776,5.0,4.0,Favorite class this semester. Chris is both extremely interesting to listen and talk to and very witty and funny. This class is never dull and it is easy to participate because he is not intimidatig either. You won't regret taking this class.
1882,918776,5.0,3.0,"Definitely take this class.  Yea, there's a two-page paper due every week unless it's a week that one of three major papers is due, but that makes it easier to figure out something to write about for the big ones.  Chris is awesome and so helpful, both in and out of class.  Plus, he's really witty and funny."
1883,918776,5.0,3.0,"Without a doubt my favourite class for the semester. He raised complex philosophical questions without putting the class to sleep. Very, very amusing professor!"
1884,918776,5.0,3.0,"He's a cool easy going grad student, the class was really interesting. He's big into philosophy, a little complicated but nothing dull. He always has some random funny thing to say."
1885,550141,1.0,5.0,"Professor Schoyer is possibly the worst art teacher I have ever had. She wastes an immense amount of time during class rambling about things that have nothing to do with the course material, so we have absolutely no class time to work on insanely hard and time-consuming projects. Please please don't take this class."
1886,550141,2.0,4.0,"Schoyer will make you do a ridiculous amount of projects, you will have to do a large majority of the work outside of class, she doesn't teach techniques so you'll have to figure everything out yourself, and she is incredibly disorganized. This class kept me stressed on a daily basis and made me resent drawing. I advise choosing a different prof."
1887,550141,1.0,4.0,You get two classes to miss before she drops your final grade. She tells you to do something instead of explaining how to do it. You will have to do an insane of work outside of class. The class is expensive and she expects you to have all the materials by the second day of class.
1888,550141,2.5,4.0,"If you absolutely have to take intro to drawing then pick another teacher. Schoyer is too scatterbrained for a syllabus, she gives a lot of homework, and you will normally work on multiple projects at once. The class is two and a half hours and only about half the time is spent working on your project so most of your work is done outside of class."
1889,550141,4.0,4.0,"Love/hate relationship. Need experience in art. I was always incredibly satisfied with my projects & felt really accomplished, but she assigns significantly more work than other professors. 5 hours a week in class/6-8 hours homework. Your grade is based on improvement over the course. She's hard to satisfy & the only grade is your final portfolio. "
1890,550141,1.5,4.0,Ive taken art all my life and Schoyer's class is the only one that ever made me dread and hate art. She is very one-sidedand only gives good grades if its her specific abstract style. She's doesn't teach students how to use the mediums or skills very well. She makes student conform to her weirdly abstract style instead of developing their own. 
1891,550141,2.5,4.0,"Schoyer focuses mainly on the abstract rather than the realism. I took this course as an Intro to Drawing but felt behind (even though I had taken Art in High School). Others who had never taken art felt and soon fell behind, since she doesn't actually teach and demonstrate skills, she simply tells you what to do and gives moderate feedback. "
1892,550141,1.5,2.0,"She gives confusing and contradictory instructions, interferes with student work, and grades inconsistently.  Not to mention, she expects you to spend a lot of time working outside of class-- which is fine if this is what you're interested in.  If you don't need this class for your major, though, I would advise against taking it for fun."
1893,550141,4.0,2.0,professor Schoyer amongst the best professors I have had whilst attending UVA. I had her for a full year ( ART 1610 2620) and she continues to be a mentor to me. I ask her for advice on which classes to take etc. She remembers all her students and care deeply about the final pieces that each student creates. She tuly values each students talent.
1894,550141,4.0,4.0,"Schoyer is really interested in what she teaches and is eager for her students to learn. She assigns a lot of work compared to the other art classes, but she has the most interesting and creative assignments. She prefers abstract to realism and wants you to experiment outside of your comfort zone. you cant help but improve. i loved this class."
1895,550141,4.0,2.0,She is very interested in individual expression and making sure you have the basic skills to be a good artist. I find her to be an excellent teacher who is excited about her students and teaching them.
1896,550141,3.5,4.0,"Professor Schoyer is the kind of professor that you love yet can't stand. She makes you do random assignments a random times; she changes due dates ON due dates, she greatly prefers abstract to realism. However, she is also involved and truly cares about a student's success in her class. Be ready for a lot of extra work and stretching your skills."
1897,550141,3.0,3.0,"This class does require a good amount of work. The assignments can be bizarre and she can be fairly intense but the variety gets you to try new techniques, materials, and subject matter--which is always good in an art class. Overall, if you work hard and listen to Schoyers sometimes crazy advice you can't help but improve. Definitely worth taking."
1898,550141,4.5,4.0,Great class.  She expects her students to think creatively.
1899,550141,2.0,5.0,"It's like she figures out what her students would hate to do the most, and then she tells them to do it.  You need to endure this class to get into higher level art, but if that's not what you're here for, then run the hell away - this class taught me the meaning of hell."
1900,550141,4.0,3.0,I loved this class. The assignments were really creative and Ms. Schoyer was very helpful with ideas and advice. The projects do require a lot of out of class time but if you love making art you will enjoy this class.
1901,550141,1.0,4.0,She was really spacey and gave rediculous assignments.  They taught us nothing and her feedback was bizarre.  She wasn't into her students at all.
1902,550141,2.5,4.0,"Elizabeth Schoyer seems like a really nice person, but she doesn't ever really explain her projects.  She lets you rework all projects, which is good, but she usually doesn't tell you what to change until after the assignment is finished."
1903,550141,4.0,4.0,"A fast-paced drawing class.. Schoyer is pretty loose with her drawing advice, don't be surprised if you have no idea what she's talking about, just keep drawing."
1904,550141,3.5,3.0,"She really pushes you in new directions. She gives a lot of creative freedom because the projects are so subjectively based. Still, the bad part is that she changes her mind every 2 minutes and constantly makes u change things on a whim. So it's hard to tell how she'll grade because it seems to be randomly based on what she feels on the spot."
1905,550141,3.0,4.0,"don't take it if you are looking for a fun,easy class."
1906,550141,4.5,4.0,"She is very demanding and the class has a lot  of outside work.  Ms. Schoyer is more into creative/abstract styles rather than traditional drawing.  She is very nice and I did enjoy the class, but if you are looking for an easier drawing course check out the other art professors."
1907,550141,2.5,3.0,No Comments
1908,468238,5.0,3.0,"Tina is a thoughtful and deliberate educator and leader among her peers.  I've taken other adv patho courses and agree that by far, she makes the material most accessible and focuses her course and lectures in a way that is realistic and relevant to as broad an audience as possible."
1909,468238,5.0,3.0,She is absolutely excellent.
1910,468238,5.0,1.0,"This was an excellent class, her lectures were thorough and mostly up to date.  The group work and homework were graded fairly.  She is a terrific teacher who clearly cares about her students."
1911,468238,4.5,4.0,"She's SO on top of her game, dedicated to her students.  She doesn't pretend that patho is easy- it's not, but she's amazing at teaching it!"
1912,468238,3.0,4.0,"I took this class as it was mandatory and important information was conveyed.  I felt I did everything possible to secure a good grade studying, reading and using other resources to reinforce the knowledge I was getting.  I did pass the class.  The professor was not helpful when I requested clarity on topics.  She said I needed to read the book!!"
1913,468238,3.5,4.0,"Great class.  Very responsive to questions. Unfortunately, did not have her for undergrad, which  many of us were at a diadvantage for the adv class. Also geared toward hospital settings especially critical care, even though the majority of of the class would later be in primary care. Needed more men's health and psych issues which are prevalent in"
1914,468238,4.0,5.0,"Great teacher, but often the class was geared for Critical Care RNs. Learned tons that will be useful for my future practice. SON is lucky to have her!"
1915,468238,4.5,4.0,"Tina teaches the best and most useful classes in the nursing school. She is open, supportive, and loves to engage with students who are eager to learn. Her advanced patho course was the best and most useful class I took in this program. She also writes incredible LOR's, so be nice to her!"
1916,468238,3.5,4.0,"She has a fun sense of humor, but the atmosphere of her classroom makes sleeping very easy. The information is good, but her exams are moderately hard."
1917,943387,1.0,2.0,"I would avoid taking ENWR with &quot;professor&quot; Keeling.  Very unprofessional, and his comments on papers often show that he barely skims over your work.  You better make a good first impression as he pretty much decides your final grade in the class after the first few weeks.  With that said, you can do little to no work and get a B or B+."
1918,943387,4.5,2.0,Very down to earth professor. Passionate about what he teaches. The class is pretty easy but definitely go to his office hours if you need help with your writing assignments. Had four papers in total which was not too bad.
1919,943387,5.0,3.0,"PhD in philosophy, enough said."
1920,943387,3.0,3.0,The class is a little boring. But some of the stuff he taught was useful. And he lets you turn in your papers as many times as you need before you really have to turn it in.
1921,943390,4.5,3.0,"Sechser is an extremely organized and clear lecturer. His visuals are orderly and even without doing reading, as long as you follow along in class the exams and papers will be pretty straightforward. He takes iClicker questions at the beginning of each lecture for attendance, but they help your grade in the end more than anything. Interesting class"
1922,943390,5.0,1.0,"Great lecturer - charismatic and engaging, but also super informative. Learned more in this class than I have in any other UVa class. He is a good resource in office hours as well as over email. Very clear and always helpful. "
1923,943390,4.5,1.0,"Easy class, but avoid it! Couldn't be more boring. Too many readings, most are useless for the exams. Do them if you want to do great in discussion section but don't make my mistake of actually reading every single one of them. His views are very pro-US and the assignments barely allow any creativity if you're genuinely interested in the subject."
1924,943390,3.5,2.0,"Sechser's class is pretty easy. The only grades are a midterm, a final, and a policy memo you write parts of during the whole semester. You are required to take one exam and it will count for both grades or you can take both and average them, so do well on the first one and you dont have to take the final. Dont need lecture, boring, read the book."
1925,943390,5.0,1.0,"Really nice guy, easy to follow and understand. Lectures can get a tad boring, but overall not bad."
1926,943390,5.0,4.0,Prof. Sechser is very clear and concise. His lectures are straight forward and easy to follow and clearly explain difficult and complex concepts. Honestly one of the best lecturers I've had while attending UVa.
1927,943390,5.0,1.0,"Very helpful and interesting lectures; if you go to class you literally won't have to touch your textbooks all semester. Pretty easy class overall, helped by the fact that he made the final optional."
1928,943390,4.5,4.0,"Not easy intro class, but VERY interesting. Probably better to have some interest in IR, but not necessary to know anything prior. LOTS of reading (don't need to do) with an extremely understanding and knowledgeable teacher. You'll really appreciate what you learn about how the world works afterwards. Simulation is surprisingly fun..."
1929,943390,3.0,3.0,"Readings are somewhat long-winded and dense for an introductory course, but Sechser is an engaging lecturer who makes an effort to get his students involved. Simulation was a valuable experience for those interested in politics; his decision to make this semester's final exam optional was extremely generous. Grading is dependent on TAs."
1930,943390,5.0,2.0,"great professor, though i'll admit i didn't go to lecture often, when i did it was certainly worth while.  very clear, concise, and organized.  only downside is the inability to use laptops during lecture to take notes.  otherwise, i'd certainly do it again."
1931,943390,4.0,3.0,"Probably one of the most understanding and approachable  professors at UVa. If there is something you don't understand, go directly to him... not your TA. Make sure you take notes during his lecture and you'll do well in the class."
1932,943390,3.5,3.0,"Honestly, this class is interesting and Prof. Sechser is is good professor. However, it is much harder than any 101 should be and the grading, done by TAs borders on ridiculous. I regret not taking an upper level with Prof. Sechser."
1933,943390,5.0,2.0,"Professor Sechser is great. He is very engaging, and it is clear that he is passionate about the subject matter. At times the lectures can seem dry, but overall he is an interesting lecturer. He is approachable and reasonable. Pay attention to the examples he uses during lecture: the readings are helpful but not entirely necessary."
1934,943390,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Sechser is top-notch.  Extremely knowledgeable and clear when discussing the course topics.  Assignments are appropriate, well thought out, and challenge students to learn the subjects inside and out.  One of the top 3 professors I've had at UVA; in terms of how much I learned, the best class I've taken at UVA."
1935,943390,4.5,2.0,"Great class! Professor Sechser can seem a bit dry at times, but his lectures are generally interesting. The games we played in class were fun and also served to really demonstrate the points he was trying to make. Readings are not absolutely necessary, but are pretty interesting anyway. Take this class if you're interested in politics at all!"
1936,943390,5.0,4.0,"great professor who makes all the material clear through quick-paced, interesting lectures.  whether or not you are interested in politics, this class if definitely worth taking. do the work and attend lectures and you will do really well."
1937,943390,5.0,2.0,"He is a great professor! Very knowledgeable and thorough, but his lectures are structured well so he keeps it interesting. He is actually concerned about whether his students are learning, and even implements games occasionally to help teach a concept. The reading load is definitely manageable. Take this professor!"
1938,943390,4.0,3.0,"Professor Sechser is very young and VERY intelligent.  I loved this class because of his insight and knowledge and how into this stuff he is.  I encourage everyone to do the weekly readings which are somewhat long but if you want to get something from the class, its worth it.  There is only a final paper/presentation- don't procrastinate!"
1939,1082658,5.0,2.0,"Professor Brickhouse is intelligent, patient, and overall an amazing person. She genuinely cares about the wellbeing of her students and was very supportive during Covid. Class discussions were rich and thought-provoking. Medical narratives was the perfect class to take alongside heavy STEM coursework. The readings were very manageable."
1940,1082658,4.0,3.0,Incredibly smart and makes everything you say in discussions sound intelligent (even if it isn't!)  Work load is great for an English class! Great professor and thoroughly enjoyed the class! 
1941,1082658,5.0,2.0,"Very nice professor who makes class discussions open and interesting. The reading load isn't overwhelming, but there's still quite a bit of it."
1942,1082658,4.0,4.0,"Professor Brickhouse is one of the nicest teachers I've had at UVA. She very friendly, approachable, and leads her discussions very competently. There is a lot of reading, however."
1943,1082658,4.0,2.0,"Prof Brickhouse provided both an insightful and enjoyable class through her discussion.  The other class members also brought interesting points to the class, and Brickhouse also struck a nice balance between lecture and discussion.  I also learned a lot without having a huge work load- but there will be lots of reading!"
1944,2688295,4.0,2.0,"Professor Sicoli was a wonderful instructor when I had him. He clearly cares very deeply about the subject of linguistic anthropology. If you're like me, you might think that subject to be too nebulous to care about, but honestly, I'm now more fascinated in language than ever, all thanks to Mark."
1945,2688295,4.0,3.0,Professor Sicoli had three tests and discussion sections were 28%. He offered a few extra credits and that was nice. His lectures were specific and he had good PowerPoints with them. You only use two books and they are both interesting.
1946,2688295,5.0,2.0,Prof. Sicoli is extremely knowledgeable and a great professor. The texts in this class are pretty easy to understand and his tests are a breeze. He is also extremely caring and considerate toward the needs of his students. I learned so much from this class which I was not looking forward to at first. I highly recommend it to everyone.
1947,2712872,5.0,4.0,Great professor! Dr. Patrick always gave timely feedback for me learn in her online class. I loved how she taught EDIS 6200!
1948,2540843,5.0,3.0,"Took HI270 at NCSU, loved her class. Work hard, listen to lectures, and you'll be fine. Really interesting coursework, really good with her TA. Would gladly take another class with this professor in the future."
1949,2540843,5.0,4.0,"TO CLARIFY!! I had Prof. Alff at NCSU for Modern Middle Eastern History. She is amazing. She truly cares about her students and works with her TA's to do the same. This class will make you think, and honestly, it is a good bit of work. If you put in the effort your grade will reflect that"
1950,1836331,5.0,3.0,"Excellent teacher, very helpful & funny"
1951,1320242,5.0,5.0,"She is so pretty and nice. I really enjoyed the exercises we did, and she was a fair and insightful with her comments on my poetry."
1952,664891,3.0,2.0,good teacher
1953,664891,4.5,4.0,"fantastic teacher.  awesome subject.  favorite class of that semester. projects were fun, thornton is great.  really knows what she's talking about."
1954,664891,3.5,2.0,"I was previously exposed to many of the concepts already, so this class wasn't very difficult. As for the prof, she is very helpful and will work with you, but she isn't a very good &quot;teacher&quot; in the sense she just spews the formulas from the book. She IS, however, very experience in Aerospace (she was an astronaut) and is enthusiastic."
1955,664891,5.0,3.0,"&quot;dude,&quot; KT is a great professor. She really understands the material and is really dedicated to the class. Her projects are really good at showing the principals behind engineering. She's a little slow at getting tests back, but it's hard not to forgive her. Also, how often do you get to say you're going to &quot;stop by the dean's office for some help."
1956,664891,5.0,1.0,"Dude, her lectures suck, but her space stories are awesome!  Shes done so many cool things.  This is a must-take class!"
1957,1377597,5.0,3.0,Prof. Zheng is an incredibly knowledgeable professor and seems to truly care about her students. She notices hard work and provides her students with many opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of the material. She responds to feedback throughout the semester. Read the textbook before the lectures. Complete the HW in small increments.
1958,1377597,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Zheng was clear from the start of the semester about which graded assignments we would have and when they would be due. She understands that physics can be hard to understand and goes out of her way to help you understand if you ask her. She's a fair grader, and responds very well to feedback, so make sure to do those course evals!"
1959,1377597,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Zheng's class was really well-structured with mandatory note-taking, and async lectures, and the synch lecture was filled with group problem-solving. It's a difficult class since there's an enormous amount of material, but I don't know how else you can teach this. She's super helpful during office hours, and really thoughtful/caring."
1960,1377597,5.0,4.0,"Professor Zheng has completely changed the course for the better since she last taught it a few years ago. Pretty sizeable homework with weekly quizzes but they are very doable, giving you lots of opportunities to practice the material before going into the (quite reasonable) tests. If you in earnest do the work, a good grade is very doable."
1961,1377597,5.0,4.0,"The class overall is fair and excellent. Professor Zheng makes the class difficult enough to make you learn. She is caring about her students and their grades. For the first exam, she had a question that half the class missed. The question seemed a little unfair and the professor decided to allow students to get more credit on it later. Awesome!"
1962,1377597,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Zheng cared a lot about her students being able to learn. One of the best parts of her teaching this class was the group quizzes, so you didn't have to worry if you didn't understand the quiz question at first. Your group would work through it together, which really encouraged learning and problem solving."
1963,1377597,1.0,4.0,"Awful teacher, made basic physics concepts about 10X more complicated than they needed to be. Wasn't clear in lectures and when approached for help wasn't much help either, simply told me a page number in the book. Had I not taken AP Physics I probably would have failed because I didn't learn anything. I wouldn't recommend taking it with her."
1964,1377597,1.0,4.0,"Prepared well for class and online notes and slides were very helpful. Lectures were rather boring and not very useful, evident by many of the clicker question results."
1965,1377597,2.5,4.0,"The class itself is already pretty hard, but Prof Zheng didn't make it any easier. Far too often it was apparent the class didn't know what was going on by the high number of people getting the clicker questions wrong. She's a very nice lady and she definitely puts forth an effort, but it just doesn't work."
1966,1377597,4.0,3.0,Prof Zheng is probably the best Physics teacher at UVA. She has a sense of humor and tries to make the lectures understandable. Physics is a difficult class but she does well.
1967,1377597,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Zheng has the right attitude towards teaching. She doesn't try to 'teach the textbook', but would work to helping us understand the material. The course is tough by definition, but I certainly felt that Prof. Zheng helped me understand the little things. Also, her constant attempts to help the class and find ways to help ppl undrstnd wasgreat"
1968,1377597,4.0,4.0,"She prepared for class, though at times was unsure about her or the textbook's correctness. However, this meant that everything was carefully derived and there was no 'look at the book for the derivation' nonsense. Good introductory course with a difficulty high enough to make it worthwhile."
1969,1377597,4.5,4.0,"She worked hard to explain a lot of difficult material. Some of it still went by me, but that was due mostly to a lack of time."
1970,1377597,5.0,2.0,"Xiaochao Zheng is one of the most consistently well-prepared instructors in the department.  She moves very quickly in lecture, but is always willing to slow down to clarify a point.  I believe that this demonstrates very well her complete grasp of the material."
1971,1377597,3.0,3.0,She prepares well for the class. Lecture notes are very well organized. But at lecture I did not get anything.
1972,402758,5.0,3.0,Helpful and friendly. Assigns very interesting books. Insightful. Not too hard but i still learned something in class. Overall great teacher. Definitely out to help and inspire students.
1973,402758,4.5,3.0,"Class on the 1960s was definitely interesting, the articles were cool but class could get a little boring. Often times there would just be dead silence because of a lack of discussion. He's kinda shy/awkward but nice and very helpful. His office hours are great. He does grade papers a lot harder than you would expect...not an easy A, but an easy B"
1974,402758,4.5,3.0,"Nathan is pretty cool.. he is a little spacey but all english prof. are lol.... he is very helpful he seems a little skittish/shy at first but after a while he wamrs up... he is really nice, and his office hours are always available! and he is not hard"
1975,402758,4.0,2.0,Great teacher. The material in Black Writers was very interesting and the discussion was rich. I got an A. The most important thing is just to talk in class occassionally and make a decent on the papers. He is a little spacey but is really good one on one. Take this class!
1976,402758,2.5,2.0,"he was a good teacher, his classes were boring sometimes but you didn't have to put a lot of effort to get a decent grade.. the lowest grade i had was a B- and I didn't do anything in that course."
1977,402758,5.0,2.0,"nice and always willing to help, decent papers are guaranteed a B-"
1978,402758,4.0,4.0,"Nice, sweet... no matter whether I wrote the paper a week before, the day before or right before class, he gave me a B- on each one :("
1979,402758,5.0,3.0,What a nice guy! He needs a haircut though.
1980,1934674,5.0,2.0,A delight to study with...
1981,1934674,4.5,1.0,She's great!
1982,2393427,5.0,3.0,I had Hiromi for three semesters. 10/10 every time. She is the best professor at UVa!!!
1983,304486,2.0,2.0,"Schuker is obviously a very smart guy. However, his lectures follow no logical pattern, nor are they in any chronological order. He references books and historians that you have never heard of every other sentence. I went to maybe half of the lectures and read none of the 20+ books he assigned but got an A-.Our TA was very easy, otherwise id avoid."
1984,304486,1.5,4.0,"Absolutely horrible professor. Extremely condescending towards the modern generation and rude while doing it. I'll admit that he can get funny, but he's frustrating FAR more often. I asked him for guidelines on books for the paper- he helped me twice and then basically declared I was dumb and refused to help anymore- not a good sign. Do not take!"
1985,304486,2.0,4.0,Hard to follow his lectures.  You need to go to a majority of the lectures but not all.  Just a midterm essay an a final for his class.  Not too bad of a class.
1986,304486,1.5,4.0,"lets just say I am a history major and it pained me to attend this class. there is no chronology to his lectures. but easy to draw out the main points when reading over notes.  he rambles, shows up late and is a horrible lecturer. it was just really hard to sit through his class. I would NOT recommend."
1987,304486,1.5,5.0,"This guy is terrible, he calls people out and argues, shows up 15 minutes late every day and tries to get you to stay an extra 10. Everyone who is writing so far must be a history major. His grader is absurdly hard. They expect grad-level work. Be prepared for a 15+ book list, costing $400 or more. If history is not your bag, AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE."
1988,304486,4.0,1.0,"Professor Schuker is the man! He calls people out in class and makes them look stupid, but for the rest of the class it is hilarious. How a history professor should be: seriously old school, it made me nostalgic for the old days. Front row beware of flying saliva when he gets excited. Easy class, reading is unnecessary to do well."
1989,304486,4.0,3.0,"One of the most intelligent professors I've ever taken a class with, BUT he rambles and you have to be willing to listen to his lectures (and not IM or do the sudoku) in order to get anything out of the class."
1990,304486,5.0,3.0,"Spectacularly magnificent professor.  Bottomless knowlegde about all history about everything.  Very articulate, lectures are eye-opening, funny at times.  He loves to explain how this and that conventional wisdom is utter nonsense.  Huge amounts of albeit well-chosen reading. His grad student grader does all the grading."
1991,304486,4.0,3.0,"This guy is great. His non-PC views that he will still put forth to the class openly are hilarious. Don't take it if easily offended, he WILL tell you things that are not PC but probably true. Probably one of the most knowledgable people about Europe and the world living today."
1992,304486,4.5,3.0,"Very nice guy, very intelligent and knowledgable.  Lectures can be a little bit hard to follow because he throws in so many foreign names and words.  A lot of reading.  Try to do most of it, but it's not a big deal if you can't get it all done.  But beware if you sit in the front row, he does cold-call!  One paper and a final, pretty straitforward."
1993,304486,4.0,1.0,"UVA should seek more professors of this kind- archetypal, aloof academic genius.  Straightforward class with no tricks.  Quote the readings in the exam and you'll get an A."
1994,304486,4.5,1.0,"Intl Systems; funniest conservative prof who clowns on the french at any possible moment.  easiest class ever.  dont need to get all of the books, an AP Euro Hist book will suffice.  show effort and you get an easy A.  lectures are a little hard to follow, but interesting, witty, and a little controversal."
1995,304486,3.5,3.0,"Prof. Schuker harks from another era when people were expected to wear a tux and tophat to go out and Europe was the center of the world.  He's obviously pissed that that era is gone, but his lectures are still good.  Watch the hair."
1996,304486,4.5,4.0,People either love or hate prof. Schuker.  The haters are usually intellectually shallow or can't handle the political controversy Schuker dishes out.  Good students will find him very friendly and helpful.
1997,304486,4.5,4.0,"If you're not intelligent and dedicated, don't take this class. If you are, you'll love it. Schuker demands students investigate issues BEYOND the class material. Once he decides you're a dedicated student, he'll do anything to help you. But his extremely independent, non-PC views offend some."
1998,304486,3.0,2.0,"Very smart. One paper and one final-both straightforward and easily graded (at least by TA Adam Trusner). Schuker is highly conservative in his political views, but a fair-minded historian. He assigns thirteen books, but just buy (and read the textbook), as well as two of the shorter memoirs."
1999,304486,4.0,4.0,Bona fide genius - which means that if you aren't serious about learning his subjects don't sign up for the class. The man knows it all - really - and that is an incredible resource if you take the time to realize what he can offer about learning about our world over the last century.
2000,304486,1.0,4.0,"Sooooooo boring!!!!!!!  You would think a class about Europe between 1895 and 1945 would be incredibly interesting, but somehow he can make anyone fall asleep.  He's very rude and intellectually snobby and makes you feel like a complete idiot whenever you actually get up the nerve to ask for help."
2001,304486,4.0,2.0,"Probably one of the best classes that i have ever taken.  The class only has one final and one paper, so assuming you do well its fairly easy to get an A.  Its one of the few classes that when you finish you really know the subject inside and out."
2002,304486,3.0,2.0,"Schucker *is* a genius.  Lectures are a bit hard to follow + can be on the DRY side and there's a TON of reading (which you can sort of do, or not).  Still if you take the class you can hear him blather on and then shout something in German, randomly."
2003,304486,2.5,2.0,"This man is a genius.  If you have any interest in European History, take this class.  Hard to follow at times but definitely worth it.  There is a lot of assigned reading, but its not necessary.  Grades are based on one paper and a final."
2004,304486,2.0,2.0,Ha. This class sucks. Lectures are so boring. Readings are ridiculous. Makes you buy like 15 books...well don't...just buy the textbook. It'll save you about $300.
2005,1025383,5.0,3.0,"Only ever had her for a summer class in Lyon, but I got to know her really well in a way you don't normally get to know professors. She is hands down the nicest person I have ever met. Absolutely take her class if you can; you'll love her."
2006,1025383,5.0,3.0,Probably the nicest professor you will ever have
2007,1025383,3.5,1.0,Adorable and so so so nice. Sometimes a little unclear and disorganized but overall her class is very easy and enjoyable. Definitely take a class with her if you can!
2008,1025383,2.0,3.0,Rachel is generally nice and understanding. She is a tough grader.
2009,1025383,4.5,2.0,"Rachel so nice and easy to talk to.  She is also very expressive, making it easier to understand her.  I saw her a little tipsy downtown once, and we had a great conversation.  Take her class if you can!"
2010,1025383,4.0,3.0,A solid french class. I found some of the tests to be quite challenging and or detail oriented than I had expected. And no final exam!
2011,1025383,4.0,1.0,Ridiculously nice.
2012,1025383,5.0,2.0,Really nice teacher. Helps you out all the time. She is just really nice and not a hard grader either.
2013,2401646,5.0,1.0,"4 open note tests, short quiz after every lecture, usually with questions phrased exactly like they were on the slides, all true/false or multiple choice. Slides are posted, take good notes and it's impossible not to get an A. Really easy but also really interesting and enjoyable."
2014,2401646,4.0,1.0,"This class was very easy and very interesting, whether you have a background in environmental science or not. Office hours were always very helpful before exams even with the class size being so big."
2015,2401646,4.0,2.0,"Do the quizzes so you can get extra credit on the test. Straight forward class, read the lecture slides (which he sends to you) and you will do well on test. Extra credit quizzes also help answer questions on test."
2016,525681,1.0,5.0,"Not a good professor at all. She has unrealistic expectations and plays to favorites. She is extremely neurotic and suspicious. She is always afraid that people are cheating or going to cheat. She gives take home exams but freaks out if you are looking in the direction of the other turned exams, only accepts exams that are sealed and covered."
2017,525681,4.5,3.0,"Khamun-e Hajibashi is an excellent language teacher - her kind and gentle demeanor has made studying Persian an absolute joy, and I highly recommend her to anyone interested in the language."
2018,525681,5.0,3.0,"Khanum-e Hajibashi is wonderful! Extremely kind, subtle sense of humor, very clear. Tests are tricky but manageable if you study. There are usually a lot of people with background knowledge in the class, but she takes this into account. I highly recommend this class!"
2019,525681,5.0,1.0,"Khanum-e Hajibashi is an excellent professor, very kind and does a good job with the class.  She's also really helpful in office hours.  Just make sure you read the textbook carefully at home first."
2020,525681,4.5,3.0,"Fantastic professor. Very knowledgable about many languages, literature, etc. Gives clear weekly homework, but watch out for the extra assignments she gives in the interim - the work piles up and it can be frustrating to keep track. Tests are difficult, but she's incredibly helpful in office hours. Soft-spoken demeanor and pleasant sense of humor."
2021,525681,3.5,3.0,"Good Teacher, she knows the material well and is very helpfull. The only negative is that there is a majority of native speakers in the class and the tests are designed to challenge them - makes it hard (also unfair) for non-native speakers."
2022,525681,5.0,2.0,"Wonderful teacher!  Hajibashi definitely knows what she is talking about and is genuinely concerned about her students.  She is not warm and fuzzy by any means, but is awesome, nonetheless.  I highly recommend her classes."
2023,2655612,5.0,3.0,Professor Mohajeri was a fantastic professor. He is super nice and loves to get to know his students. I was reading along in the textbook all semester and I did really well. There are weekly quizzes that allow you to practice what you're learning and the tests are very reasonable. I would definitely recommend him.
2024,2655612,4.0,3.0,"Hes a good teacher. The stuff hes teaching is complex, but he is accommodating for when you struggle with it. Also, he goes through lectures very quickly and its hard to pick up on everything. But if you do the homeworks, then you have a good chance at passing the class and understanding the material for the tests (aka where it really matters)."
2025,2655612,2.0,2.0,Thinks very highly of himself. Doesn't explain things too well and expects you to get everything first time through. Make sure you get a good TA if you take his class.
2026,50558,4.5,3.0,"Wonderful professor! Organic chemistry can be a hard subject but Professor Sundberg does his best to explain everything. He is very helpful and always answeres questions. The course does incorporate a large amount of material and does go fast but overall if you study hard and pay attention in class, you can at least do well if not enjoy it too"
2027,50558,3.0,5.0,"Demanding class, but it is Orgo. Class was difficult and fair, except for the final, which was extreme."
2028,50558,1.0,5.0,"He often becomes confused, and is impossible to follow at times in lecture."
2029,50558,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Sundberg's class is hard. However, if you put in the time to read before lecture, what he says during lecture will make sense. ORGO is about memorizing mechanisms for most part. Try to find patterns in memorizing the mechanisms. I think he explains complicated materials in a very simple way. I recommend going to his OH and ask questions."
2030,50558,3.0,5.0,"Good Professor, but very hard class. No curve and final is extremely difficult. Plan on lowering your grade just on final."
2031,50558,3.5,4.0,"Orgo is not easy, and Sundberg is sometimes hard to follow.  But he's very helpful outside of the classroom.  Orgo takes a lot of effort outside of lecture and you have to make a pretty concerted effort for any Orgo lecture here.  Anyway, its Orgo lab that you should be worried about.  Second test average was a 60%."
2032,50558,3.5,4.0,"He's awesome.  No denying his classes aren't easy, but his teaching style--of helping you teach yourself really helps you learn the material.  He's got a great sense of humor too--although he's not aware of that, or anything besides chemistry. GREAT PROFESSOR!!!!"
2033,50558,3.0,4.0,"Sundberg is not nearly as bad as these people are making him out to be.  His exams are fair, and you have to keep in mind that it's all curved in the end.  If you read the book and pay attention in class you'll do fine.  He lectures straight from the book.  It REALLY helps if you get a good group to study with!"
2034,50558,1.5,5.0,"It depends on people, but I didn't really like Sundberg's style. He is very unorganized and to be on top of things you actually have to study 3 times more than what he covers in class. I wanted to major in chemistry but taking 182 and 281 made me change my mind. I thought 80s had better grade distribution but I just found out 40s had 60% A. waste!"
2035,50558,4.0,4.0,If you're reading these reviews keep in mind that the 40s and 80s are different TA and test wise.  Tests are hard but with the grade distribution of the 80s you wont leave without a B if you try.  HW can be a pain but he will help.  Some HW questions show up on tests others are a huge waster of time.  If you like chem then you should be in the 80s
2036,50558,1.0,5.0,"He should focus on administrative duties (i.e. chair of the chemistry department) and leave the teaching to Burnett and Harman.  Those who can, teach; those who can't, supervise everyone else."
2037,50558,1.0,5.0,Advice to all prospective/ fellow chemistry majors: DROP THE 80s FOR ORGO AND COME BACK FOR 281 WITH HARMAN IN THE SPRING OF SECOND YEAR.
2038,50558,2.5,5.0,"Professor Sundberg is a very nice guy who is clearly a smart person, but who is difficult to follow if chemistry is not a student's natural strength."
2039,50558,3.5,4.0,"Obviously a brilliant man who knows his stuff.  You can tell he loves chemistry, but sometimes he's not so good about relaying the info.  He's very approachable outside of class and wants everyone to learn.  T.A.'s could stand to be nicer.  An overall really hard class, but required for pre-med."
2040,50558,2.0,5.0,Most days he lists reaction after reaction and doesn't specify why there are important. Many times he has given the wrong information in class. Some of the information on the exams isn't in the texts books. Sundberg never reviews so it's hard to know what to expect on the exams. sheer volume is overwhelming. Doesn't given answers to practice exams
2041,50558,4.5,5.0,"Great professor.  He does move rather quickly, but he covers what you will need to know for tests.  He's extremely approachable even outside of office hours and will help you with what you need to know.  Overall, he is a wonderful teacher and covers the material in a way that makes you pay attention and learn."
2042,50558,4.0,4.0,"Goes really fast in lectures, but likes to take stuff directly from the book.  Read it as you go and the course will be much easier.  Problem sets are free points if you take advantage of study sessions and office hours.  Gives a fairly generous curve."
2043,50558,4.5,3.0,"Even better the second time around. There is a heavy tilt towards the biological applications of carbonyl chemistry, rather than the usual synthetic emphasis. I, however, found this approach to be fascinating. Very approachable in the office, (rather) straightforward exams; Sundberg basically becomes like Grandpa once you're through."
2044,50558,2.5,5.0,"Liked the guy. He's a good lecturer with a wide range of knowledge about science in general. His tests are pretty tough, and require you to really know almost everything in the textbook, including factoids like pKa of compounds. End-of-chapter problems really help. Problem sets take awhile, but buffer your grade if you have a hard time on a test."
2045,50558,1.5,5.0,"He is a very nice guy but his lectures are incredibly boring! His lectures were always about 2 chapters ahead of the reading, so it was hard to follow. The problem sets were a lot of work for not too much credit, and tests were in a difficult &quot;choose all that apply&quot; format. The good thing is that old tests are available format is usually the same."
2046,50558,3.5,3.0,"the problem sets are hard but he recycles test questions, which is pretty cool"
2047,50558,4.5,5.0,"Prof Sundberg is a great teacher, the most interesting chem teacher I have ever had.  The material is hard, but that can be expected in orgo.  He takes his test material straight from the book and makes his lecture notes very clear.  His problem sets are hard but are group work.  My only complaint is to make the problem sets a little easier."
2048,50558,3.0,5.0,"Dude is a nice guy - very reminiscent of your good ol' Chemistry teacher in high school - older, huge specs and the occasional corny jokes. His lectures are very fast paced. Be ready to take/understand his class notes because he writes on the projector as quickly as anyone. The tests are hard but the homework grade helps alot."
2049,50558,4.0,5.0,"Orgo is never easy. Sundberg gives &quot;homework&quot;, but it's not hard & can be done in a group. All hmwk points add up to equal a test grade & they keep you on top of the material. I got a B in orgo b/c I did really well on the hmwk - it WILL help your grade! Tests are HARD, mult choice, but lots of &quot;circle all correct answers&quot; which makes tests harder."
2050,50558,4.5,4.0,"I took marshall for 241, and I had to make some minor adjustments (relatively easy transition).He is extremely helpful and really made me understand how to apply a general concept to specific questions.  He also makes the class interesting by relating the material to our daily life. He's really sweet.  Orgo is a tough subject but not impossible!"
2051,50558,3.5,4.0,"really fast-paced compared to other sections, no exams are dropped, and weekly hw assignments.  otherwise, sundberg is really knowledgeable and a nice guy.  (btw there are no easy orgo classes)"
2052,50558,5.0,4.0,"Class is difficult but not as hard as you'd think going in. Tests are definently long and draining. Good guy otherwise, plan on taking him again for 242"
2053,50558,4.5,2.0,"Orgo is hard, but not as bad as people say. Professor Sundberg is good at explaining concepts, and he posts old tests online which is extremely helpful.  The associated lab is much much harder than the lecture class."
2054,50558,5.0,5.0,"he is such a sweet man!  he is totally willing to explain things to you and loves the chemistry.  his sense of humor makes class fun.  this section is definitely harder than the other professors, but really worth it."
2055,50558,4.5,5.0,"The final was a packet. He's nice, but hard."
2056,50558,5.0,3.0,"Very good teacher.... explains everything clearly, however his tests are pretty hard"
2057,50558,5.0,5.0,He's sooooo sweet!!!
2058,50558,5.0,4.0,He's an awesome teacher and prepares his students for the MCATs.
2059,1623424,2.0,5.0,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. Takes discussion sections way to seriously. assigns weekly papers. I switched out of his discussion after the first class...     glad I did.
2060,1623424,3.0,4.0,He's the TA for Comparative Politics...the weekly papers suck but in the end are really helpful in that they force you to read/understand the course packet and are exactly like the essay you have to write for the midterm.  He's really available and doesn't grade too hard.
2061,1516932,5.0,1.0,She was awesome. Clearly presented material.
2062,1516932,5.0,1.0,"She gives out extra credit at the end of the course and i loved her to death. she's so helpful anything too. probably one of the easiest math teachers, a lot of people in the class get A+s and she doesn't even give us any credit for it."
2063,1516932,5.0,1.0,She's a really fun and nice math teacher who understands students' mentality. She gives out written homework and WebAssign every week but they aren't usually too hard. She kinda grades written homework hard but she has a reason behind this. It really helps to understand the ACTUAL concept. Only downside to her: She doesn't give out A+s to anyone.
2064,542086,4.5,4.0,"Gweneth is AMAZING. Seriously, my favorite professor of all time. The course is not easy (especially in the beginning), but it can be transformative if you take it seriously. I absolutely loved this course, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge and is willing to make him/herself vulnerable."
2065,542086,5.0,5.0,She's so awesome
2066,542086,3.0,3.0,Gwen is certainly a character and some people won't like her new agey approach to the arts.  But I thought it was refreshing.  I also think she forces us to think outside the box and to use aspects of our talent and intelligence that other professors never ask us to use.  Go Gwen!
2067,542086,2.0,3.0,"Gweneth is brilliant. Crazy, but brilliant.  I LOVED HER CLASS. It is a little difficult, and the work load is kind of odd, very intense at the begining and end, but the middle is fingerpainting.  Just learn to ride the wave with her and you will be ok, accept that she's not the most normal of people, and you can handle it.  very rewarding for me"
2068,542086,3.5,3.0,"She is brilliant,insecure & mean.  How to Get an A: 3)Be popular, she likes to hang out with the &quot;hot&quot; kids. 2)Kiss her butt. Must be good at it. Can read &quot;fake&quot; in seconds; or BEST CHANCE FOR AN &quot;A&quot;, 3 Be a cute guy who gives her attention. I should have gotten an A for my work (& butt kissing skills), but she also has a mean streak a mile wide."
2069,542086,1.0,4.0,"Horrible.  Almost worth not doing the drama program to avoid having to take this class.  Why it is a requirement is beyond me, let alone why it exists.  She's totally subjective, moody, unclear, totally over-sensitive, and pretty much super crazy.  Total psycho, worthless class.  Made me hate my entire semester, way to be, Gweneth."
2070,542086,4.5,4.0,I absolutely adore this course.  It is fantastic.  The only reason the textbook use is high is because you copy drawings from it.  Reading is not needed to do well.  This is definitely my favorite course.
2071,542086,2.5,3.0,"This class was quite...interesting.  Gweneth is dedicated to the theatre, so there are some great learning experiences.  Yes, the grading seems subjective and the homework is not evenly spaced over the semester. Still, this class does have important lessons for artists (once you relax about all the nonsense and confusing, random grading!)."
2072,542086,1.0,5.0,Hated this class.  It was a waste of time and the teacher is a waste of space.  I guess anyone can teach at the UVA.  Why this is a requirement is beyond me.
2073,542086,1.0,5.0,"Useless assignments with a completely arbitrary grading scale. It is impossible to intentionally succeed in this course--Gweneth's whims determine your future GPA. She should be working in a textile factory. She is hypersensitive, unclear, unhelpful, self-righteous, and self-absorbed."
2074,542086,1.0,4.0,"Stupidest class in the Drama Dep't.  Ridiculously arbitrary grading and you don't learn jack about the theater.  Also, Gweneth has a mean streak."
2075,542086,3.0,4.0,"Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed the class.  While at times I didn't understand the point of a particular assignment, overall, I could see how it related to my development as an artist.  Grading is subjective, and there's a lot of work.  However, it still not a particularly hard course.  As I said...I liked it!"
2076,542086,1.0,5.0,I hate this class.  I can't wait for it to end.   How do you grade finger painting&#63;  What a waste of time.
2077,542086,1.0,5.0,What a load of crap!  If my parent only knew what their money was paying for.  I mean why would you make this Hippy Bullsh@# a requirement for being a drama major.  She is unhelpful and mean spirited.  I can not believe UVA empolys her.  The work load goes from no homework to unbelievable amounts in a sec.  Work is very unclear and subjective.
2078,542086,1.0,5.0,No Comments
2079,542086,2.0,1.0,Her information is WRONG!  Research consists of whatever she can pull out of her ass 5 minutes before class.  Moody and vindictive.  Avoid at all costs.
2080,542086,1.5,3.0,"Some weeks you will be staying up all night writing a 20-page script analysis, other weeks there will be no homework at all or maybe a painting or two. The class generally starts very hard and gets easy as the semester goes on. Gweneth takes the material very seriously but it's hard to see why. Very emotional--you don't want to get on her bad side."
2081,542086,1.5,3.0,"This class is 90% BS.  Gweneth can be very patronizing and very unclear.  I don't know how she manages that.  I'm pretty sure that grading is entirely subjective.  If she likes you, expect to do well.  If not, tough luck.  I hope you like to fingerpaint and listen to completely useless feedback from other students, because that's what you'll get."
2082,542086,1.0,3.0,"She is completely out of her mind. She is moody. I think that she is talented and understands her field, but her interpersonal skills are the worst I ahve ever encountered. She is overly sensitive and looks for reasons to get her feelings hurt. I think that she is emotionally unstable. Maybe that is what it takes to be creative - I don't know!"
2083,542086,2.0,3.0,No Comments
2084,542086,5.0,2.0,"The best. A little new-agey, but really sweet and fun and knows her stuff!"
2085,279945,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor and by far the best in the MAE department. He actually makes difficult material fun to learn with videos and demos. if you have a choice, take his section  "
2086,279945,5.0,4.0,"The best teacher I had at UVA.  He made class fun, and taught a hard subject well.  Take Ocean Engineering"
2087,279945,5.0,3.0,"The best teacher possible. I dont believe any other professor could teach the same material and make it any easier, or fun to learn. Unbeatable as best teacher at UVA, too bad they got rid of him"
2088,279945,5.0,3.0,"Makes difficult courses much easier to understand.  If you are going to choose a section for one of these courses, CHOOSE HIM."
2089,279945,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher, makes fluids interesting.  Approachable, and helpful in office hours."
2090,1082763,2.0,5.0,"He must be a totally different teacher for 3010 than the lower levels... He was unclear about his expectations and his tests were completely unfair, in addition to everything being graded too harshly. Do not take this class with him unless you want to work harder than you ever have before and still get a mediocre grade."
2091,1082763,2.5,4.0,"DO NOT have him as a teacher. He is a PhD student who thinks that he knows everything. I have gotten nothing but A's on every paper I've written here and he continually gives me B-'s criticizing my writing style, not my spanish. Plus he has a very condescending manner."
2092,1082763,2.0,4.0,Professor McCallister is one of the two reasons I am no longer taking Spanish at UVA. He's quite rude and if you're confused he'll definitely call on you during class to either explain or write it on the board. In his defense he does make cookies for the last day of class and he has fun animations on his powerpoints. Avoid him at all costs.
2093,1082763,5.0,2.0,"I've only been in his class for a week and I'm already in love with Prof. McCallister. He's hilarious, super helpful, and he tries so hard to make spanish fun. I hate spanish, but I love coming to class because of him. I never though anyone could make spanish fun, but he does. TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM! You won't regret it. One of the best at UVA."
2094,1082763,5.0,3.0,he is amazing!!! i had the chance to have a 11:00 spanish class but chose to take him 8:00 spanish class instead. he makes class fun and interesting. He is very willing to help and clarify. I would most definitely recommend him. I wish he taught higher levels.
2095,1082763,5.0,1.0,"I love this man.  He is hilarious, helpful, and entertaining.  I had him for 101 and 102, and wish he taught the 200-level classes!"
2096,1082763,5.0,2.0,"I created an account for Prof. M. solely for the purpose of praising him. I don't think you can actively select him from the COD (since the Spanish department at UVA is idiotic), but if you've been placed in his class, you will NOT be disappointed. Hilarious, entertaining and personable. I struggled with the language but still loved the class."
2097,1959308,4.5,3.0,She gives you so much individual attention. I felt like she cared about helping me with my specific issues. I should have gone to office hours more.
2098,1959308,5.0,1.0,She is kind and makes class fun. The assignments and homework and more boring assignments are fun and we get to talk about them in class and she makes sure everyone understands what is going on without leaving anyone behind but it isn't boring even if you are really good at it. She makes herself really available and really wants us to succeed. 
2099,1959308,5.0,1.0,This is the best class I have ever taken. She is fun and kind and smart and funny. I would totally recommend it. She makes it easy if you are willing to do the work and sometimes she brings her puppies to class. 
2100,2295180,4.0,4.0,"I wouldn't take her class again, but she is honestly not that bad. Very helpful in office hours but is a tough grader, but does give clear criteria and good texts to write from. Not the best prof I have had, but certainly not the worst. Also, I wish there was more chances for discussion in seminar."
2101,2295180,1.0,4.0,Just don't take this class with her.
2102,2295180,3.0,4.0,"She is clearly passionate about Shakespeare, but often does not allow for students to show their interest. Many times people are cut off by her so she can say whatever it is she wants to teach for the lesson. Otherwise, she grades papers very harshly, but she does give good feedback."
2103,1959311,2.0,3.0,"I think the subject matter was absolutely wonderful, but her teaching lowered the quality of this class. This class had wasted potential, due to her being late on numerous occasions to class, several typos in the syllabus and other assignment, grades being put in days before they are due, and her rambling and not making much sense a lot of times. "
2104,1959311,1.0,2.0,"It was very clear that she did not put the time or effort in to teaching. There were numerous typos in every lecture, study guide, rubric, and test. This made it incredibly hard to learn and felt disrespectful of our time and money. She rambles a lot and the lectures are not very helpful. All of the tests are based solely on the readings."
2105,1959311,1.0,3.0,Rambles a lot and has lectures that are really hard to follow because they don't have a clear structure. Most of the assignments are unclear and we are 80% done with the semester and we have no grades in the gradebook. She's often late to class and going to class just feels like a waste of time. 
2106,1959311,1.0,4.0,"This class was the most disorganized, unprofessional conglomeration of nothing I have ever sat through. Prof is very intelligent but conveys this in no way through her lectures. Grading is harsh and unjustified given the lack of clarity, construction, and specificity."
2107,1959311,1.0,4.0,"Probably one of the worst, most incompetent people to work at this University. She does not teach, but rather just wanders around talking to herself about irrelevant and incomprehensible things. There are few assignments and they are graded incredibly harshly. Do not take under any circumstances."
2108,1959311,1.0,4.0,"Professor Fraser didn't even know what she was talking about half the time, she would refer questions asked by students back to other students because she was constantly unsure.  She seemed to be learning along WITH the class versus teaching it, while the exams were extremely specific and harsh grading. "
2109,1959311,1.0,3.0,Professor Fraser would come in to class and would forget what the reading was about and have to ask students. Her powerpoints are full of misspellings and look very thrown together and the assignments she gives are unhelpful in learning the material. She seems to be learning it along with us. 
2110,1893776,4.5,3.0,"She is very helpful and always available during office hours. The work load isn't too bad but you learn a lot about culture, and you become a better writer. The themes were interesting as well.  "
2111,1893776,3.0,2.0,"Sometimes confusing when explaining criteria for assignments but always happy to make herself available if you need help. She's a pretty lenient grader. Lectures are sometimes boring but she's very open to suggestion about what you want to learnimprove upon and will structure her lectures around your feedback. Had her twice, would take her again!"
2112,1893776,4.5,2.0,Really encourages students to participate. She's patient with students who struggle and holds lots of office hours. 
2113,1893776,5.0,2.0,"This professor is amazing! She is really nice and respectful, I feel comfortable participating in class and I am sure everybody else feels the same. She makes the class entertaining and interesting so it is easy to be engaged. I strongly recommend her. "
2114,1893776,4.5,2.0,She just seems to really love watching everyone learn!!
2115,1058192,5.0,3.0,"Sherriff did his best to make this dry topic entertaining and kind of succeeded just because of how friendly he is. The whole class is centered around a group project. I got a pretty good team, but I imagine if you don't the class is much worse."
2116,1058192,5.0,3.0,"Sherriff is a fantastic professor. He knows that most students absolutely dread computer science, but he keeps everyone interested. Very clear in his lectures"
2117,1058192,4.0,4.0,Dr Sherriff is fantastic. 
2118,1058192,5.0,2.0,Great Professor for game design (a topic he is clearly passionate about). He does a very thorough job of explaining concepts of game design for both the technical and nontechnical side.  He does not grade harshly at all but that doesn't mean you can get away with anything.  If you hit the simple requirements then you will do well.
2119,1058192,4.0,2.0,"Easy enough class, but he is very condescending if you need help. TAs will help you solve problems much better than he will. If you show up to class and try your best, you should do alright."
2120,1058192,5.0,3.0,Only once in a generation does  a professor of this kind arise. Adventuring into Chem 402 on the first day of class and realizing what a legend this man is was as emotional an experience as randomly encountering a wild Mew and capturing it with the one great ball you had left in your pack. Do yourself a favor and take this man's class
2121,1058192,2.0,3.0,"Incredibly condescending at office hours and not very helpful. Does not realize that this is a required course, and not everyone is a CS major/ incredibly skilled at programming. I had never taken a CS class before and have no intention of taking another one after this class."
2122,1058192,5.0,2.0,Great professor! His lectures are funny and engaging--full of useful metaphors and clear explanations that really help you learn the material.  I would definitely recommend him!
2123,1058192,5.0,3.0,He is soooo cool(academically) and really great!
2124,1058192,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sherriff was my favorite teacher at UVA. He's engaging, helpful and very funny! Plus, the projects you do in his class have real world applications. I was able to put a lot of the skills I learned in his classes on my resume. His best teacher award was well earned!"
2125,1058192,4.5,2.0,"Professor Sherriff is very funny and very good at explaining things using illustrations, metaphors, and examples. Unlike many other professors, he is young enough that he talks about things in terms the average college student can understand- that is, in terms of the internet and video games. He's a cool guy."
2126,1058192,4.5,2.0,"Sherriff is an engaging person, and a great professor. His lectures are complimented by helpful slides he posts online, along with example coding. Exams are pretty straightforward, either you read his slides and listened in class or you didn't, don't be lazy, this class isn't hard to get an A in if you don't slack. Just be ready to code like nevab4"
2127,1058192,4.5,1.0,"His lectures contain most of the material needed to do the homework and do well on the tests.  He posts a lot of example code, lecture slides, and podcasts of the lectures, which is very useful in studying.  The material presented in class may at first be confusing, but the homework, labs, and test practice problems are very useful."
2128,1058192,4.5,4.0,"He's great, and made me love computer science!"
2129,1058192,5.0,2.0,"Java programming. Sherriff=crystal clear, hilarious, awesome, helpful. Never used textbook. HWs got hard, but the army of TAs is there to help. Tests all hand-written, but graded really fast. Big class, but with ppts & podcasts online, okay to miss. Expect fun scavenger hunts. Highly recommended. Went in with no experience & came out with an A."
2130,1058192,4.0,2.0,He's hilarious and a ton of fun!
2131,1058192,3.0,4.0,"He is unpredictable. At times he will be lenient in grading, and at times not so much. He very much does tough love with you if you are not very skilled in programming. He speaks particularly quick, and if you miss something you had better ask. He doesn't have any power point slides often, and sometimes seems to ramble a bit."
2132,1058192,5.0,2.0,"He really is a great guy who has the rare gift among professors of not only knowing the material, but also how to teach it effectively. On tests and HW's the TA's are petty with grading, but Sherriff gives ample extra credit opportunities and free points to compensate. One thing people need to acclimate to before this class is programming w/ others"
2133,1058192,2.0,3.0,"Mark Sherriff knows what he's talking about, he's simply a petty grader. He'll take off points if he's in a bad mood or doesn't like you, or fail you on an assignment because of something trivial."
2134,1058192,4.5,3.0,"Good professor, he's very engaging and wants to see the students do well. The tests are a bit rough, but he'll let you know generally what's on them. His teaching style keeps most people's attention."
2135,1058192,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed Prof. Sherriff's class.  I was really looking forward to 201 and he did not disappoint.  He's clearly at UVA because he wants to teach, and teach well (not just do research like some of the more crappy profs).  I would highly recommend him."
2136,1058192,5.0,3.0,"Sherriff is definitely one of the better professors in the CS department. It is obvious he cares about teaching and not just lecturing to students. And he's got a great sense of humor as well. Homeworks generally weren't too bad, but make sure you stay on top of work for the group project. Overall, very good class with a funny, caring professor."
2137,1058192,5.0,2.0,"Had him for two classes now. He's sarcastic and very funny, which make his lectures interesting. I've found him approachable, if grumpy, outside of class. Does a good job telling you what's on the test, but you have to attend class to get that..."
2138,1058192,3.5,4.0,"Just not that great of a prof. He can be unclear, and his tests are really hard."
2139,1058192,3.0,4.0,"He is a nice guy but he can be unclear at times. The material isn't too hard, but he actually makes very specific, difficult tests. It pretty much comes down to how much you want to study, not how well you know how to code."
2140,1058192,4.0,3.0,"Good guy, but sometimes he seems grumpy in class.  His jokes are really corny.  He makes class pretty interesting for the most part."
2141,2278804,5.0,4.0,"Superb lectures. Summer class, pretty relaxed."
2142,2278804,5.0,3.0,"I had him for a summer class. He was excellent. Pay very close attention in class, and you will do well on the tests."
2143,959893,4.0,3.0,"Chen laoshi makes her students participate in every class and do daily homework exercises, but it pays off. She gives feedback on every assignment and will not leave a student to struggle without help. This class is a heavy workload but Chen laoshi will give you a good grade if you put in the effort."
2144,959893,5.0,3.0,"Chen laoshi is incredible. She's very sassy, which can make it hard to get along with her at first, but you'll find that as long as you put in a decent amount of effort, she'll like you and you'll be able to do very well."
2145,959893,5.0,3.0,"Chen-?? is very understanding. Though she is very intimidating in the beginning, it is only because she is trying to root out unserious students so that interested ones can get in. She is very flexible with her hours, but her temper can fray at times."
2146,959893,4.5,4.0,"She is one of my favorite teachers here at UVA. You might her scary at times, but as long as you try hard, you will definitely get an A."
2147,959893,4.0,1.0,"The class takes up a lot of time outside of class, but it was pretty easy and is an easy high grade if you put in the hours. If you are bad at hearing tones though, you might not want to take the class."
2148,959893,4.0,2.0,"Chen Laoshi is awesome. She makes class so interesting and fun! I highly recommend her. Homework, however, can take a really long time. everyday, i spend 2 to 3 hours on it. its pretty intense. and on weekends, i spend even more time because i have to memorize the characters. despite that, its very easy to get an A. Take chinese 101 with her!"
2149,959893,4.0,1.0,"My favorite teacher so far at UVa. She makes class fun and is quite entertaining. 101 material is sooo easy as long as you put in a little bit of effort. Laoshi is pretty lax when it comes to assignments and hw, you can usually turn things in a lil late if you have a legit excuse. as long as you do all the work, you'll get an A. def reccommend!"
2150,959893,4.5,4.0,"Chen Laoshi was an excellent teacher and she makes it so anyone can learn Chinese and learn it well. She is always available during office hours and is very willing to help out her students. As long as you try hard in her class, she will LOVE you, otherwise you're doomed."
2151,2344354,5.0,4.0,"Prof Casteen is excellent. I went into this class knowing nothing about Icelandic lit, but it is now one of my favorite subjects. He was very accommodating for anyone who was struggling due to Covid or other personal issues (even built in extra credit so everyone could boost quiz scores). Fair grader on the two papers for the course and quizzes!"
2152,2344354,5.0,3.0,"I took Prof. Casteen's Old Icelandic Lit in Trans class in spring of 2018, and I cannot think of another professor at The University who is more passionate about the material he teaches. He is a professor who will put students first, and he tries to be as engaging in his class as possible. Sure, there's a lot to read, but his lessons are priceless!"
2153,2344354,5.0,3.0,"Professor Casteen is one of the few professors who actually cares that we learn instead of just memorize information. He is always prepared for class and he brings books/magazines to relate to the topic of the lecture which really helps with connecting themes. His early bird specials are something to treasure, &amp; he gives solid life advice too."
2154,2344354,5.0,4.0,"The first day I didn't know what class this was. Afterwards, I loved it so much. I normally would never have taken a writing class like this, but Prof Casteen was very nice, funny, and thoughtful. You have few assignments but you have to be really careful. It's writing req so need to go to class, but overall he's one of the greatest prof. ever."
2155,1861035,4.5,1.0,He's such a nice guy and the class isn't too hard. Definitely recommend if you're interested in continuing Spanish but don't want to spend hours a day on it.
2156,1746348,3.0,4.0,"The first quiz was kinda hard, but I like that he helps us identify weaknesses before the ACTUAL exam."
2157,1369520,3.0,3.0,She clearly has a lot of passion for music and cares about the material. I didnt like the way her class worked simply because she had you read the textbook and then take a quiz about the material only to go over that same material again in class. This did make it east to remember the material but made me feel like I wasted time. Very approachable.
2158,1369520,2.0,4.0,"She is a good teacher and knowledgable about jazz history. However, if you disagree with her, she will call you out in front of the class and embarrass you to prove her point. When I didn't understand her answer to one of my questions, she got more and more angry with me and then followed it up with condescending comments about my intelligence."
2159,1369520,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Doktor is incredibly passionate about music and it shows in the classroom.  Makes learning music fun and interesting.  I can tell she has listened to cool bands like Pedro the Lion and Yesterself.
2160,1369520,5.0,3.0,"Stephanie is hilarious, personable, and passionate about teaching. She was extremely reasonable with grading and always made herself available to help students. Awesome class."
2161,1369520,5.0,2.0,"I came into this class with no previous technical music knowledge and she made this class so much fun and made you want to learn.  She will stop the lesson and spend as much time as needed to make sure the student understands, her enthusiasm is contagious."
2162,517554,5.0,3.0,Great and very good-looking!
2163,517554,5.0,3.0,"I hated English until I took this class.  It was engaging, helped me with my writing, and I got to read some great books"
2164,517554,2.5,5.0,"This was most everyone's favorite class.  He is enthusiastic and makes it interesting BUT you will read A TON in a short period of time. Very hard paper grader, gives unhelpful feedback, his final exam is vague to the point of incomprehensible and is not based on the texts so much as dates and historical background so you MUST attend lecture."
2165,517554,4.5,4.0,He was extremely helpful in working through the texts and poems. I think he did a good job moderating discussions and he was open to discussing class proceedings with the class. His comments on papers will not only help you for the class but on essays for other english classes. An effective teacher. I'd recommend him as a TA.
2166,517554,4.0,2.0,nice person. makes class interesting and wants you to do well.
2167,517554,4.5,2.0,Pete's a good teacher. He's not one of the best I've ever had but he's very willing to help with your writing and chooses interesting novels. Do the reading because the whole class is discussion and participation is key. He tends to spend a little too much time on some novels and can ramble but is overall a good teacher
2168,517554,5.0,3.0,"Pete teaches novels but more it's more important that he teaches how to think more clearly.  You'll get better at just about everything if you take him, and you may not even notice it until you say something really smart in class! Stickler on attendance, but you'll want to go."
2169,517554,4.5,4.0,Pete came highly recommended by a friend and so far he has not disappointed. By far the most interesting course I have in my schedule.  He knows his stuff cold.
2170,517554,1.5,4.0,"If you're one of his favorites he's helpful.  If not, not. Has a chip on his shoulder and can be inappropriate.  Tries to be your buddy, which some people think passes for teaching.  for some people, that may get them involved with the subject in a roundabout manner.  To me, it's just irritating and off base."
2171,517554,4.0,3.0,"Can't sing this guy's praises enough. The guy doesn't even have his Phd yet, and yet he's one of the finest teachers I've had in my three years of college. On top of it all, he's a great person, and is interested in getting to know you outside of class."
2172,517554,4.5,4.0,This guy can flat out teach. I had no clue what I wanted to study and I just turned in my declaration for the English major because of this course alone.  Take him if you ever get the chance.
2173,517554,5.0,3.0,"This is an awesome class! Pete is so helpful and you can tell that he's really rooting for you to do well. You have to earn your grades and work hard, but its worth it. One of my favorite classes/profs at uva."
2174,517554,5.0,2.0,"Pete was a really cool guy.  He tries to make class interesting and is into the topics.  Also, he was very willing to help during office hours.  As far as grading, he was very fair; you have to earn good grades.  Overall a really good teacher!"
2175,517554,5.0,2.0,Wonderful class. Helps that it's small. Very helpful and willing to work with you. Grades on improvement which is very easy to do as long as you follow his guidelines.
2176,1410505,4.5,3.0,"Professor did assign too much reading and it was very difficult to get practice exams out of him, but he was very fair in his grading. He was approachable, had a good sense of humor in class, and made the subject interesting. He was never intimidating or mean to students and people who asked questions in class didn't get cold called on much."
2177,1410505,1.0,5.0,Professor has huge ego and doesn't teach. Is more interested in telling you how brilliant he us.
2178,67018,3.0,4.0,"Tough grader and can be kinda boring. Read the book! Gives pop quizzes, so be prepared. Know the geological timeline. Tests have stuff only in the readings and he only posts summary slides online, so you have to go to class to get the full information. He does give extra credit, however, it's time extensive and requires effort."
2179,67018,1.0,3.0,"Biggs is probably the worst professor I have had at UVA. He claims to be open to questions, then when you ask one is condescending and fails to answer it clearly. He says to focus on the general concepts then tests on absurdly specific examples. He is not approachable, rude, and says very little of value."
2180,67018,1.0,4.0,"I'm not entirely sure why I kept going to lecture throughout the semester. He sometimes says things of value, but they're too well hidden between long-winded, useless examples. I made the mistake of taking it without the lab- apparently it's the only redeeming part of the course. His tests have D averages, and while he claims not to curve, he will."
2181,67018,1.5,3.0,"Easy material, but he somehow managed to make tests ridiculously difficult to score well on. His lectures were a mess; repeated himself way too much and used too many case studies that we weren't tested on. Least favorite class I've taken at UVA for sure, but not really his fault. He is a funny &nice professor though, that helped make it bearable."
2182,67018,4.0,3.0,"Great guy, very approachable. A tad old fashioned"
2183,67018,3.5,4.0,"It's a hard class, but I also found most of the material we covered to be very interesting. Biggs is willing to help you if you ask for it."
2184,67018,3.5,4.0,"Biggs is a hard grader. His test are extremely hard and you MUST read the textbook - he does not cover all of the material in class. He is very approachable outside of class. Overall, I loved his class. Even with failing the first 2 quizzes and the 1st test, I ended up with a B . You just have to WORK in this class!"
2185,67018,1.0,5.0,He is the worst professor I have come across at this university. His tests are ridiculous and his pop-up quizzes make the class even worse. I am warning you not to take this class!
2186,67018,2.5,5.0,Well you better read the whole book!!! when i say the whole book i mean like everything he assigns very closely!! he is pretty difficult. you need to go to class because he will have pop quizzes. Everything is from the book! have fun!
2187,67018,1.0,5.0,"Mean, arrogant, unhelpful and extremely hard tests. I read all the chapters and attended all lectures and still failed the first exam. Take geology with another professor, Biggs is terrible."
2188,67018,2.0,5.0,"Run in the other direction. This class was absolutely the worst, and it is not easy for non science majors. The tests were far too specific and nit picky for a 100 level class. Lecture is not interesting at all and the reading does not pertain to the class"
2189,67018,2.0,4.0,This is not an easy class.  Do not take it to fill requirements.  Biggs is a rude and completely unhelpful teacher.  I went into this class considering being an EVSC major and he made me change my mind.  The tests do not measure your knowledge or understanding of the material. He gives pop quizes in class to make sure you attend. Dont take EVSC145
2190,67018,2.5,4.0,"This class is taught more like an upper-level course than anything else. His lectures are dry, no matter how excited beneath the surface he may seem he'll make you want to take an unexpected afternoon nap. His tests are far more difficult than they need to be for a 100-level class. Don't take this class if you can avoid it. Definitely not easy."
2191,67018,1.0,5.0,"He is the worst professor I've ever had. He is completely disrespectful to his students during office hours and he is not willing to help people. He expects everyone to understand science just by reading the textbook, because when he lectures, he never actually teaches. Avoid his classes if at all possible."
2192,67018,4.5,4.0,"Biggs is a nice guy and his lectures definitely aren't boring but the info he gives you in class is so no where near as tough as his tests are He has a tendency to be a little arrogant sometimes, but hes willing to office hours. Definitely study for the tests (books/notes) as, like I said they tend to be rather tricky (has surpise in class quizzes)"
2193,67018,3.0,4.0,"He was a pretty good teacher, but tests and quizzes were not so good."
2194,67018,3.0,4.0,"I found him approachable outside of class, he really wanted to understand what I wasn't getting. Nonetheless, tests were a little ridiculous, &quot;knowing everything&quot; is a must because specifics come up. Know your mineralogy. Read the book!"
2195,67018,5.0,5.0,I dig Biggs.
2196,67018,2.5,4.0,"Pop quizzes randomly, usually once a week, tests were really hard because he asked questions that were unimportant to the broad theme so you don't bother to study them."
2197,67018,3.0,5.0,"Biggs is a nice enough guy, the lectures were interesting and I learned a lot. However, the tests aren't easy so READ THE BOOK, he tends to test on nitpicky details, it's good to know processes and stuff inside out. You can drop some quizzes so that's good. I didn't take the lab w/the course but probably should have."
2198,67018,1.0,4.0,"Biggs is not a nice person.  He is not an approachable person.  If you admit to him that you do not understand the subject at hand, he will mock you.  He does not like women.  He belittles them.  Take this class if you must, and hang on his every word.  Maybe then you will get a B."
2199,67018,5.0,3.0,"He's a nice guy and a good teacher.  It's a requirement for the EVSC major, so it's not a gut class and the tests aren't easy."
2200,67018,1.0,5.0,His tests are HARD.  He can't explain geology to a normal person who doesn't dream about plate tectonics.  He is approachable but isn't a good teacher.  Take the Orphaned Lands class with him instead if you're interested in him for his personality rather than his ability to teach.
2201,67018,1.5,4.0,No Comments
2202,67018,1.0,5.0,"Why this man is allowed to teach at this university is beyond me.  Yes, he understands the material but he is truly a horrendous professor.  His tests are absurd and totally worthless in showing how much a student knows.  Also, his guest speakers are inexcusably stupid, except for one former wahoo."
2203,67018,2.5,4.0,"Perhaps the worst class I've ever taken at UVA.  His lectures are sufficient and he know the material but he is honestly incapable of writing an exam.  Besides being absurdly difficult, they do not measure the students knowledge in the subject.  DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!!!!!!!!!"
2204,67018,3.5,3.0,"All I have to say is, &quot;Nuke-u-lus&quot;  He's not too good with the pronunciation.  Geology is not as easy as you think it will be!  Biggs hardly ever works with the book, and he doesn't post his lecture slides, so class attendance is important."
2205,67018,4.0,4.0,"Hard, but very informative.  If you are interested in geology, you should take his class, just be prepared for studying for tests."
2206,67018,1.5,4.0,BEWARE.  Virginia's environment is not a gut and Biggs is not easy.
2207,67018,4.5,3.0,"I loved this class, Biggs is awesome for the material.  Moves quickly but clearly through the material -- attending class is a must if you want to do well"
2208,67018,2.0,3.0,"This prof. isn't the best, he hasn't even been rated in forever! But, I will say he gives extra credit opportunities.  He's a pretty nice guy, but he's not the best prof.  He's not the worst though.  Flies through slides, doesn't always correlate with the book, office hours don't always help..."
2209,67018,4.0,3.0,"Good teacher, keeps you engaged.  Dreamy."
2210,67018,4.5,4.0,Good teacher and helpful lectures... no helpful book for the class... tests and quizes are more difficult than expected... plan ahead and write the extra credit research paper!
2211,67018,2.0,5.0,"He is a good teacher, but his test and quizes are very difficult."
2212,67018,3.0,3.0,No Comments
2213,67018,4.0,3.0,"Very knowledgeable.  Nice course material, but hard tests and quizzes.  A lot of interesting guest speakers--a plus!"
2214,67018,3.0,3.0,Biggs made this class more difficult than it needed to be; hard tests
2215,67021,3.0,2.0,"This class is so chill. The discussions once a week are just so you can sit back and watch a movie, which you'll spend the next couple lectures going over and re-watching clips from. Prof. Korte is clearly passionate about film and is adorable in an old-person kind of way. Only 2 exams throughout the whole year, and definitely doable."
2216,67021,5.0,3.0,"Very animated and interesting for such an old guy. Definitely knows his stuff and is able to present it clearly. Don't expect a film anthology - the class focuses on just a handful of directors (Welles, Hitchcock, Kubrick, Scorsese), but they are spread over a variety of techniques. Loved this class even as a science major."
2217,67021,4.5,2.0,"Great class, shows the films that are the &quot;classics&quot; for those who study or love film (not movies). Very clear in what he wants the student to walk away from the class knowing. Visit office hours to chat him up/ask questions. Awesome one on one. DO attend class...info for exams is all presented there and DO see all the films, clips, etc GREAT CLASS"
2218,67021,2.0,2.0,I honestly didn't like the class.  Yes it was relatively easy but I don't feel like I learned anything.  The class is Cinema as an Art Form yet well over half of the films are by Martin Scorsesse which doesn't give you a good overview of an art form in my opinion.  Lectures are boring and get very very repetitive.
2219,67021,4.5,3.0,Not my area of study but Walter really grabbed my interest in the class. Easily my favorite teacher at UVa. Medium difficulty first test then two essay exams that unless you are a moron AND don't go to any classes you will get a B or above.
2220,67021,5.0,2.0,This was a great class! It was very interesting and not hard at all. You have a multiole choice text test which you must do the reading for. Luckily this test doesnt count for too much ( got a D but still got an A- for the class). There is also two essay tests (2 essays/ test) which are graded pretty easily. The TA's and the professor are also grea
2221,67021,2.0,1.0,"Having taken two separate classes with Korte, I can say the the vast majority of the films he selects are awful.  What they also have in common are overtly sexual themes and undertones.  It's like watching bad**** without the freedom to ****.  You can score an easy &quot;A,&quot; but you won't learn anything useful."
2222,67021,5.0,1.0,"AMAZING CLASS!! Korte is SO knowledgeable! It may seem easy to skip the lectures, but they are so interesting - and if you pay attention you are guaranteed a good grade in the class. Plus, the movies are awesome as well. If you do the readings and go to lecture you will come out with an A ... and be a movie buff!"
2223,67021,3.5,3.0,"Very interesting and knowledgeable professor. Gives a few non mandatory lectures per week, along with 1 required movie screening. Only two grades in the entire class, a midterm and a final. Good class if you like movies and care enough to figure out exactly what the graders are looking for."
2224,67021,5.0,1.0,"TAKE THIS CLASS! It is really interesting, especially if you like movies. Porf. Korte really knows his stuff and makes the class really interesting. If you go to class and do the readings you are bound to get a really good grade."
2225,67021,5.0,3.0,This class was very interesting and the movies were great.  The textbook is pretty much useless except on the multiple choice exam.  The essays are much easier if you think of topics beforehand and outline the scenes so you have some idea of what to write on.
2226,67021,5.0,2.0,"Prof Korte is a very knowledgeable about the movies, but he never sees a singlemidterm anf final ( and those are the only grades you receive) The class is easy if you keep up with going to class and reading... then you can write up a storm and adhere to their formula...He spells things out SEVERAL times in a lecture period... seems like a cool guy."
2227,67021,5.0,2.0,"OK, easy class, but so much fun and very interesting...I actually took away a lot info that makes me look at movies differently....see him during office hours to chat...very helpful to organize all the info that he presents...."
2228,67021,3.5,2.0,"Maybe I'm artistically retarded, but I don't like the way this guy teaches. Exams are essay tests where you have to write about things that he's never mentioned in class and have nothing to do with movies. On the first exam, he asked us to relate cinematic devices to feminism. Turn on director commentary on DVDs if you want to learn about movies :("
2229,67021,5.0,1.0,"Amazing lecturer who spells out most of his points. He knows his movies and shares many interesting views on the films watched in class. We focused on Scorsese, which was a cinematic wet-dream as his passion was incredible. You WILL look at movies in a different light after the class and will finally realize how crappy movies like The Notebook are."
2230,67021,2.0,3.0,"my attendance rate was around 10%... and i still got a B+. nearly everything this man says is redundant. the reading is unneccesary. his more ambitious points are clouded by his inability to speak. one cool thing -- he has alright movie taste, and the free screenings make for good dates."
2231,67021,4.5,2.0,"This was my most enjoyable class of the semester. We watched citizen kane, psycho, the usual suspects and 7 other great movies - one unit on Orson Welles/Alfred Hitchcock and one on film noir. Only two tests - a midterm and a final. Lectures are easy to sit through and the class is about movies!"
2232,67021,3.5,4.0,Korte may be a dry lecturer but he loves movies and his tests are not bad. Hint: Prepare ahead of time your scenes & listen because he might hint similar TQ's.  If you love movies you will probably enjoy this class. More reading than I expected but Korte is cool!
2233,67021,2.5,2.0,"Knows what he's talking about, says &quot;Uh, um, err...&quot; when he's trying to think up a word, which is very entertaining. Go to the weekend movie reviews!!!  Reading only necessary before taking midterm, for cinematographic terms."
2234,67021,3.5,1.0,"Prof. Korte isn't the best lecturer at the University, but the material is certainly interesting and he has a definite love of film.  Easy course if you prepare for the tests and come to class.  I wouldn't recommend this to someone not already interested in film, but I loved it!"
2235,67021,3.5,3.0,"could he be any uh uh uh um ummmm ummm more ughhhhhhh...boring!  Be more boring!  if you ummmm uhhhhuuuuuhhhh uhhhhhhh, think that, that this entry is uhhhhhhhh, ummmm, hard to, hard to read, then, you may no ummmm, uhhh, want to, want to take...this class because uh, this is exactly how he lectures"
2236,67021,5.0,2.0,"Korte's lectures are circuitous but he eventually gets to the point. Study the glossary for the objective because it's incredibly hard, but the essays are easy."
2237,67021,4.5,2.0,korte's lectures are for the most part engaging and the reading for the class is very managable. the objective test is fairly hard but the essay-format tests are much easier.
2238,67021,5.0,2.0,"I have taken several Korte classes over the years, and if you are interested in film, then you will find his courses both interesting and engaging. He is extremely animated in his smaller classes and definitely knows his stuff. Definitely one of the few g"
2239,67021,4.5,3.0,"I enjoyed this class very much, but beware, the lectures are quite boring, but Korte knows his stuff and the movies are fantastic."
2240,67021,3.0,2.0,"Korte looks like Hitchcock.  He does tend to blather on and on, but the movies are interesting and if you just reguritate what he's said, and try to apply it a little to specific scenes within the movie, you'll ace the class."
2241,67021,3.0,3.0,"I would not recommend this class.  I find him an unneccesarily verbose prof who loves the sound of his own voice. In, my opinion the subject matter is fairly interesting, but the presentation is pitiful and not worth the difficult midterm."
2242,67021,5.0,2.0,"1 very hard multiple choice test & 2 easy essay tests, watch movies/great lectur"
2243,1328592,3.0,3.0,"He was overall a good teacher.  He could seem condescending at times, though, and didn't seem to care much about the students."
2244,1328592,4.0,2.0,"From hearing about other Calc 2 teachers friends have had, I'm very glad I had Josh. He's a nice guy and does a good job of explaining the material well, although the pacing is fast at times."
2245,1328592,5.0,2.0,Josh was awesome. Really funny and entertaining. I learned a lot from him and enjoyed his class.
2246,1328592,5.0,3.0,"Many of my friends took the same class with different grad students, and from talking with them I am incredibly glad I had Josh. He really wanted us to do well, and helped by curving tests and providing extra credit (which other teachers did not do). I thought he was very clear and good at explaining problems. Also willing to help you after class."
2247,1328592,5.0,2.0,Josh is the sweetest teacher. Explains new concepts in interesting ways... it really helped me understand it. And his drawings on the board are awesome. He makes nerdy math jokes - you won't find that in many other classes. Josh is rare! Take his class. He's very helpful and it actually made me look forward to calculus class. :)
2248,1328592,3.0,3.0,"Pretty awkward and not the most enthusiastic teacher, but he's a LOT better than most of the other grad students teaching the course. He's really helpful if you ask questions, otherwise he'll just keep moving through the material. Pretty funny, if you can appreciate nerdy-math-grad-student humor."
2249,1328592,3.0,1.0,Nice guy but he struggles to be a teacher.  He knows his stuff and his helpful when you go in to see him.
2250,1328594,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Hopper should definitely play basketball.  This mamma-jamma has got to be almost 7 feet tall.  It can be kind of intimidating, but he is a gentle giant of sorts, and his southern charm is endearing.  But really, someone should tell Tony Bennett about him."
2251,1328596,5.0,2.0,"Sean is awesome.  I don't know why some of these ratings are bad.  He's funny, explains things well, and he doesn't drown you with homework.  What more could you want out of a math teacher?"
2252,1328596,3.0,5.0,Sean is very interested in the subject and is very willing to help if you attend office hours. The way he presents information is as if everything is a review. He is very unclear and overall is poor at explaining concepts.
2253,1328596,4.0,3.0,"Sean is cool.  He starts every class with a math joke.  He is really passionate about math and gets very excited.  People that don't like him probably just didn't work hard (which kind of necessary to do well in calculus).  Overall, a good guy and a decent teacher."
2254,1328596,4.0,2.0,"I think Sean is a great teacher. He is so excited about math and it makes the class interesting. He reminded me how much I enjoy math. It is refreshing to have a teacher so excited about what he is teaching. He follows the book really well so if you are confused, you can always follow along in the textbook. Overall, not that hard."
2255,1328596,3.5,4.0,"Sean is a great teacher. He is willing to help students that seek out help. Calc is hard, but Sean has made it bearable. He is extremely passionate about Math - his lectures go fast, but be sure to attend office hours!"
2256,1328596,1.0,4.0,I still do not understand how Sean is paid to teach at UVA. Worst teacher at the University by far. He took a subject I used to be interested in and made me hate it. Switch to a different teacher immediately.
2257,1328596,2.0,5.0,"Mr. Clark speaks much too fast and his penmanship is atrocious.  He also looks a bit like a hobbit, which makes me giggle on the inside.  Overall, I wouldn't hit that."
2258,1533398,4.0,2.0,Knowledgeable and covered all topics. Followed textbook and had interesting experiences to make lectures more lively and enjoyable. Students who wanted to be spoon fed and lazy will not like this type of old school professor. But he does teach well and is worthy of respect. I liked him.
2259,1533398,1.5,3.0,Useless professor. Didn't learn a thing. Avoid at all costs.
2260,1533398,2.5,4.0,"Hendrickson hasn't taught for 10 years prior to this, and unfortunately it shows. He seems ignorant to the needs of his students in class and moves through both conceptual material and example problems too quickly. If he returns, I don't recommend this class."
2261,1230296,5.0,4.0,This girl is on fire. Best class I've taken at UVA.
2262,1230296,5.0,4.0,Good TA.
2263,1230296,3.0,2.0,"Gwen Nally is a fun TA who definitely has passion for the subject matter and does her best to engage students. This being said, she's a surprisingly tough grader when it comes to essays. Attending class is most definitely optional."
2264,1230296,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Nally (She likes to be called Gwen!) was great! Her class was really helpful! (I also like the clothes she wears). Sometimes she looked really tired, but her intellect never faded!"
2265,296411,3.5,4.0,"Dr.H was a great teacher. Loves to teach and woo the students. If you want an A just say DNA a lot. Test are tough, real tough."
2266,296411,5.0,5.0,I thought Dr. Hecht was a fantastic teacher.  He lectured with great enthusiasm and was very helpful when I went for help. You have to study a lot and take a lot of notes in lecture. It is possible to get an A.
2267,296411,4.0,4.0,No Comments
2268,2754011,4.0,2.0,"Absolutely loved Hogg as a professor! She was really nice and made the class engaging. Make sure that you continue on in the class if you get worried about the homework. When you start the Contrase&ntilde;a activities it seems like hours on end of work, but around half of the assignments aren't required! Only check the ones that are due the next morning."
2269,787946,1.0,5.0,He's horrible 
2270,787946,2.0,5.0,He is not a good professor. He tries but usually just confusing. The course material is boring. Tests are hard. Didn't feel like i learned much. I'd avoid it.
2271,787946,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2272,787946,4.0,2.0,This guy likes to teach. Very understanding and concerned for his students. Very helpful.
2273,787946,4.5,3.0,"Decent teacher, willing to offer any help a student desires. Offers extra credit so its easy to pull up your grade if you do poorly on a test.  Very cute personality, enjoyed going to class."
2274,1041900,4.0,3.0,"Coulter is the best. He's a bit nerdy, but you can tell he really knows his stuff, and can talk about it forever. I don't know why people are complaining about his ling classes, yes they can be tough, but he's very clear and helpful. I definitely would take more classes with this guy--He's been awesome."
2275,1041900,2.0,3.0,"Professor George is...alright. He certainly knows a lot about the topic (I was in a class on Lucretius' De Rerum Natura), but he's a bit unapproachable if you have questions. His classroom vibe is also very tense in general. I wouldn't say to avoid him as a professor, but you should definitely have a great interest in the material."
2276,1041900,3.5,2.0,"George is ok. He's very clear, and his exams were fair. He's kind of a stickler about spelling and punctuation, but all around the class wasn't bad. I've heard bad things about the language classes though. Steer clear!"
2277,1041900,2.0,4.0,"The professor managed to make what should have been a fairly straigtforward, if difficult, class into a hellish nightmare of boredom and confusion.  Also, he's not too helpful in office hours either, so make friends with a grad student who can help you study."
2278,787948,1.0,5.0,"Professor Krzystofowicz is one of the least professional professors I have ever had. He gives incredibly dull lectures paired with 20+ page typed homework assignment, to be completed and printed on a bi-weekly basis, despite he and his TA not grading the assignments for 6-7 weeks. If you can in any way avoid this man, avoid this man."
2279,787948,1.0,4.0,"Bad lecturer, super harsh grading, and will not answer questions. nuff said."
2280,787948,5.0,1.0,Best Class I ever had.
2281,787948,5.0,1.0,"I don't understand why people do not like him. He is the greatest professor I ever had. Read,  do his problems, and you will pass. "
2282,787948,5.0,5.0,"An incredible instructor. His classes are incredibly painful, but so is being born."
2283,787948,2.5,4.0,"He seems to lecture right out of the book and gives very few examples, which may explain why our grades are so much lower than the other sections. Make sure you have your book if you ever go see him for help or he'll yell at you!"
2284,787948,1.5,4.0,"Terrible, avoid at all costs! Very cute old man, clear polish accent, but basically just reads out of the book.  On average, our test scores were 20 points beneath the other classes, enough said."
2285,1803756,1.5,2.0,Very unclear. Speaks with weird accent. Seems very confident but doesn't really know what he himself is talking about. Wouldn't recommend him.
2286,1803756,5.0,1.0,"Professor is very nice, easygoing, and patient. This course is not very hard but requires you to attend classes regularly cos everything in the exam will be related to what he taught in class. It's easy to get an A if you follow him in class. Strongly recommended if you want to take 302 and want to learn some serious stuff while still getting an A."
2287,1803756,4.0,3.0,Tests are easy if study the notes and practice exams.
2288,1402354,2.0,3.0,"i did feel bad for her, she had to fill big shoes for sanda while she was away. however, the projects were unclear and the TAs hated her."
2289,1402354,2.5,4.0,"If there is anyone that has had Erin as either a professor or advisor who finds her the least bit HELPFUL or even INTELLIGENT I would like to meet him/her.  I feel bad for her during lectures because, at times, she seems to know less than the TAs/students.  God help her....."
2290,1402354,2.5,5.0,overbearing power tripper.  I feel sorry for those who have to take her 102 class.  Sanda was the best :(
2291,1041907,5.0,1.0,"Chaussee's a great professor. Very funny and knowledgeable, and works very hard to get to know his students."
2292,1041907,3.0,2.0,"He is a smart dude and a good teacher. At first he seems like a really awesome person as well, but as time goes on you find that he is a bit of a mean-spirited guy... Sometimes it feels like he is just waiting to make fun of us. But it's ok. The worst thing is that he thinks he's really cool. Like, the Ryan Gosling saving jazz music brand of cool."
2293,1041907,5.0,3.0,"Chaussee Ji is an amazing man and teacher. He is very youthful, and because you're taking the class four times a week, you get the opportunity to know him very well. He is inspirational, and extremely knowledgable about his field. It has been my favorite class at UVA so far - and I plan on continuing in the Urdu track so I can stay with him!"
2294,1041907,5.0,3.0,"The best language teacher I've had, extremely helpful and full of interesting information. If you want to learn any language or have a specific interest in hindi/urdu, take this class. He rules!"
2295,1041907,5.0,2.0,Silver fox!
2296,1041907,5.0,4.0,"Griff Sahab is quite possibly the best teacher I had at UVa. He's extremely intelligent and knowledgeable and knows when to get down to business but has a funny side. Do your work in his class and expect to be challenged on the quizzes, they're not terribly easy, but lots of practice will definitely help. Overall a great professor, highly recommend"
2297,1041907,5.0,4.0,No Comments
2298,1041907,5.0,2.0,"Griffji is a great teacher- very helpful and makes the material very clear.  Sometimes he flakes out and cancels class (pretty often actually), but that's the only problem.  If you show you put in any effort at all you'll get an A."
2299,1541620,2.0,4.0,"A very bad lecturer, but a very nice and patient teacher outside of class. Don't recommend unless you are a good independent learner, or you have the time to spend hours in office hours."
2300,1541620,4.5,3.0,"She makes the topic really easy to understand and honestly I would say she's one of the best Math teachers I've had. You can miss a few classes and still be okay, though I wouldn't make a habit of it."
2301,1541620,1.5,5.0,Awful teacher. Stay away at all costs. Worst teacher I have ever had.
2302,1541620,1.5,4.0,"Bad. She faces the board the whole class, speaks really quietly, and does not explain concepts well at all. Her ""lectures"" are hard to follow and I never feel prepared for exams. She is a really nice person and is available outside of class if you seek her help. However, I would not recommend her ESPECIALLY if you aren't familiar with CALC."
2303,1541620,3.0,4.0,"Sue He is not clear in her teaching, talks quietly, faces the board, and assigns a ridiculous and almost impossible amount of homework. She is nice if you go to office hours, but there are oftena lot of people there trying to get clarification. Try to get Daniel Remine if possibl!"
2304,1541620,1.0,3.0,Sue He is a terrible teacher. She reads off her notes and does not face the class. She writes out everything and avoids difficult questions that you ask. She also assigns a ridiculous amount of homework. If you have no prior experience with calculus then either hire a tutor or find another teacher
2305,1738228,4.5,2.0,Very nice and very helpful. I really look forward to class. He is very knowledgable and helpful.  I have grown as an actor through his class. He is also very funny.
2306,2729463,5.0,4.0,"Shes a diamond in the rough. Some things just stick with you and I would sign up for everything she taught if possible. She made complicated topics relatable, clear and ez"
2307,1779192,4.0,2.0,"She's a pretty good professor, although she takes off for some unimportant things on the essay exams.  As long as you go to class and read the texts, you will be fine."
2308,2655742,2.0,4.0,"Professor Morse is probably the hardest teacher the world has ever seen. I scored a 800 on the math portion of the SAT and got a D in the class. Professor Morse makes you watch lectures online and do graded homework after every single homework. That's not including the 20+ problems she assigns weekly for ADDITIONAL homework. Very nice lady, though."
2309,2532872,5.0,3.0,"A really solid teacher, seriously so kind and accommodating. There were no late penalties which was awesome bc it was a 4-week summer class at a moderately fast pace. She speaks with a lot of care for the material and very respectful to students, even bringing up when students made &quot;really great,&quot; &quot;astute,&quot; or &quot;insightful&quot; points in posts/essays"
2310,2532872,5.0,2.0,"one of the BEST professors/teachers ive had, I didn't know anything about the subject going in but she wanted to see you working with the material not just pure knowledge, I had the flu and she was SO understanding and let me get back on track with my other classes and then helped me to get back on track with hers 100% take one of her classes!!!!!!"
2311,624152,3.0,5.0,"Great guy, good lecture, horrible readings.  The readings are extremely dense and long (sometimes 60+ pages to read  for a class) and you have to pay attention to all the words he says because he does not write words on his PPT slides.  If you are looking for a good segway into Art History, this is not it.  Not recommended for other majors."
2312,624152,4.5,3.0,"Fordham is a great Professor and it's obvious how interested he is in the subject matter. My only problem was actually getting to the class, as it was a 9:30, but despite this he is a very engaging teacher and at times very witty and entertaining. His class isn't necessarily difficult, but you do need to do the readings and study to get an A."
2313,624152,4.5,3.0,"Fordham is adorable, knowledgeable, and very engaging! Attendance was not mandatory, but you definitely need to go because there is no textbook. The readings were a little tough for the level of the class, but you only need general ideas from them. Not much work besides memorizing slides for the midterm/final. Besides that just a 5-10 pg paper!"
2314,624152,5.0,4.0,"One of the best teachers I've had at UVA. He is very interesting, cute, extremely knowledgeable, and good at leading classroom discussion (even in a larger lecture setting). I want to take more of his classes!"
2315,624152,4.0,2.0,Fordham is a young professor who got very interested in the subject matter of the course I took - British Art History. He has cute nerdy moments that make him endearing and for the most part the lectures are interesting. He pulls a lot from the articles so take good notes on the themes and main points of those as well as recording lecture notes!
2316,624152,5.0,4.0,"Amazing teacher, great class. He really gets you excited about art, and you can tell he's very passionate and very knowledgeable."
2317,624152,4.5,3.0,Fordham is awesome. He's a pretty good lecturer and is a really nice guy.
2318,624152,4.0,3.0,"Really interesting class, most of the reading is articles on toolkit so probably not really worth it to buy the textbook except maybe for the images but you can google those."
2319,624152,5.0,4.0,Great professor who makes the subject really interesting. Has a lot of energy.
2320,624152,5.0,4.0,"This was easily my favorite class, but also my hardest. The tests were very straight forward, but there was a TON of memorization required. Fordham's lectures were fascinating, and he really cares about his students. I'd definitely recommend him as a professor, just be prepared to devote a lot of time to his class."
2321,624152,4.5,2.0,"Doug rocks, he's adorable and funny and his lectures are very clear. The tests are very straightforward as long as you know the material and pretty easy to do well on."
2322,624152,5.0,5.0,"This is an absolutely fantastic class.  He is a brillant and eloquent lecturer, very passionate about the subject.   Best class I've taken at uva...and I'm a 4th year.     Warning - tons of memorization required so be willing to spend long nights in the library."
2323,624152,5.0,3.0,Great class. Lectures rarely dry but Prof. Fordham keeps it entertaining regardless. Important to keep up with the readings and go to lectures if you want to all the material on the exams.
2324,624152,5.0,2.0,"prof fordham is very clear, engaging, and incredibly nice. he's been extremely helpful and encourages class participation. i enjoy going to his lectures, and make a point not to miss them. he's a fair grader, and the memorization wasn't excessive. i highly recommend his class for anyone, even with no art history background."
2325,624152,4.5,3.0,"I initally only took this class to fill my humanities requirement, since I couldn't take studio art. But it really ended up being one of my most favorite classes so far, and I never felt bored in that class even though it's mainly lecture. There are lots of readings to do, but otherwise, it's a great class!"
2326,624152,4.5,3.0,"I signed up for British Art History as a random course of interest, and now it's one of my favorite classes this semester.  Professor Fordham is an engaging lecturer, the subject matter is interesting, and it's made me want to take more art history classes.  There's a steady flow of important reading, but it's managable.  Really good class."
2327,624152,4.0,3.0,"It's a fun class and gives a interesting take on history and how it effected art during this time.  The text to read are up and down for interest; you have to be sure to keep up on them.  But, Fordham is great, helpful, funny, and hot.  Also, the lectures help with getting through some confusing parts of the text."
2328,624152,5.0,2.0,"This is a pretty easy class, not a lot of reading and the tests aren't too bad.  The class can get boring but Prof Fordham makes up for it because he has a good sense of humor and is hot."

2330,1238559,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Wright is absolutely brilliant, he is very knowledgeable. His lectures are insightful. He introduces very relevant concepts with an equally relevant personal anecdote to go with it. Grades a little tough, he appreciates critical thinking and well source papers. I had him for 3 semesters and learned a lot from him."
2331,1238559,1.0,3.0,"We ordered a bunch of books and used one of them. There was no plan for the class at all. We'd show up, he'd talk about how great he was and then get frustrated when we didn't have anything to say. Say something about what?! There's no structure! There's no lesson plan!"
2332,1238559,2.5,4.0,"I found professor Wright's lectures very insightful and although I found the assigned readings a bit boring and at times unintelligible, I do feel I came away with a better grasp of the subject. Be prepared to do a lot of reading and writing. He's eccentric and can be critical of your ideas but if you do the reading and writing you should be okay."
2333,1238559,4.0,3.0,"I found him to be pompous and full of himself.  He doesn't want your ideas in your paper.  He only wants to make sure you get his opinions clearly stated.  I have never before or since had a college professor who tore down my papers so much simply because my ideas were showing through too clearly.  Of course, he would never use those words exactly."
2334,1238559,4.0,5.0,"Luke has very high standards for himself and for you. He's very knowledgeable. Expect a lot of reading, a lot of writing, and about a third of a letter grade lower than you usually get from other professors."
2335,1238559,4.0,5.0,"I found him to be compelling. His only fault is that he is a womanizer. This is good for the females because they make better overall grades than the men. However, I can't prove this."
2336,1238559,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely fabulous teacher - very passionate about his subject. Originally, I signed up just because, but I ended up loving it and he was extremely helpful when I went to office hours! A fair amount of reading from a couple of books, but he makes it bearable"

2338,362019,5.0,1.0,I'm here rating Bill on APMA642 but in fact he wasn't my professor in APMA642 because I never took it -- I did 702 and 703 with Jim Simmonds.  But he was my adviser for my PhD back in the 80s and he was a fantastic adviser.   I've seen the comments about about having to be proactive and that's true.   A brilliant mathematical-computational modeler.
2339,362019,3.0,4.0,I knew him when we were both much younger.  His lectures were actually pretty good.  Not exactly super helpful outside the lectures however.  No sense of humor.  His work on atomic weapons didn't seem to help his karma over the years.
2340,362019,5.0,2.0,He is a great teacher. He is an old style teacher who takes his job seriously. The exams are on the same level of the homeworks. The only complain I have is he gives a bit too much homework otherwise he is a fine professor.
2341,362019,3.5,5.0,"Contrary to other ratings, he's a decent teacher. Explains each core concept in depth, albeit somewhat tedious and monotonous, but he does explain it well and comprehensively. The professor is approachable but that has to be by the student's own accord. Jared, the TA for my class, was great and the review sessions will get you through this class."
2342,362019,1.0,5.0,Took this via distance learning. Just barely got a B. Does not cater to students. Gives excessive homework. Rarely gives direction on homework corrections. Gives no help on homework. Communication skills are lacking.
2343,362019,1.0,4.0,No Comments
2344,362019,1.0,4.0,"Teaches from overhead only. He photocopies the books (don't buy them) and hands them out; those are your notes. Tests are six-hour sessions OUTSIDE of class, on Friday nights, 6pm-12am. Ask for help and you'll be directed to drop the course. 60% drop rate"

2346,362019,1.0,5.0,Probably the worst prof in the e-school. Seems to try to get students confused so he can get them to drop the class. Thinks his class should come before EVERYTHING else and thus gives around 15-20 hours/week of homework.
2347,362019,1.0,5.0,"The absolute worst teacher I have ever taken. He is a condescending, mean-spirited, and bitter old man, and to top it off, his lectures are horrible. He berates students as he teaches."
2348,1648168,3.0,5.0,"He works very fast in his lectures, but he is very willing to help you outside of the classroom. The homeworks are online and did not aid me at all in learning the subject material and are almost pointless. I've resorted to get a tutor to try to salvage my grade and G.P.A."
2349,1648168,3.0,3.0,He goes super fast during lectures but if there's ever point when you don't understand something he's more than willing to help if you want it. The main problem just the transferring of information from teacher to student. Long and sometimes difficult explanations for simple things. Quizzes and homework are fairly easy as long as you put in effort.
2350,1648168,3.5,4.0,"He is a great teacher. He is always willing to help even outside of office hours. He may not at get his point across in the clearest way, but is VERY patient and understanding. You definitely have to put a lot of effort in keeping up in lecture because he goes quite fast."
2351,1648168,1.0,5.0,The homework doesn't really prepare you for the class. Exams are scheduled before the reading days meant for studying and preparing. The lecture and discussion aren't particularly helpful. Be prepared to teach yourself into the wee hours of the morning.
2352,1648168,2.0,4.0,1.  Makes things so much harder and confusing than they need to be 2.  Math homework online? Its just a terrible idea that doesn't  help you learn the material 3. He's nice and is willing to help if you are willing  to ask 4. Quizzes are VERY tough (and every week) but exactly like the homework (which is also tough)
2353,1648168,2.5,4.0,"He's an intelligent guy with good intentions, and is always willing to listen and help out if he can, but communication is difficult between him and the students. Classes are quick-paced and although they're not mandatory, they might as well be because you really can't afford to miss anything. "
2354,1205800,4.0,4.0,"Professor Li is a super nice guy and a good teacher. This class was super hard though, a lot of people didn't do well on the exams so I suggest really studying before the three tests. He drops the lowest grade. Do the extra credit, and attend lectures to get the iclickr credit. He really cares about the subject and it shows."
2355,1205800,5.0,1.0,"Incredibly interesting lectures! Super easy class, and you don't even need an actual clicker for the clicker questions. All you have to do is show up for lectures, study for like 5 minutes before quizzes, and you'll be fine."
2356,1205800,3.0,4.0,All the powerpoints Li uses for lectures are posted online. He is a sweet man but the material is not interesting whatsoever. Class is easy for people willing to study before each quiz. You need to show up in order to earn clicker points. Do the extra credit.
2357,1205800,4.5,1.0,"Awesome lecturer. Plays funny videos as ""break time"". If you follow powerpoints and read some of the textbook you will be fine for tests; they are quite easy. I suggest doing extra credit even if you think you're doing well. He drops lowest test grade. He is very sweet and doesn't get much kids in office hours, don't be scared to ask for help. "
2358,1205800,4.0,1.0,"Awesome lecturer, plays funny videos as ""break time"". No homework. Look at powerpoints and maybe textbook and you will be fine. Tests are not hard at all really. Do the extra credit even if you don't think you need it because why not. He is very sweet and doesn't seem to get much kids for office hours, don't be scared to go and ask for help."
2359,1205800,4.0,3.0,He is a good proferssor
2360,1205800,5.0,2.0,"Professor Li is a boss.  His lectures are really interesting and fun and he knows his stuff.  He tries to make the material interesting for everyone.  Also, he doesn't give homework.  I didn't even buy the book and I just went to class and did fine."
2361,1205800,2.5,3.0,Li's class will lull you into a certain false sense of ease.  Read the chapters and you will do well.
2362,976426,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mohajeri is one of the sweetest professors I've ever had. Assuming you show up to class every day and do the homework, should be a very standard class. Saw a review that said he gives off cute grandpa energy, which is 100% true"
2363,976426,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mohajeri was the best professor I've had for math. I struggled with multi in high school, but his teaching style and attention to concepts/details helped me understand each chapter very well. He also has cute grandpa energy"
2364,976426,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, very sweet. Cute grandpa type. Lectures are generally easy to follow."
2365,976426,5.0,3.0,"Mohajeri is a really good guy and a really good professor. His online version of the class he taught really well, and you could go back and watch the recorded lectures before quizzes and tests and it really helps. If you're going to take APMA 2120, absolutely take it with Mohajeri and get to know him and go to his office hours."
2366,976426,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic professor, favorite professor ive had so far, even though the grading was hard, Ive learned more in this class than any class ive taken so far, high school included. Pay attention to every word this man says, as every word from his mouth is pure golden wisdom/great instruction. Cares for his students, extremely rewarding, wonderful."
2367,976426,5.0,3.0,"Mike is the MAN. Hands down the best math teacher and in general the best professor I've had so far. He's passionate about what he's teaching and he really wants all of his students to understand the concepts. If you're taking APMA 2120, go for Prof. Mohajeri immediately."
2368,976426,5.0,4.0,"Professor Mohajeri is a cool guy. Knows his stuff and is able to deliver it well. He likes to joke with people if they show up late or turn in work late, but don't take it to heart. Overall great professor."
2369,976426,4.0,4.0,"Professor Mohajeri definitely knows his content very well and is one of the best math professors especially in conveying concepts, but there have been times he seemed rather unapproachable and made students feel bad about their performance or lack of understanding of a concept, which is the opposite of what professors should do."
2370,976426,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely amazing, actually cares and knows what he's talking about."
2371,976426,5.0,3.0,An amazing teacher. Truly knows about the subject and can teach it well. Also genuinely cares about you succeeding in the class.
2372,976426,4.0,3.0,"Our class had 3 homework problems every night before he lectured on the topic. Halfway through he changed it so we did hw on a subject after the lectures. He talks and explains a lot but spends SO MUCH TIME deriving, which isn't on tests. Come into class with specific problems about which to ask! And go see TAs early on!!!"
2373,976426,4.0,3.0,"Our class had 3 homework problems every night before he lectured on the topic. Halfway through he changed it so we did hw on a subject after the lectures.

2374,976426,3.0,3.0,"Mohajeri is an okay professor, but honestly the cutest guy. He's very understanding if you are sick or if you can't attend a test or if you accidentally only forgot about a webassign or woke up late (obviously only once but some professors don't understand at all). He's an okay teacher, really tries to explain concepts, but the webassig really help"
2375,976426,5.0,3.0,"Best professor at UVA, the most quote-able professor you will have in all of your schooling. Do your homework and you will be fine, he is very accessible in office hours or via email. He makes boring lectures fun with his sense of humor and constant happy demeanor. He will make you smile every class. Lots of review, definitely take his class."
2376,976426,4.0,4.0,He's a tough grader but otherwise a great professor. He makes sure to go into detail with his explanations. Watch out for attendance and class participation.
2377,976426,2.5,4.0,He makes tests harder than any of the other professors. Likes going on rants that are hard to follow. Also kinda looks like one of those fish from spongebob. 
2378,976426,4.0,3.0,"Really great guy, does his absolute best to keep calculus as interesting as he can.  The quizzes and tests can be challenging but he gives a TON of partial credit, as long as you understand the basic concepts."
2379,976426,5.0,3.0,"He is an amazing teacher! Not easy but keeps you listening. He's this cute little grandpa type guy, has a good sense of humor, but is very helpful, especially during office hours."
2380,976426,5.0,3.0,"Mohajeri is one of the best professors I have had, which was surprising for an entry-level calculus class. His lectures were as entertaining as math lectures can be, yet incredibly clear and concise. He knows how to teach and gives you everything you need to succeed in Multivariable."
2381,976426,5.0,3.0,"He is really great! So helpful, and he really cares about his students.  He takes attendance, and has weekly written homework, weekly online homework and weekly quizzes.  I would definitely recommend him."
2382,976426,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, always seems to be in a good mood. Class is quite doable if you go to the lectures."
2383,976426,5.0,2.0,"He is fantastic. He really cares about his students and if you like his sense of humor, can be rather entertaining. Not a fan of multi, but Mohajeri definitely made it bearable. Highly recommend."
2384,976426,5.0,2.0,He is the best professor ever.
2385,976426,4.0,3.0,"Mohajeri really cares about his students' success and brings a little bit of charm to Multi. He is quite clear, fair, and organized, and goes over all his notes right before quizzes which really helps!"
2386,976426,5.0,3.0,"He is one of the most approachable teachers at UVA and genuinely wants his students to do well.  His lectures can be a bit fast-paced at times, but explain the material very well.  His weekly tests, though annoying, are very effective in teaching the material.  Great teacher."
2387,976426,5.0,3.0,"Mohajeri is awesome.  Notes are crystal clear and is very helpful in office hours.  That being said, the class can be challenging and moves fast at times so don't skip.  He takes attendance so if you are having trouble but he can tell you are making an effort, he'll help you out."
2388,976426,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, couldn't ask for better in any way."
2389,976426,5.0,3.0,"Best math teacher at UVA. Very clear, teaches you what you need to know for the tests."
2390,976426,5.0,3.0,"Best math professor at UVA. Lectures and notes are clear, tests and quizzes are good representations of the material covered in class, and they are graded fairly. He actually makes calculus interesting and applies it to real world problems."
2391,976426,5.0,1.0,"Best math teacher ever. Hands down. Clear explanations, goes over problems, great notes, and fair tests. He will teach the test in many cases. Highly recommended!"
2392,976426,4.0,3.0,No Comments
2393,902702,4.0,3.0,"It was his first time teaching undergrad, and he did really well! He explained things very thoroughly and was always available if you needed help."
2394,902702,3.0,3.0,"Honestly, this class isn't as bad as many have written on here. Just show up, take down everything he writes on the board, and do the homework. For the midterm, just do all of the homework again and definitely do the practice midterm, since the real midterm is pretty much the same thing. As for the final, it's not hard, if you showed up for class."
2395,902702,4.0,2.0,"One of the best ECON professors! He introduces the topics very clearly and systematically. Very useful analytical skills covered in the materials.Students are free to interrupt and ask questions and he'll answer them promptly. Materials covered are totally manageable. Especially if you like BOTH math & econ,you'll be very comfortable in this class."
2396,902702,3.0,3.0,Not a hard class. Just make sure you go to all of the lectures and write down everything he writes down. If you know how to do the homeworks before the tests you will do fine.
2397,902702,1.0,5.0,"Believe what you read, he's the worst professor I've ever had. Can't understand him, his notes make no sense, his final is insanely difficult, and he prances around the room like a lunatic while he teaches. If you get stuck with him, go to class and copy down all the graphs, but read EVERYTHING relevant in the book if you want to survive."
2398,902702,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely miserable professor.  Not only does the class border on physically painful, but I came out of it having learned NOTHING about macro."
2399,902702,2.0,3.0,Worst Econ Professor.  Don't take this class.
2400,902702,1.5,5.0,"What everyone else has said is entirely true.  Lectures come word-for-word from the textbook, classes are extremely boring, and the second midterm was ridiculously hard.  But on the plus side, homeworks are graded on completion, and there must be a huge curve at the end because my final graded ended up being okay."
2401,902702,1.0,3.0,"My advice: buy the textbook, show up only on the days of the midterms and final, or, better yet, DON'T TAKE A CLASS W/ THIS PROF! His lectures are useless, the tests are fairly straight-forward but hard considering the dearth of teaching, and he is thoroughly unhelpful. Didn't bother showing up on the day of the final. He shouldn't be teaching."
2402,902702,1.0,3.0,"Awful Teacher. Can barely speak English and cannot pronounce the letter &quot;r.&quot; I ended up being my own teacher with the textbook. First test, easy, then the second one is hard. Going to class will give you a headache and alot of time to read the cav daily. Oh, and the discussion teachers are worthless too."
2403,902702,1.5,3.0,Without a doubt the worst econ class and professor i have taken while at this school.  He does nothing but give lectures right out of the book and still doesn't manage to teach it clearly.  Its also almost impossible to sit through an entire class without dying from boredom.  Avoid if possible.
2404,902702,3.0,2.0,"ludicrously easy first midterm, IMPOSSIBLE second one. class in super repetitive, less than half of the people attend, most do sudoku, barely anyone takes notes... i dont know of a single person who enjoys 302. the lectures are readings of the book, and the examples are straight from the book, class is &quot;textbook storytime&quot; terrible, just terrible."
2405,902702,5.0,1.0,"Possibly the nicest prof in the econ department. He tries very hard to make the concepts clear, which sometimes results in repetitiveness. Also, he spends a lot of the class reviewing 202 and 301 - the actual macro stuff doesn't start till after the first midterm. There's sporadic homework, graded on effort, and two midterms - nothing too intense."
2406,861757,2.5,3.0,"adams a cool guy. i hate his attendance policy though. after you miss 1 class, you get 1/3 of a letter grade deducted from final grade. i missed just 2 or 3 classes and my final grade was lowered from an A to a B+. Kind of unfair since i attended 95% of the courses. But anyway, adams a cool guy. Knows a lot about the material. Teaches objectively."
2407,861757,2.5,2.0,"Not the best class; interesting subject turned dull by the dreaded powerpoint. Not too hard to eventually get an A because you can keep redrafting papers to boost your grade. Doesn't teach you to write well. Very formulaic writing approach reminiscent of my first year of high school. Comments are often unclear, unhelpful, and often seem dead wrong."
2408,861757,5.0,3.0,"Class itself requires a bit of research to write a good paper, nothing overwhelming. Prof Trusner is friendly and always willing to help you with your papers/writing. I feel my writing has improved as a result of taking this class."
2409,861757,5.0,4.0,Very knowledgable about american legal history!
2410,861757,4.0,2.0,"Adam is a great guy and a truly excellent professor. There were some misunderstandings early on in the class, but he had no problem clarifying them and being available for assistance. Adam is understanding with essays, but is particular in grading. His class is very worthwhile and you definitely learn a lot about the ENWR writing style."
2411,861757,4.5,4.0,"He's a pretty good teacher--it's kind of weird that he's not much older, but he has so much experience already.  I highly recommend taking his course; you'll learn a ton about the war in Iraq and learn how to write properly."
2412,861757,2.0,1.0,"I have to come down on the side that this guy isn't that great.  He's really nice but he's just not that smart.  So if you want someone who is easy, then take him.  If you want someone who has some insight, then don't."
2413,861757,4.0,2.0,"Very interesting class, good professor that is willing to help. Follow the directions and use the little readings and the papers aren't bad at all.  I learned a lot."
2414,861757,1.5,4.0,I dont knw what the other folks are talking about.  The guy is a tool.  Where does the grad school get these people&#63;
2415,861757,4.0,2.0,His class is so fun that I never fall asleep! He is an easier grader and nice person. Definitely take him if you can!
2416,861757,4.5,2.0,"Awesome.  Genuinely nice guy with one of the most interesting backgrounds of anyone you'll find, professor or TA."
2417,1181251,5.0,3.0,"Entertaining professor who tries to keep the material engaging. Enjoyed both his personality and teaching. Textbook isn't actually required since lecture notes are posted beforehand. Decent amount of homework, but it makes for good practice for the exams."
2418,1181251,1.0,5.0,Teaches from Premade notes that are riddled with errors
2419,1181251,2.0,3.0,"He's not that good of a Professor. He makes mistakes in class, and does unnecessary derivatives. The questions he gives on the tests are harder than the easy examples he gives in class. He might know the material, but isn't that good at teaching"
2420,1181251,1.5,4.0,"Terrible teacher. He'll show a single, simple example that will take an entire class for one problem, then expect us to figure out how to do the complicated multi-step problems on the quizzes and tests in 5 mins. He has 2 office hours, makes frequent mistakes and is often unclear. Expect to spend lots of time in workshops/tutor sessions to pass."
2421,1181251,2.0,5.0,"Guadagni is a joke.  The worst math teacher I have ever had, and this guy supposedly has a PHD in math.  He does not even know the values of the unit circle. If you want to learn from a guy that relies on the textbook for his information go ahead and take him.  Oh and good luck asking him for extra help. He has 2 office hours a week."
2422,1181251,5.0,4.0,"Great guy, really funny, worth knowing. Makes math not so dry somehow. Midterms be hard."
2423,1181251,3.0,5.0,"Guadagni is like a textbook.  He explains the material in a clear and logical way, but he doesn't really help you learn it.  I feel like I taught myself most of the course material . . ."
2424,1181251,1.0,5.0,"Also took and dropped APMA 2130 with Guadagni. He really understands calculus, he just has no idea how to explain it or help students learn it. Often makes huge mistakes while working problems."
2425,1181251,4.5,3.0,"He is a machine at math.  I enjoyed not having to attend class.  It was difficult material and I prefer to use my book, but I think if I had attended class more often then I would have had no trouble.  I learned the material."
2426,1181251,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Guadagni is pretty much the man.  His class is challenging because the material itself is hard, but he knows his stuff and works hard to express it clearly.  He is extremely helpful if you take the initiative to go to office hours and ask questions in class."
2427,1181251,1.5,5.0,He knows what he is talking about but is miserable at demonstrating it to the students. His example problems are very difficult and he skips steps and does not properly explain himself
2428,1181251,3.0,4.0,"You have to get used to his way of teaching...However, hee is not that helpful. If you want to get a good grade, you better study and go to TA hours, because if you only go to class, you will probably fail."
2429,1181251,2.0,5.0,"He knows what he's talking about, but doesn't teach very well at all. (He doesn't even know the quotient rule, though, haha). Skips lots of steps when he's showing examples, and won't explain half of what he's doing unless you ask him explicitly. Only good for introducing the material. Go to TA help sessions if you want to understand the material."
2430,1181251,2.0,3.0,"I dont like him. He once spent the entire class working a problem, and eventually got it wrong, and then ended class with out finishing it. He then said that the same problem on a test should take us 15 min. He doesent even know the subjet he is teaching."
2431,1181251,3.0,3.0,"Guadagni is a good professor. It takes time to get used to his method of teaching, but all that is required is a bit of patience. Anyone interested in calculus should be able to do well in his class."
2432,1181251,4.0,4.0,No Comments
2433,1181251,2.5,4.0,Bad.
2434,2172486,5.0,3.0,"I think that every student should take this course, or an equivalent in English. Professor Rajaonarisoa's style of teaching and the organization of the class was excellent and also very helpful in getting the most out of the material and the topics of each day. French for International Relations with Professor Rajaonarisoa is an amazing class!"
2435,2172486,5.0,4.0,"The class itself is quite difficult, but Mme Lova is great! Probably my favourite language teacher ever. She's obviously well prepared for every class with a variety of structured activities for students to learn from and participate in. She's also really nice and can have a laugh with her students if something is funny. Highly recommend."
2436,2172486,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors I've had. Pay attention- she's very funny. If you enjoy really great discussion of a variety of topics Lova is perfect for you. Bonne Chance!
2437,1582671,4.5,2.0,"Katell is hands down the best French teacher I've had here so far (of the two). She is clear, speaks slowly enough for you to understand, funny, and extremely approachable. There is a lot of new grammar and vocabulary in 1020 but it's not half bad with Katell. Also, she made French cake, so bonus."
2438,1582671,3.5,3.0,"Great class & super approachable teacher. Course material can be challenging, especially with different tenses. Regardless, it was worthwhile and Katell Bourhis made it fun and engaging."
2439,2074191,5.0,3.0,love her
2440,2074191,2.0,2.0,"Professor is horrible. Her powerpoints come directly from the textbook & she reads straight from the powerpoint. Her test questions are poorly worded. I never went to a single lecture but read chapter summaries & still got a B. If you've taken psych before, it's an easy A, but definitely not worth the money if you actually like psych."
2441,902737,5.0,1.0,"Take hime! Andy is a fun and really approachable professor. He is a very intelligent guy, who always gives very good observations and ideas on society from many different points."
2442,902737,5.0,3.0,"Andy is fantastic. Incredibly knowledgeable, one of the best teachers I've had in the discipline. We are so lucky he was teaching 301. He is also extremely approachable."
2443,902737,5.0,2.0,Andy is great!  He's sooo nice and really good at clarifying topics in class.  He also brings food if his cell phone goes off in class. :)
2444,902742,2.0,3.0,"The class is fine but the way some liberal arts teachers grade papers is just bizarre to me, they give you no rubric or any real advice on what they're looking for and then give you just one shot to do well on something that makes up a large part of your grade. The material was interesting, but not to an incredible degree. "
2445,902742,2.0,3.0,This teacher does not care for your input unless it reinforces her point . She has no interest in discussing an opinion in class which is not completely in line with hers. Will shut you down immediately if you start expressing your opinion. Class is not difficult and material is interesting. A shame she skews everything sometimes non factually.
2446,902742,1.0,4.0,She ruined my fourth year in college.She is extremely opinionated. Easy in sense that you just have to think and express the way she wants you to. Freedom of Speech is tolerated with severe grade deduction. I truly regret taking this course.
2447,902742,1.5,3.0,I?m sorry but there seems to be a major conflict of interest with this woman teaching in an English department.  She has outspoken contempt for English majors and English as an academic discipline and would be far better suited to another department.
2448,902742,1.0,1.0,"The class was really easy, as long as you regurgitated her ideas and concepts on the papers and final exam. She assigns a lot of reading that is essentially useless to the class. I was extremely interested in the course material but found her intolerable and mean as a professor, especially during office hours. Overall, not worth it."
2449,902742,2.0,4.0,This is the worst professor I have ever had in my UVA experience. She is a favoritist and completely shuts student opinions down in class. She does make clear her expectations and requirements at all and then docks points without explanation.  I was extremely interested in the course material but it was ruined by a bad teacher.
2450,902742,4.0,5.0,"Professor Chong challenges her students, she wants you to think deeply and have complex arguments rather than just getting by. She does give a lot of reading and has high expectations for her students. She can be intimidating but she has a sense of humor and appreciates different opinions. Recommended if you want a challenge."
2451,902742,5.0,3.0,"She is a very intuitive and intelligent professor. The class teaches you how to think and analyze literary and visual works critically. She may appear intimidating, but she is very nice. Just make sure you think through your ideas comprehensively and avoid making assumptions. Even if she corrects you, take it as a learning experience."
2452,902742,1.5,4.0,"Highly critical of papers, but also highly vague when you try to clarify what exactly she's looking for. Not a good combination."
2453,902742,1.5,5.0,"Mandatory boring field trips where trans and accom. had to be arranged by students! she made me feel uncomfortable in class with personal questions, and was really mean when it came to discussing papers. she only left room for you to agree with her answers, not make your own. i hated this class. she thought she was cool and &quot;on our level&quot;, but not."
2454,902742,4.0,3.0,"Her classes are so interesting. The way she opens up a topic and then exposes every single nitty-gritty detail about what those little things could mean and stand for is just so mind boggling. I enjoyed learning how to analyze movies & texts, but the class can be very difficult. (weekly film responses, 2 papers, 1 final)"
2455,902742,5.0,3.0,"Flipping through the COD for an interesting, relevant, thought-provoking course, this class is what you're looking for. Chong leaves questions unanswered and indefinite but gives you the tools to answer them yourself. Afterwards, you can call yourself a pro at analyzing film and other visual text. The readings are enjoyable, lectures engaging."
2456,902742,5.0,4.0,Sylvia was a great teacher! Definetly take her ENMC355/AMST201 class. She's very smart and knows so much about Asian American Cultural History. She's also very willing to take time to help you with any paper topics. Highly recommended. :-)
2457,902742,1.0,5.0,Potentially great class ruined by bad teacher.
2458,902742,1.0,5.0,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! I love American Studies but could not stand the class. It was not about mainstream American Studies--it was about the obscure topics she wanted to push. Had no idea what she wanted on the essays--penalized students who weren't as weird as her. Sometimes there isn't a &quot;deeper meaning&quot;--things are just what they are.
2459,902742,5.0,4.0,"Sylvia is relatively young and passionate about what she is teaching.  She always pushes you to think past what you're used to, and is willing to make a fool out of herself to do so.  She is incredibly willing to help if you need clarification, though personality-wise can be a bit blunt. She is a smart, smart woman, but don't let it intimidate you."
2460,2074199,5.0,1.0,She is the best teacher!. I highly recommend any of her classes. She is very helpful and easy grader.
2461,2074199,5.0,2.0,"Janet is an amazing woman. She truly cares about her students. This 1credit class was the best part of my 1st semester at UVA. Very minimal homework, but the discussions were always about thought-provoking world issues. She connected me with numerous people on grounds. Highly recommend for anyone interested in foreign affairs, human rights, etc."
2462,1877592,1.5,4.0,Human epitome of a computer. Very challenging for an intro to programming class.  Careful taking this class without previous coding experience. Homework is weighted the same as exams and is graded strictly. 
2463,1877592,1.0,5.0,"Not a good teacher, especially for an intro to Python coding class where no prior experience is expected. In a class for people with no coding experience, she taught as if everyone knew basic code, but we didn't. Her responses to questions were harsh, and she basically called people stupid if they couldn't figure it out. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES."
2464,1689183,5.0,1.0,"Extremely sweet guy, would highly recommend taking if you wanna boost your GPA. Assignments are easy but keep you busy the entire class, (attend class) your grade comes from participating in the group projects of making 'places' and what the final product looks like. No need to study for final, just go in and be detailed on describing the projects"
2465,1427042,1.0,3.0,"He s probably the worst professor in the systems curriculum. He teaches you nothing, reads directly off powerpoint slides, then expects you to know how to do things he hasn't taught you. He thinks we're all worthless and don't try, but he doesn't teach so he's the worst. If you want to learn in this class, you'll have to teach yourself."
2466,2467439,5.0,4.0,"Professor Yagi was great, but the lectures were pretty slow/more focussed on derivations than on what was asked during midterms/final. The final/midterms were to a large part multiple choice questions, which made them very tricky, and there was a lot of weekly homework. But he is always open for questions during class and office hours."
2467,1664641,2.5,3.0,"The reading is a lot but not necessarily required. NO TESTS! 4 3-page papers, a fun debate that really reinforces the topics discussed in class and a take home final. The professor is quite monotone for a 3 hour class but it was cool cause I always got my language homework done ;)"
2468,968327,4.5,1.0,Roque is the best and makes it easy to learn.  He
2469,968327,4.5,2.0,Great professor who is very approachable and loves what he teaches!
2470,968327,4.5,2.0,Cute accent! Really knows his stuff. I enjoyed it because you are able to think for yourself. Gives out study guides before only 3 exams. Very easy if you do the article readings. Extremely approachable outside of class.
2471,968327,5.0,4.0,One of the most supportive and helpful professors at Uva. He is also very engaging in his lectures. He takes time to make sure that students are following his teachings as well. I'd recommend taking a class with him.
2472,968327,4.0,2.0,Roque's lectures may not always be the most interesting but he is really supportive of his students and open to hearing their feedback and suggestions regarding how class goes.  Fairly easy grader and very laid-back.  I would definitely recommend him!
2473,968327,5.0,2.0,Awesome lecturer! Explains everything thoroughly and makes sure students are clear on everything before the exams. Very friendly and extremely knowledgeable.
2474,624270,2.0,3.0,"I have taken Spanish courses before, and I can attest this was the worst experience I have had in a Spanish course. I feel she was trying to cover her own insecurities as a professor by being unnecessarily tough and unapproachable, believing her own hype. I usually enjoy studying hard and learning Spanish, but she makes it a painful experience."
2475,624270,1.0,5.0,"She is not willing to do anything to help students. She knows the Spanish department is popular and pretty much flaunts it in your face and when you ask her for help, the best she will offer is, I'm sorry I can't do anything when she can as department chair. A good professor should care for students and do all they can to help."
2476,624270,4.0,2.0,"Emily is really sweet and passionate about teaching linguistics! The material isn't exactly fun - it's pretty hard, with a ton of memorization - but I thought it was very interesting and learned a lot about the background, development and sounds of Spanish. A few pop quizzes but the exams are pretty clear. No surprises there. Very cute!"
2477,624270,3.0,5.0,"To be honest, she was just mean. I bet shes nice when not on the job, but this class overall was just a waste of time and a pain. I would rather eat leeches."
2478,624270,2.5,5.0,"Only take this class if it is an absolute requirement for you to graduate; it's usually not. Emily is very knowledgeable but extremely boring, the class is too hard for no reason, she makes the already boring material more boring, we go through a lot of material very quickly and learn nothing in the end. Avoid this class at all costs!"
2479,624270,5.0,3.0,"While Practi****is not necessarily the world's most exciting class, it would be 20 times worse without Prof. Scida.  She's wonderful to work with and really cares about all of us in her class."
2480,624270,5.0,3.0,"Emily is extremely willing to help us improve as teachers, and she really takes an interest in our careers and wants us to succeed. Ok, so the readings and work aren't the most interesting things in the world to us. It's not her fault!"
2481,624270,4.5,4.0,"She's really good at what she does.I would strongly recommend her, even though this is one of the hardest spanish classes I've taken, its very interesting."
2482,624270,5.0,3.0,"She is a great professor.  Really good to work with, willing to talk with you if anything is wrong.  She can tell when you are bsing so those who don't like her is probably because they didn't put an effort into the class..."
2483,624270,4.5,3.0,"As much as everyone likes to attack Scida on her teaching abilities, no one stopped to think that maybe its the course.  She does what she can with this course because, really, how can you teach teaching&#63;  She is fair and does not deserve to be crucified to such a rude and obnoxious degree."
2484,624270,5.0,4.0,"In my experience in talking to friends studying languages at other institutions, the mandatory pedagogy class is universally reviled and hated, along with the professor (who is usually in charge of coordinating language classes at the lower levels).  Emily is a nice person and a great teacher - very clear and helpful - once you get past her venee"
2485,624270,2.5,2.0,"Let's face it: Emily should have absolutely NOTHING to do with future generations of teachers...she's spiteful and vindictive, in addition to playing favorites inside and outside the class. Some of her liberal, feel-good methodological claims are nonsense and she has no clue how to substantiate them when pressed. AVOID EMILY!"
2486,624270,1.0,5.0,You would be better served to punch out your teeth and chew foil with your bleeding gums than to spend a minute in her class.  She has managed to subject innocents to an intellectual failure of biblical proportions.
2487,624270,1.0,3.0,"This class is horrible!! Do anything you can to get out of it.  It´s a big phat waste of time, nothing but busy work, not helpful at all."
2488,624270,1.0,5.0,No Comments
2489,2573967,1.0,3.0,unbelievably boring. would never recommend this class to anyone. she sucks. just reads off slides. tests are hard too. 
2490,2573967,4.0,3.0,"Definitely not an easy A. There are few tests, and they are extremely difficult. However, she does curve so that the class average is an 85, which is super generous. Lectures aren't recorded, and tests are mostly based on powerpoints, so definitely go in person! One on one, she's very kind and knowledgeable. "
2491,2573967,3.0,5.0,"Horn is a very nice lady, but the class is hard. Your entire grade is 3 exams + the final and the exams are extremely detailed. Questions are on the smallest, seemingly unimportant facts/topics from class. She also offers 6 extra credit papers, and if you pass them all your grade is boosted. The ECs are VERY difficult and have unclear expectations."
2492,2573967,4.0,4.0,"This class is famously difficult, but if you love psychology or just mental health in general, you might just be okay. This class is what a lot of people think psychology is all about, and while that's not entirely true, the material is very important and I recommend all PSYC majors take it. Credit to Prof. Horn though, because she made it work."
2493,2573967,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Horns tests are primarily based on her powerpoint slides and not so much the textbook. Her tests were pretty hard and timing was tricky, but she curved pretty well which is always nice. I highly recommend doing the extra credit assignment! It might seem like a lot of work, which it is, but it can really save your grade since it bumps it up."
2494,2573967,4.0,4.0,"I loved the course and Dr. Horn is a very intelligent person. Her tests are a little tricky but she curves them (in everyone's favor) and so they end up being fair. She provides all you need to know to do well on exams, but her lectures can sometimes be monotonous. There is extra cred, its tough to get but definitely worth it."
2495,2573967,4.0,4.0,"Dr Horn is a decent lecturer, albeit somewhat boring/monotonous. Her lectures are extremely dense with information, and you can tell she's slightly anxious while giving lectures. Her exams are very tricky, with at least 5/6 questions each exam being ambiguous and poorly asked. She is very nice and helpful outside of class."
2496,2508432,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Carter is a fair, fun, and kind professor. The class is only &quot;hard&quot; in the sense that you have to do consistent work, but if you do, you should get a good grade--no grading surprises. Very passionate and knowledgeable about music, and fun to talk to about it! I took this class as a non-music major and found it to be very valuable."
2497,2508433,5.0,2.0,Holy moly. Such an excellent class. Prof. Marcom fosters an incredible environment for students to grow as writers.
2498,312979,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Hollier's class was one of the most useful courses that I took at UVA over ten years ago (Thinking About Thinking).  I'm now a VP at a large Fortune 500 company, and I still apply many of the topics we covered in class to my daily business world.  Dr. Hollier was fair, great at leading interesting, thought provoking lectures, and knowledgeable."
2499,312979,5.0,4.0,Best class ever!
2500,312979,5.0,5.0,"I had him for two courses and I thought he was brilliant, hard and fair.  His lectures went way beyond the reading and really got deep into some really cool stuff."
2501,312979,1.0,3.0,Hollier leads dense lectures that are completely pointless. Tests are ambiguous and receiving grades above the average is difficult. One of the books assigned is very hard to read. ruined my interest in psyc
2502,312979,4.0,2.0,Very straight-forward; easy A/B if you do decently on tests and case studies. Lectures are 40% of test material & interesting. Down side: you don't see what you got wrong on tests and questions reappear on final. Optional review section is pointless.
2503,312979,2.0,5.0,I would NOT recommend this class! I think you can find something better do do with your time....
2504,312979,1.5,3.0,Do NOT take this class.  You can invest your time better elsewhere.
2505,312979,2.0,3.0,"this class was particularly boring, you basically teach yourself with reference to the book.  The lectures are not interesting and not many people show up because of it.  I didn't enjoy the class other than the material I learned myself."
2506,2655894,1.0,4.0,"He's the worst Professor at UVA CS department. This course is very disorganized. Some chapters there is no textbook or lecture recordings. You have to spend much time on it and try to figure them out on your own. When you ask him questions, he can be mad at you. Sometimes you cannot find him in office hour. "
2507,2655894,1.0,4.0,He is very rude to students. He sometimes yells at you when you ask him questions. 
2508,2655894,1.0,4.0,I have to say that  he is very professional but he does not how to respect students. 
2509,2655894,1.0,5.0,"He is a bad instructor. I don't know why the university hire him. He is so cocky and picky about every student. Not a great professor. Although my professor is co-teaching with him, he still dominates the majority of the content. I do not like him at all. Do not take McBurney's class. Not helpful to your CS career."
2510,2655894,1.0,3.0,"He is an arrogant professor. He is very strict on if &amp; when he wants to help you. A lot of the time he just expects you to know things. He makes you feel small for not getting something immediately. The only redeeming factor is that he sometimes gives a heads up for what will show up on exams. The class isn't super hard, but just tedious sometimes"
2511,951963,5.0,3.0,"I took four Arabic classes with ustetha Omima and I can honestly say that she is brilliant, helpful, encouraging and very interesting. I highly recommend this Professor! It will make your Arabic studies engaging, fun and not stressful at all!"
2512,951963,4.5,3.0,"Nice and helpful professor, not too much work but you learn a lot."
2513,951963,4.0,2.0,"Awesome instructor- kind and easy grader.  homework every night, but helpful.  take her class!!!"
2514,951963,4.0,4.0,I heart Omima!
2515,951963,4.0,4.0,No Comments
2516,951963,4.5,3.0,"Omima is super nice and helpful--even for Sawaie lovers, Omima is most often the good cop, which is a plus for discussion."
2517,951963,5.0,1.0,"Prof Omima is really friendly, i think this is her first year as a professor, but she's very good, im taking her class right now, its not too bad, but she assigns hw every class though, she's egyptian, which is a plus (theyre the best!)"
2518,2000541,5.0,3.0,Amazing class taught by an even more amazing professor. 10/10 would recommend. Work's not horrible -- gets rid of second writing in an interesting and fun way. 
2519,2246307,5.0,2.0,"An incredibly down-to-earth professor. Not full-time (works for the Gov) so it's hard to find info on her, but she's very intelligent, humorous, and charming. Amazingly detailed powerpoints! All resources provided for you. Three five-page papers on a self-selected country, a collective group presentation, and a short essay-based take-home final."
2520,2500264,3.0,3.0,Ok
2521,2500264,3.0,5.0,The group work was completely hard
2522,2500264,4.0,2.0,Cool topic but too much technology
2523,2500264,5.0,4.0,Interesting topics
2524,2500264,5.0,3.0,Habib Al Souleiman was a good lecturer
2525,50857,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, very knowledgeable, passionate about subject matter. Just put effort into this course and you'll be fine."
2526,50857,5.0,1.0,"Taken during covid, where tests were open note. Super easy, but tbh wouldn't have been hard even if closed note. Lots of other chances for points too--only 50% of your grade was exams, others included participation stuff, quizzes on chapter readings (easiest textbook ever), &amp; a short easy blog post. Prof is super nice and passionate. No final."
2527,50857,5.0,3.0,"I loved Prof Lawrence. To do well, make sure to read the textbook before tests, you have to stay on top of lectures (they are pre recorded) you have a 30 minute discussion during one of the class times, there are three exams and a project. You have a bunch of opportunities to do well. I think this was the best online course Ive taken."
2528,50857,2.0,3.0,Brutal lectures but attendance is enforced with Learning Catalytics questions. Tests are heavy on arbitrary details. Not nearly as interesting of a course as it appears. Definitely avoid.
2529,50857,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lawrence is absolutely amazing. You can tell that she actually cares about the lectures she gives. The class super informative about climate change, and I've learned a lot. You get graded for participation in class by answering questions on Learning Catalytics. There are 4 exams (final isn't cumulative) and a blog post. Not much homework."
2530,50857,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lawrence is a really engaging lecturer that made Climate, You &amp; CO2 an awesome class! You do have to show up to answer learning catalytics questions and read the textbook, but if you do both of those it's almost impossible not to get an A."
2531,50857,3.0,2.0,"easy A/B+! yes you need to go to class, but the tests are generally fair and theres no final for EVSC 1450. She's super enthusiastic about climate change and i liked listening to her. she assigns a lot of homework, but its just busy work like short easy quizzes and forum posts to get you participation points. definitely recommend. dont buy the book"
2532,50857,5.0,2.0,"By far my favorite professor at UVA. She is ALWAYS available and quick to email back. Obviously wants to work with students and learn from them, too. If you like environmental science, she would be a great advisor!"
2533,50857,2.0,3.0,"The class appears to be easy, and the subject matter is not difficult, but the tests are tested on insignificant details. The lectures tend to be boring, but the guest lecturers are usually great. The curve is AMAZING!"
2534,50857,5.0,2.0,"Easy. Professor is the BEST professor I have had here. She is very easy to understand and very kind. She truly loves the subject, and makes class interesting. She is always willing to help you. As long as you come to class and take notes during the lectures you will get a good grade. book helps solidify your understanding but isn't necessary"
2535,50857,3.5,3.0,She's a really nice person and is always there during office hours. You have to go to class to get notes she doesn't put on the powerpoints. Lectures are structured and tests are long but straightforward. I'd recommend this class.
2536,50857,3.0,4.0,"How do I begin to explain the terribleness of this class&#63;  She made you come to lecutre by including stuff on the test that wasn't in the book.  Sleeping, however was the only option in lecture. The tests were SO hard witnessed by the 65-70 averages.  Scoring above the average is impossible if you are not hardcore about the material.  stay away!"
2537,50857,1.5,4.0,"This class looked like it could've been a fun and interesting class, but I was definitely wrong.  This teacher is horrible, and her lectures have nothing to do with the tests.  Please save yourself the time and energy of taking this class.  I wish I would've known about her before I signed up!"
2538,50857,1.5,5.0,"AVOID THIS CLASS!!! Terrible teacher, she is better at confusing herself than teaching you. Tests are ridiculous"
2539,50857,4.0,4.0,"Deborah is a difficult grader, but makes it up by curving.  She is much better in a small class setting rather than the larger ecology lecture.  If you're interested in ecology, her work is interesting and she'll go out of her way to help you.  If you are not really interested in ecology, I would recommend Smith for 320."
2540,50857,3.0,5.0,"Deborah is nice and helps answer questions in office hours- COOL!  However, her tests were incredibly long and difficult.  She is confused herself when teaching which confuses you.  I studied my butt off, went to office hours & someone who never came to class got the same grade mysteriously."
2541,50857,4.0,4.0,"Didn't really like her teaching style, but she was always around if you needed help."
2542,50857,2.5,5.0,Read the other frown face comments. I hate to be repetitive. The comments on the difficulty of tests and the amount of reading are quite true.
2543,50857,1.0,5.0,This is the worst teacher I have had yet.  Is pregnant yet cancels class for several days due to having baby.  Tests are bs and material is unexpectedly pointless.  Prepare yourself for some horrible lectures.
2544,50857,3.0,4.0,"nice teacher, but definitely a lot of reading and the midterms cover a lot of material. if youre not an ecology/science person, definitely NOT recommended because its pretty hard to do well on the midterms"
2545,50857,1.0,5.0,"Whoa, this class is horrible,boring,hard,unfair AND confusing grading,etc.I expected to learn about conservation tactics,movements,public policy,rather I learned about dirt and the carbon cycle.I studied so much too,but all/non of the above questio suck."
2546,50857,1.5,5.0,"Boring and its the worst class I have ever taken in 3 years at UVa. Tests are inherently unfair in nature, and test what you dont know, rather than what you do know. There is a reason AP tests no longer use all of the above questions. this class=pain."
2547,50857,2.0,4.0,"this is not an easy class...contrary to popular belief, ecology is not a gut class.  the test are outrageous and they are not what is covered in class...and all the questions are in the form of &quot;all of the above, none of the above...&quot;)avoid this"
2548,50857,1.5,4.0,Very boring and uninspiring.
2549,50857,3.5,2.0,"Was easy, but not a gut."
2550,50857,1.0,5.0,No Comments
2551,1967795,5.0,2.0,"White is a really nice professor and really cares about her students. It's not her fault the class is terrible, it's the way UVA requires language courses to be run. She makes the best out of their system though, the class is easy."
2552,1967795,5.0,3.0,"Prof. White is excellent in SPAN 2010! The course is much more discussion-based than 1060, but she made sure to review difficult concepts in lecture. Also, she was very helpful with composition and project corrections. The biggest downfall in 2010 is the level of work enforced by the department, but White did everything she could to help us succeed"
2553,1967795,4.0,3.0,"There is a good amount  of work, but she's really nice and willing to help. "
2554,1967795,3.5,3.0,"Mrs. White is a nice teacher. The online homework in accelerated Spanish is excessive though. The Syllabus says about 8 hours a week for online homework. The tests are ok and there is a video project and a cultural paper. She talks as fast as native speakers that I know, but you get used to it. Would take again if it wasn't accelerated."
2555,1967795,3.0,3.0,"I loved Senorita White. She was a really great instructor. She does talk really fast, so it's kind of difficult when taking notes. If you don't understand something, tell her!!! She will help you until you get it. The homework on Connect can be long & difficult. So don't put it off. ALWAYS have your book because you WILL use it every class!!!"
2556,763574,4.5,3.0,"Each time I turned in a short story to Karen, it came back plump with commentary.  She is a professor who cares enough to spend time in and outside of class truly being involved.  She is spunky, adorable, hilarious, and the most helpful writing instructor I've ever had the pleasure to work with. (Note: for English 134 at UCLA)"
2557,763574,2.0,4.0,"Very airy-fairy, unclear, intimidating, slow and boring."
2558,763574,1.0,3.0,"Do not take a writing class with Karen Kevorkian. It's always unclear what she wants out of her assignments and she does not provide constructive criticism. She definitely does not create a good workshop environment, and the other creative writing professors are far better than she is."
2559,763574,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2560,763574,5.0,2.0,"This was a poetry writing class that required a lot of creativity and needs enough time to be devoted to it but not enormous amounts. There's a lot of creative freedom. Prof Kevorkian was very helpful, pushes you to improve ure work as much as possible over the semester and is very clear about ure strong and weak points."
2561,329403,1.5,5.0,sucks. terribly hard. will screw up your GPA.
2562,329403,2.0,5.0,"I had never taken a foreign policy class and can honestly say that after this I hope I never have to. Very boring, its a class I dreaded going to. Prof. Stagg never looks at his class nor does he offer any assistance, Avoid the class if possible if not seek out the TA! He's going to be grading everything and he knows how the prof. thinks!"
2563,329403,1.5,4.0,I guess Prof. Stagg knows what he's talking about...but he's so hard to understand it's anyone's guess.  And don't bother asking for help with the essay or even asking about the exam material. You'll get nothing out of this guy.
2564,329403,1.0,5.0,"Professor Stagg is the worst professor I've ever had. I really mean that. His lectures are incomprehensible (he mumbles). The tests are ridiculous, some of the IDs I had never heard of. Midterm is 25%, 8 page paper with ridiculous prompt is 25% and final is 50%. AVOID THIS CLASS. IT IS TERRIBLE."
2565,329403,5.0,3.0,Knows his stuff like I've never seen in my life.  Very good lecturer and leanient.
2566,329403,2.5,4.0,"Knows much about his field, but seems to consider the ceiling a more receptive audience than his class. There is, actually, a pattern in his line of vision as he lectures: right corner of ceiling to left corner to podium."
2567,2672325,3.0,3.0,"he is kind of shy and he makes alot of mistakes. I don't think he prepares before he lectures, but he is very knowledgable in the content"
2568,992969,1.0,5.0,Honestly she is such a loser. I wonder if her family is the same way because that would be a damn shame and I fear for them. I am a liberal but Im ready to support Trump after meeting her. The way she treats people and WOMEN is condesending and disrespectful. 
2569,992969,2.0,4.0,"Professor Pugh seems to love her sociology, but her setup of the course was questionable. The required readings consisted of her own book as well as her friends' books from graduate school. Had daily iClicker questions and flies through her powerpoint slides. She assigned 5 papers on the weekly (long) readings, a 6-page essay, and an 8-page essay."
2570,992969,3.0,4.0,Be prepared to read full books and participate a lot.  Her grading is tough and the assignments can be kind of confusing.
2571,992969,1.5,3.0,This course has been changed extremely from how Pugh used to teach it in the past. There are 19 i-clicker quizzes given in lecture so there is basically a quiz 75% of the time. You actually have to do the reading and read it well to get a decent grade on the quizzes and frequently i would read thoroughly and do poorly. 
2572,992969,5.0,3.0,"She is very interactive during lectures, and likes to check what you're doing on your computer, but she really just wants people to participate and doesn't mind a different opinion if you can back it up"
2573,992969,2.5,3.0,"She's a pretty average professor. She wasn't always clear and changed the syllabus at times, but it's challenging to teach on Semester at Sea. Her quizzes can be challenging, but if you do the readings, you'll be okay."
2574,992969,5.0,3.0,"Pugh really cared about her students, loved this class and would recommend"
2575,992969,4.0,3.0,"Opens her lectures w/ lots of (unnecessary) statistics, but she makes sure to pinpoint the main ideas/arguments of the EXTENSIVE readings. Uses clickers to monitor attendance. Gives exam ?s prior to exam where you can use notes and Internet to prepare. Great readings.  Take-home final that's pretty fair--you can use your notes, too! Skim read"
2576,992969,1.0,2.0,"Pugh is so unengaging. The material isn't hard, but she makes things unnecessarily complicated, and often contradicts herself.  The course itself was interesting, just wish I hadn't had to do it with her."
2577,992969,4.0,2.0,Prof Pugh is not boring but also not that engaging. Her lectures often reiterate what you have already read. There is a lot of reading and many assignments but it's honestly a very easy class! I thought the topic was interesting too.
2578,992969,2.5,3.0,"If you want an easyish A, don't take. If you need to take this class, take it when Will Cox teaches it. He's more interesting. Lectures = boring, says everyone. Unless you LOVE Soc."
2579,992969,4.5,3.0,Wonderful. Opinionated but as long as you are capable of supporting your argument she's open to it.
2580,992969,3.5,2.0,loved this class!
2581,992969,3.5,2.0,"Not the hardest, not the easiest, not the most interesting, not the most boring.  Take the class if you like SOC"
2582,992969,1.5,2.0,"Pugh was an incredibly boring lecturer. No one paid attention in class, and she was extremely defensive if anyone brought up criticism of her. I found her rude and slightly offensive. I despised the class and would STRONGLY recommend taking any class BUT this one."
2583,992969,3.5,1.0,Pugh is a great lecturer. Easy class. The midterm is a group project then there is a 7-10 page paper and then a take-home open-book final.
2584,992969,1.0,3.0,"Never ever ever take this class! It's awful; I have never hated a class so much. Pugh is repetitive, boring, and rude. The TAs were absolutely useless, and the group project and huge paper were nightmares. NEVER take this class."
2585,992969,4.0,3.0,"LOVED this class! Professor Pugh is animated and makes lectures interesting. She also tries to involve her students by asking questions, etc. I recommend this class"
2586,992969,2.0,3.0,"Professor Pugh was one of the best I've had at UVA. She's really passionate about the subject and tries hard to make lectures enjoyable and tailored to the taste of students. She included lots of videos from youtube, interesting websites, and other sources that made class interesting. She was enthusiastic and very clear! Made me a sociology major."
2587,992969,2.5,4.0,"I would not recommend taking this class from Professor Pugh. She passed a lot of judgement, and was offensive on many topics. My TA was good, but Pugh was unengaging and boring in lecture and managed to be insulting a lot of the time."
2588,992969,5.0,3.0,"If you like Sociology this is one of the best classes. A lot of reading, but getting a good great is not hard at all."
2589,992969,2.0,3.0,AWFUL class.  There was far too much reading and it was very repetetive.  Her lectures and the material were unfocused and she was defensive when it came to criticism of the class.  This class was disappointing considering how interesting the material is.
2590,992969,3.5,3.0,This was a bad class. I thought it would be easy and fun but the lectures were extremely boring-hardly anyone showed up to class. There was a lot of reading and we would read entire books and not even dicuss them in lecture or sections. The papers weren't too bad but the final was ridiculous.
2591,460501,5.0,2.0,Amazing and Caring!
2592,460501,5.0,4.0,Although the grade you receive in this class depends mainly on your TA but professor Halverson-Taylor is a very impressive lecturer. Every time class ended I feel I took a lot away and feel more knowledgeable about the old testament/hebrew bible. I would recommend taking this class.
2593,460501,4.5,5.0,"This class is way harder than people made it sound. Your grade depends entirely on your TA. They are nice, but hard graders. Despite being a 1000 level, this is my lowest grade amongst my other 3000 level classes. It's interesting, but too unrewarding to enjoy or recommend. Overall, I'm disappointed."
2594,460501,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely loved this class. There is a lot of reading and graded assignments due frequently in addition to a midterm and final, but I genuinely enjoyed the work. Her lectures are interesting, clear and easily understandable. There is a study guide for the midterm and the final. This class is a lot of work, but it so rewarding."
2595,460501,5.0,4.0,"Very interesting class! A lot of reading, but definitely worth it! Her lectures always leave you wondering more about the topic."
2596,460501,4.5,3.0,"Very clear and passionate. Lecture is huge, but she tries to make it as interactive and interesting as possible. Her sense of humor and provocative questions make the Old Testament fresh. She and the TAs make this class fascinating, and the short papers are good yet painless practice; take it! P.S. It fulfills non-Western and history requirements!"
2597,460501,5.0,3.0,I absolutely loved this class and this professor. She was amazing! She made lectures so enjoyable that I hated the one time I had to miss one because I was sick. I look forward to this class every week. I'm not very religious but this class was my favorite so far here at UVA. She is also my favorite professor. She is so passionate!
2598,460501,5.0,3.0,I absolutely loved this class. I only missed one lecture because I was sick. This is one of those classes that you look forward to going to. She wants everyone to do well in this class and she is very passionate about it. I'm not very religious and I found this to be an amazing and interesting class. She is the best teacher I've had so far.
2599,460501,4.5,2.0,Great professor! Absolutely loved her. I spoke up one time in lecture and she remembered my name all year. Presents the material very clearly and in an interesting manner. DEFINITELY recommend this class!
2600,460501,4.5,4.0,"The class is very difficult, but she knows her stuff. I always enjoyed going to class because she's very helpful and encouraging and also an interesting lecture. Highly recommended!"
2601,460501,4.5,4.0,lectures were boring but extremely helpful. go to office hours. LOTS of work and reading. when you do the bible readings ALWAYS summarize all of them in a notebook.. it reduces study time by HOURS before exams.
2602,460501,4.0,4.0,Expect a lot of writing in this course; it meets the standards for a 2nd Writing Requirement.  I really liked Halvosen-Taylor because I could easily follow her lectures.  Readings are not always necessary
2603,460501,4.0,4.0,"Halvorson-Taylor is truly brilliant, and because of this she is very intimidating. However, take this class if you can, its hard, but it was wonderful."
2604,460501,2.5,5.0,"I was genuinely interested in the subject matter when I signed up for this class. The lectures were very interesting to me. But the tests and papers, which make up the grade, were useless and brought my grade down. We were tested on things that were really not big issues, and the papers were supposed to help our grade but they were graded on style."
2605,460501,1.0,5.0,"Don't take anything with her.  Everyone in my class seemed to do poorly on papers (I base this on the fact that she kept telling us not to worry about paper grades and that it's not the only part of our grade).   Yea, well, it's enough of it.  She thinks she's helping us write better, when she's really just bringing our GPAs down."
2606,460501,2.5,5.0,I withdrew from her class because my grades on the papers were all awful and I didn't want to bring my GPA down.  Tests do a better job estimating if you studied than if you actually learned anything.  She stresses important things in class and then tests the obscure useless stuff.  AVOID HER.
2607,460501,4.0,5.0,"A good prof, I enjoyed lecture, but because of the discussion and papers I would never recommend anyone take class with her. If you get good grades on the paper you probably are God and don't need to take this class. They aren't graded on content, they're graded on whether you have a clear thesis which is ridiculous since this is not English class."
2608,460501,3.0,4.0,"Lots and lots of reading, and the TA can make it or break it for you because they are who grade all your papers. yup. lots of reading, a paper due just about every week, only take it if you are going to be really dedicated."
2609,460501,5.0,4.0,"Great class, excellent professor, but an IN-SANE amount of reading. They really need to dial that down, but still a great class."
2610,460501,4.0,3.0,"I took her Biblical Hebrew class simply b/c I was interested and as I expected, it was challenging. However she had some very helpful tips on how to better our understanding of the understudied language and made herself available to us often."
2611,460501,3.5,4.0,"It could easily be classified as an English class as well.  Your whole grade is subjective making it ridiculously hard to get an A on the test (and there is no curve).  Good professor, class and interesting material but don't take it as a filler class.  There is a decent amount of reading and a short paper due most discussion sections."
2612,460501,5.0,3.0,This course is fabulous; I highly recommend it for anyone interested in religious studies  She is a gifted lecturer who easily commands attention and actively involves the class.  She presents all sides of contentious issues.  Honestly the only people who have a problem are those who are too narrow-minded to study religion in an academic setting.
2613,460501,5.0,3.0,"Very informative about the Old Testament and history of the Israelite community. Professor Halvorsen-Taylor's lectures are great. She really engages you into the topic. Readings are a lot, but you can get the gist of them in lecture. A weekly writing assignment is due weekly for lecture (1-2 pages). Mid-term was a killer, but outline was helpful."
2614,460501,5.0,1.0,"(Side note:  J sections do better than C sections).  Martien's teaching style can get a bit slow, but she really knows her stuff.  I love the way she engages the students, although her lectures occupy ~150 people.  She is an all-around nice woman.  Important info is gone over more than once and very detailed review lists are given well in advance of exams."

2616,460501,5.0,2.0,9/15 guy doesnt know what hes talking about.  Awesome lecturer and really presents an unbiased viewpoint of old testament that makes you think.  Exams arent hard if u know the terms she gives you.Readings arent essential but lectures are.Take this class.  Great non-western and even better professor.
2617,460501,4.0,3.0,"As opposed to the person for 9/15 I believe that Professor Halverson-Taylor presents the material in an unbiased way, she always tells both the jewish and christian viewpoints and what the literal translation out of the Hebrew is.  A lot of reading but majority of tests is lecture material."
2618,460501,4.0,3.0,The class was hard and there were a lot of reading and writing assignments. The lectures were interesting and useful to attend. You could usually not do most of the readings and pick up most of the stuff at the lecture. Exams were killer hard but tested what was taught in lecture.
2619,460501,5.0,3.0,"Really nice, especially helpful when you go to office hours. A lot of reading, but she gives you a clear outline of the exam."
2620,460501,1.0,4.0,She sets out to bash all conservative religious theology.  If you make comments she disagrees with she treats you like you are stupid.  She gives no credibility to Jewish and Christian beliefs about the Old Testament.
2621,239321,4.5,4.0,"I really enjoyed Prof. Affron's class. Keeping up with the readings will benefit you on the exams. Attend lectures and take good notes, but because Affron can sometimes be longwinded in his descriptions, summarizing is key."
2622,239321,4.5,2.0,He's really approachable and knowledgeable....a good class.
2623,239321,2.0,4.0,"I have now taken two classes with Professor Affron and have been extremely disappointed with both. He takes really interesting subjects and makes them incredibly boring. The amount of reading is ridiculous and the exams are killer. Try to avoid taking a class with him, if possible."
2624,239321,5.0,3.0,"I dont know how anyone could ever NOT like affron! he is an amazing professor, brilliant, but his class is not for the lazy student. he demands a lot but in turn, one learns a LOT. you just have to put in the work. again, not for the lazy student."
2625,239321,4.0,4.0,prof affron is well organized but his class is very demanding and requires a lot of reading.  you can tell he is very smart and takes time to prepare his lectures but they can be very boring.  even with a full nights sleep and a cup of coffee before class it is very easy to fall asleep.
2626,239321,2.0,3.0,I was really excited about this class...until i took it. It ended up being really boring and really redundant...he has the bad habit of using a billion adjectives and synonyms to describe one thing which gets annoying..just dont take this class
2627,239321,3.0,4.0,"What could have been an interesting class, history of photography, turned out to be deathly boring...I fell asleep in most lectures, and the work was hard."
2628,239321,1.5,3.0,I don't know where all the smiley faces came from but Prof. Affron was TERRIBLE. DONT EVER TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM. I went into the semester being SO excited about modern art but he killed it with his deathly boring lectures and his demeaning attitude. The material on the exam was frustratingly obscure. Bottom line: stay away.
2629,239321,4.5,3.0,His requirements are very clear but that also means he expects you to know the material very well.
2630,239321,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Affron is very well organized and clear.  I didn't find assignments or tests hard b/c for the tests he gives you a list of the slides you need to know and the essay a couple weeks ahead of time.  Go to class, take good notes, and you'll be fine."
2631,239321,4.5,4.0,one of my favorite profs in UVa!!! always smiley and eager to help students. he's so well-prepared that the class never gets behind the syllabus. always on schedule so you know what to expect and your readings never fail.
2632,239321,4.0,4.0,"I really liked the 1st half of the class. The professor seemed really passionate about it. The second half needs to be worked on, the lectures were boring and the book was black and white (which is a definite drawback when you analyse things like colors for instance). Dana Wheeler - is a great TA!"
2633,239321,3.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed Affron! He was very prepared and always smiling and seemed to really care about his students. The thing that ruined this class was the TA - Do not take any class that is TAed by Dana Wheeles. Horrible, unapproachable, and her teaching conflicted with Affron's. A TA can ruin a class!"
2634,239321,3.5,3.0,Be prepared to take a lot of notes - he talks very quickly and packs a ton of information into every lecture.  He's very intelligent and seems to do a lot of planning and preparation for his lectures.  The only negative - I though that he asked too much for the time/space of his assignments.
2635,239321,5.0,4.0,No Comments
2636,239321,3.0,3.0,"interesting class. although the first half or so is pretty technical about the development of photographic methods. affron is a good lecturer and obviously very intelligent, although he can be a little dry and rambling."
2637,239321,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2638,239321,5.0,3.0,"A great professor and an interesting lecturer.  Too bad all his TA's are total bimbos, which detracts significantly from the course's appeal."

2640,50905,5.0,4.0,"Professor Blum is by far the professor I have ever take a class with. While her classes are by no means an easy A, if you do the work and get invested in her class you will do extremely well. I would highly recommend taking any class you can with her."
2641,50905,1.0,4.0,"Linda Blum is not a good professor, and I would not recommend her to anyone. Estuarine Ecology sounds interesting, but her lectures are dull and repetitive and her exams are very difficult. The field trip is fun but not worth writing a 15-page single-spaced research project. I highly regret taking this class."
2642,50905,2.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE. If you need to take EVSC 1010, wait until the spring when she is NOT teaching. Professor Blum is unclear, confusing, and highly inarticulate. No student should receive a D+ in an introductory course, but somehow Blum made that possible for me. I studied hard, went to class, and went to office hours. Her tests are very difficult."
2643,50905,1.0,4.0,"Literally the worst professor I have had in my entire life. Lectures are scattered and unorganized despite her reading word for word off of the slides, she can barely answer questions and she's more often than not reciting inaccurate information. When studying for tests, the textbook and class notesslides do not match up. Impossible to do well. "
2644,50905,2.0,5.0,"There aren't any assignments in this class, but there are 4 exams (the lowest grade gets dropped) plus a final, which are mainly based off of the lectures. She does post the slides online for students, but she changes them. So she will show some slides in class, that we don't have. She does read off of the slides quite often. I didn't care for EVSC"
2645,50905,4.0,3.0,"I enjoyed Professor Blum. She is passionate about what she is teaching, but to do well you must go to the lectures and take good notes. If you do that you don't need to read the textbook. She is always ready to help and will spend however long it takes to make sure you do. If you want to do well, you will. The concepts are not hard. "
2646,50905,1.5,5.0,"Avoid this professor. Take this course in the spring with the other instructor. She is very unclear, her slides are disorganized and she creates no incentives for her students to do better. There is no curve even though the class average for most of her tests is 70."
2647,50905,5.0,2.0,"This was a great class - a lot of work, but you learn a lot. Blum was a great professor and was NOT a harsh grader at all (my lowest grade was an 89). Envi Sci students - don't be afraid to take her upper level class, she is great and so is the class!"
2648,50905,2.0,5.0,While it is obvious that Blum has a lot of interest in the course material it is often hard to follow her lectures.  The slides that she posts only contain pictures so it is impossible to skip lecture and try to catch up by looking at the slides.  She gives zero guidance on what to study for exams. She's tough but not terrible.
2649,50905,3.0,2.0,"She really isn't that bad. She loves the material, though the lectures can be a bit boring. Her tests are based almost completely off the lecture, so go to lecture and take good notes. I got a B+ by cramming the night before for everything. It's really not that bad of a class, and the material isn't that hard."
2650,50905,4.0,3.0,A lot of people this class but I really liked it. I don't think you will find the tests too hard as long as you read the chapters and take very good notes (which you will need to study well!) And I'm not too sure why people think Linda is so evil because I really liked her. I guess just dont get on her bad side. She also gives hmwrk almost weekly.
2651,50905,1.0,5.0,"Actually brought a student up on Honor charges because he came in late to a multiple-choice quiz, and guessed on questions he wasn't there to see. Scary. She could not only ruin your grade, but get you kicked out of school. Claims guessing correctly on three multiple choice questions is essentially statistically impossible."
2652,50905,1.5,5.0,"Overall was a horrible class. The lectures are extremely boring and Blum tends to stutter and say &quot;uhhhh&quot; every two seconds. The material is fairly easy, yet the tests are almost impossible to do well on. It is an extremely hard class to do well in even though you may know the material. Don't recommend, especially if it is to fulfill a requirement."
2653,50905,1.0,5.0,"Worst class in the COD.  She is terrible.  She just repeats what is on her slides, and offers no help.  She gave me a 0/100 on an exam even though I had gotten permission from her to miss it previously, so she went back on her word.  Please avoid this class so the EVSC dept. can realize she needs to be FIRED! AVOID THIS CLASS."
2654,50905,4.0,4.0,"Honestly this woman is really helpful, knows her work but will definitely make life HELL!!! Tough tests, tough HW, loads of quizzes,tough grading, 50% B's 1% A's the rest r def C's and D'. YUP AVOID THE CLASS!!..show her she needs to change her way or else we students will stop taking her class!!"
2655,50905,2.0,4.0,I looked at these ratings too late. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! IT SUCKS!
2656,50905,2.0,3.0,"This class really isn't that bad. If you can put up with Blum's stutter and inability to keep lectures interesting then you'll be fine. Just read the book, memorize vocab, and do the homework."
2657,50905,1.5,4.0,should have listened to the warnings here. i tried to stick it out and my gpa is suffering. don't take this course.
2658,50905,1.5,4.0,QUITE TERRIBLE!DON'T TAKE THE CLASS!I DIDN'T SEE THESE COMMENTS TILL NOW AND IT IS TOO LATE TO REGRET!!
2659,50905,2.0,3.0,She is nice enough but will only help if you go to office hours.  She gives pop quizzes on the readings.
2660,50905,1.5,3.0,"she is a terrible professor. her lectures are extremely boring (uhhh, every few seconds) and include a lot of uneeded info. she also grades extremely harshly; i have gotten zeroes on homework that i spent hours on simply because i neglected to sign the pledge (i wrote it out, just forgot to sign it) and her tests are pretty ridiciulous also."
2661,50905,1.0,5.0,"This woman should be FIRED IMMEDIATELY!!! Tests are absolutely RIDICULOUS. She ruins the EVSC program b/c everyone who takes her 101 class (including me) decides that they hate EVSC. EVSC deserves SO much better! Seriously, get your parents to write to UVA and get this loser FIRED!!!"
2662,50905,4.5,1.0,"She is not that bad!  Maybe she's bad for Envi Sci but her tests were easy enough.  There was no curve but the averages on the last two tests were in the low-mid 80s!!  Not a great professor but not as bad as people say and really a nice, if awkward, person."
2663,50905,1.0,4.0,"IMO the WORST class/teacher I have ever experienced. Blum's unsympathetic (doesn't curve her tests), incompetent (needs speech class), dry (try stayin awake to her &quot;uh uh uh..&quot; with the lights off) and unreasonable (her tests require you to make UNEDUCATED GUESSES!!!).  For your own sake, stay away from this course.  Blum SHOULD BE FIRED!!! &gt;_&lt;"
2664,50905,1.0,4.0,"Seriously...stay away. Before the semester, I read through all of these reviews and said &quot;Nah...she can't be this horrible...OK, she's teaching a new class, so maybe she'll do a better job here.&quot; Absolutely not. She's terrible, incompetent, and tests at a far more difficult level than how she lectures. AND NO CURVE!&#63; WTF! Stay away!"
2665,50905,4.0,3.0,Not a hard class material-wise but expect a B because of the tests-basically the only grades.  Professor Blum clearly enjoys EVSC but doesn't seem that excited about teaching it.
2666,50905,2.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!  I ignored people's warnings and the class was terrible.  She's boring and her exams are unreasonable.  If you take the class, you'll regret it."
2667,50905,1.0,5.0,Linda makes tests harder than they should be because she is a heartless jigamasauntez with no sould and she is married only to hide her true feelings. Questions are worded poorly and content on the test is only slightly covered in class so answers are usually educated guesses. Dont take this class unless you like stupid questions from christoff.
2668,50905,1.0,5.0,Linda Blum is a very confusing professor who gives test questions that were not covered during the class.
2669,50905,1.0,4.0,"If she was suffering from a fatal, painful disease and i was the governor, i would outlaw euthanasia and force her to listen to her own lectures and take her own tests.I've never been in a worse class at UVa.She should be fired.Immediately."
2670,50905,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I have ever experienced. Sounds like a broken record player in class and tests have the most arbitrary questions that you will ever come across. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS
2671,50905,2.0,4.0,"Overall terrible class. Lectures are disorganized, boring, and don't cover the material you are tested on. Tests themselves are frustrating bc the material should not be hard, yet the questions are random, poorly worded, impossible to study for, and don't seem to test what you're learning in class. Don't take this as an easy science credit!!!!!!!"
2672,50905,2.5,4.0,"all of the tests were hard, even after studying for a long time and going to class! all tests are m/c and so your grade is mostly that. not very engaging lecturer"
2673,50905,2.5,3.0,"She's not that bad,the tests can be kind of hard. Do the reading and the practice questions provided by the book website, and should be fine"
2674,50905,1.5,5.0,"This professor is horrible.  Not only is she rude when you approach her to ask questions, she also makes things about 20 times harder than they should be.  Test questions are poorly worded and there is no curve.  I now hate environmental science completely.  Thanks Professor Blum!!"
2675,50905,2.0,5.0,"This class was soooo frustrating. Test questions were very ambiguous. One in particular was worded so that you had to read her mind to know which of two answers was correct, but she refused to give credit for the one that was &quot;wrong&quot;. Others were not quite so blatant, but still... this was a horrible course."
2676,50905,1.0,4.0,"She's a crazy person. If you want to spend a review session learning SCIENTIFIC NOTATION because somone there missed it in 6th grade, take the class. If you have mastered scientific notation and don't want to listen to Linda's other &quot;learning moments,&quot; don't take it. She wears sweater vests and courdoroy, she should be teaching kindergarten."
2677,50905,4.5,2.0,"I think Blum is great to have, especially for an intro class. She's very organized- she puts the lecture outlines online, as well as slides, and also posts practice tests. She holds a review session the day before the test will stay long to help clear up anything. You still have to study to do well, but it's not a hard class. I liked her!"
2678,50905,1.0,5.0,"Does environmental science have to be this hard&#63;  NO!  Ok, she makes it sound easy in the lectures, but once you get your uncurved test back (ave usually 72%), you just want to cry.  Spare yourself."
2679,50905,1.0,5.0,This class sucked
2680,50905,1.0,5.0,"This class is TERRIBLE. The woman expects you to have no life outside of work - and that includes no eating or sleeping in her terms. She's boring and unclear. The tests are hard and she doesn't curve. If its just to fulfill a requirement, DO NOT take this class!!!"
2681,50905,1.0,4.0,"the tests are hard and unrelated to the material taught in class, there is no curve, and the only thing that can save your grade is the few extra credit points she offers. she is also extremely inflexible with her stupid policies. DO NOT take this class."
2682,50905,1.0,3.0,"Absolutely Horrible. She needs to take a public speaking class and for someone to read over her tests for her, because apparently she doesn't understand english too well. Going to lecture doesn't help too much on tests. This class will drive you nuts, especially if you are interested in Envi-Sci"
2683,50905,1.0,5.0,"ok yess i dont know whether i read all those comments i might have and just didnt take them seriously,,,pleasee take them seriously this class is extremely pointless not an easy A"
2684,50905,2.5,5.0,"I don't think she's realised that she's teaching a 101 class and not a thesis program. If you're only trying to fill a requirement DON'T take this class, it will screw you over. If you do take it...beware of her 'teaching moments'."
2685,50905,2.0,5.0,"This class is easily among the most frustrating ever.  Like everyone else has said, the tests are ridiculously hard to the point of hopeless and the lectures are boring to the point of pulling your hair out in frustration.  STAY AWAY!"
2686,50905,3.0,4.0,This class is very hard.  She purposely makes the test hard.  The reading is not that bad and if you go see her she is very helpful.  But TESTS ARE HARD!
2687,50905,1.0,3.0,"I would only take this class if you watned an excuse to hate everything about env. science.  Absolutely terrible.  One of the most annoying, incompetent, and generally unclear professors I have ever studied under.  Do not take this class."
2688,50905,4.5,2.0,"Lectures are relatively borning, but don't pass them up.  Extra credit opportunities are only offered to those in attendance and there is no telling when she'll spring some on you.  If you pay attention and do the work, the class is easy."
2689,50905,1.5,3.0,"She destroyed any interest I had in environmental science.  I took this class expecting it to be easy, but I was definitely wrong.  What everyone on here has said about her is completely true.  Take another EVSC class if you want something easy."
2690,50905,2.0,4.0,I agree with all the negative comments that have been said above.
2691,50905,1.5,4.0,Horrible class. Tests are impossible no matter how hard you study. Stay away from this lady!
2692,50905,1.0,4.0,"This woman is really annoying, and unfair.  She purposely makes the tests very hard, and is totally unsympathetic.  On the fun side, if you get stuck with her, you can drive her INSANE with cell phones.  It sure breaks the usual monotony of the class."
2693,50905,4.0,2.0,Professor Blum taught me a lot in EVSC 101.
2694,50905,1.5,4.0,"Lectures are boring and her speaking skills are not very good. Even by reading the text, studying notes and the lectures, the tests were hard to take... especially when there was no motivation because the material was boring! Not a recommended class."
2695,50905,2.0,5.0,"She's nice, but her lectures are SO boring. And her tests are unnecessarily hard. I hate the environment now."
2696,50905,3.0,4.0,This class is super boring and this prof will make you fall asleep.  You may think the material is easy to understand when you read the texts and powerpoints but the tests are crazy hard.
2697,50905,1.0,4.0,"I had a good backround in this area before taking this class, yet somehow that didn't help at ALL on her ludicrous exams. I absolutely hated this class and this professor.  But thanks to her project I salvaged my gradfe. And trick questions don't prove your knowledge as well as an essay would."
2698,50905,2.5,2.0,"Boring as this class was, it wasn't particularly hard.  As for not knowing what was on the tests, several practice questions could be found verbatim on each test.  Staying awake in class should by itself guarantee a B."
2699,50905,1.0,4.0,I hate environmental science thanks to this class.
2700,50905,1.0,5.0,worst class..i thought it would be easy..all her tests were as if she was trying to fail you!!! horrible experience..her help didnt really help either...her tests had nothing to do with the lectures..no matter how hard u studied...dont ever take this...
2701,50905,1.0,3.0,"One of the worst professors ever, not to mention says umm, well umm a lot =P"
2702,50905,1.0,4.0,The tests had nothing to do with the practice questions or material.  bad lecturer. mean.  don't take.
2703,50905,2.5,4.0,"worst class ever, so boring, hard to know what's on the tests"
2704,50905,2.0,4.0,BAD! DO NOT take her!
2705,50905,2.5,3.0,This woman is SO boring.  When the lights are dimmed and she starts umming...it puts me right to sleep

2710,50905,3.5,3.0,"Relatively decent teacher. I just believe she's been teaching this class for more semester's than she has wanted. The class is not hard, and she will help if you really want it."
2711,50905,1.0,3.0,"Not so much that the class is hard; Prof. Blum is hard to get along with and doesn't really get her point across, and she takes her job way too seriously.  I never know what will be on the test."

2724,50905,3.5,2.0,"a bit boring and not always clear on test material needed to know, but not hard"
2725,50905,2.0,4.0,"Envisci 101 seems like it would be an easy class, right? WRONG"
2726,960219,4.5,4.0,"Hard Class, but worth it.  Assignments take forever.  You don't really need to read, but you should be in class.  Tests are hard but fair."
2727,960219,4.5,4.0,"Jason Lawrence is a fantastic professor!  He knows his subject matter very well and really loves teaching it.  The way that he lectures is calm, clear, and focused.  Highly recommended."
2728,1566441,4.5,2.0,Interesting class.
2729,607978,4.0,1.0,"I learned a lot from this class, but did not feel that having Kovacs as the teacher was a defining factor. He picked some interesting texts, but I often found that they were easy for me, and yet difficult for many in the class. The course difficulty was not defined before signups, and he chose material (Caesar) many of us had covered before in AP."
2730,607978,3.5,2.0,"Professor Kovacs made for an interesting professor for Greek. He clearly knew his stuff but I often felt like he would profit more from simply putting a conjugation on the board and having us review it rather than lecturing for a whole hour and probably confusing half the class. Overall, I did enjoy the semester, but mainly because of my interest."
2731,607978,4.5,3.0,"Sometimes rambles a bit, but he is usually on topic. He's a good teacher, and doesn't strive to make his class overly hard (although it isn't really easy either). He really does want everyone to do well. I went to office hours a few times, and he was always helpful. Attendance is required, and there are quizzes twice a week (plus 3 exams)."
2732,607978,4.5,3.0,"He explains things clearly and is really funny. I'm normally awful at languages, but he explained Greek in such a way that I understood it almost immediately. There's a fair amount of work, but it's not too painful."
2733,607978,1.0,5.0,"If I had a choice of gouging out my eyes with a spoon, or listening to Dr. Kovacs' senseless prattle, the choice would be obvious: suicide."
2734,607978,4.5,1.0,"Cute, funny old man, very friendly. He is incredibly knowledgeable about classic drama (although he is more enthusiastic about the Greek plays than the Roman ones). Not too much reading, really easy grader. Not always clear and tends to ramble sometimes, but still a great professor."
2735,1443571,4.0,4.0,"I loved her enthusiasm and passion for what she taught- it made me way more interested in the course. Grading was not easy though. It was always consistent/fair, but sometimes I felt like she expected more work then I had time for."
2736,1443572,5.0,2.0,"Took him as a first-year. Of the 10 teachers I've had, he's by far THE greatest. Really engaged, cares about his students, and makes each lecture really interesting and fun. Some readings might be challenging, and the papers...meh. Go to office hours if you're nervous at all. He's extremely approachable and helpful. Would love to have him again."
2737,1443572,5.0,3.0,"Professor Stauffer is intelligent, approachable, and entertaining.  He facilitates great discussion by encouraging his students to participate and valuing their thoughts and opinions.  Great class with a great professor!"
2738,1443572,4.5,2.0,"He is incredibly insightful, takes all students opinions/ideas into account, and offers thought provoking discussion. He's also incredibly good looking."
2739,1443572,4.5,3.0,He is a knowledgeable and passionate professor with many interests in books as objects as well as poetry itself.  All in all Great course and a pretty easy going interesting professor
2740,1443572,5.0,3.0,"Enthusiastic, open to opinions and helpful.  Not a huge poetry fan, but have a better grasp after his class."
2741,935671,5.0,2.0,"Jeff is the man. He is very kind, knowledgable, and extremely willing to help students."
2742,935671,5.0,4.0,"He's a very knowledgeable and skilled professor and a really kind person. He was approachable, helpful, and encouraging. I found the readings and paper topics extremely interesting as well. I highly recommend taking a class with him; you can learn a lot without having your soul crushed."
2743,935671,5.0,3.0,"Extremely personable and helpful on many levels. Very knowledgeable in both literature and history. Seems a bit nerdy but is passionate about teaching, about helping his students do well, and about the subject matter which is usually pretty interesting. I am not a bookworm, stay-in type and I have really loved getting to know him"
2744,935671,4.0,1.0,"He's so enthusiastic about his subject matter. The lectures can still get rather boring though, especially since the class is usually stone silent. There are a bunch of little movie reviews due though. He may SEEM demanding and difficult, but just a lot of BS and little literary knowledge can give you an easy A."
2745,378628,5.0,4.0,"She's a great teacher! This class takes a lot of work to do well, but every required project helps you learn more. Her and the TAs have office hours that are helpful to attend if you want a good grade, and going will help you improve."
2746,378628,5.0,4.0,Love this course!!!! The works we've done seem not that related to architecture but in fact they do. Every project in this class help practice and improve the ways of thinking and the ability of aesthetic appreciation--fundamental skills that you need to become a qualified architect.
2747,378628,4.0,4.0,"For a student not in the architecture school, Sanda is a phenomenal and engaging professor. She is truly compassionate towards her students. There is a ton of work which is why the class is hard, however, Sanda is very encouraging and will give you a good grade if you do everything and if you put in your best effort. Also a good TA is helpful."
2748,378628,3.0,4.0,"I loved Professor Iliescu's personality, but as someone not majoring in architecture, I felt the work was rather extreme and I quickly became tired of the class as it was such intense work."
2749,378628,3.5,4.0,"Took this as a requirement for architecture major. Difficult and pushed my boundaries. Very abstract. Be prepared for a project due every week. Be sure to get a good TA, they can make or break your experience (and your grade). GO TO OFFICE HOURS! She is only helpful if you ask for it. Recommended for majors and those interested in arch. Enjoy"
2750,378628,4.5,4.0,"Sanda is the best. More teachers ought to be like her. She is incredibly encouraging and truly cares about how her students develop. Although it isn't an easy A, it is possible, and the learning experience/growth from this class is tremendous."
2751,378628,4.5,4.0,"Sanda is a fantastic professor, and really pushes for the students who show an effort or appreciation for the class. It is a good basics course for anyone who wants to learn design. Keep in mind that this course is a precursor to the workloads in studio, and should be taken seriously by anyone who is in the a-school or thinking of transferring in"
2752,378628,3.0,5.0,She is FANTASTIC and made absolutely every lesson fun to attend. You almost didn't want to ever skip her class!!!!
2753,378628,4.0,1.0,"GET A GOOD TA!  My TAs were so vapid and insipid that it made my head spin.  The class itself is wonderful, and would be even more so if the TA and discussion sections were moderated and kept the same!  I had friends who loved their TAs and made friends, while I just wanted to bash my TA's faces in.  Not hard to get a good grade, fun class."
2754,378628,3.5,5.0,"this class requires a lot of work but definitely worths it. sanda encourages you to see beauty out of everything, making you start to appreciate small things in unexpected way. get a good ta (ask around) and you won't regret taking it."
2755,378628,4.0,2.0,"get a good ta.  this cannot be emphasized enough.  the class gives good information and is wonderful if you want to learn.  i took it not as an A-skooler so i got to see things from an outsider's perspective.  question everything.  be wary.  Did i mention to get a good ta&#63;  if your TA is not doing it for you, SWITCH.  Dont be afraid to switch."
2756,378628,3.0,4.0,"This class is very demanding on time and energy, be prepared for many all nighters over the semester, of course the time you spend on projects you never notice passing by like you do when you are reading a text book for another class. And at the end there was this great rewarding feeling that made me want to transfer into the a-school."
2757,378628,3.0,5.0,"This was probably the most challenging and ultimately most rewarding class I've taken. However, during the semester, it drove me crazy and most of the time I was just frustrated. There's a ton of work which requires late nights and getting friendly with your TAs."
2758,378628,4.0,2.0,No Comments
2759,378628,2.0,2.0,"Very enthusiastic & passionate, but we were constantly assigned art projects that were fun, but I was left asking, &quot;What about architecture&#63;!&quot; This class is great for kids who really wanted to be artists, but their parents told them to major in something that they could actually make a living at, hence Architecture. No help to me."
2760,378628,5.0,4.0,"What an inspiring teacher!  She finds everything to be so interesting.  The class is a tough grade and it's a lot of work, but it's definately worth it in the end."
2761,378628,4.0,4.0,"She is amazing, but it definately helps to get a good TA.  Don't be afriad to go up and talk to her during office hours, she'll love it."
2762,378628,2.5,4.0,"a very eccentric lady who finds beauty in everything. loves to show student work in class. most work of any class i have taken, but fun. good for taking in a light semester."
2763,378628,3.5,4.0,"sanda is eccentric, get a good TA: this makes all the difference"
2764,378628,4.0,3.0,Sanda finds love in everything-brings great spirit to the lecture. Assingments are very open to interpretation-they can be time consuming but for the most part are pretty enjoyable. A good TA is a must!  Definitely recommend the class for those outside the A-school. Pick 102 over 101.
2765,378628,4.5,3.0,interesting
2766,378628,4.0,3.0,"overall, i enjoyed the class, especially after 101. get a good ta"
2767,378628,4.5,2.0,"Sanda is a great teacher. After taking 101 this class really makes up for it. It definitely helps to have a cool TA for this class, because you could end up doing much more work than other sections. This is a great class for anyone interested in art/arch."
2768,1591064,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Robey was awesome! Easy class, although I still had to pay attention. I read the textbook although optional. I enjoyed the content thoroughly, but Prof. Robey's experience should be independently noted and appreciated and his lectures were so helpful."
2769,1591064,5.0,3.0,I really liked his class as well as him just as a professor.
2770,75550,4.5,3.0,"Very helpful & knowledgable professor. Strength of Materials and Structural Mechanics are not easy subjects to understand, but Baber is an excellent professor and makes the subject manageable."
2771,75550,5.0,1.0,Just come to class and listen.  Notes are posted if you miss anything (but don't skip) because he won't put EVERYTHING online.
2772,75550,5.0,2.0,"He is definitly one of the best professors I have ever had. Great teacher, excellent expertise on the materials and very efficient in presenting required topics."
2773,75550,3.0,3.0,Baber is truly a nice guy. But his class was boring and his instruction a little hard to follow. He wrote the textbook (which appears to be in draft form - many typos) and it is not very helpful at all.
2774,75550,5.0,3.0,best teacher i've had yet at school...very fair
2775,75550,4.5,2.0,Nicest and easiest teacher in E-School so far
2776,75550,1.0,5.0,Thought Baber was a lot better teaching CE 230.  Now he goes through examples and is not clear about the procedure.  The class has no idea what to expect on the upcoming tests.  The textbook is written by Baber causing you to not get a different explanation on the way things work... so if you don't understand in class you won't have  chance to read the textbook and understand it at home.  Expect a feeling of being lost.

2780,75550,5.0,3.0,"do your homework and youre set!!  he knows his stuff, and is always willing to help.  Tests are VERY reasonable:o)"
2781,75550,2.5,4.0,"Tends to go through examples at light speed, rarely with timefor questions."
2782,75550,5.0,2.0,The professor is very open to answering any questions at any time. He always has his door open for students for any questions you may have. The subject material isnt the easiest but the professor does his best to make sure his students understand. GREAT PROFESSOR!!!
2783,75550,4.0,2.0,"Good guy, actually learned names in fairly large class.  Sometimes lectures are a little slow, but he provides note packets to follow along.  Homework and tests are definitely manageable."
2784,75550,4.5,4.0,very clear. tests are not that bad if you do the homework

2787,75550,2.0,4.0,He is incredibly smart but horribly boring

2789,1550111,5.0,3.0,"Profound, patient, brilliant, generous. 
A passionate professor who gives eye opening lectures and encourages his students. Amazing taste"
2790,1550111,5.0,4.0,Best professor at UVA. Leads awesome class discussions. Tough grader but very willing to help you do your best work in any way he can.
2791,1550111,5.0,3.0,He's very enthusiastic and is a wonderful teacher. Tough grader but he knows this and will help you.
2792,1550111,4.5,2.0,"Took Gangster FIlm with LIttle. Very little textbook usage but assigns one or two readings per week, and quizes. Quizes are easy and in a pinch you can get by with wikipediaing the movie and watching a few clips online. Very good, helpful, willing to talk, sometimes takes things a bit too far as far as analysis."
2793,1550111,5.0,4.0,great person!
2794,1550111,5.0,3.0,inspiring and fantastic teacher
2795,75552,5.0,1.0,"This guy is my kind of guy. A true scholar and a gentlemen. If he were an Ice Cream flavor, he would be Cookie Dough with extra chocolate syrup."

2799,2688801,1.0,2.0,Tries to make himself more essential than he is. Makes everything take super long and doesn't always understand what he himself is saying. Makes things more confusing than they need to be.
2800,747300,5.0,5.0,"Janis is an excellent professor, an awesome person, an accent to die for, need I say more???"
2801,747300,3.0,3.0,"janis is a soft spoken man who is super nice...he seems like he cares and wants to be there, unlike some of the other biology professors at uva...i kind of messed up my poster bc i was really sick the day it was due...he let me make it up...most professors wouldve been like too bad but he helped me out..."
2802,747300,4.5,2.0,"This is an outstanding course. Yanis is quite possibly the friendliest teacher I've had at UVA, and I will definitely miss his enthusiasm in class. No textbook but are weekly readings. Tests focus largly on lecture material and are not too bad. Poster project is a blast and he wants you to have fun with it above all else. Highly recommended!"
2803,747300,4.0,3.0,"Really interesting material, and I've heard it's not bad for a biology class.  It's the only one I've taken here so far, but I found the tests pretty difficult.  Janis is sweet and brings jokes/songs/films to class."
2804,1951527,3.0,4.0,Very knowledgeable. Clear rubrics--I would suggest following them. Have someone proofread your papers for sure!
2805,509740,3.0,3.0,"Keeps lectures short, usually always leave 15-20 min early. Plays a video after the end of power point 95% of the time. If you know you're not doing well, DO THE EXTRA CREDIT. I feel like she gives you an A on it just because you did it. Supposed to be an easy A class but still don't underestimate, I ended up getting a B+ with the extra credit. "
2806,509740,5.0,1.0,"You didn't really have to go to class because all she did was read straight from the powerpoints, which she posted online. I always went, though, because I loved hearing the stories she'd tell about her adventures in Buddhist countries. Lots of reading, but you could probably skim through. She posted helpful study guides. Tests were extremely easy."
2807,509740,3.5,3.0,"Very nice lady. Mandatory discussion once a week. Lecture is optional, given she doesn't take attendance and puts everything online. My only complaint is that she follows the slides too closely, which becomes boring. There is a lot of reading, but manageable. Midterm, a short paper, and a final. She gives review sheets for exams!"
2808,509740,4.0,2.0,"She is very nice, and the exam is not that hard, but you really need to study on the review sheet she gives you. As long as you work hard on the review sheet and go through the lecture slides, you will get good grades. You don't have to do all of the readings, but it's really necessary to know about the readings that are emphasized in review sheet."
2809,509740,4.5,3.0,I really enjoyed her lectures. She posted them online so you could follow along but kept it interesting with personal stories. She has lots of experience and anecdotes and is very helpful at the end of the semester if you do extra credit. I recommend her and this course; if you pay attention in class you don't need to do some of the readings.
2810,509740,2.5,3.0,"Attending lecture is completely optional; Dr. Lang posts the slides for the entire semester on Collab from the start, and adds nothing of significant value during class. Mid-Term and Final are surprisingly tough. A great deal of reading, if you choose to do it. Still, a very nice woman and offers extra credit opportunities."
2811,509740,5.0,3.0,Absolutely amazing person! You will love her. She is an incredibly intelligent and kind lady. She keeps the lectures interesting with her quirky sense of humor. She offers extra credit if you talk to her. I would definitely recommend taking any class with her!
2812,509740,5.0,3.0,"Karen Lang is amazing! I took this class just to get more credits, having no high expectations or whatsoever as I tried other religious studies but they turned out to be extremely boring.I liked RELB210 since the first day I went in.She has travelled to many countries in pursuit of the religion.It's a class u have to take if u're at UVa.Simply amaz"
2813,509740,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Adds videos and personal stories to organized lectures to keep your interest. Her genuine interest in the subject is impossible to deny. If you study for the exams, you can do well. Grade: 1 paper, 2 exams, participation."
2814,509740,5.0,3.0,"Karen Lang is a great teacher and knows a lot about her subject.  Lecture isn't mandatory, but is still interesting.  She always ended class at least half an hour early, and broke up the lectures with movies and her personal stories about meeting the dalai lama.  take this class!"
2815,509740,5.0,2.0,"Buddhism itself requires a lot of interest and work on behalf of the student, but Professor Lang makes learning it so interesting.  She breaks up her lectures with lots of videos and personal stories from her own experiences with the religion.  Memorization of terms is pretty much the whole basis of the class however."
2816,509740,4.5,2.0,"Professor Lang is an excellent teacher. She's understanding and helpful, and her door is always open when you need the extra help. Great story teller, interesting lectures, and she's overall a great person to talk to! Very interesting woman, definitely one of a kind!"
2817,509740,3.5,2.0,"The class is interesting if you actively try to learn, because just going to lectures is very boring. Readings are not necessary. Two essay tests,  for both you are given a review sheet with a lot of names to memorize and several essays to prepare for. Not that bad, just have to put in work for the tests. Worth taking for non-western perspectives."
2818,509740,3.0,2.0,"Lang's not a terrible professor, but she doesn't really manage to convey a lot of enthusiasm for her subject.  Powerpoint lectures posted on Toolkit allow for easy studying, but suck the life out of lectures, and her class focuses heavily on the history, rather than the theology, of Buddhism.  Overall, tremendously disappointing."
2819,509740,3.0,2.0,"She's a really interesting woman and an easy grader, yet the classes were really dull.  All the lectures are done on powerpoint and are available on toolkit, making it unnecessary to go to class.  Definitely get Lang for your discussion and the material will make so much more sense."
2820,509740,4.5,2.0,"Very enthusiastic, sweet, and willing to help outside of class.  Class can be boring at times, but there are usually a few stories to lighten it up.  A LOT of reading, but mostly very interesting.  Not very hard if you do most of the work."
2821,509740,5.0,2.0,"Karen Lang is such a great professor.  I learned a lot from her class; her lectures are really interesting and informative.  There is a lot of reading for RELB 210, and I definitely fell behind, but I ended up doing really well and getting a great understanding of Buddhism, just from lectures."
2822,509740,5.0,2.0,She's one of the sweetest ladies ever--extremely helpful and will talk to you about anything to help you and keep the class going.  Lectures are even posted online to help with notes.  Classes are well worth her stories.
2823,509740,4.0,2.0,She is a good teacher who knows her stuff but Buddhism is very abstract and complicated. She does her best to help you understand and grades a lot easier than you would think.
2824,2647862,5.0,3.0,"Professor David was great! Really nice guy who understands that students have other classes. His distribution of the work across the semester makes the amount of work fair but not overloading. Also, he doesn't make students take a final exam and instead has them do a project. Overall, great dude and you should consider taking Spanish with him."
2825,132921,2.5,4.0,"Way too much reading. Little instruction on assignments and the TA was not helpful at all. Confino is good about responding to emails, but the TA takes a week, if he responds."
2826,132921,3.5,3.0,"Really good lecturer! He's funny and, even at 9 AM. It's a really interesting subject. Only downfall is the large amount of reading."
2827,132921,5.0,2.0,"Had Confino for Palestine 1948.  Fantastic class!  Lots of reading but it's interesting and relevant stuff; you don't have to read every document.  Attending lectures not critical, but they're worth going to - Confino's a really good lecturer (and seems so nice!).  If writing is your strength, you'll do great.  I had Ambuske as a TA - he's quality."
2828,132921,5.0,2.0,"Confino rules. He presents the topic through the experiences of both sides (Palestinian as much as, if not more than, Israeli). So if you're looking to UNDERSTAND the history of Israel/Palestine, he's great. If you're looking for a moralistic justification of your preconceived notions, you will, like the poster below me, come away disappointed."
2829,132921,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this class! The lectures were difficult to follow and borderline incomprehensible. If you are looking for a fair and objective view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, look elsewhere. Confino without a doubt favors Israel to the point it clouds his lectures and makes his arguments confusing. Discussion sections are an absolute drag."
2830,132921,4.5,2.0,"Professor Confino is awesome! His class is super easy and he is a really interesting lecturer. His voice is also totally adorable. Although there is a lot of reading, this class is totally worth taking!"
2831,132921,5.0,3.0,"I LOVED THIS CLASS! I was a first year when I took this and was fairly intimidated going in. This class was easily my favorite, and while the reading is heavy the papers are very clear and grading is VERY FAIR. TA's are amazing, lectures are amazing. take this class."
2832,132921,5.0,3.0,"Professor Confino is the most passionate, articulate, and intelligent teacher I have ever had. This is a great class; great lectures, clear paper assignments and interesting material. The reading load is fairly heavy, but doable. Sit up front and pay attention: that shouldnt be hard, as his lectures are captivating and comprehensible. Great prof!"
2833,132921,5.0,3.0,Best class I took at UVA. Confino is a mastermind.
2834,132921,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Confino makes things interesting and the topic itself is fascinating. If only English was his first language... it's somewhat humourous when he stops lecture to ponder what word he was trying to use, but if anything, his charming little accent gets in the way of his teaching. Sit up front, do the readings, take good notes - easy A- or B+."
2835,132921,4.5,2.0,"He is excellent at teaching the material, and I really liked how he approached histiography.  The exams aren't too hard, as long as you attend lectures and do some of the readings (most of the readings are interesting, even though there are a lot).  Don't slack off, though, on the paper- it's toughly graded, but with effort you will do well."
2836,132921,3.0,3.0,"Modern Germany History was very interesting.  Professor Confino clearly understands the material.  It is helpful because he follows the required readings.  One does not need to necessarily do the readings, except for the paper.  The 2 tests are challenging but not overly difficult.  I would definately take another class taught by Professor Confino."
2837,132921,5.0,3.0,Very clear lecturer who always pauses during his lectures to make sure his students are understanding him.  Class is challenging but not impossible.
2838,132921,4.5,4.0,"One of the best classes I've taken here by far. GREAT, engaging, insightful professor! Definitely recommended"

2840,132921,5.0,2.0,Awesome dude.
2841,2467652,4.0,5.0,"Professor Sy is very patient and understanding. He is easily accessible outside of class, with many times he even set up appointment with me the next day right away. He prepared us well for the exams by giving us class time do to the practice problems, and go over it with us. He gives homework every two weeks, but they're long so pace yourself."
2842,2467652,1.0,3.0,"thinks the class understands the material much more than they do. when majority of class does poorly on a test he finds simple (due to a lack of time to write out simple yet lengthy math operations) he gets angry at them. The class suggests shorter tests and he says that the tests are just fine, despite few given normal time actually doing well."
2843,1181520,2.0,4.0,"Ok professor, talks at you not to you though.  The worst part of the class is her grading policies are CLEARLY not applied equally to each student. She has favorites and it shows; if you aren't one of them it doesn't matter how hard you try PERIOD.  TONS OF READING, POP QUIZZES, and MAJOR PAPERS.  She is also very aloof and self important."
2844,968533,2.5,1.0,"Classes were relatively disorganized and communications with the class (exams, emails, etc) were written unprofessionally."
2845,968533,5.0,2.0,Best teacher ever- looooove her. I'd take any class she taught
2846,968533,5.0,2.0,"Awesome class with an awesome teacher. She was always really excited to teach us the information, so it was fun to learn. There wasn't too much work, either!"
2847,2017113,5.0,1.0,"Amazing! Super understanding and a great lecturer. Not only is he smart, but is very good at teaching, which cannot be said for all professors. He cares about his students and is very kind and approachable."
2848,2017113,5.0,3.0,Brunelle has been the best prof I've had in the CS dept so far. His lectures are engaging and he makes complex concepts easy to understand. The class model was a little annoying at times- you are put into a cohort of 5-7 people based on when you can meet 2x a week and you are stuck with them for the entire class. No tests tho which is great.
2849,2017113,5.0,3.0,"Very nice. Learned a lot from the professor and the TAs. 40% of the final grade is programming assignments, so you shouldn't worry about the tests as much. Go to labs often so you can get that 10% participation grade. If you have no coding experience, don't worry. As long as you are good at logic and are interested in programming, you'll do fine."
2850,2017113,5.0,2.0,Nathan Brunelle is an angel sent from heaven to teach algorithms
2851,2017113,5.0,3.0,"This was the first class Nathan's taught. He's a really great guy. He has a good grasp on the material, his classes are funny and informative, and he's always willing to help you outside of class. He's very zen. Whenever you put in the effort, he's going to make it worth your while."
2852,255835,2.0,2.0,"Kim does whatever he wants. It'll take awhile to understand what he's saying unless you're good at accents. He gives out a reasonable number of hws but doesn't give any regard for timing, so you might have 4 due in 1 week. He also wants a good curve by any means so it may mean that he tests on obscure concepts or instituting a random grading scales"
2853,255835,4.0,2.0,"He really cares about his students.  Helpful if you just ask him.  Really knows his stuff, but the accent is pretty thick, and I understand accents."
2854,255835,3.5,1.0,"Absolutely fantastic and fair teacher. Very interested in students who take the effort to put into learning the material. Rewards effort and participation, and very fair grader. lots of extra credit!"
2855,255835,4.0,4.0,"Dr Kim was my adviser in the 80s. He was one of the most enthusiastic & highly motivated professors I ever had. He set very high standards, but always well within reason. He also showed a very high degree in his students and was one of the few who really cared. I never had any difficulty understanding him, despite what others say about his accent"
2856,255835,2.5,4.0,"Hard to understand, but the class is interesting.  Hooked it up w/ extra credit on the test and let us pick which 12 of 25 mc questions we wanted graded.  when he says &quot;dorsal root ganglia&quot; i cant stop laughing.  i fell asleep every day tho."
2857,255835,1.0,5.0,"CIRCUIT NEVER LIE, YOU LIE.This teacher is not exactly the most helpful, but his grading is fairer than anyone else in the BME dept.HWs are awful and take around 8 hours in groups to complete. Tests were ok, until he pulled some random crap on the final with new material. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO."
2858,255835,1.0,5.0,"This class is a steaming pile of crap.  The homework is very long and tedious, the textbook is junk, and the lecture notes are practically worthless.  The guy shows contempt for his students when they're struggling.  This class is so much harder than it needs to be..."
2859,255835,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2860,255835,3.0,3.0,"He is a decent professor, but he's soft spoken and difficult to hear.  Because of this, don't take a large class from him, but I think he'd be a pretty good teacher in a smaller class."
2861,255835,5.0,1.0,I love this man. I love this Man. I love this Man.He is the coolest prof. in the world.He is the damn nigga of all queens.
2862,608094,5.0,5.0,Professor Bashkow has been my advisor since 1st yr and he is so helpful and kind. I am taking the major capstone class with him and he always gives out constructive and positive feedback. I struggled a lot to find a clear focus of my thesis and he was very patient in helping me find the right direction. He helped me a lot and I am very grateful. 
2863,608094,1.0,1.0,"The most difficult to listen to professor I've ever had. If you can't fall asleep at night just listen to one of Prof Bashkow's lectures - you'll be out like a light. Easy class but impossible to pay attention to which makes the final/final paper difficult to do. Seriously, nice guy, if anthropology is your thing go for it but if not, good luck."
2864,608094,5.0,3.0,"Professor Bashkow is such a delight. He is very passionate about what he teaches and really tries to understand his students and their interests. He typically keeps his classes very light hearted, but the materials and discussions in class are engaging enough that you still learn a lot. He is also incredibly accommodating and supportive of students"
2865,608094,4.5,2.0,"He is very passionate in what he teaches, showing us his work and how it relates to the topic of the class. He also values group work so we usually discuss things with our groups before talks with the whole class. The homework is requires effort but the class is so interesting that it's enjoyable."
2866,608094,4.5,4.0,He's a great teacher! Very enthusiastic in class and explains things well. Get to learn a lot about different cool topics. You will have to do a lot of writing in the class though.
2867,608094,4.0,2.0,"An entertaining, intereseted teacher who will do everything to make sure his students understand"
2868,608094,5.0,2.0,"i dreaded this class because it was required for the ANTH major, but i love it, and i think it has a lot to do with bashkow. his lectures are interesting and funny, he makes very difficult concepts clear, and he doesn't give tests, just papers with a lot of feedback. i would definitly recommend his class. everyone in the class seems to feel the same way too."
2869,608094,2.5,3.0,"He's a nice man, but he is a very stubborn professor. This class is still being developed, and so he's trying out different methods. Currently, the organization of the course is hopelessly confusing. But neither he nor the TA's will admit this and so you're on your own. Maybe it's better now..."
2870,337760,5.0,2.0,Fantastic professor who really cares about improving your writing.
2871,337760,4.5,2.0,Jason is great and he really helps to bring the text to life
2872,337760,5.0,3.0,good ta. very approachable and clear. talking about beowulf and chaucer sucks but he did cool things like compare canterbury tales to snoop dogg. grades pretty fairly.
2873,337760,5.0,1.0,great ta!  discussion never sucked.
2874,337760,5.0,2.0,"Jason's amazing. he is the best ta that i have -ever- had. he works so hard for you in the class and really helps out so much. really, really great guy. check him out =)."
2875,337760,4.5,2.0,Pretty cool guy
2876,337760,5.0,1.0,"very light reading, really awesome open-minded guy, a little too easy but he's really good at promoting class discussion"
2877,2131810,5.0,2.0,"Her child psychology class was phenomenal. I learned so much but the tests were straightforward and not at all difficult. Some of her classes go by fast, but if she feels she rushed too much she will go back to the material she rushed through. She assigns readings in the text book, but if you listen in class, all you need to look at is bold terms."
2878,2131810,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Vaish very clearly knows her stuff and does an amazing job explaining it. The slides are very clear and neatly organized, and she posts them online, which makes note-taking less stressful. The tests don't try to trick you, so learn the concepts and you'll be fine. She's enthusiastic and friendly, and reasonably no-nonsense. Recommended."
2879,2656108,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Carey truly cares about seeing her students improve, both as individuals and as writers. She is very attentive during class discussion and will challenge you to push yourself in your thinking. You will constantly be ready and writing for this class, but as long as you embrace the process, you will be successful."
2880,1558382,5.0,3.0,"Such a passionate and personal professor - would definitely recommend. The material is interesting with only three grades for the semester. Midterm, project, final (take home). All were pretty fair and interesting. Definitely recommend and not too hard!"
2881,1558382,5.0,4.0,"I took his Spiritual but not religious this semester, he is the best lecturer I've ever had, now I finally know what a college-level lecture should be like. He has the appropriate amount of humor and he knows a lot about what he is teaching. Taking his class is very enjoyable, will consider taking his class again!"
2882,1558382,5.0,2.0,"I can't recommend Professor Hedstrom enough. He's really funny and engaging, which made lecture enjoyable. I've had him for Intro to American Studies as well as Spiritual But Not Religious and I wish I could take another one of his classes. He manages to teach in a though-provoking way yet you won't be fretting about your grade. Take his classes!!"
2883,1558382,4.5,2.0,"Hedstrom is a really nice guy who is really invested in his specialty (religion and american studies) and tries to bring both disciplines into his teaching whenever he can. He is young, funny, interesting and easy to talk to during office hours. Take any classes you can with him"
2884,1558382,5.0,2.0,Hedstrom is fantastic. He is an adorable nerdy man who is definitely willing to get to know you and is so interested in the material (he came up with the curriculum for the course himself). This class is also super interesting.
2885,1558382,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Very helpful and enthusiastic about whatever he teaches. Great response. Willing to bend over backwards to help students. Engaging, and funny. TAKE HIS CLASSES!"
2886,1558382,4.5,3.0,"Hedstom is a great professor.  He is newer to UVA so he isn't widely known yet.  While he does require a bit of reading from primary source books, he creates literally the best study guides for exams (the exam comes directly from the study guide) and he is very helpful with questions.  Wonderful professor!  He is also kind of funny."
2887,1722224,2.5,3.0,"He was a bit eccentric and the class was more neuroscience-based due to his own interest. Barely used the textbook, but he copied the book-provided ppts in addition to his own neuro-filled ppts. Not much reading, but he does upload multiple assigned reading PDFs that he expects you to know for the 3 non-cumulative, pretty fair exams"
2888,1877880,4.0,2.0,"Huang was my section in her capacity as a TA for Mr. Elzinga in ECON 2010. She was always very helpful and knew the text very well. Her quizzes are actually quite thorough and help prepare for exams. if given the chance, I would gladly take another class with her."
2889,1877880,4.5,2.0,Ivy is very good at explaining complex economic principles in a simple and understandable way.  She is very friendly and easy to talk to.  Her discussion section compliments the lectures very well.
2890,1877880,4.5,3.0,I had Ivy as a TA for Professor Elzinga's Econ 2010 class. Her discussion section was very helpful and she was able to clearly explain difficult concepts. Her quizzes were reasonable and her grading was fair. I am very glad that I took the class!
2891,1877880,3.5,4.0,"Huang is a nice lady.  This class is hard because there is so much to learn, but she explains them step by step.  However, she goes pretty fast as there is a lot to cover so it is better to prepare yourself by going over the textbook before the lecture.  Overall, a pretty rough course."
2892,1877880,4.0,3.0,Professor Huang is a great teacher. She explains everything thoroughly and well. The only complaint I have is that she sometimes tries to rush to get things in before the class ends - that can lead to confusion at the end of the class.
2893,1877880,4.0,4.0,A relatively hard course but she is very clear in teaching and very helpful in the office hours
2894,1877880,4.5,2.0,"She's very nice and helpful if you have questions.  The material is a little dry but I found her slides extremely helpful.  You don't have to read the textbook since her slides cover pretty much everything.  The first midterm we weren't allowed to use cheat sheet, but the second midterm and the final we can bring a cheat sheet along."
2895,1755007,5.0,1.0,"I almost cried the last day of class because I didn't want it to end. This class was super fun and interesting. You could get away with skimming the readings. Weekly online posts were pretty simple; tests were easy; discussion was boring. Lecture was awesome, though. She showed great videos and really taught me some useful things."
2896,1755007,5.0,2.0,"Really nice professor! The course is interesting and fun, especially when you get to the later topics which are less theoretical. Attendance isn't mandatory at lectures (but participation is part of your grade for discussions so you have to go to those) but the tests are based off her powerpoints. Definitely recommend!"
2897,1755007,5.0,3.0,"LC is super nice, and care for student's performance. Her class is interesting and not that hard. You can learn a lot from both her sociology experience and class"
2898,1755007,4.5,2.0,"Used to teach at W&L. Super nice. Easy to follow powerpoints. Material is straight forward. You have to go to discussion and class. Discussion is part of your grade, and she doesn't post powerpoints on collab. Make sure to do all the readings. It's kind of a lot, but she uses all class material for the tests. Tests are predictable and reasonable"
2899,2615170,4.0,2.0,He is really knowledgeable about linguistics but his lectures can be a little boring. Takes forever to grade homeworks but the TA will usually be very accessible and can help.
2900,2615170,3.0,3.0,"I took this class Fall 2020 while it was online. Prof. Mirzayan is a visiting professor, and it seems he was not ready for so many students online. He is a sweetheart and loves going on tangents, but his lectures can go off topic quite a bit. He only could do a handful of HW assignments and a final paper, and is terrible at returning grades quickly"
2901,2615170,1.0,5.0,"The lectures are so aimless, the professor essentially just lists facts about the topic but it does not follow a consistent lesson plan or tie any of the ideas together. Yet you are expected to understand the topics like there was a clear curriculum or expectations were set at any point ( which they are not)"
2902,2402179,5.0,3.0,"Tyler was the best TA ive ever had, he inspired to become a better human being. I hope one day to be half the man Tyler Ludwig is"
2903,2402179,1.0,5.0,"Tyler Ludwig was probably the worst TA ive ever had. He constantly makes awkward jokes that no one laughs at, and berates people for asking questions. I don't think he fully knows how to read or write and I don't understand how he became a TA"
2904,903049,1.0,1.0,"Despite being a well cited professor, his lectures are usually a babble of incoherence. I am absolutely shocked by his lack of knowledge of certain books on the topics of cognition Not to mention the blathering contradictions in his content. Would not recommend, felt like I learned nothing."
2905,903049,2.0,3.0,"Wow this professor is a boring lecturer. It shocks me sometimes how poorly structured his lectures are in relation to his slides. He does record his lectures, which is very helpful, but listening to them is painful. There is no homework (only readings) and your whole grade is tests. He is a nice guy but lectures are so so boring."
2906,903049,4.0,4.0,"Turkheimer is the man. This class is kind of confusing and the material is hard to follow, but the curve is pretty generous and its not that hard to get a good grade if you go to lecture."
2907,903049,2.0,4.0,"Although the tests are mostly MCQs, questions and options are worded badly and he tests about random things- I personally never know what he is going to test for and by extension, what to study for. Lectures are amazingly boring and I honestly do not know what I have learnt after a semester of this. Just don't take it."
2908,903049,3.5,2.0,Turkheimer can be a bit boring in lecture at times but it's only made worse if you keep telling yourself it's boring. Tests seem a bit random at first but then you understand his style and know what to study for. Textbook is actually interesting & I didn't mind reading it. TAs are friendly and helpful too!
2909,903049,3.5,2.0,"I liked this class though the first half was certainly more interesting than the second half. I kept wanting to like Turkheimer though he said some things that became self-fulfilling prophecies like ""it will be hard to stay off Facebook"" -- well, *now* it is. The MC tests are not as easy as you think they will be."
2910,903049,1.5,3.0,"No personality, unorganized and lacks coherency--as reflected in his lectures and exams. Focuses too much on Freud and includes random ?s on his MC exams (lowest score you can drop) that come from his disorganize PPTS. He never fully covers any material that you are still expected to know for the exam. Take with some other professor!"
2911,903049,5.0,3.0,LOVED This class! Turkheimer was very helpful and made class engaging! One of the best classes I have taken at UVA.
2912,903049,4.5,1.0,Interesting. Explains everything you need to know very clearly in class. Main terms and concepts from the reading end up on the test but not too much.
2913,903049,5.0,1.0,"I don't know why anyone would have a problem with this class. If you're conscious during lectures the points are spelled out for you very very clearly. Those who don't do well in this class do not belong in college. He's a nice guy and lectures, if you have interest in psychology, are interesting."
2914,903049,2.5,3.0,"Not a great lecturer - though interesting, lectures were disorganized and didn't cover all the slides in his powerpoint (but you're still expected to know them). Tests are always mult. choice & always ask details that you wouldn't think to study. Seemed lazy but very nice. I only recommend this if you really like psych - don't take for an easy A."
2915,903049,1.5,4.0,"Probably the worse teacher I've had here. Came to class late very often, with no lecture planned. Got let out early more than once. Lectures were unorganized, unplanned, slides were from 2006, and his tests were bogus."
2916,903049,4.5,4.0,This has been my favorite class.  Mr. Turkheimer is super cool and keeps things interesting.  I want to take more classes from him.
2917,903049,5.0,1.0,"He's a very nice guy. I can tell he's passionate about his work and agrees with Freud in a lot of ways and focuses on him a lot. The class is easy, read the book (which is really good) and go to class and you'll do great!"
2918,903049,4.0,2.0,Very nice teacher. makes his lectures interesting (If you cant handle talk about sex dont take it ;)readings are interesting. exams are average and pay attention to lectures.
2919,903049,2.0,2.0,Pretty ironic actually: a personality teacher with no personality. Talks too much about sex and when lecturing you're never sure what will be on the test. Though if you read the book (which IS really interesting) well you'll fine.
2920,903049,4.5,3.0,I love this class! He is a very funny guy and his tests are more focused on his lectures. The book is not that hard to study so I think you can get a good grade if you just pay attention in class. Lectures are enjoyable! I'll definitely recommend this class!
2921,903049,3.5,4.0,He talks a lot about Freud and not enough about other psychologists. Some topics were irrelevant. Exams were between 29-45 multiple choice questions = each is worth almost 1% of your grade. Meanwhile he says longer personality tests are a better sample of personality- that would apply well to exams. Especially when he asks trivial questions.
2922,903049,3.0,2.0,"His tests focus more on his lectures than the book, but it's  good to read the book anyways. Definitely bring a laptop to class if you want to write down what he says...he talks pretty quickly and I don't know how people without laptops took decent notes."
2923,903049,4.5,2.0,"I enjoyed this class a lot; it started out a bit dry, but got pretty good. Turkheimer is very engaging, and when he felt a lecture scheduled in the syllabus was too dry, he would just change it. A very good teacher overall."
2924,903049,4.0,4.0,"Turkheimer is pretty cool guy- his lectures are pretty interesting and good to listen to, although I have fallen asleep a few times here or there.  Some advice- READ THE BOOK!!  His tests come from the book and his lectures.  Exams are hard, but 240 is a worthwhile class."
2925,1009549,4.5,2.0,"Jing is hilarious. There is a language barrier at times, but she will explain information repeatedly until it is completely clear to the entire class. She teaches to the test and there will be very few surprises overall. I am not a math person at all, but found her class entertaining and easy because of the way she taught."
2926,1009549,2.5,1.0,Funniest teacher ever. Are you happy with result&#63; ARE YOU HAPPY&#63; Hilarious. Fantastic teacher. If you get her be sure to give her a high five at some point. It'll be the best experience of your life.
2927,1009549,2.0,3.0,"Her accent makes her difficult to understand at times, and theres often a language barrier in asking questions.  She mostly teaches through examples on the board, and makes rather frequent mistakes.  The class isnt really hard, but unless youve taken calc before, try to get into a different section"
2928,1009549,4.5,1.0,She tries to explain everything so that everyone and i mean EVERYONE in the class understands. Also her office hours were really helpful.
2929,1009549,4.0,1.0,"Even though english is her second language, it doesn't really get in the way of her teaching although sometimes there are some funny awkward moments with communication. Jing's accent is adorable."
2930,1009549,2.0,4.0,"Jing's lectures are a complete waste of time, because she only goes over the examples in the book - you can do that yourself. She also moves very fast, and her accent makes her difficult to understand. She also tended to make mistakes on the board. The homework that she gives from the textbook is easy to do; however, the webassign that she gives me"
2931,296858,4.0,3.0,"Professor DeVeaux is an entertaining guy, and the textbook (that he wrote) is beautifully done. It's definitely not an easy A, though. The listening portions for the midterm and final exam are tricky, especially if you don't have a musical background. DO NOT wait until the last minute to listen to the material - it takes time to absorb what's"
2932,296858,4.5,3.0,"Professor Deveaux is by far the kindest professor I've met at UVA. Go to him if you have any problem, even if it doesn't have to do with class. He actively looks out for you. Go to his office hours for help with assignments- readings aren't always clear but he is. Make him your best friend if you're a music major! He's the music DUP (look it up)."
2933,296858,4.5,2.0,Deveaux is by far the best professor I have had at UVA. His lectures are very entertaining and he is hilarious. He mixes in lecturing with playing music himself in order to keep you interested. The tests are not too difficult but you do need to read the chapter outlines and go to lecture. Definitely take this class!
2934,296858,4.5,4.0,"I had History of Jazz with Dr. DeVeaux 23 years ago, and it still stands out as one of the best classes I took at UVA.  I'm rating him now because RMP did not exist when I was in school, and the music I learned about in his class was life-changing for me, even though I was not a music major.  Thank you, Dr. D., for making the last 23 years richer!"
2935,296858,4.5,2.0,Deveaux teaches with his old powerpoints he's very familiar with. He gives cool piano examples to help the class understand what he's saying better. Read the textbook (which is basically all his powerpoints are on) & you'll do fine. Listening can be a bit tricky for beginners but not impossible if you keep up with them too. I enjoyed this class!
2936,296858,4.5,1.0,"Deveaux plays the piano during class and gives tons of musical examples. The tests have a listening and history portion. The history is easy if you memorize his powerpoint. The listening wasn't too bad either and my highest musical experience is middle school orchestra. You also have 2 papers, but I also had some help from the TA, so it's not bad."
2937,296858,4.0,2.0,This class was easy if you studied hard. I enjoyed listening to the jazz music and the discussions were helpful and not too bad. The papers were a little difficult but the tests were not very hard. Good class overall. I recommend it if you are at all interested in music.
2938,296858,4.5,2.0,"DeVeaux is remarkable. He has incredible passion, energy, and knowledge that he always brings to lecture. His tests are not too difficult; a few of the listening questions can be a bit ridiculous, but overall they were fair. He is truly one of the best professors at the University."
2939,296858,4.0,1.0,Proessor Deveaux is the bomb.  Go to lectures and you'll learn everything you need.
2940,296858,1.0,5.0,"Hard class, the description saying musical background is unnecessary is false.  He has unfair grading, and unfair tests."
2941,296858,3.5,4.0,"Interesting class.  a little difficult if you dont know anything about jazz or music, and requires a lot more studying.  tests can be difficult.  great professor, really goofy and plays the keyboard a lot during class to explain things.  essays and concert reports definitely boost your grade because the exams are somewhat hard.  overall , loved it."
2942,296858,4.5,3.0,Deveaux is great at teaching you the material without it ever getting boring. He includes tons of videos and sound clips throughout his presentations that really make them fun and interesting. he is also funny when he plays the piano for you.
2943,296858,5.0,2.0,"DeVeaux is a funny, enjoyable professor. He knows the material well and is brilliant at teaching. I recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in jazz...it takes in-depth exploration through the history of jazz, from New Orleans Jazz to Avant-Garde Jazz and Fusion. You'll learn about many different artists and songs."
2944,296858,4.0,4.0,"Prior musical experience is needed or, at the very least, makes the class much easier as listening examples are on each test. Great lecturer. Obvious he loves his topic. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and learned a lot."
2945,296858,5.0,3.0,"Took this class to knock out some requirements, was way better than what I was expecting.  Deveaux is very clear about what he wants, and he tries to make things as clear easy as possible.  Definitely take this class.  Obviously some musical background will be helpful, but not at all necessary to appreciate what is being taught."
2946,296858,3.5,2.0,"great class for people with musical backgrounds and an ear for different scales, individuals' tonality, and eras of jazz.  Don't have to come to class or even read the text book consistently.  beware if you don't have a good ear for music patterns or identifying particular instruments amongst the mess."
2947,296858,4.5,4.0,"Obviously, there's an advantage to people with a good ear for music, but a lot of the material is still based purely on the history and facts. Overall, if you put in a solid amount of work into this class, you'll do fine. I love jazz, so I got a lot out of it, but I was admittedly lazy at times and didn't do as well as I'd liked because of that."
2948,296858,4.5,4.0,"Deveaux is a decent professor, considering I had no previous knowledge in jazz.  However, don't expect to not work, especially if you're not familiar with musical terms.  The class overall was quite interesting and instructful in basic music.  The material becomes dry later in the semester, but Deveaux has good power points."
2949,296858,4.0,3.0,"funny guy and always available to help, even via email. it takes an effort to familiarize yourself with different jazz styles, but you end up learning a lot just by listening. even the professor recommends taking it as credit/no credit, unless it is to fulfill a requirement, i would definitely do so."
2950,296858,2.5,4.0,"I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this class if you have no musical experience or a good ear for distinct music styles.  LIstening on exams count as 40%, and all exams are cummulative.  I would say jazz-lovers would enjoy this class, but I completely regret it, and it turned out to be my lowest grade - total GPA downer."
2951,296858,4.5,2.0,"Great class overall He is passionate about the subject matter, sometimes brings live bands into class for demonstrations. There are 2 midterms and a Final, and 2 papers. All three are MC and are EXACTLY from the powerpoints. The only difficult part were the listenting portions (about 40% ) of each exam. TAs make or break the class--get Joe or Sara!"
2952,296858,3.5,1.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this class.  I only took it to fulfill two requirements, but it was much better than I was expecting.  The exams were straightforward and easy, lectures weren't too boring, the professor was nice and sometimes funny, and I really learned a lot about a genre of music I previously had no interest in."
2953,296858,4.5,2.0,"Scott DeVeaux single-handedly reawakened my interest in music, and turned me on to a genre that I had previously ignored.  His lectures are fairly by-the-book, but he still makes the material interesting.  The hardest part on the tests are the listening examples.  As said before, I would not take this class unless you have some musical background."
2954,296858,5.0,2.0,"If you have no music background, the class seems somewhat overwhelming at first. But his exams are fair, they're taken straight from his powerpoints. If you are good at memorization or just sweet like me, you'll find it easy to pick up even if you know nothing about music. The papers are tougher than the exams mainly because the TA's grade them tou"
2955,296858,4.0,3.0,one of the classes I've enjoyed the most so far. Deveaux is such a cool guy! a must take if u're interested in jazz
2956,296858,4.5,1.0,amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2957,296858,4.5,1.0,"I loved this class - Deveaux is a little out there sometimes, but always hilarious. Coursework is light (if you come to lecture you don't need to do the lecture readings), and the tests come right from his ppts - its basically memorization. However, if you have no music background, you might find it hard"
2958,296858,1.0,4.0,something about talking while playing music made it difficult for me to understand a single thing he was saying.  More interested in name dropping all the legends he's had the priviledge to meet.
2959,296858,4.5,1.0,"Probably one of the best classes I've taken at U.Va. Deveaux knows so much about the subject and it really shows when he plays random examples during class to help you understand the underlying technical aspects of the music.  I DEFINITELY recommend this class to anyone interested in jazz! So good, SO easy!"
2960,296858,4.5,2.0,"this class is definitely perfect for you if you have taken at least band is middle school and remember what notes are.  otherwise, if you read you should do fine. easiest class test-wise I've had so far... just do the reading and remember it well- you should get a good grade.  don't listen to anyone who said this class was bad.  it's awesome!!"
2961,296858,4.0,1.0,If you know anything about music and especially jazz the class should be a breeze. Go to 2 concerts and write a page on them and 2 other short papers. Exams are easy though and all the info from class he puts up on the website as power point slides. You really don't need more than the slides. Readings are short and only important for discussion.
2962,296858,5.0,4.0,amazing class.  i recommend it highly.
2963,296858,1.0,4.0,"Don't take the class. He's an odd and weird guy who in recent year, has made it his purpose to make the class difficult instead of intersting.  People worry about this class likes its Organic Cheminstry instead of enjoying the music like they should be."
2964,296858,3.5,4.0,didn't lie but didn't tell the whole story
2965,296858,4.0,2.0,"Class could be boring, especially since we found out later he would post all of the slideshows, but material was fairly interesting and tests were alright.  Easy non-western perspective though."
2966,296858,3.5,2.0,"I had some prior musical technical knowledge but no real knowledge of jazz, and I'm looking at a probable B in the class. It isn't too hard, but requires a lot of out of class work to learn the musical styles and textures."
2967,296858,1.5,5.0,prof. deveaux makes jazz inaccessible and incomprehensible to the non-musician.  Two five-page papers and concert reports don't help either.
2968,296858,2.0,4.0,Deveaux is aweful.  His crusade to make History of Jazz a hard class ruins the appeal of jazz music.  Spends first 3 weeks solely on technical terminology.  I can't understand how he relates to jazz -- he's old and stuffy; nothing like the dynamic musicians he decribes.
2969,296858,3.5,1.0,"This class is not hard if you spend any time studying at all. Lectures are sometimes boring but his quirky personality and passion for jazz add interest. So, he has a few problems with organization and technology. It was an intersting class and he is a helpful professor."
2970,296858,4.0,3.0,"Great professor--he's not a teacher who the average student will understand or relate to, but for the more quirky student, I definitely recommend this course and professor."
2971,296858,1.0,5.0,"Think it's easy, guess again.  I took this 3 years ago now and he has made a lot of changes since then, but this class was my worst grade at UVA and really just turned my interest in jazz into hatred."
2972,296858,2.0,5.0,"like everyone has said before, you have to have music experience or be very interested in jazz, b/c it is very difficult to try and listening and determine which kind of jazz it is if you have no prior knowledge.  he doesnt really attempt to teach you the difference either."
2973,296858,1.0,3.0,not good
2974,296858,2.0,4.0,"As the last person says, if you have any musical knowledge, it's easy.  If you don't it's hard as all get out.  But then again, I have a little knowledge of music, and it's still hard as all get out."
2975,296858,5.0,1.0,"this class is an Easy A if u know ANYTHING about jazz.  wouldnt recommend it to ppl who dont have any prior musical knowledge.  notes are clearly displayed on powerpt, test questions taken right from them.  listening selections also on tests, again, not hard at all if u know anything about music."
2976,296858,2.0,3.0,Not a good professor. Stay clear of him. His teaching style is one of the worst. Its basically 50 minutes of straight note taking. Cant explain stuff any.
2977,296858,5.0,3.0,"Despite having difficulties with computers, Deveaux is a great professor.  Each lecture was worth my time in one way or another, either for educational value, entertainment, or both.  The course can be a little more difficult if you don't have music exp. but it's still a great one to take."
2978,296858,5.0,1.0,My favorite class.
2979,296858,2.0,4.0,"The man is a nut.  Spends the first 10 minutes of class trying to get the &quot;technology&quot; to work--the TAs get frustrated and end up doing it for him.  Kind of makes class funny.  Lectures are nebulous and circuitous.   Despite common belief, the class is NOT EASY!"
2980,296858,2.5,1.0,Deveaux circles the airport in his teaching method.  I cannot determine whether his complete ineptitude at powerpoint or the useless course packet was his greatest flaw.  Musical experience is a huge benefit to this course; this made this course one of the easiest 'A's I've ever received at UVA.
2981,296858,1.5,3.0,"I would NOT recommend this course to other students.  Upon enrolling in this course, I was under the impression that &quot;no prior musical knowledge/experience&quot; was needed as a prerequisite for the course.  I was sadly misled, as nearly 50% of the exams are listening (which immediately presents a disadv"
2982,296858,2.5,3.0,"Ok, this man was obciously born before computers.  He has serious issues with powerpoint and finds the best method of fixing them to be talking to himself.  Overall, everybody thinks this class is easy, I think no.  However, excellent way to do nonwestern perspectives."
2983,296858,5.0,1.0,AWESOME
2984,296858,4.5,2.0,turned borderline jazz fan into bonafide jazz lover. he really loves what he teaches and it shows; he's also funny without even realizing. Great TAs (especially Jeff Decker) and good class overall.
2985,296858,4.5,1.0,Easy and interesting. Take for Nonwestern perspectives req.
2986,296858,4.5,1.0,"Very good teacher, very interesting (and easy) course."
2987,296858,5.0,1.0,"Yes, this class is easy. Very worth it. It is not difficult to prepare for the tests at all. READ HIS WEBSITE NOTES. The course packet is of minimal importance."
2988,296858,3.5,2.0,"Good teacher, knows his stuff and subject is interesting. Class isnt that hard, tests very straight forward. It's worth taking for the non-western persp. and fine arts requirements, or just credit/no credit."
2989,296858,4.0,1.0,No Comments
2990,296858,3.5,2.0,"I'm not a big fan of jazz, but Deveaux managed to make the class fairly interesting. The tests are pretty straight forward, and the class has ample resources online to aid in studying."
2991,1214376,5.0,1.0,Very fun and easy class. Professor Shelat was very enthusiastic and engaging in class. All work was very straightforward and simple. As long as you follow the directions you are guaranteed a 100 and maybe extra credit. One of the best professor in Northeastern by far.
2992,1214376,1.0,4.0,He goes through the material quickly and seems like he wants to show off how smart he is rather than actually help us students learn.
2993,1214376,1.0,5.0,"The class has an unreasonable amount of work, especially for an elective class. Projects are lengthy and take a ridiculous amount of time and effort to complete. There are weekly quizzes that are more like problem sets. Expect to spend hours staring at a command line and reading error messages in Linux. The pace of the class is extremely fast."
2994,1214376,3.0,4.0,"I took CY2550 at Northeastern with Abhi. He's really smart and cares about his students a lot, but can tend to be somewhat scattered in lectures and the presentations he reads from are pretty disorganized. His grading policy is very generous and he makes the course interesting. If you don't come in with linux experience its gonna suck"
2995,1214376,3.0,5.0,"If you define a smart person as someone that goes through material really fast and leaves out many small details in explaining complex subjects than this guy is really smart, you can't take that away from someone that has degrees from Harvard and MIT.  I would only recommend taking his classes for students that have strong fundamentals in subject"
2996,1214376,2.0,5.0,"This class required A LOT of work, but if you have the time to go to multiple office hours and have a study group you can do the homeworks with, you can do well. Unless you are especially good at algorithms, I would recommend that you take this class ONLY if you are able to go to a majority of the office hours and have a group to work with."
2997,1214376,3.0,5.0,"My first time failing a class. If you don't like working with others then you need to be pretty genius at this stuff to get by. Weekly, four-question homeworks that take hours, even if you're working with a group. To his credit, he tries to make it clear, but the material is absolutely nightmarish. Hint: know your logs and run-times going in."
2998,1214376,5.0,5.0,"Algorithm was the hardest and yet most interesting class I have ever taken at UVA. The problem sets were challenging and took forever to think up solutions and even more time to type it up in LaTeX. However, I learned a great deal about the subject matter. Definitely recommend for those  who want to challenge themselves and learn about algorithm."
2999,1214376,4.5,5.0,"Don't know what these ppl are talkin about.  By far the best class in terms of what I've gotten in return: real-life problem solving skills. Shelat is hard, rigorous, and really pushes his students, but if you make an effort to learn the material, he'll ace you.  Truly cares about his students."
3000,1214376,3.0,5.0,"Certainly one of the most challenging classes I have taken at UVA.  Professor was fairly new and inexperienced at teaching, but improved dramatically, showing he cares about doing a good job unlike some professors.  Assignments must be done in LaTeX, which is worthwhile to learn if you're going to grad school.  May be better at teaching crypto."
3001,1214376,3.5,5.0,"Very challenging class. If you really like computer science, you will enjoy it at least to some extent and should do well. As others said, the tests are very hard, but his grade assignments at the end of the semester are reasonable. Using the textbook helps a lot and it's important to keep up with the material."
3002,1214376,2.0,5.0,Intentionally makes his class harder than &quot;typical&quot; algorithms courses because he wants to challenge us.  Not what we need 5th semester.  Very good at explaining things in complicated unclear ways.  Hopefully he doesn't teach this class again since it's required.
3003,1214376,1.0,5.0,"I wanted to give him a zero rating but RMP wouldn't let me. Horrible, never again."
3004,1214376,1.5,5.0,He gave us a mid-term that he knew was too hard...and then nobody finished. This class has been a nightmare. Avoid at all costs.
3005,739246,3.5,2.0,"I took his crime fictions class and it was amazing! The material he chose was great and the discussions we had in class were great as well. As others have said, he is a stickler for grammar. However, his close attention to grammar and eagerness to help those understand their grammatical errors helped me improve my writing. Take a class with him!"
3006,739246,4.5,3.0,"Holsinger is incredible. Leads discussions well and constructively, fair grader, eloquent speaker, sense of humor, and really nice to look at. He really knows his stuff but is open to a lot of what students have to say. Very approachable too. He IS a stickler for grammar/mechanics so proofread closely. Take any class with him! He's great!"
3007,739246,4.5,4.0,"Holsinger is brilliant. An excellent lecturer, and outlines his lectures ahead of time, which is refreshing. The reading is manageable and incredibly interesting, and he is incredibly personable. He came to my discussion section just see how things were going. He is also prompt if anyone has further interests concerning anything covered in lecture."
3008,739246,3.0,3.0,He is entertaining and really tries to keep your attention but can get a little off topic and vague with slides...write fast. It is a fun class and he is hot; plus you have to take the class as an English major
3009,739246,4.5,4.0,"holy hell, this man is hot! of course, being brilliant tends to up the hotness factor."
3010,739246,5.0,3.0,Hot and brilliant--class a bit disorganized at first but better as the semester went on...
3011,739246,5.0,4.0,Extremely smart; good at leading class discussions.
3012,739246,4.0,2.0,"Pre-modern music was a very interesting class.  Holsinger's lectures were always good, and the readings were great."
3013,739248,4.5,4.0,"Had him years ago, and even though I have long since left Renaissance Lit., he still stands as one of the most influential professors I have ever had.  An absolute genius.  If he appears disorganized, that's probably because your brain can't keep up with his.  Not sure anyone's can. Comments on papers were candid, insightful, and often  full of wit"
3014,739248,3.5,2.0,"best professor i had at UVa - brilliant, disorganized, but go TALK TO HIM especially about his comments on papers.  really knows all the subject matter he teaches, and cares about it deeply.  don't expect a linear train of thought during class; if disorganization bothers you, he's probably not the professor for you."
3015,739248,1.0,2.0,"Do not take a class with him! Dante is probably one of the most interesting texts to read...but he hardly talked about Dante at all and read from pretty much every other book in the middle ages (that we weren't reading!). Painful, painful class."
3016,739248,4.5,4.0,"Best professor I've had at UVA.  Classes are small- no attendance policy means only interested people show up.  The lectures are worth going: brilliant, but disorganized.  He's best with grading papers, he takes time to really consider what you're saying, and comments extensively.  Sees through BS and pandering- don't parrot his lectures in papers."
3017,1951673,4.0,2.0,"Peter is very chill. He doesn't seem to prepare material for his lectures, but he is very approachable. He will answer any questions you have, and he is not trying to destroy your grade. He's a pretty easy grader, but the Spanish department requires that you obtain a 96% to get an A. "
3018,1951673,4.0,1.0,He's a very nice guy and an easy professor.
3019,1951673,5.0,2.0,"The class is very easy, partly due to the material and to him being an easy professor."
3020,976825,5.0,2.0,"Couldn't have asked for a better Spanish teacher my first semester. More than any other professor I've ever had he really wants us to succeed. Instead of trying to weed us out, he wants us to understand and love the language as much as he does. He grades very fairly and is available in office hours to answer grammar questions on papers."
3021,976825,4.0,3.0,Pedro is great. Highly recommend his Texts and Interpretations class. Do the readings the night before and be prepared to discuss with classmates and speak up from time to time. Most of the tests/quizzes were take homes and very easily graded. Essays are easy too. Readings are interesting and easy if you look up translations. Take this class!!
3022,976825,4.5,1.0,"Pedro is an awesome professor. I learned so much about Spanish literature, and it was even fun!"
3023,976825,4.0,2.0,"Pedro is an amazing instructor. He's very knowledgeable about history, languages, and literature. Very enthusiastic about the subject. I wasn't much of a fan of literature, but I actually enjoy this course! You'll learn alot, and it's definitely worthwhile."
3024,976825,4.5,3.0,really awesome prof. totally recommend him.
3025,976825,4.5,1.0,Pedro is an amazing teacher. He is very knowledgeable of the history of literature as well as all of the material we cover in class. Just make sure you read before class and speak at least once a day and you'll do fine. Be sure to show up on time because he takes attendance every day.
3026,976825,5.0,4.0,"So nice, really great teacher."
3027,976825,5.0,1.0,Pedro is extremely helpful and clears things up in english if no one in the class understands what he is saying (even in 202).
3028,976825,5.0,3.0,Pedro is a great professor.  He is extremely helpful and really cares about making sure you are learning.  He isn't too difficult.
3029,976825,4.5,1.0,"At first, I was intimidated by Pedro the first day of class because I had never had a spanish teacher from Spain before but my opinion soon changed. Pedro is incredibly helpful in class as well as on test material. My test grades definately improved from SPanish 201 to 202. Pedro really wants his students to perfect the language."
3030,1935295,5.0,3.0,"Willa is a GREAT TA for WGS 2100. She makes discussion fun and interesting, fosters great conversation, and gives very detailed feedback on papers. I would 100% recommend taking a class with her! She's a really cool person too :)"
3031,190402,4.0,4.0,"I took ENGL 2500 as a non-major, but it was still pretty accessible. Lots of papers, lots of reading, but Prof. Tucker is good about understanding the workload and meeting you where you're at. Enjoyed the class and what I learned but definitely wouldn't consider it easy. Biggest downside was short turnaround on papers and reading."
3032,190402,5.0,4.0,He is a tough but fair grader and always willing to help. He wants you to do well in the class but will give you the grade you earn based on the quality of your work. He is very good at explaining the deeper meanings and themes of the novels we read.
3033,190402,4.5,5.0,"A truly brilliant person and an excellent teacher! I would hesitate to suggest this class for non-english majors, but he is an absolute MUST for those in the english department. He challenges his students to think deeply, and is quick to award credit where due, but can also be brutally honest, which is quite refreshing!"
3034,190402,1.5,5.0,"For a 1000 level class &quot;designed for non English majors&quot; this class had more work than a 2nd writing requirement and an inhumane amount of reading, 200 pages and a short essay due on a Sun night and assigned Fri night was a common thing. Tucker has no sympathy for students and doesn't respect medical notes from CAPS. Lectures boring and pointless."
3035,190402,4.0,5.0,"He is absolutely brilliant, a genius. Speaks as if he is reading aloud a Jane Austen novel and can mimic every accent known to man (try Scottish!). He is an excellent professor and extremely knowledgeable; that said, he expects you to work -you will get out as much as you put into the course, and he is a tough but fair grader. You will learn a lot."
3036,190402,1.5,5.0,Impossible grader.  I suggest having significant background in lit classes.  Be well-versed in the readings.  Difficult.
3037,190402,4.5,4.0,"Tucker is an amazing professor. He is extremely intelligent, quirky, funny, and endearing. He picked great material for our class and is extremely knowledgeable. Very blunt and honest which is really refreshing. Take his class!"
3038,190402,5.0,5.0,great person
3039,190402,5.0,4.0,"One of the best teachers I had at UVA. Gives copious comments on papers and sets a high standard... so if you're doing good work, you'll know it."
3040,190402,2.0,4.0,"I was hoping the ratings below were exaggerated, but sadly they are not. Tucker talks in lofty language not easily understood by undergrads, much less grad students. In addition, his grading is impossible. To top it off, he is useless in office hours. You must go into his class well-versed in the topic in order to have a fighting chance."
3041,190402,2.0,4.0,"Professor Tucker undoubtedly knows his stuff but he's a very hard grader and his classes are all about what he likes and doesn't encompass all that needs to be known. He's in love with poetry so don't think alot of prose works will be read. Not really helpful in office hours either. I say, if you can take another professor, do so!"
3042,190402,2.0,4.0,His lectures were all about how smart he could make himself sound.  I got very few good notes from his lectures so most of my learning was from reading the poems themselves.  Very smart but not very accessible.
3043,190402,4.0,3.0,"Tucker is a genius of English literature. His lectures are understandable and fascinating and he is adept at facilitating discussion as well. His insight and mastery of the English language breathe life into the readings. If you love English, you'll love him."
3044,190402,4.0,5.0,Good professor.
3045,190402,5.0,3.0,"Tucker is absolutely AMAZING!!! Very intellectual and versed in literature/English, not too hard of a grader, gives very good feedback on papers, and is not averse to complimenting students on a job well done. He definitely brings out the best in students and makes students better writers. Very interesting and worthwhile class!!"
3046,190402,4.5,3.0,i can see how he comes off this way (full of himself and inhumane) but he's really a real person.  just dances to the beat of his own drummer.  very detailed feedback on papers and quick to congratulate you if you do happen to do something smart/right/original.  he seems to bring out the best in students intellectually.
3047,190402,2.5,5.0,"Knows a lot (basic requirement for a prof), but so full of himself that the benefits that could be gained from his class are low. Zero ability to empathize humanly, zero intellectual ability to listen to others' opinions. Too busy coming up with big words to use.  Should be locked in a library writing books, an ivory tower, not in a classroom!!!!"
3048,190402,2.0,3.0,"okay, so I was super excited for this class, then the guy gave me a C on a paper with no explanation just the arbitrary letter.  YEt, the shakespeare usem was sooo much fun, and thank God for his wife!!"
3049,190402,2.0,5.0,"Very smart but not a nice person, which actually does count for something.  So if he's giving a lecture, great.  But if you need some help from him personally, forget it."
3050,190402,5.0,3.0,"I did an independent study with Prof. Tucker.  Awesome professor and great person -- is nice, but not coddling, really encourages you to challenge yourself."
3051,190402,3.5,2.0,Great speaker-- I bet he would be great at lecturing.  Sometimes tended to dominate discussions.  Very helpful about giving advice a/b papers when I went to see him in his office hours.
3052,190402,5.0,4.0,"Thanks to Tucker's lyric poetry class, I enjoy teaching poetry to my high school students.  He taught me poems are fun."
3053,190402,5.0,3.0,Tucker is simply one of the best speakers around.  He is a brilliant man and has terrific insight in all areas of literature.  I make a point to never miss his lectures.
3054,296900,1.0,4.0,"Feldman is one of the worst professors I've ever had. She knows her stuff, but is obviously more interested in teaching students who share her knowledge, i.e. if you don't know as much as her, then you probably won't do well in her courses. I have taken 2 of her classes and wish I had never had the misfortune."
3055,296900,1.0,5.0,Professors like Feldman are the reason that the humanities are hemorraghing jobs and students. They have a lot to say but prefer destructive criticism to constructive criticism whenever possible.
3056,296900,5.0,3.0,"Professor Feldman is one of my favorite professors at UVa. She is very engaging and really pushes you to think more deeply about poetry. She's fantastic to meet with outside of class, too. Definitely take her class!!!"
3057,296900,1.0,5.0,"Feldman inspired me *not* to become an English teacher. She disregarded my original comments, but made a lot of my less sophisticated prose. She silenced me a few times during class and didn't stop another student from making ad hominem attacks towards me."
3058,296900,1.0,5.0,Feldman damned me with faint praise on a letter of recommendation that has been questionably cited to me by several interviewers after I had put in a lot of hard honest work for her course. I gave her a resume and she couldn't believe I did several of the things I actually did on my resume. Small imagination.
3059,296900,4.5,2.0,"Professor Feldman helped me decide to switch from Neuroscience to an English major! The woman is incredible, leads great discussions, really knows her poetry, and is always open to new ideas and interpretations. Can grade a little hard, but is not out to KILL you -- put in the time and effort and you'll love her!"
3060,296900,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Feldman knows her poetry. Although she assigned a lot of writing, the work load was not unbearable, and as long as you made a good effort you will be fine. She is also extremely willing to help you outside of class, in particular on papers and such. Overall, she is a very nice woman. I would take a class of hers again."
3061,296900,3.5,3.0,"Very knowledgeable about poetry and literature in general. However, sometimes she can make you feel a little dumb, although she doesn't mean to. Class discussions are really deep and thought-provoking, but all the writing is murderous. Take this class only if you're really into poetry and are seriously contemplating majoring in English."
3062,190405,3.5,3.0,"Can shock you with your first writing assignment grade, but if you follow her instruction for improvement you can make it to the A-range for papers. Her tough grading improves your writing immensely. She may seem a little odd, but she's nice and has some great ideas and really helps you to dig deep into the subtext. Recommend for English Majors."
3063,190405,2.0,4.0,"Not very helpful to students, classes are very slow and little is learned. Unapproachable and cold, I enjoy the material of the class very much but feel the exact opposite way about this teacher."
3064,190405,4.5,4.0,"Six years out of college, Prof. Lofgren is one of the few teachers whose lessons I still use. Take this class if you're looking to whip your writing into shape, but don't be proud -- everyone has something to improve, and she will find it! Lofgren will humble you, but she'll also help you. Brilliant mind, too."
3065,190405,1.0,5.0,i agree. She is weird. seems very cold and unapproachable. Makes you nervous even talking to her. she kinda ruins the subject. i would avoid the class if possible. you have a 50/50 chance she'll either love you or hate you. if she hates you (based on 1st impressions) good luck
3066,190405,2.0,5.0,"She is AWFUL. I can't believe she has gotten fairly good reviews. I am an english major and can tell you out of all the professors i have had, she is the worst. Her grading of essays is so subjective and arbitrary. She hands out a 3 pg checklist designed so she doesnt have to give anyone As. Her comments are negative. YUCK"
3067,190405,4.5,1.0,"Took this class just for fun and it was well worth it.  Great selection of plays.  The discussions were sometimes intimidating, about 5 people participate on a regular basis.  Lofgren is exceedingly intelligent which is nice.  The papers aren't hard if you write clearly and concisely and have an interesting thesis."
3068,190405,3.5,5.0,GREAT teacher. really hard grader on papers but greatly improved my writing. lots of work but worth it. her class was sometimes extremely boring but the plays were fascinating and discussion was really interesting if you put effort into it. take her!
3069,190405,3.0,5.0,"Classes are boring but she is enthusiastic- outside of class,though, a totally different person. Very critical of your work and sometimes makes writing papers even harder. She knows her stuff though."
3070,190405,5.0,4.0,"Lotta Lofgren is one of the best professors I have ever had. She has gotten me interested in reading and writing plays. She structures her class very well and clearly. She allows you your own creativity in the final project/essay. Class isn't easy but she gets you to learn and think about the literature. She's great, a great prof!"
3071,190405,5.0,4.0,"very intelligent. i was surprised that she was so focused on the structure of our writings.  she's one of those professors who whips ya to get into shape, and you really end up thanking them at the end. awesome woman outside of the class. friendly, helpful, but also difficult."
3072,190405,4.0,3.0,clear analysis of plays.  a bit bloodless.  the focus is definitely on literature rather than performance.  I feel like she decided my grade before even seeing my work.
3073,190405,4.5,4.0,"well, i geuss the class is a little boring, and in truth, had i posted this a month ago she would've gotten the big thumbs down. But after personal experience with her after the first paper was handed in, i really started to look at her differently; she's a great teacher, ready to help. super intelligent too...knows what the plays are about."
3074,190405,3.0,4.0,"The class is great if you love drama. She's extremely knowledgable about the subject which helps class discussion.  Her affect is strange--she's not cold, but very disconnected.  It's somewhat offputting.  But still a great class!"
3075,190405,1.0,4.0,boring and vindictive
3076,190405,5.0,4.0,"This woman gave me my first C on a paper ever, and I'm still thanking her to this day.  She was the first and few that pushed me to really WORK on my writing instead of just &quot;getting by.&quot;  She took the time to teach me how to think more critically in my writing and cut the crap.  Thank you, Lotta."
3077,190405,5.0,3.0,"I don't know what these people are talking about...everyone in my class LOVED her and thought she was one of the most intelligent, respected, and most helpful teachers we've had."
3078,190405,2.0,3.0,boring and uninterested in the material
3079,190405,2.0,4.0,unenthusiastic
3080,190405,5.0,1.0,No Comments
3081,534474,1.0,2.0,"Professor Kaiser, although a very nice person, did not provide a syllabus until a month into the course and then did not even remotely adhere to the syllabus. We only had two graded assignments: one paper and the final. He also liked to hear himself talk and spent every class talking without caring if anyone understood the concepts."
3082,534474,1.5,3.0,"Nice guy, but what you should try to avoid: to trust him!"
3083,534474,4.0,1.0,He's a nice man. He cares about his students. At times he gets a little carried away and talks too much. He's really easy going. I would recommend him
3084,534474,3.5,3.0,"I love this class and Voker Kaiser; quite frankly, the reason people dislike it is because the material is over their head.  Take this class if you are intelligent (almost extremely so); if not, then yes, you will be bored and confused.  I think this class is wonderful; it is my favorite this semester."
3085,534474,1.0,2.0,"honestly, this was the worst class ever and i changed my concentration after taking it."
3086,534474,2.0,1.0,"EXTREMELY BORING. Nice person, but a terrible professor. I advise: do not take his class."
3087,534474,2.0,1.0,"As stated below, he talks more than he should, and does not answer questions. Don't take the class unless you have to, because the subject matter is pretty intimidating. He is a very nice man, and welcomes visits during office hours, even if you dont want to see him. I didnt think Id do well in the class, but he's an easy grader. Class is confusing"
3088,534474,1.0,3.0,"He KNOWS he talks too much, but he doesn't seem to care. He doesn't properly respond to questions, and he almost always holds the class late."
3089,534474,2.0,3.0,This man loves his own voice and will blatanly ignore your attempts to speak out.
3090,534474,5.0,3.0,he was a good prof.
3091,534474,3.5,3.0,No Comments
3092,534475,4.0,3.0,"While extremely knowledgeable in many disciplines, Hudson prefers her students repeat what she has taught rather than come up with their own ideas. Yes, she is nice. Yes, she is smart. Yes, her opinion is law. But, I do feel I learned from taking her class."
3093,534475,4.0,2.0,"I had Hudson for both 301 and 311 - she is very approachable, writes thorough comments on your papers and gives you a chance to re-do them, class isn't too hard as long as you pay attention to what she says and take good notes to use in the papers, the final is pretty easy and reading isn't usually too intense"
3094,534475,2.0,4.0,"I felt I had realistic expectations going into this class.I have always gotten an A in German by doing the work .That was not the case-no matter how hard I worked on the papers,I always ended up w/ a B/B+.She def wants u 2 regurgitate her thoughts &I found myself grinding my teeth in class bc shes very irritating.Nice woman,bad teacher."
3095,534475,2.0,3.0,"I really didn't like Frau Hudson's 301 German class. Unfortunately, both 301 and 311 are required for the major and she teaches both. She is a nice woman but only wants to hear her own lectures repeated to her in papers and does not respond well to differing opinions. Lectures were confusing and very hard to follow at times."
3096,534475,3.0,3.0,"I am not a fan of Frau Hudson's. While her mandatory &quot;editing&quot; can be helpful, the class is structured like Freshman English, which is insulting to the level of students she teaches and certainly to the literature. She's disorganized, a terrible lecturer, and makes reading the best writers a chore."
3097,534475,4.5,4.0,"I'm a big fan of Frau Hudson's. My understanding and comfort level w/ German literature really grew a lot from taking her class. She was very clear in class, very interested in the material, and eager to help outside of class. No intimidation. If you're a German major, def. take one of her classes."
3098,567245,2.0,4.0,He is a smart guy but often says incorrect &quot;facts&quot;. He made a few ignorant/rude comments and for that reason I wasn't crazy about the professor. I liked the class because of the readings he chose and the way the discussion was set up but i would recommend turning the final paper in early to have him look over it.
3099,567245,3.5,5.0,"Great guy who really cares about the intellectual well beings of his students but he's a HARD paper grader. Class consisted of 2 reading exams, a class presentation & 2 paper 8-10 pages. He encourages class discussion & gives good feedback through out. He does however tally the times each person speaks each class so beware if you dont like to talk."
3100,567245,5.0,2.0,"Portmann taught this religious studies major seminar on Ritual. Great guy, very nice and understanding. Encourages GREAT discussion in class. Readings are interesting. His classes normally consist of 3 small reading exams, a presentation on one of the readings, and a final 15 page paper. Great class. I'd encourage students to take anything by him."
3101,567245,3.0,5.0,"Intelligent professor, very approachable.  Class structure is a bit different with 50% of your grade coming from the final exam.  No term paper."
3102,567245,4.5,3.0,"John Portmann = awesome.  He is a great guy - the goal of the class is to form your own opinion, not to regurgitate material.  class is interesting, thought provoking, discussion driven - I LOVED IT."
3103,567245,5.0,2.0,"Awesome guy!  He really cares about his students.  His classes are open discussions.  He values everyone's opnion, and wants to make discussions interesting.  Most of the readings are very enjoyable as well."
3104,567245,4.5,2.0,He is very kind and good at engaging the material. Encourages class discussion and offers interesting insight into the matters discussed in class. Very approachable.
3105,567245,5.0,3.0,"this class was amazing.  discussions were fantastic (portmann is unbiased and very skilled at discussion facilitating), the reading load was heavy but always interesting, and portmann is a kind guy, too.  for me the only downside was coming out of the class painfully critical of how i think about things."
3106,567245,5.0,2.0,"This class was wonderful. Portmann is a great professor. He is very approachable and seems to really care about his students. He assigned a lot of reading, but none of it was too difficult and the discussions were great. If you're looking for a course with lots of fun discussions that generates interesting ideas, take a class with Portmann!"
3107,567245,3.0,2.0,I REALLY enjoyed this class.  Prof. Portmann makes the class really interesting.  Not too much work.  Highly recommended :)
3108,567245,4.5,2.0,"Professor Portmann is very popular: he's funny, the reading is easy(ocassionaly long, but on a 10th grade level at most), and he lets the students do the talking. If you wanta professor who focuses on &quot;actual religion&quot; rather than &quot;popular religion&quot;, then take another. If you want an A for talking about who's on the cover of People, take this one."
3109,567245,5.0,3.0,The best professor I've had at UVA. Great at facilitating discussion. He makes sure to guide the conversation but makes sure the students do most of the talking.
3110,296913,4.0,3.0,"Professor D'Errico is a super nice guy who tries his best to make class fun. Class is almost entirely group work, so if your classmates are a little questionable like mine were, prepare to be doing the brunt of the work. His quizzes are confusing though because he never really explains what they're about. "
3111,296913,4.0,3.0,I loved having Professor D'Errico. He introduces you to a new writing style that can be tough to learn at first but eventually gets easier. He also gives good feedback and is willing to meet outside of class if you need more clarification. He also seems to genuinely care about his students.
3112,296913,2.0,3.0,"Does not make much sense when lecturing. His assignments and quizzes also make very little sense. Had absolutely nothing to do with the course I signed up for. Very nice man, tries to make class fun but just does not understand how to simplify things and teach efficiently."
3113,296913,4.0,3.0,"Great professor who really knows his stuff, but he can be a bit hard to understand if you are not an English major. He will work with you if you want to do well in his class."
3114,296913,1.0,4.0,Assignments and expectations are IMPOSSIBLE to understand. Grading was NOT objective and his reasoning was extremely hard to follow
3115,296913,4.0,3.0,"I had Prof. D'errico with Prof. Greg Coloumb and he is the lighter of the two, a little softer spoken and a little less harsh on some of his lessons. He is very helpful however and the two know what they are doing."
3116,296913,5.0,2.0,Nice sense of humor.
3117,1148891,5.0,2.0,Professor Gerrans was a great chem teacher. Will miss him!
3118,1148891,4.5,3.0,Very Good!!
3119,1148891,1.5,4.0,He's a very smart and lucid Chemistry teacher. He helps students who find it hard. He keeps class alive by showing cartoons of scientists and funny comments here and there. He is the teacher built to teach CHEM 141/142!
3120,1148891,4.5,3.0,Extremely organized and lecture notes are crystal clear.  Quizzes aren't terrible but you need to study.
3121,1148891,5.0,3.0,"Take orgo with Gerrans! His notes are very clear and he's always willing to help if you're confused.  The class is not a breeze, but what you learn is invaluable.  Comparatively, orgo with Burnett was too simple and rather uninteresting. Go to class and you won't need to read the book."
3122,1148891,5.0,3.0,Best teacher I have ever had.
3123,1148891,5.0,3.0,"Gerrans is an excellent professor whose notes and lectures are crystal clear and easy to follow. his notes are extremely organized, and he is available outside of class for extra help. great for gen chem too."
3124,1148891,4.5,5.0,"Like a lot of students, I was worried about orgo at the beginning of the semester. Yet after I took practice quizzes, attended lectures, and spent time studying the lecture notes, my work really paid off. Although orgo is a difficult class, it was reassuring to know that with time and effort, it was not impossible."
3125,1148891,4.5,3.0,"Good professor, quizzes weren't absurdly hard but if you didn't study a solid amount you could get below the class average. Had really helpful TA recitations and gave out previous quizzes, although they were always much easier than the actual tests. Good professor, definitely the best one but it didn't seem to me like anyone of them were superb"
3126,1148891,4.0,3.0,gerrans is a great professor--the best out of the gen chem teachers at UVa.  His quizzes are easier than the other professors quizzes and he's just an awesome guy.  it's too bad he's not teaching next semester :(  take him and you won't regret it!
3127,1148891,4.5,3.0,He is an awesome lecturer and professor. Take him and you will not regret it. Much better than metcalf and grisham from what i heard.
3128,1148891,5.0,2.0,He is so cute and enthusiastic!  His South African accent is adorable and his notes in class are very organized and easy to follow.
3129,1148891,4.0,4.0,"His classes can be a little boring at times, but he's really helpful when you go and talk to him. I once bubbled wrong on a quiz and when I talked to him about it and showed him my work, he gave me the benefit of the doubt and gave me my points back! It's a huge class, but when you talk to him one on one, he really seems to care about his students!"
3130,1148891,3.0,2.0,"For the 2008 year, Gerrans has been the easiest of the three chem teachers (Metcalf is the hardes, Grisham in between).  His quizzes are the easiest of the three, but keep in mind they are curved, so you are competing against others.  He is a pretty good teacher, but you can probably get most of it if you read the book."
3131,1148891,3.5,5.0,"Like others have said, he is no Harman.  However, Gerrans does give notes and presents the basics in class.  Read the textbook, go to office hours, and do practice problems to really understand the concepts."
3132,1148891,4.5,2.0,He is no Harman but Harman doesn't teach first-years anymore so boo. Do take him over Metcalf and read the book! Specimen quizzes don't really give good idea of real quizzes. Go to office hours too and he will do any problem you give him.
3133,1148891,3.0,4.0,"Tough not to fall asleep -- he's really boring. When I did manage to get to class and also pay attention (rarely), he did explain things clearly though. Absolutely take Harman for 141, he's sooo much better."
3134,1148891,4.0,3.0,"He's a pretty good teacher. Shows you EXACTLY what to take notes on. You'll be writing notes ALL class, so get a notebook big enough. Tests are better than Metcalfs. Never had Harmon, but I hear he's better."
3135,1148891,4.0,1.0,Very clear and straightforward professor.  Known to be easier than the other chemistry teachers.  I'd say you can't go wrong with Gerrans.
3136,1148891,5.0,1.0,Extremely helpful! You must go to his office hour!
3137,1148891,4.0,1.0,Not GREAT but very clear about things you need to know for exams. It's hard to stay awake at 9am to copy off from transparencies though since he's a bit boring...i heard he has easier quizzes compared to the other 2 lecturers though. Funny accent.
3138,1148891,4.5,2.0,"Gerrens methodically covers the material, explaining everything you need to know for the quizzes. His accent is really fun to listen to."
3139,1148891,5.0,4.0,Professore Gerrans is a good teacher with a great accent but very boring. The class is so large that coming to lecture is almost pointless and sleep always ensues during lecture. The quizzes are fair and adequately test one's knowledge of chemistry.
3140,1148891,4.0,2.0,"He is a good teacher; however, he doesn't have powerpoints which means 3 pages of notes everyday. It's not too hard as long as you put in a little effort."
3141,1148891,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor!  His notes are incredible!  He makes it easy to succeed in his class if you work hard and study his notes.  Although orgo was difficult, I am so glad I took it with Gerrans."
3142,1148891,3.5,2.0,"boring, but a good teacher. quizzes come from lecture so go to class. love the accent!"
3143,1148891,4.0,2.0,"Gerrans is a only a decent lecturer, but he's a very nice guy who is very helpful to students (go to his office!). Tests are fair and test important concepts without requiring specific memorizations. However, I had more success simply watching Thinkwell tutorials rather than going to lecture. Take Harman if available, but take Gerrans over Metcalf."
3144,1148891,4.0,2.0,"This guy sucks compared to Harman, his accent put me to sleep every class, he's not funny either. If you like copying overhead notes all class then he's your guy, i don't take notes however.  Got an A+ in 141 and 142 (its possible if you stop taking notes and try to understand the concepts), he's alright, not as cool as Harman though."
3145,1148891,3.0,5.0,"Orgo Chem is no joke...especially the second half. If you don't understand something ASK! Correct your tests within two days after you get them, and review your notes a little bit everyday. Trust me. This will save you a lot of heartache throughout the semester. By the way, the multiple choice are what will hurt your grade."
3146,1148891,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Very organized, nice, and helpful. Tests are hard but fair. Do optional problems and study his notes & Oxtoby carefully."
3147,1148891,3.5,4.0,"Nice guy with a cute British accent. Chem 141 is a killer, whoever you have. Supposedly Gerrans is one of the lesser evils. Quizzes are VERY specific.   If you have to take this class, take it with Gerrans or Harmon. If you don't have to take this class, then definitely don't take it."
3148,1148891,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher; he presents his lectures very clearly with handouts and examples. However, being the weedout course that it is for premeds, this class is not easy. Halfway into the semester, I stopped going to class. The information in his lectures is chem you learned sophomore year, but his quizzes are extremely tricky and often irrelevant."
3149,1148891,3.0,4.0,"Chemistry sucks. BUT, if you must take it, GET GERRANS. He has a sense of humor and has a british accent. I know that has nothing to do with his teaching, but he is the cutest old man i have ever met. But seriously, hes a good/clear teacher, and fair."
3150,1148891,5.0,4.0,"If ur going to take Orgo, take it with Gerrans. U don't need to read the book to do well. All u need are his notes, the recommended problems, and practice tests. The curve is also a big help. Tests are consistent (12 multiple choice, 3 free response) and if you've had him before he's almost predictable. Much better than the other 2 professors!"
3151,1148891,4.0,4.0,"Really boring lectures, about 1/4 of the class came on Fridays.  He's helpful during his office hours, but his quizes are pretty random and requires you to read the questions very very carefully.  I recommend taking him since the other two proffessors seem to be worse."
3152,1148891,4.0,2.0,Gerrans gives fairly easy tests if you know the material and do the practice tests.  His lectures are organized and easy to understand.  Often lightens up the class with an amusing transparency.
3153,1148891,5.0,3.0,"People who say he's really hard didn't study enough. His tests are based a lot on your actual understanding of the material and his class notes, though it does help to do the problems in the book for practice. He's also very approachable and helpful at his office hours."
3154,1148891,5.0,3.0,"Prof Gerrans is a very good proffessor, and man, are his notes the best or what.. definitely take hmi for your 142/141, he'a awesome, but study well for the quizzes, he might make them tough once in a while, and i love his accent. His flaws are only that he's a lil bad with electronics, but who cares.. he rocks"
3155,1148891,5.0,4.0,Prof. Gerrans is wonderful.  I was intimidated at first because i came into his class with a very weak background in Chemistry and a lot of my classmates took AP or IB Chem.  But that's ok because Gerrans is very clear with his lectures and I love this class.  It's challenging if you haven't had chem already but an A is definitely obtainable.
3156,1148891,1.0,4.0,EWw.... He uses his transparencies - but they don't help for the quiz - quizzes&#63; nothing from the lecture or thinkwell hw problems or from the old quizzes... i didn't like this class... the only way to succeed is if you learned a lot from high school
3157,1148891,4.5,2.0,Love the accent! His lectures are very clear and I hardly ever need to read the textbook. Do the homework and the practice quizes and you should be fine!
3158,1148891,5.0,2.0,"Incredibly organized, clear, knows exactly what he's covered in lecture - to succeed, you must read the book and lecture notes well - sometimes tells funny stories to spice up the lecture"
3159,1148891,4.0,2.0,"Read the book. Do the practice problems from the syllabus. That's all I'm saying. If you base your entire studying on lecture notes, you will be in poor shape for quiz time. I got an A- BECAUSE I did the practice problems. Take the time. Do them."
3160,1148891,3.5,2.0,Uses transparencies.  Tests are mostly based on things covered in class.  Cool accent!
3161,1148891,4.5,2.0,Gus is my boy. ive had him for 2 semesters and ive joyed him right from the beginning. he is very clear and on the whole the quizzes are very fair. IF YOU DONT WANT TO ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK THEN TAKE GUS. i never read and got an A- in the class. be sure to visit him at office hours- hes a really sweet old man.
3162,1148891,1.0,5.0,"you can think you know the material, but once you get to the quizzes it's like wtf&#63;!"
3163,1148891,2.0,4.0,"What he goes over in class is very deceptive, along with his problem sets, the quizzes are different and require you to learn more than what he is teaching."
3164,1148891,5.0,3.0,He is without a doubt the best Chem 141/142 teacher there is.
3165,1148891,5.0,3.0,Gerrans is amazing.  A must-have for Chem 141/142.
3166,1148891,3.0,3.0,nice guy but i didnt learn anything from his lectures. specimen quizzes were very decpetive and did not cover what was eventually on the test! has a great TA though and she is very helpful. i learned everything from thinkwell and linh (the TA)
3167,1148891,3.0,2.0,"Incredidibly boring lectures.  Prior to this class I wasn't aware that a teacher with an accent could be monotone.  This entire year I have learnt nothing, the reason I did not fail is due to my IB chemistry class.  If you can, avoid Gerrans at all costs."
3168,1148891,3.0,4.0,Lectures=boring.  I taught myself most of it from memory of high school. Sense of humor=not funny.  Supposedly better than other professors.
3169,1148891,4.5,3.0,"I LOVE GERRANS!! extremely fair, fabulous/clear lectures, cool accent. really is a great man and amazing professor"
3170,1148891,4.5,2.0,"cool accent and real nice guy.  class can be real boring, mostly sleep through his lectures, but he takes his time and doesnt rush through material so that all the students can understand.  probably best of the 3 chem prof, i would def take him again."
3171,1148891,4.5,3.0,"Fair (but sometimes difficult) tests, doesn't rush through material, explains it clearly, and a nice man. Really, just look at the number of students signing up for his Chem class in comparison to other available section b/c that says it all."
3172,1148891,3.0,4.0,gus is hard
3173,1148891,4.0,2.0,Professor Gerrans is a sometimes boring lecturer but makes up for it with his accent and his humor. A must have!
3174,1148891,5.0,3.0,"Gerrans is a very nice man and really helpful during his office hours. He really tries. Lectures can be really dull but what do expect from organic chemistry. Tests are hard but fair, study your notes and do the practice tests because they really help you prepare."
3175,1148891,5.0,3.0,"I love Prof Gerrans!!! I took his 141&142, 241&242. He reminded me of my grandpa. =) His lectures were very clear. He's kind and was always there to help. All his 141&42 tests were multiple choice and orgo was a mixture of multiple choice and short answers. Try hard and you should be ok getting B or above in his class."
3176,1148891,5.0,2.0,"I have had this for all my chemistry. He is really clear. Forget any other professors if you have a choice to take him. Though do not mistake him for easy. It is easy if you understand his very easy explanations, which even a snail can understand. He is funny, and relates chemistry to outside work."
3177,1148891,5.0,3.0,"Papa G is the best chemistry teacher out there.  While his tests may seem hard, they are quality tests - they only test you on what you need to know.  Also, he is EXTREMELY clear and a wonderful professor."
3178,1148891,4.5,3.0,No Comments
3179,1148891,3.5,3.0,"out of the rest of the chem department, he is the easiest to follow in lecture.  plus, he has a south african accent so that isn't so bad.  he is tricky on his tests but gives old ones with answers to practice."
3180,1148891,4.0,3.0,"Gus is the clearest chem teacher here, period.  Not only is he clear, but he allows you to drop a test which reeeally helps.  But people looking into taking his class solely because a portion of it is multiple choice unlike other professors', beware: It isn't easier at all.  MC hurts you in orgo."
3181,1148891,3.0,3.0,"his intro chem class isn't that easy. youll have to work hard. second exam, average was a 61. ouch. everyone says he lectures slow, but how many times are you scrambling to take down notes before he switches gears&#63; his accent is sweet, but it'll put you to sleep. alas, i recommend his class."
3182,1148891,5.0,4.0,"You WILL have to work hard in this class, but Gerrans is a clear, friendly, funny teacher.  I found the book to be very clear also, so staying ahead of him in the reading will help you understand his lectures a lot better.  Let's you drop 1 of 4 tests which is veeery helpful."
3183,1148891,4.0,3.0,"He goes over material slowly, so people can get a good grasp on it.  However I find that the quizzes usually have something that we didn't cover well or didn't show up on the posted past quizzes.  He does hold a lot of office hours and review sessions to help you though.  Overall a good professor."
3184,1148891,4.5,3.0,"Covers lecture material slowly, but not always in a way that will help you on the quizzes.  If chemistry isn't your favorite thing, there are lots of options for extra help."
3185,1148891,3.5,4.0,"i didn't find him to be as easy as everyone else did, i actually did much better with bryant in 141 than with gerrans in 142, i felt like his quizzes contained a lot of off-topic material, but i did find the final to be easier-i got a 95 without much preparation :)"
3186,1148891,5.0,1.0,He is famed to be the clearest teacher and to have the easiest tests--great combination!
3187,1148891,4.5,1.0,Gerrans provide very clear examples and logic for this class.  The tests are easy if you go to class and read the book.
3188,1148891,4.5,3.0,"I am going to be a chem major and I have had this professor for all my chem so far (141/2 and 241 and going to take 242). He is NOT easy; however, the way he covers the material is ever understandable even to a snail, which makes it easy. If you dont try understanding the material, it's hard!"
3189,1148891,5.0,2.0,Easiest Intro Chem teacher.
3190,1148891,5.0,4.0,He's one of the best I've had here. He writes up his lectures on the overhead so you can follow along without stressing out about missing stuff. Great teacher!
3191,1148891,4.5,3.0,He's extremely clear in his lectures and they're really worth going to. I learned a lot simply by copying down what he wrote on the board. His tests are fair and well-balanced.
3192,1148891,5.0,2.0,"Really good lecturer, clearer notes than the book.  If you go to class and go to office hours, you will do well in the class.  Get to drop one quiz, unlike other orgo professors."
3193,1148891,2.0,4.0,"boring, i've had good chemistry teachers, he is NOT one of them go find one who is"
3194,1148891,5.0,3.0,Definetly the best out of the chemistry professors. He is easy to follow and understand and writes everything out on overheads. (Plus he has a cool accent)
3195,1148891,4.5,2.0,soo much better than some of the others. very clear and easy to understand- speaks slow enough and is organized. does random cute/funny things. tests are based on the bk and his lectures (doesnt throw in crazy ques like the others)
3196,1148891,5.0,3.0,He's a real nice guy. His lectures are clear and his quizzes are okay. You still have to do alot of outside prep on your own but overall he is really good. Has lots of office hours and is willing to help!
3197,1148891,1.5,4.0,"often talks off subject, throws personal political views into lectures. what he recommends to study does not show up on quizes."
3198,1148891,4.5,1.0,He's good. Take him if you want chemistry in simple terms. And he's easy ... very easy (no tricky test questions.. only things he teaches and the sort of examples he does appear on test) Funny at some times..
3199,1148891,4.0,3.0,Boring but apparently the best.  All notes are on an over-head.
3200,1148891,5.0,4.0,"very friendly and easy to talk to, explains best out of all available professors"
3201,1148891,4.0,3.0,"Go to lectures, take notes, read the book, keys to success"
3202,1148891,4.5,2.0,No Comments
3203,1148891,5.0,3.0,Agree with bellow.  Good notes and lecture though a little bit slow.
3204,1148891,4.5,2.0,"although he writes EVERYTHING on the overhead, if you study his notes you will do well in the class"
3205,1148891,5.0,4.0,"decent professor for 141/151, great professor for 241, very clear, nice guy"
3206,1148891,2.0,5.0,No Comments
3207,2140126,5.0,3.0,"Terrorism & Political Violence is one of the best classes I've taken at UVA. Potter is a master of the subject, and he explains things so clearly in engaging lectures. Exams are a bit of a time crunch, but there are never any curveballs. Just do the readings, pay attention to his lecture slides, and you will be fine. I wish I could take this again."
3208,911342,5.0,1.0,I LOVED Justin.  He ended up writing a letter of recommendation for me.  Class and readings were super easy and enjoyable for the most part and lectures were very beneficial.  The subject matter was intriguing and Justin only added to that.  Great teacher- MUST TAKE COURSE!
3209,911342,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING. He is one of the best Professors in the department. Readings are reasonable and VERY interesting. He really knows what he is doing. He is clear concise, his lectures connect and make sense. He has great organization and knowledge of the subject. Grade Distribution: Two non-cumulative test, two reading guides, participation, Final paper."
3210,911342,4.0,3.0,"This class kept me sane during this past semester.  It was engaging, taught at a good pace, and thought-provoking about how groups are stereotyped based on race and ethnicity.  Grading consists of attendance, two tests, and a final paper."
3211,1525747,4.5,1.0,jeff has a great way of explaining thisngs
3212,1296382,5.0,1.0,"She's so nice! She seems pretty shy though and discussion can sometimes be very slow. Compared to my roommate's ENWR, Ms. Sandberg's seemed much more relaxed with the final portfolio being optional and a few movies throughout the semester. Readings were pretty lengthy but with only two classes per week, it wasn't too bad. I'd recommend this class!"
3213,1493001,4.5,4.0,"Clarens is a great teacher! He gives a lot of practice problems in class that are somewhat confusing but help a lot. He also takes in a lot of imput from the class which is great. Amazing guy, good/great teacher."
3214,1493001,2.0,3.0,"Clarens is a goofy,  entertaining professor but has a difficult time explaning math based problems. He gives lots of practice problems in class but doesn't explain how to do them. He just gives out long complicated equations which are very hard to manipulate. The tests are not easy to study for because a lot of specific material is not covered."
3215,1132557,4.0,3.0,"The Professor was very knowledgeable in German History given his background.  The in-class portion was entertaining and fun at times, however, It is a very heavy reading load with equal papers.  He is fair in his grading and willing to look over papers prior to the due date.  I would recommend this very highly to assure the best grade possible."
3216,1132557,5.0,5.0,"Amazing lecturer, great sense of humor. Not an easy class and a ton of work, but enjoyable nonetheless"
3217,1132557,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful, best teacher and one of the best people I have ever met. He is always there for you both in and outside of class. If you ever need help he is always just a phone call away. He is a very engaging lecturer who makes even the most boring topics interesting. Make sure to speak frequently and stay off your phone."
3218,1132557,4.0,3.0,Professor Mock is an amazing teacher who sincerely cares for his students. You can tell he loves the subject and what he's teaching. There was a lot of reading but all of it was relevant to the class and discussions.
3219,1132557,3.0,4.0,"Good guy, gets off topic a lot and can be spacey. MUST READ TO DO WELL"
3220,1132557,5.0,3.0,"Harolds a great teacher. His enthusiasm is contagious, making each and every one of his students truly invested in his lesson. I really enjoyed being in his class"
3221,1132557,5.0,3.0,Harold is a nice guy and a great teacher. He is open minded and always willing to help. I wasn't interested in the topic at first but he really makes the class fun. I think compared to other ENWR classes there is more reading but it's easily manageable.
3222,1132557,5.0,3.0,Harold is a great teacher. I wasn't really interested in the topic of the class at first but i ended up loving the class. There isnt much reading and he will definitely help you become a better writer. He's also more on the lenient side so that's not so bad either
3223,1132557,5.0,3.0,"Great guy, incredibly enthusiastic. Discussion is not particularly demanding and usually very fun. You'll learn how to write a good paper by having him as your TA."
3224,1656849,4.5,1.0,Best TA Ever
3225,428055,5.0,3.0,"I adored having Beatley, he is so passionate about what he's teaching and truly made me consider going into urban planning. While he records all lectures, it is not necessary to go over each one as a lot of the content is repetitive. Final grade is made up of two exams, which are just memorizing terms, and a paper that you have months to work on."
3226,428055,4.0,1.0,Beatley is a very cool guy and passionate about this subject. Took this class as a non-architecture major and enjoyed it. Graded on two tests and one big paper so give yourself time to do it. The tests are basically memorization as well. No need to attend lectures or do the reading if you don't want to. Just memorize and work on the paper.
3227,428055,4.0,2.0,Dont buy the books. I didnt read one chapter and did well. He gives you study guides for the midterm and final. You also write one paper. I got a B because I didnt do that well on the paper. He is a great lecturer. Hes passionate about teaching intro level classes. The content of his class is interesting and every lecture taught me so much!
3228,428055,3.0,3.0,"You can tell he is a genuine guy, but his lectures are very boring and not very helpful. Tests are pretty easy, graded fairly difficult. Make sure to give yourself plenty of time for the big paper. Only take this class if it is a requirement, otherwise, you won't get much out of it."
3229,428055,4.0,1.0,"Tim Beatley actually has some very interesting lectures and uses a bunch of unique examples (which show up on the exams). If you show up to them and are half awake, you should do fine. Textbook is unnecessary."
3230,428055,3.0,2.0,"No need to buy textbooks or do any of the readings unless you want to. He gives out a review guide that covers most of the tests, but going to class can help with understanding the bigger concepts not on the review guide. Beatley is clearly very passionate about planning, which makes some of the lectures fairly interesting."
3231,428055,3.5,1.0,"Easy class - hardly went. Don't buy the textbooks. If you attend class and pay attention, you will do great. If not, you will still do well if you study on your own. Many study guides on quizlet from prev yrs helped. Paper, midterm, final are fairly easy. He's a cool guy, but the class is so lax - can be super cool though and interesting material."
3232,428055,3.0,3.0,"Awesome guy, just not the best professor. Class topic is interesting but lectures aren't so much. Only 3 grades, two tests and a large paper. If you attend class and study, no problem, otherwise study smart. Great for ARCH majors."
3233,428055,1.0,5.0,Do not take his class. He makes an interesting subject and turns it extremely boring.
3234,428055,4.0,1.0,He's very passionate about the subject and it's easy to tell through his many somewhat unrelated stories. No need to do the readings. The exams are relatively easy and the paper is graded fairly easy too
3235,428055,5.0,1.0,Beatley is a wonderful professor. He is passionate about his field and truly cares about getting his students to love it too. The material is very interesting and had me considering a transfer into the A-school.
3236,428055,5.0,1.0,Wonderful professor passionate about urban and environmental planning. Shares lots of anecdotes and photographs.
3237,428055,3.0,2.0,"Good material but a very hard class to sit through.  Only take this class if you are really interested in the material, it is not an &quot;easy A, take for fun class&quot;.  Books are definitely not needed and only helpful if you want to learn on your own"
3238,428055,2.0,1.0,"Probably one of the most boring classes I've taken- I ended up thinking it was a waste of time.  The material is very interesting but the professor really does not organize in a way I could understand.  I ended up doing none of the reading-- and it did not matter at all.  Overall, boring."
3239,428055,4.5,2.0,"The class is very interesting. I learned so much. His knowledge of the subject is extensive and comprehensive, and it's really easy to follow along. If you come to class every day and pay attention (taking notes is encouraged, maybe not totally required), you will ace the course. Fun, interesting, good class."
3240,428055,4.0,2.0,"This is a very interesting class and Beatley knows all there is about sustainability. However, because he knows so much, he ALWAYS runs out of time. Not kidding: EVERY CLASS!! And if you go talk to him one-on-one, he'll talk you to death. That said, I am extremely glad to have taken his course and I learned a lot. Do the reading and enjoy!"
3241,428055,4.5,1.0,Probably one of the best professors here at UVA.  Both Plan 103 and 553 are great classes.  He sparks a lot of interest in the subject.  I would recommend either class for someone even slightly interested in the subject.
3242,428055,4.0,1.0,"PLAN 103 is not a hard class at hall and Beatley doesn't try to make it difficult.  He's definitely long-winded but that doesn't detract too much.  You can skip lectures a fair bit and still do fine in the course, as long as you've done a bit of the reading.  He provides study guides for miderm and final, so anything you missed you can look up."
3243,428055,5.0,2.0,"Favorite professor! Very passionate about subject matter. Lectures are powerpoint (in the dark, can be easy to fall asleep) Good class for anyone, not just architecture."
3244,428055,4.5,1.0,"very nice teacher, his lectures can be kind of disorganized but he is good about focusing on what's important. gives a lot of choice for what questions you want to answer on midterm and exam. good class, not hard."
3245,428055,5.0,1.0,He is very interested in his subject and makes you interested.  You will get a new view of the world after this class.
3246,428055,5.0,1.0,interesting lectures about real life relevant material. is very interested in what students think and is very approachable and passionate about the material
3247,428055,5.0,2.0,"There is a direct correlation between the effort you put into this class and what you get out of it. As others have said, you can put very little in and still get the grade, but if you're interested in Planning, attend the lectures, pay attention, etc. and you will get a TON out of this class. Lectures cover case studies of cities."
3248,428055,4.0,1.0,You have to attend lectures or get the notes from someone.  Beatley has a good sense of humor.  I once announced during a lecture that I wanted to live as a hermit in the woods and avoid all urban planning.  He actually took me seriously.  I rarely went to lectures and got a B+.
3249,428055,5.0,3.0,one of the best professors here
3250,428055,5.0,1.0,"Interesting class, not too hard.  Beatley is very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject.  Recommended."
3251,428055,4.5,1.0,"It's an interesting class.  Some (or lots of the material) might seem like common sense, but when it comes time to review your notes for the exam youll realize you learned a lot.  This class is not demanding and Beatley is a funny guy.  Recommended."
3252,428055,4.0,2.0,"interesting course. went to 2/3rds of lectures, didn't study for final or midterm and wrote term paper in one night but still got a b+"
3253,1755159,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely LOVE her positive energy and ability to challenge what we say without ever coming off as disrespectful. She asks the kinds of questions that really make you think about assumptions you might not even realize you carry around. Her friendliness, sense of humor and clear intelligence make our 2hr 45min class fly by. Highly recommend!!"
3254,2320416,5.0,3.0,"Professor Davis is very entertaining and assigns interesting, inexpensive course material. He is easy to talk to and very understanding. The readings are not ridiculously long, and the writing is doable. It was a very low-stress class that I was always happy to attend. "
3255,2320416,5.0,3.0,never expected a writing class could be so much fun!!!!
3256,2320416,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Davis is a great choice if you are not the best at writing/humanities subjects but you try hard. He gives great feedback and will always give more if you ask. His ENWR class is a small step up from AP Literature 12 that you would take in highschool- if you enjoy analyzing short stories/ texts, it is a great class."
3257,2320416,5.0,3.0,super passionate and fun professor. gave great feedback.
3258,428066,5.0,2.0,I took EVGE 5850 (not EVSC2050) class with professor Macko in fall 2021. He is a very nice and humorous lecturer. Labs in this class were pretty fair and useful and could learn a lot from them. Sometimes he also gave real life problems. No exams in this class but there would be final paper and presentation in your final week.
3259,428066,5.0,3.0,"Took his oceanography class over the Summer in the UVA Advance Program and absolutely loved him. He is a great teacher, although he does go off-topic at times, however, his class is very engaging and is willing to answer all questions."
3260,428066,4.0,4.0,"Took the class this summer. The class is entirely based on labs and multiple-choice tests. There is a textbook and you need to definitely read it regularly. Tests are fairly difficult and refer to specific information. Grades are very curved though, so an 80 is an A. Labs are very tedious and tricky. Personally, I found them to be annoying and hard"
3261,428066,5.0,2.0,Go to class. Humorous teacher.
3262,428066,4.0,3.0,Dynamite professor. Lots of experiences. Grade on curve. Go to class and read the book.
3263,428066,5.0,4.0,"Do the readings, go to class. Fair grading scheme. You get to throw one test grade away. Tells lots of stories based on experiences."
3264,428066,2.0,5.0,"pretty hard class.. the only grades are labs and multiple choice tests. ALWAYS go to the TA's during office hours bc they give all the lab answers. The tests are VERY tricky, they mostly focus on random minuscule details and his lectures are unorganized and confusing. Just take the 4050, it has more grades so its easier and more room for error."
3265,428066,5.0,3.0,"Wide knowledge of the Ocean. Has lots of experiences to relate to. Gives ""pop quizzes "" for extra credit. Will find time to just chat. Go to class!"
3266,428066,5.0,4.0,Lots of Stories based on his experiences. Curved  grades. Go to class. Tests are based on information covered in class.
3267,428066,3.0,2.0,"Macko is a bit of an odd bird (but what EnviSci professor isnt?) but entertaining enough for a pretty boring subject matter. Labs are take-home and pretty easy, and his tests are all multiple choice and allow for extra credit. You will fall behind schedule, Macko will tell the same oceanography stories over and over again. Straightforward class."
3268,428066,4.5,2.0,"Good Prof, passionate about teaching."
3269,428066,5.0,2.0,"Great guy, Macko's got a heart the size of a small blue whale, which are not, in fact, small.  Take the class (2050 or 4050!) and learn cool stuff about the ocean. Macko's a pro, he's been doin it for ages!"
3270,428066,4.5,3.0,"Go to class, read the book. Grades on a curve."
3271,428066,4.5,4.0,good class. Go to class and do the readings= good grade
3272,428066,3.5,2.0,"It's important to do the reading because most of the test material comes straight out of the book, but it's interesting and not difficult to understand. The labs were tricky, but if you go to office hours the TA will give you the answers to all of the questions. There were several extra credit opportunities. Overall easy class."
3273,428066,4.5,2.0,"I took this class this past summer as my first semester. His class is challenging if you don't put time into it. Definitely make use of office hours, ask questions, read the book, and do the practice quizzes on his website. The labs can be tricky. He's really passionate about what he teaches. Super nice and inspiring."
3274,428066,5.0,2.0,"hard tests. labs useful, but easy to get an A on them- done outside of class"
3275,428066,1.5,5.0,"GET OUT OF THIS CLASS!!! There is a huge curve which makes the class GPA like it is, but the labs are hard and the exams are impossible. What he lectures about is not on the exam. It all comes from the book and the key terms he puts online. I worked my ass off on the labs and I still got an 80 average. Terrible lecturer."
3276,428066,5.0,3.0,"I took Macko's summer Oceanography course. The class was fun, and Macko is a great professor & person; he's also very helpful. Attendance isn't required, but you'll want to come to class because Macko's really engaging and he brings in interesting things. Pay attention in class, read the book, and you'll be fine. The labs & tests require thought!"
3277,428066,4.0,2.0,"Good Professor and fairly easy class. Lecture is usually pretty boring, but it isn't really mandatory. Tests are easy and fair."
3278,428066,3.5,2.0,"This class is a breeze. Tests are very easy. It can be quite boring, however. Attendance is not mandatory. Labs can be a bit tricky but if you talk to him he'll push you in the right direction. Take it, especially the 400 level class, its not much harder at all, just a paper at the end which is on whatever you want."
3279,428066,2.5,5.0,"Not as easy as people assume. Hard to pay attention.  Labs are really hard, too. Not a gut class! Least he bumps up your grade by a whole letter."
3280,428066,3.5,3.0,"I had trouble paying attention in class, but the material is pretty interesting. He sort of mumbles and rambles and there is hardly any structure to his lectures, but I still enjoyed the class, and Macko is a cool guy."
3281,428066,5.0,1.0,"Amazing teacher. Smart, funny, and genuinely one of the nicest people I have met."
3282,428066,2.5,2.0,"honestly, i don't see why so people like him. he's passionate but then he's boring at the same time. not too clear about what you should know for exams. the homework is absurdly hard and time-consuming. tests are not too bad though...i went to fewer than half of the lectures but still got an A... thanks to the study group before the final."
3283,428066,4.0,2.0,"Macko is a cool dude. He is really passionate about what his stuff and its easy to tell he loves teaching. His tests are a little tricky, but nothing a little studying won't get you through. Attendance definitely isnt mandatory, you can just read the book and get more info than the lectures will give you. BuT go to lecture, they're entertaining!"
3284,428066,3.5,4.0,"(Summer course) Nice professor, accessible.  Class was based too much on tricky multiple choice tests.  We had little chance to demonstrate our understanding of the material because of the way the tests were structured.  I like and appreciate Professor Macko, but I would not recommend taking this class in its current format."
3285,428066,5.0,3.0,"great class for summer...lots of info, good activities, very willing to clarify....reading, work, notes, tests all go together...makes for a well organized and relaxed class"
3286,428066,5.0,4.0,"215 & 415 are the same course, except 415 has more labs involved. MACKO is probably one of the nicest professors ever. His door is always open to students and he's very willing to help with anything. I've had him for the undergrad seminar and I work in his lab. Pay attention in class and read the book and you're golden."
3287,428066,5.0,2.0,"he scared me the first day, but man I love this guy. complete crazy looking, but AWESOME. LOVE HIM! I hate science and I loved his course. TAKE IT! YOU ROCK MACKO!!!!"
3288,428066,5.0,2.0,"Very kind hearted man who loves Oceanography and his students.  He presents the lecture material very well, and the book is fantastic.  You dont really have to do much preparation for tests."
3289,1271846,5.0,1.0,"Wonderful teacher, wonderful class section. Off-road baby strollers was a great project. He is enthusiastic, nice, and puts a ton of time and effort into the class."
3290,1271846,5.0,2.0,"Lays everything out very clearly, gives a detailed outline of what's coming on each exam, very nice guy. Uses words like &quot;mac-daddy&quot;. He's pretty much the man."
3291,1665065,4.5,3.0,"Approachable and articulate. He made class interesting with lots of random stories and facts, and really encouraged us to participate."
3292,1665065,5.0,3.0,"Jon was awesome. Heâ??s enthusiastic and approachable and easy to understand. He asks thought-provoking questions and gives interesting history facts that make his lessons very human. It also helps that he's really funny and down-to-Earth. Overall, Jon is definitely one of the very best professors I've ever had at the UVa."
3293,2320434,3.0,4.0,"His lectures were fine, but he would occasionally show YouTube videos that weren't really necessary. He essentially taught out of the textbook, but the textbook explained some of the concepts more clearly than he did; you cannot go without it. Additionally, much of the exams are based on fill-in-the-blank and select-multiple-answers questions."
3294,165938,2.5,3.0,"I really didn't think Ramirez was that bad.  No, he's not a great professor, but he could be a lot worse.  He's teaching a really boring topic, so of course his lectures are boring.  His tests are pretty straightforward though, and the homework isn't required.  Ended up with a B+ because I didn't take the final seriously.  Lots of memorization."
3295,165938,1.0,3.0,"Everything is true. Took this class with him one year ago. He's not helpful, not friendly, extremely boring, makes too many mistakes on the board and harsch grader. Even when copying from his notes he gets stuck while solving problems."
3296,165938,1.5,3.0,"One of the worst professors ever: Boring, Unclear, Not Helpful, Not Friendly. As soon as he stopped copying from his notes, he made a mistake on the board."
3297,165938,1.5,1.0,No Comments
3298,165938,1.0,4.0,"What everyone else said, this guy is horrid.  Made calculus-based statistics even harder than I could imagine.  Not helpful, not friendly, probably should go back to the private sector."
3299,165938,1.0,5.0,didnt understand a thing in his lectures
3300,165938,1.0,5.0,"Worthless professor. Worked so hard in that class to understand and succeed, but ended up coming away with nothing at the end of the semester. Horrible. Avoid this man at all costs."
3301,165938,1.0,3.0,"boring, terrible, unfair, tests are all takehome, but impossible"
3302,165938,1.0,4.0,No Comments
3303,165938,1.0,4.0,"His explanation are THE most confusing and his test follow directly from class notes, so you have to memorize a bunch of stuff that you don't really understand. Whatever you do, don't take a class with him."
3304,952370,2.0,2.0,"I have never seen lecture halls so empty until I took Rubin's class. About 40 people showed up for a 500 person lecture each week, I counted. Pointless lectures, we talked about absolutely nothing. Discussion was super interesting, easy A, but it made me hate media studies."
3305,952370,5.0,4.0,"Granted, I never took Intro to Media Studies with Professor Rubin, but his class about Music &amp; Broadcasting was my favorite class at UVa -- and also the most challenging. Intro just sucks, no matter what prof. Prof. Rubin's very smart and makes the class relevant. There's reading quizzes and frequent assignments, but they're all worthwhile."
3306,952370,2.0,3.0,"Boring Lecturer, seems to just restate material in readings, and not necessarily a good job at it.  Gives interesting material in relation to music and is friendly/approachable."
3307,952370,4.5,2.0,"really nice guy, very helpful, humorous, engaging, classes go by quickly, very accommodating"
3308,952370,5.0,1.0,nick is an  awesome awesome professor... u can score an easy A in his class and he is really helpful....i dunno why ppl wouldnt think he is good ...but if u get a chance take his class u wont regret it!!
3309,952370,2.0,1.0,"Nick Rubin is just a Musicology PhD UVA student.  He's not an actual professor.  He is mostly unable to convey musical principles to his students.  He of course knows his subject well, but he is not articulate enough to show it.  If you decide to take MUSI 131, make sure that you do NOT get Nick Rubin."
3310,952370,5.0,1.0,No Comments
3311,2549817,1.0,3.0,"I would take her class again literally just to get her fired for breaking school protocol. She refused to let me use my ADA accommodations. I should have pushed harder, but I just wanted to graduate. She cares so much about representing minorities, but not those with cognitive disabilities."
3312,1452104,3.0,4.0,"She is a great professor but her tests are very hard. She has a great sense of humor and can be entertaining. However, if you want a good grade, you definitely have to spend alot of time outside the classroom studying and trying to review your spanish grammar. I really did enjoyed her class, even though I struggled at the begining."
3313,1452104,3.0,4.0,She makes the tests more difficult than the ones in the other classes. She also doesn't really explain the material we learn in the homework unless you ask a specific question about it. I felt like you had to self-teach a lot.
3314,1452104,5.0,4.0,"Paula is really funny, knows her spanish. She wants her students to learn as much as possible, and does her best to do so. You will learn more in her section than you will in other ones."
3315,1452104,5.0,2.0,"It's a lot like high school spanish working out of the textbook. I wasn't really interested in more grammar, but there's a lot of conversation and some writing involved in the class too. She's super awesome. Helpful and adds easy assignments to boost grades."
3316,1452104,5.0,3.0,"Paula is awesome! She is really funny and her class was always super interesting. You may think she's too hard if you are lazy and stupid, but I loved her class and would recommend it to anyone."
3317,1452104,3.0,5.0,"Paula is very sweet and funny. However, the class is extremely difficult. I recommend a different professor.She has made me really hate spanish even though I am going to continue my studies. Like the class average is a C and thats good. This class is impossible especially with her strict teaching methods, no exceptions with her."
3318,788553,4.5,3.0,"this guy is chill...like an old hip cat that knows what he is talking about...if you take this couse, show up, estimate basketballs and what not you will be inspired to stay the course.  Eng isn't easy, and that probably why that other comments are so low...these people didn't make it.  If you love the field you will love White..."
3319,788553,1.5,3.0,"He seemed like a really cool guy, except he never prepared a lecture or taught us anything of use. I hoped to get a sense of what being an Engineer would be like and came out with nothing. He should be more aware of knowing when he has the class' attention."
3320,788553,3.5,4.0,"He doesn't really care about teaching. He comes late every day- sometimes not even showing up. The simulation was interesting, and lectures were not that painful. Homework was so-so. But it seemed like I was on track all semester with an above-average grade, and then I looked up my grades and felt cheated."
3321,788553,1.5,2.0,Very chill teacher but I never felt like I learned much during his class.
3322,788553,1.5,5.0,"He is a good scientist, but maybe not a good teacher. Sometime he is late for class. And he will disappoint you when you see your grade."
3323,788553,1.0,5.0,"What I want to say is he is is definitely a XXX!!! his class is  so boring and he is the most unreasonable professor I have ever met. Never say anything like he is wrong, He will kill you by give you a bad grade at the end of the semester."
3324,788553,2.5,1.0,No Comments
3325,788553,2.0,3.0,"Sadly every 1st year Eschooler has to take 162.  DO NOT TAKE IT WITH WHITE IF POSSIBLE.  He is a tenured crackpot who shows up to class late (first day of class he showed up 20 minutes late because he had a phone interview that he just couldn't get away from).  He is unclear, arrogant, boring, and grades harshly on projects without guidelines."
3326,2623573,2.0,3.0,A lot of my classmates and I were surprised this is an introductory course. There was a good amount of online homework with the textbook website. There were two midterms (one was oral) and one final. There were three quizzes and three written homeworks. This class was okay.
3327,2623573,1.0,4.0,"Mark manages to use three entirely separate platforms to base his grades after. If you are not capable of checking each of these platforms at least three times a week, you will miss something. He is condescending and beyond unapproachable. If he is asked to explain something again, he says the exact same thing only slower. Not worth the time."
3328,2623573,3.0,3.0,"He means well, but his online is just not great. He uses like 5 different platforms and doesn't post stuff until a few days before so unless you check them CONSTANTLY, you will inevitably miss assignments. He attempts a conceptual approach, but it's honestly really confusing. I once saw him use a concept in its proof...."
3329,1894506,1.0,3.0,"He was very confusing. Couldn't answer basic questions. Kept saying, ""I'll get back to you on that one."""
3330,2345069,4.0,1.0,Very doable class. Put in the work and you will succeed. The material is very straightforward and easy to understand.
3331,2345069,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT take Calculus with this professor. If you want to learn, pick another professor. If you want to fail and struggle in this class, with no help or guidance, be my guess. Promise he will not care, he does not collaborate with his students."
3332,2345069,1.0,5.0,"Terrible Professor, does not even know how to teach. If he is the only professor left to teach any Math at your school, might as well pick another degree. Doesn't teach at all, nor it seems like he wants to teach students. Professors are supposed to engage and help their students understand concepts, not this one. You need Khan academy all semester"
3333,1190009,5.0,3.0,"I love Adriana, she's a great Spanish teacher. She's very nice and I think she's pretty generous with grading tests, though she wants to improve your writing so the papers are graded more harshly. It's not a hard class by any means, and if you do your work and work hard on your papers you can get an A/A-."
3334,1190009,5.0,3.0,"I had the best experience in Adriana's class. This instructor actually speaks Spanish and is totally helpful. The course is tough, but she helped us get through it and I feel confident about. Using my Spanish in real scenario. I highly recommend her!!"
3335,1190009,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed her class and I actually learned to speak Spanish. Most classes focus on grammar, but I liked the conversation activities the best."
3336,1190009,5.0,3.0,Sra. Campbell is amazing! I couldn't have asked for a better Spanish teacher! She's a native and speaks Spanish very well and it's not hard to understand her. An A is attainable as long as you do your part. I'd definitely recommend her.
3337,166011,1.0,3.0,"He wants you to think exactly how he does. One person's feedback for her essay was &quot;this is a good essay but not what we are looking for&quot; Got a B. so even if you have a good essay, they don't care. He's also rude and condescending. He emailed my friend to stop &quot;nagging&quot; about grades when collab gradebook was glitching and she asked for extra credit"
3338,166011,3.0,3.0,"By the end of this class, I learned interesting things, but it just didn't feel like it mattered. Maybe that's because I'm not an anthro person, but it just didn't really feel that important tbh. You're only graded on essays really. The texts are sometimes boring, but Handler is p good at explaining."
3339,166011,5.0,1.0,"Professor Handler is a great guy to know. This course was about advising rather than an actual workload. However, we had thought provoking conversations about college throughout the semester. I would take one of his actual courses in a heartbeat."
3340,166011,5.0,2.0,Very engaging. Offers opportunities for students to argue and push conceptual boundaries. Course material itself interesting. Very approachable and own passion for subject made me more interested as well.
3341,166011,1.0,3.0,"Like one of the other comments mentioned, he is the epitome of white liberalism. He uses racial slurs even after students of color have asked him not to. That class was just uncomfortable for me to sit in. Also felt like he just lectured whatever came to his head without any proper thought. Would not recommend his class. Save your time and energy."
3342,166011,3.0,1.0,"Always had engaging lectures but definitely not as socially aware as we'd all like to believe--has used racial slurs in class and seems to believe his brand of white liberalism to be the only right worldview. Still a fairly good professor and the class is pretty easy, just don't know if I could handle taking another class with him."
3343,166011,5.0,3.0,"Extremely mindblowing, straightforward"
3344,166011,5.0,1.0,"BEST CLASS. He's so nice. Doesn't believe in structured exams or quizzes, so the only grades are short papers which I thought were very easy and opinion-based. Final exam was take home and it was a breeze. He is very liberal and respects everyone's opinion. Was the only class i enjoyed my first year at UVA. Convinced me to be a Global Studies major"
3345,166011,3.5,2.0,This class was a big lecture that required 3 papers (1 to be dropped or not written) so I could have taken better advantage of his office hours. When it came time for papers to be due  he was always there to answer questions through e-mail. His liberal view was very clear in this class and provided a hilarious channel for discussion.
3346,166011,4.0,1.0,ANTH 1010 was probably the easiest and most beneficial class that I have taken at UVA thus far. Professor Handler is very eloquent and challenges the social norm of thinking. Do take this class! It's very easy to pull off at least an A-.
3347,166011,4.0,3.0,"Wonderful lectures, learned a lot. "
3348,166011,1.0,5.0,he is obnoxious and rude and does not know much about anthropology
3349,166011,5.0,1.0,"Best Professor. He sat and worked with me, so I could improve my composition skills! I learned more from him than from my English instructors."
3350,166011,4.5,2.0,Best professor I had at UVa.  A true individual...paradigm shifting if you really pay attention.
3351,166011,3.0,1.0,anth 101 is a sweet class. take it.
3352,166011,3.5,4.0,"Fantastic man! Absolutely wonderful. However I think it helps to be an anthropology major. ALWAYS goes off topic, but always very interesting facts. Does swear. Does say things just to make people angry. But will always answer the classes questions. You either completely love him and think he's a genius, or hate him and think he's a ****."
3353,166011,4.5,1.0,"Fantastic professor. Not always necessarily on topic, but always interesting. Great class!"
3354,166011,2.5,4.0,"please. handler's class sucked and we all knew it. incoherent babbling about NOTHING at all...you'll end up facebooking the entire time. and the quizzes! what a joke. didn't matter what you wrote, but if you got an easy or hard TA. this was BY FAR the worst class i had all semester. ratemyprofs, my bible, lead me astray on this one..."
3355,166011,4.5,2.0,the man. that's all.
3356,166011,3.0,2.0,"this man is the tightest teacher ive come across. drug references, cusses like a sailor, and encourages arguing in class. should attend class to absorb terms to use in the quizzes, take this class you'll either have fun or a lot of free time to play tetris"
3357,166011,5.0,2.0,"Hmm, do I even have words to describe how AMAZING he is!!!  By far the best professor I've ever come across....I true genius and a very nice man too!! His classes will open your eyes to aspects of American life you've never thought about....TAKE HIM!"
3358,166011,4.5,2.0,"Handler is just AMAZING and nice. His classes are just mind blogging, but his arguments makes sense. It is a very worthwhile class and the best class I had so far at UVA."
3359,166011,5.0,2.0,"Hands down, greatest professor I've ever had. This class seriously changed my life. I'm obsessed with Handler- take any class he's teaching. The work load was very reasonable, and grading is fair."
3360,166011,4.0,1.0,**** Handler is one of the best profs at U.Va.  I had absolutely zero interest in the subject and I still went to class all the time b/c he is so entertaining and I learned a ton.  Take 101 with him--it's worth it.
3361,166011,5.0,2.0,The best class i've taken at uva so far.  Really makes you think about racism in America in a different way.  Conservatives flee after the 1st class so get on the waitlist if you're interested.  Easy to get at least an A-.
3362,166011,5.0,5.0,Handler is the best professor I've had at UVA. He's insanely hilarious and brilliant at the same time. Just do the readings and go to class. I would just go to class anyway because his lectures are so informative. Grading isn't too bad. The class is pretty intimate for having 250 people and he's very receptive to questions and interaction.
3363,166011,3.0,3.0,"He was an awesome teacher. absolutely no interest in the topic going in, makes it easy and fun. Makes you think alot too, but the class isnt hard"
3364,166011,4.0,2.0,pretty easy.
3365,166011,2.0,1.0,"I can't complain about a class I never went to (except quiz days) yet still pulled off an A.  Definitely go for the discussion section, it's basically a freebie.  Not quite as awesome as I expected, but still pretty cool."
3366,166011,5.0,2.0,lovely human
3367,166011,5.0,3.0,Never thought I'd get into Anth before taking Handler's class.  Handler's the man.
3368,166011,5.0,2.0,"Handler is the man. Everyone should basically take this awesome class as he changes the way you think about society. He makes you see the problematic structure of the nationalist ideology for example, and also talks about race and diversity very interestingly. You will gasp at the end of every lecture because this guy just simply rocks. A must take"
3369,166011,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, funny, and very interesting."
3370,166011,4.0,2.0,"Amazing. Awesome professor. So funny, basically give you all the information you need to know in lecture but do the readings anyway. I would take another class by him, no matter the context. Made me consider becoming an anthropology major."
3371,166011,4.5,3.0,"Took Race, Nationalism and Multiculturalism, after taking 101 with him. One of, if not my favorite professors, at UVA."
3372,166011,5.0,1.0,"Beyond amazing--he's my idol, if anything for his not giving a crap what anyone thinks.  He will change your view of the world--I took the class 2 years ago and it's still affecting me, I'm still engaging in the concepts of that class.  Reason I am an Anthropology major."
3373,166011,4.0,2.0,Handler is bloody amazing! He will change the way you understand the world in so many ways! The most meaningful class I have ever taken at U.Va. Reading is not overbearing and you will be drawn to attend every lecture. Handler is like intellectual crack--but it's GOOD for you!
3374,166011,5.0,3.0,"If you're a conservative who is afraid to have your views challenged, then stay away. But as professor Handler always says: you've come to this school to be challenged. So if you're up for it, be prepared to have your world turned upside down."
3375,166011,5.0,2.0,"He is amazing.  If you want a class and teacher that will challenge your entire view of the world, here it is."
3376,166011,3.0,1.0,This guy blows.  Period.  Don't take his class if you are right-thinking at all.
3377,166011,4.5,3.0,"This man is the reason I declared the Anthrpology major. Whether you love him or hate him, you just can't get enough. Do yourself a favor and give him the opportunity to change the way you think about the world."
3378,166011,5.0,3.0,"I loved having Prof. Handler, he was provactive and an engaging speaker.  I really encourage people to take his class."
3379,166011,5.0,2.0,Professor Handler is extraordinary!  He's brilliant--just listen to him for 15 minutes and he'll tell you something that changes the way you think.  225 was AMAZING--it will be VERY hard to beat that class while I'm here.  Take it!  Or ANYTHING by Handler.
3380,166011,5.0,2.0,Amazing.
3381,166011,5.0,2.0,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROFS. Brilliant, hilarious, left-wing nutcase. A bit intimidating one-on-one, nonetheless extremely honest, kind and helpful. Completely changes your thinking and humbles you."
3382,166011,4.5,1.0,"GREAT CLASS!! loved it. slightly repetative but very entertaining professor. Absolutly loved him. very liberal and outspoken, but honest about it. take this class, you won't regret it, best class i've taken at UVa!!!"
3383,166011,5.0,2.0,"Everyone should take this class with Handler (Nationalism, Racism, and Multicultrualism).  In fact there should just be more classes like this and more professors like him."
3384,166011,4.0,3.0,His class is really interesting and really relevent to issues today.  It will give you a new perspective on the world.  I don't recommend this class for conservatives who don't like to hear arguements against their beliefs.  Handler is VERY liberal and not afraid to say what he thinks.
3385,166011,4.5,2.0,"Best class I have taken at UVa so far.  Gives you a new perspective of races and predjudice, very eye-opening.  Lectures can become drawn-out, but are necessary in highlighting key aspects of readings for essays and are mostly entertaining. Great material, great class."
3386,166011,4.0,3.0,His class is great - it is greatly relevant to day to day situations in life. His tangents are funny too.
3387,166011,4.5,3.0,"Handler is an amazing professor. Not only is he brilliant and interesting, but he is humerous, nice, and will do just about anything to help you with your grade. I was struggling, and he tried extremely hard to make sure I received individual attention in a class of several hundred students."
3388,166011,5.0,4.0,"Handler: intelligent, thoughtful, humorous, spastic, energetic, enlightening, passionate. Amazing guy, amazing class. This isnt a class on knowledge, its a class on life- something everyone should take...and he is what makes the class."
3389,166011,4.0,2.0,"an AMAZING man!! He has really opened my eyes to a lot of issues. Go to lecture, the important points of the reading become obvious. It can get a little monotonous sometimes, he's at his best  when he goes off on a tangent."
3390,166011,4.0,2.0,"With a name like Dick Handler, how can you not like him&#63;"
3391,166011,4.5,3.0,"Handler is one of the best professors I've ever had! Very approachable, humorous, enlightening, and inspiring."
3392,166011,5.0,3.0,"definitly will not waste your tuition, so long as you can handle the extreme liberal flavor - but it ads a nice spice"
3393,166011,5.0,3.0,the dude is awesome.
3394,166011,2.5,3.0,"i mean honestly   who can take a guy with the name &quot;dick handler&quot; serious   very intelligent but very, very liberal    any people aspiring to go into big business definitely skip out on this class"
3395,166011,4.5,2.0,"I love this man. Take him any way you can, one of the most &quot;with-it&quot; profs I've ever had!"
3396,166011,5.0,2.0,"Not only is this man adorbale to watch lecture, he really is a very intelligent man. His opinions are often very strong, but he speaks so well that there is rarely opposititon. He really makes you think, the readings are well picked, and tests are fair."
3397,166011,3.5,2.0,Very interesting class. Reading isn't too bad and if you go and pay attention to the lectures the reading isn't entirely necessary.
3398,166011,5.0,3.0,Wonderful lectures help you open your eyes to the world or at least articulate views on culture in a new way.  The reading is quite manageable which means you get way more out of it.  He has a great personality and is one of the wisest profs here.
3399,166011,4.0,1.0,"Ridiculously easy class, but it's super interesting so that makes up for it.  If you never go to class, you'll still pass easily but you're missing out on a great lecturer.  Plus he's so jaded and bitter it becomes hilarious."
3400,166011,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Handler is the best professor I've ever taken a class from. He offers an important perspective - especially on issues of race. Despite what one reviewer wrote, he IS a nice person one on one - he just has a slightly unusual personality. GREAT PROF!"
3401,166011,3.5,3.0,"I really enjoy this class even though it is a lot of work.  Professor Handler will challenge and maybe even change the way you think about culture and society.  Don't take a discussion, they don't really help at all.  The readings get a little monotonous!"
3402,166011,3.0,3.0,funny name
3403,166011,1.0,1.0,Not a very nice individual in person
3404,166011,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting lecturer.  Intelligently discusses issues from all sides(including his own VERY liberal viewpoint)and enjoys challenging stereotypes.  Not the easiest class in the world, but definitely worth the effort."
3405,166011,5.0,2.0,"Interesting for the first few lectures, but afterwards lectures get really repetitive. I wouldn't recommend taking a discussion section with any of Handler's classes -- just talk to him in class or go to office hours if you want to talk."

3408,919678,5.0,3.0,"Great TA, also Beefcake the Mighty and Blothar in one of the greatest bands of all time GWAR."
3409,919678,4.5,1.0,Great professor.....only four papers that we could rewrite many times.  Recommend taking this class.
3410,919678,4.5,1.0,Professor Bishop is a really relaxed professor who knows a lot about music.  Even if you don't know anything about music I would still recommend taking his class.  Only had to write four papers and workshop your paper with other students.  No textbook or readings.  Would definitely recommend him
3411,919678,2.0,2.0,"easy class...Bishop is a horrible lecturer but tries really hard. You should go to class to get the notes unless you can get them from someone. 3 papers, midterm, final. all easy. TA's go over the information and prepare you. Easy A but you do have to do these &quot;comments&quot; on the readings every class period. Don't have to read the whole thing to writ"
3412,919678,3.0,2.0,He's pretty cool. Nice class. Papers are actually FUN to write. He loves music. His laugh is pretty funny too. Overall I'm glad I took this class.
3413,919678,3.0,1.0,michael bishop is fantastic. if you have a chance to take a class with him you MUST. he loves to air guitar and makes hilarious comments. get him going on dolly parton or elvis and youre in for a fabulous discussion
3414,919678,5.0,1.0,"Professor Bishop is really cool.  The class itself is a lot of fun, if you love music. He likes to ramble a lot, but he is funny when he starts to sing.  The essay topics are so much fun and so easy to write about. Greatest class this semester!"
3415,919678,4.0,2.0,he is a really great guy and an awesome ta who loves his subject matter. comletely entertaining and hands down best ta i have ever had!
3416,919678,4.0,3.0,"This guys is really cool, I took History of Jazz discussion with him, and he is great. I also discovered later on that he used to be in GWAR among other bands. He is kind of hard in the sense that he expects you to know what's going on but if you're interested in the topic at all he's great."
3417,1067137,1.0,5.0,"He has the most complicated grading system and class calender. Each class he spend some time introduce the rule, the rest of time is left for other student's presentation. This is a math or stat course."
3418,1067137,1.0,5.0,"Worst STAT 2120 teacher at UVA.  Tests were tricky and were nothing like anything addressed in the lectures or homework problems, especially the conceptual questions, which were very hit or miss.  Lectures are pointless as he only reads off of the slides."
3419,1067137,1.0,5.0,Spitzner is absolutely terrible. Take this with anyone else. You won't learn a thing from lecture because he puts the textbook into PowerPoint and reads straight off the slides. Don't bother going to lecture. 
3420,1067137,2.5,4.0,"Definitely a tough class. Lectures are truly confusing - he doesn't explain sufficiently or clearly enough - hence pointless. Just make sure you understand the examples and homework questions, 'cause exams are similar, but concept (definition) questions are really hard, and usually a hit or miss. Homework and labs take up a lot of time too."
3421,1067137,1.0,4.0,"I wished I had looked him up beforehand, otherwise I would have NOT taken his Stat 2120 class.  Lectures are pointless.  I got more out of tutoring.  DOES NOT TEACH CALCULATOR FUNCTIONS; teaches Excel functions instead and you need a calculator on the exams.  I wish I had researched him before I took his class.  Oh and the tests suck."
3422,1067137,2.5,4.0,"Lectures are pointless as all slides are posted to Collab. Concept questions on the test can be obscure and difficult, and because there are only like 24 questions to a test (2 tests plus a final) each one you miss hugely impacts your grade. Low test averages but don't go looking for a decent curve because there is none."
3423,1067137,2.0,5.0,"I do not like this professor... Horrible lectures, tests, everything"
3424,1067137,1.5,5.0,Professor Spitzner is a horrible lecturer and talks about common sense topics in class and then creates ridiculously hard trick question tests which everyone fails. There is no point attending class and you can prepare as much as you like for the tests but it won't help.
3425,1067137,2.0,4.0,"I'm going to be clear and to the point..if you have never taken a statistics class before, do not take this professor. I have not learned any new material from him, the only reason I have the slightest clue what is going on in class is because I have taken the class before at another school. His voice also trails off at the end of his sentences"
3426,1067137,4.0,2.0,"Spitzner is the best STAT 2120 teacher at UVA. He cares about the subject a lot and is always willing to help out students. He doesn't trick you with what the tests will be on. They are very very similar to his old exams he has given previous classes, and he gives you those exams to practice with."
3427,1067137,5.0,5.0,"Certainly a very difficult class, given the content. However, Professor Spitzner knows his stuff and is very generous. Just make sure you study."
3428,1067137,1.0,4.0,"The biggest issue in this class is that lectures are completely useless. I walked out of lecture every time feeling like I had learned nothing, then read the textbook and it made sense. Also, the homework doesn't correlate to the exams, which is ridiculously stupid. Avoid this class."
3429,1067137,2.0,5.0,"I have never failed a class before. This is definitely a really hard class. The material isn't that hard to understand. Honestly, I felt like I knew the material for the the exam, but my exam grades do not reflect that. I sought a tutor, used two books, and practiced A LOT. It's just really disconcerting when you've tried your very best and failed."
3430,1067137,2.0,5.0,"I took this class over a year ago, and have been waiting til I had cooled off before writing this review. But still, this professor sucks. He is easily the worst professor/teacher I've ever had. If you don't have any prior stat knowledge (which is not required) then you can't do well. He is just an awful lecturer/teacher."
3431,1067137,1.0,4.0,"Worst teacher ever!!! I do not even think he knows what he is talking about. Lectures were pointless, help labs were pointless, heck everything was pointless. He even screwed up on the scantron and made us take the test again. Screwed that one up too, which lowered my grade. I hope I never see standard deviation again in my life!!!"
3432,1067137,1.5,5.0,"DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM!! I can't stress it enough. He doesn't even have office hours, and if you have no prior statistics knowledge, I promise you will fail. He moves faster than colleges should. He made me quit pre-comm!"
3433,1067137,2.0,5.0,"You need to know how to handle this class beforehand.  Focus on reading and understanding the book rather than lectures.  Don't procrastinate the homework and leave plenty of study time for exams.  I haven't been to the actual class in a month, because it's not that useful.  It's very hard and I'd recommend taking a lower-level stat class first."
3434,1067137,5.0,4.0,"Prof Spitzner is a great teacher who explains difficult concepts as clearly as they can be explained.  He's very helpful and the tests, while very challenging, help you truly understand the material.  It's not a memorize-and-you'll-be-fine course, but it is one where you'll learn a lot if you put in the time!"
3435,1067137,3.5,4.0,This class is a bit tough but if you take it seriously from the beginning and read the textbook and study for all the weekly quizzes you can do good. The midterm is hard and is nothing like the quizzes/homeworks but I thought the final was harder. At the end professor Spitzner curves the grades and you can do fine.
3436,1067137,1.0,4.0,"The worst class that I have ever taken. The professor was a complete waste of a life form. Final was insanely ridiculous. This class is a waste of time, tests are nothing like the material."
3437,1067137,1.5,5.0,"Class was extremely hard if you have no statistics background.  The final was nothing like the quizzes, practice exams or the midterm.  Class was a joke because all he did was read straight off powerpoint slides."
3438,1067137,1.0,5.0,This is the worst class I have ever taken in any level of school. The only reason I did well is because I took it in high school. The lectures are useless. He does not teach you how to do the homework or weekly quizzes. The final was also unlike anything we had done the rest of the year and he did not prepare us for it at all. Avoid if possible.
3439,1067137,5.0,5.0,He's a very nice professor when you talk to him outside class and is always willing to help. The course itself though is very difficult especially for those with low statistics backgrounds. Tricky tests that focus primarily on concepts rather than just number-crunching (completely unlike the homework and quizzes)
3440,1067137,4.5,3.0,The class is very helpful for SAS beginners. Hw/project is assigned each week..fun to work on. Dan is a good teacher overall.
3441,1902726,5.0,3.0,"No Tests, No Finals. Weekly Quizzes (60%) and Homework (40%) compose the whole grade. Those quizzes can be HARD! Just took the priority queue quiz, didn't have a clue what to do. There are retake options around every three weeks. And you can make up any one of them during ""final""

Homework are Implementation (Wed) and Analysis (Fri). Not too hard"
3442,1902726,5.0,3.0,"Lectures are recorded and optional, but they are really helpful for labs and exams. The labs are tough but the office hours are useful and theres usually lots of TAs there to help. Overall the workload isn't terrible."
3443,1902726,5.0,2.0,"Floryan is an exceptional lecturer who does the course material justice. CS 2150 covers a lot of ground, even though the course is relatively easy. Floryan can explain concepts well to newcomers and is pretty entertaining."
3444,1902726,5.0,5.0,"CS 2150 is the hardest class I have ever taken, but Floryan is also a fantastic teacher. Hilarious and you can just tell he's legit."
3445,1902726,5.0,4.0,"Tough class, but an amazing professor. He's funny, engaging, down to earth, and really knows the material. It's a lot of work, but Floryan is a great teacher."
3446,1902726,5.0,5.0,"2150 was one of the hardest classes I've taken, and though Floryan tends to be a tough grader, he is a fantastic lecturer who really cares about the students learning and doing well."
3447,1902726,5.0,5.0,"I would not have taken this class if it wasn't with Floryan. Great professor. That being said, his classes are super difficult. Be prepared to work forever on Algo homework and still not feel prepared for the exams. It's a tough class, he makes it tough, but he's such a great lecturer and you do really learn in classes he teaches."
3448,1902726,5.0,3.0,"Floryan is awesome!! I've taken Algorithms and HCI and I have enjoyed both of them. He really wants to teach the students and is really understanding of what the students need! For HCI, he even extended the deadline of a homework assignment and push backed a test to make it easier on us."
3449,1902726,2.5,4.0,"Floryan is a good lecturer and the material is interesting but... The assignments' instructions are unclear, and the one programming homework given was absurd and more about nonsensical implementations in Java than it is about HCI. Grading is often very subjective and harsh. You'll get random points deducted for formatting. Poorly organized class."
3450,1902726,4.5,3.0,"Floryan was the best professor I've had at UVA.  He is the most clear and organized teacher I've had, and he's really good at helping students get through tough patches in the semester."
3451,1902726,5.0,3.0,"Floryan is the man. Take all of his classes. Explains the material well, gives interesting lectures, and is very approachable and understanding. Makes a fun class even more fun."
3452,903303,5.0,2.0,"DO NOT TAKE FREEMAN! TAKE MIKAMI! Mikami makes the material in this class incredibly clear and understandable, considering how difficult it could potentially be. She teaches exactly what will be on the test, so there are no tricky questions... it's very possible to get 100s! Everyone who had Freeman wished they had Mikami, definitely take her!"
3453,903303,5.0,2.0,TAKE 305 WITH MIKAMI! It is so much better than Freeman. I wish she taught 306.
3454,903303,5.0,1.0,"Fantastic professor! Highly recommend. Just review the homeworks before tests, follow the rubrics for paper-writing to a tee (TA's have to be sticklers for APA format), and you're good to go! An A is definitely achievable."
3455,903303,5.0,2.0,"Amazing, keeps you engaged. Very helpful if you reach out to her."
3456,903303,5.0,1.0,"Professor Mikami is awesome. She really cares about whether you understand the material and puts concepts in terms so unbelievably simple to understand. If you have to take 305, take it with her."
3457,903303,2.0,1.0,Strange and awkward. I would stay away.
3458,903303,5.0,1.0,Prof Mikami is awesome. She seems genuinely interested in what she is teaching and her main concern is that you understand it.  She explains things in multiple ways and has office hours on AIM before the test!!! She wants to get to know students and is really nice (if a bit awkward). Def take her class if you can get her.
3459,903303,5.0,1.0,She is awesome!  So enthusiastic.  Also has really cute clothes.  Psyc 305 is a really boring subject; she makes it bearable and understandable.  Tests aren't too bad.
3460,903303,4.0,2.0,If you attend class and listen to her lectures then the tests are very easy--you don't even need to read the text. Class is pretty entertaining and she is relatively straightforward with the material. One of the best teachers I've ever had.
3461,903303,5.0,3.0,Great professor with good lecture style. Keeps the class moving and makes statistics come alive!
3462,903303,5.0,4.0,take this class. she rocks.
3463,903303,4.5,2.0,Straightforward class with a professor excited about her job and teaching. Lectures are easy to follow but reading the book is as equally important for success on the tests as studying the lecture notes.
3464,903303,4.5,2.0,"Great content and organization. For a 2.5 hr class, it was tolerable because its mostly discussion and Mikami uses some creative techniques to teach. Only drawback is she will call on people randomly, so you have to do reading for class. There's a final paper, and a midterm and final exam that are open book- not too difficult!"
3465,903303,4.0,2.0,"Not a bad lecturer.  Goes straight off of the powerpoints.  You need to study to do well, since all the tests are semi-tricky multiple choice."
3466,903306,4.5,3.0,"She has a great amount of interest in Hispanic culture. She's lived abroad and integrates her experiences there into the class. In addition to teaching us to write well, she loves discussing controversial issues in the Hispanic community. Only negative: She takes a long time (understandably) to return papers, so it's hard to know how you're doing."
3467,903306,5.0,4.0,"I had her twice for 202 and 3020 and I love her!Very friendly and, as someone else commented,always smiling and also funny which makes class much more enjoyable.I'm not sure if she's teaching anymore after this year, but if she is, I definitely recommend her. Amazing person and great teacher!"
3468,903306,5.0,2.0,"if you are looking for a great spanish 202 teacher senora stachura is the one to take. she is so cute and is always smiling and the tests are very easy. if you think 202 is going to be real hard, you thought wrong. With her its a breeze and if your a guy, your even more set."
3469,903306,3.0,2.0,She's one of the nicest teacher's I've had in 3 years at UVA. too bad she's only a TA and won't be around long
3470,903306,4.5,3.0,"An excellent teacher. Her teaching is very clear and she is very friendly, very helpful, and very nice. She understands that up to 202 is a requirement and therefore grades very easily on her exams. She is understanding and there to help you get through the class while making the class fun and teaching you the language. Highly recommended!!!"
3471,903306,5.0,1.0,"An excellent Spanish teacher. Just what you're looking for: friendly, knowledgeable and passionate about the subject material. Always willing to help with difficult material and goes the extra mile to aide specific student needs. Highly recommended, A+."
3472,903306,5.0,2.0,she is teh best ever! take all her classes because she is the best teacher ever!!!!and shes fun...and she makes spanish interesting...aka i love her too
3473,903306,5.0,2.0,"Omg...so I'm pretty sure I have a legit crush on her. She's awesome. Take her class. You'll really enjoy. I had never had Spanish before this, so I was intimidated at first but she really makes the env't so laid back. Love it."
3474,903308,4.0,3.0,Lots and lots of homework assignments and quizzes
3475,903308,4.5,1.0,Professor Sakas is great. I took 164 with her and she is very reasonable and explains things well. Her test were online and she was very generous in her grading.
3476,903308,5.0,1.0,"Prof Sakas is great! She speaks very clearly, is helpful with papers and other assignments, and is a fair grader. Take a Spanish course with her if possible because your Spanish will improve greatly (and you'll enjoy it too!)."
3477,903308,4.5,1.0,"Profesora Sakas is great. If you're not into literature, the class is boring. There were two tests and two papers with a few quizzes. If you did the readings and understand Spanish, you will get a high grade on the tests. If you have an interesting thesis and nail your grammar, you will ace the papers. Very easy grader, just check papers with her."
3478,903308,5.0,1.0,"Do yourself a favor and take this class.  She rules and is a ridiculously nice grader.  She's so nice, easy to understand, there is no final, and the only homework is reading. Also, you don't even have to buy a textbook because it's online!"
3479,903308,3.5,1.0,"i definitely recommend taking 311 w/ sakas. shes the EASIEST grader, even if u have mistakes. shes american & speaks slow so its easy to understand her. class is heavily based on the textbook but its easy stuff, just do the homework. i had her 8am & she was good at keeping us awake & understood if we were sleepy. overall, EASY A & shes really nice"
3480,903308,3.5,2.0,"She's extremely relaxed, and a very liberal grader.  Just do the online homework (so easy) and show up to class.  It's nearly impossible to get below an A on any composition or oral exam.  Final exam was pretty rough, but curve helps.  She's a great choice for 202!"
3481,903308,3.0,2.0,the class is definately straight from the book...she's really understanding and really nice
3482,903308,4.0,1.0,"she's just not a teacher. she knows spanish but can't organize a class, can't go through an exercise without skipping something or messing up something. she doesn't know how to answer students' questions and doesn't pay attention to students half the time. she's a really sweet girl and tries to help you, but just is confusing."
3483,903308,4.5,2.0,very laid back young grad student.
3484,387236,3.0,2.0,"Professor Cantor is a good and funny lecturer, although he can be dry at times. He loves passage IDs, meaning you actually have to read the books to do well. He is very knowledgable about Shakespeare and is a pretty easy grader."
3485,387236,5.0,3.0,"Amazing lecturer and extremely erudite. Cantor always has an interesting reading list. If you are a serious student who respects Lit/Comp Lit/ History, I highly recommend his classes."
3486,387236,5.0,3.0,Mr. Cantor is a good professor and a nice person. He answers emails very fast and gives me advice on the class as well as career choice. He is very experienced in teaching. Remember to read the assigned reading before class otherwise lectures can be really boring.
3487,387236,4.0,3.0,"Profesor Cantor loves what he does, and did a surprisingly good job of keeping me interested. His use of historical facts and context meant it wasn't just literature. Warning though, LOT of reading (it's Lit, what did you expect?) and class really needed to be 30 min shorter or I napped with my eyes open. Good 2nd writing requirement."
3488,387236,3.0,2.0,"Overall he's a very smart guy and kind. You'll be reading a good number of books if you take him for Fiction of Empire, but none that are too lengthy or strenuous. A forewarning, however, his lectures drag on; my only gripe is his use of historical references, although sometimes relevant to the books, mostly are meaningless and take up too muchtime"
3489,387236,3.5,3.0,"Had him as a lecturer for both this course and CPLT 2020. While he's enthusiastic about the material and capable of delivering beneficial insight, Cantor often focuses far too intently on cramming in page references (which are relevant, given his exam style). He has a tendency to drone on, but there are worse English professors."
3490,387236,4.0,3.0,Cantor was a a fun lecturer and always made good points on the works we read. I recommend him and Luftig if you need to take 3830!
3491,387236,4.0,4.0,"I've had him for 201, 202, and now 383. One of my favorite lecturers at UVa, especially in the English department. Keeps material relevant by tying in with pop culture/historical events. Once you tune in to his sense of humor, he's hilarious."
3492,387236,4.0,3.0,"I LOVED THIS CLASS! Im not an English major or close to it..but if you care AT ALL about how literature has changed, how people have changed, or how our values have changed.THEN TAKE IT"
3493,387236,5.0,5.0,"Professor Cantor is the best professor that I have had at UVA.  His lectures are outstanding.  We are fortunate to have a teacher of his stature.  He brings in economics, history, and popular culture to the study of literature.  I want to read one of his books after taking his class."
3494,387236,1.0,4.0,"I love English, but this class is beyond awful. Cantor is a pro at talking about everything but the text. I've heard more from him about history than the books. He also makes continual references to other texts that we have not read, without explaining the relevance. Not even 1/3 of the class shows up. Avoid this class and imminent boredom."
3495,387236,3.5,4.0,"LOTS of reading but it is a 4 credit class..lectures were rarely interesting. I was lucky to have a good TA-Hugh Dornan, who was really nice and funny and always very excited about the literature. Some of the books we read I liked, others..barely anyone read. Papers weren't so bad, but overall wouldn't recommend it."
3496,387236,2.0,2.0,"utterly boring. talked nothing about the books but only about the context of them.  heavy heavy reading but expects us to do additional reading in order to write papers.  in a class of 40 people, 10-15 show up"
3497,387236,4.5,3.0,paul cantor is pretty much my english-teaching hero. enough said.
3498,387236,2.5,4.0,"Boring. Knows a lot about literature and comparison and such. Boring. Took a lot of notes. The exam was easy enough. Pretty easy class. Except he's boring. He's funny sometimes, but he only gets weak laughter from the barely half-full lecture hall."
3499,387236,4.0,2.0,Prof. Cantor is really an ingenious professor. As far as caring &quot;only about the literature&quot; that attitude isn't really what makes our English department one of the best in the nation. We're at the top because professors like Cantor realize the need to make real world connections to the texts we are reading.
3500,387236,4.5,1.0,"snore. i don't care about the history of ireland, i want to talk about the literature. he wasn't that bad...it was just such a boring class. having to identify quotes on the exams is horribly annoying. i'm ashamed this kind of testing exists at uva."
3501,387236,2.0,2.0,"I had a bad experience in this class. I found the professor to play favorites (and I was definitely an anti-favorite). It is a very oldfashioned take on literature---all and only the usual canon of dead white males, and a very conservative approach. But the worst part was capricious grading and much unkindness to students not in his &quot;in&quot;club."
3502,387236,5.0,3.0,"lots of reading, but do it all and the course is easy. one of the reasons i became a comp lit major."
3503,387236,3.5,1.0,"very difficult to get used to his take on things, but he is not here to tell you how to think...he is here to get you TO think...very good at playing the devil's advocate....great take on pop culture and TV's role of mirroring society..."
3504,387236,2.0,4.0,"Just fabulous, if you're into jerks.  Only a fool would say  kate chopin's the Awakening isn't a feminist text.  Please, dinosaurs need to retire."
3505,387236,3.0,3.0,bitter and cruel
3506,387236,2.0,5.0,zzzzzzzzzzzz
3507,387236,1.0,2.0,"Vile lack of fairness in grading, plays favorites, teaches from 20-yr-old notes, an entertainer, not an intellectual. Yes, a touch of H. Bloom, & we should be GLAD of that&#63; If you disagree w/him, you'llbe graded down. A truly terrible prof in the guise of a slick performer. There are many better engl profs & courses than his here,&hardly any worse."
3508,387236,3.0,3.0,"If you're previously interested in the subject and motivated to go to class you will learn a lot.  He is very subjective on the papers, which can help or hurt, depending on your writing capabilities.  He likes to keep his focus in one direction, but it's interesting in itself.  Only three grades in class - two papers and an exam"
3509,387236,5.0,3.0,"Easily pre-judged to be boring and strict, but he grows on you.  His aversion to email is only due to his genuine desire to help you in person, and he makes himself available whenever need be.  Also, his lectures are among the best planned and most engaging/entertaining that I have attended."
3510,387236,5.0,3.0,Cantor's lectures are the crown jewel of UVa.  His Comp Lit course was one of the best courses I have taken.  Anyone who does not take at least one course from Professor Cantor is missing out big time.  I wish more classes were taught like his.  A MUST TAKE!!!
3511,387236,4.5,3.0,One of the reasons I became an English major.  His lectures are not to be missed.
3512,387236,4.5,3.0,I beg to differ; cantor is awesome--he's this department's Harold Bloom
3513,387236,1.0,1.0,It is amazing how Professor Cantor can talk for an hour and 15 minutes twice a week and never talk about the text. He chooses one general theme and tries to relate everything to it without explaining his logic.
3514,387236,2.0,3.0,"Not very hands on, leaves all communication up to his TA's.  Funny lectures though."
3515,100516,3.5,5.0,He talks very quietly and mumbles a lot but is one of the cutest old &quot;grandpa&quot; professors around grounds. Lab is beyond easy and helps with understanding lecture material. Takes attendance randomly - took attendance the Friday before Spring Break (of course few to none were there!) Extremely dedicated and willing to answer questions.
3516,100516,4.5,4.0,"Professor Homyk is, as everyone says, hard to understand at times and his tests are challenging. But he is absolutely the nicest man, and EXTREMELY helpful out of class. He'll definitely help you out if you get to know him. He is so intelligent and passionate to teach- but don't take this as a blow-off class. Best class I've ever taken."
3517,100516,2.0,1.0,"He mumbles and is very hard to understand. All test material comes from notes, so this can be a challenge. If you ask him a question after class he rambles on FOREVER about irrelevant things. However he loves his job and cares a great deal about his students. It is the easiest science class I have taken here, an easy 3 credit A."
3518,100516,4.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I've had at UVA. He teaches his own labs, grades hundreds of handwritten tests himself, and by the way he makes himself available outside of class, it is clear he cares a lot about his students and what he is teaching. A+ professor"
3519,100516,4.0,1.0,OK all you have to do is try the best you can to take good lecture notes(thats where EVERY test question comes from) what you dont understand in the notes---go into the book. If its not in the book go see him. I re-wrote all of my notes..never went to office hours and right now I have 97%. Cutest man ever.
3520,100516,3.0,1.0,"Very easy class, and the books were really good, but the class was boring. Idk, it's something about his accent...he seems to drone on and on. Still, if you're looking for a class that doesn't require a lot of effort...take this. Easy handouts, easy exams. Just read the books, participate and you'll get an A"
3521,100516,1.5,5.0,"Most frustrating class I have taken at UVA. He is impossible to understand and follow. Test come from lecture notes but its hard to understand him enough to take notes. Nice man but horrible professor. Must go to office hours for a good grade, but not always easy to attend. Take this calss only if you must."
3522,100516,4.0,1.0,This is a really interesting USEM. Homyk is very knowledgeable on the subject. His lectures are good as long as you can look past him saying &quot;right&quot; every five words. There's a lot of reading but it is very interesting reading. This class is an incredibly easy A.
3523,100516,3.5,2.0,"I thought that this was a very interesting class. It is true that Prof. Homyk is a little hard to follow sometimes, but he is VERY knowledgeable about the subject. You have to do a lot of reading each week. The reading is valuable, because people should be educated about the enviornment, and if you do all the reading, you will ace the tests."
3524,100516,3.5,2.0,"I thought that this was a very interesting class. It is true that Prof. Homyk is a little hard to follow sometimes, but he is VERY knowledgeable about the subject. You have to do a lot of reading each week. The reading is valuable, because people should be educated about the enviornment, and if you do all the reading, you will ace the tests."
3525,100516,2.0,1.0,"It's good thing that I only had him for a freshman seminar-type class, because I can't imagine how badly his mumbling and rambling detracts from his science class lectures. He seems to know quite a bit on the subject, and grades fairly easily. It's just that his lectures are boring and not terribly easy to understand."
3526,100516,3.0,2.0,His USEM is decent. LOTS of reading with a few lectures. the 2 hour class is almost unbearable in length. He has a LOT to say. He has a tendency to ramble and mumble. Not a very good combination. Gives arbitrary assignments. Knows a lot though and is very willing to share. Is a really nice guy too.
3527,100516,3.5,5.0,"He's a nice guy and very approachable. But the tests are extremely hard. They rely heavily on lecture, but he mumbles, and it is hard to understand what he is saying sometimes. He does, however, have many opportunities for his students to meet with him for any questions they may have."
3528,100516,4.0,2.0,I loved this class and Professor Homyk. He rocks!
3529,100516,3.5,4.0,"Yes he mumbles and yes his tests are hard but he truly enlivens this subject and conveys a deep understanding of the most difficult concepts. Plus, if you know everything from your notes, you will get an A on the tests."
3530,100516,5.0,3.0,Dr. Homyk is extremly approachable and willing to answer any and all questions.
3531,100516,2.0,5.0,"He mumbles incessantly. His lectures are very hard to follow and even more boring. His tests are hard. This will deff be my worst grade ever at UVA, and not because I didn't know the material. He picks the most random, and non essential, concepts or terms to test on! He seems like a nice guy. But he is an ineffective teacher. booooo"
3532,100516,4.0,2.0,"A VERY nice man.  As other students have said, he does mumble a lot, and it is difficult to follow his lectures as a result.  He isn't very direct or clear about explaining concepts, but he is extremely helpful and approachable."
3533,100516,4.5,4.0,"BEST TEACHER EVER!  he is possibly the smartest person at UVA.  He is a mumbler, but he'll repeat anything and he's so awesome that it's ok.  Tests are hard, but everything is from the notes."
3534,100516,3.5,3.0,"Tests are extremely hard, but they only come from lecture material.  Lectures are boring and hard to follow because he mumbles and doesn't use any visual aids.  He's very helpful if you go to office hours with questions, but be prepared to stay a while...he never answers questions briefly!"
3535,100516,3.0,5.0,"I like professor Homyk, but I hate his class/exams. I feel like he sometimes picks the most obscure things to put on there and then leaves out huge crucial elements. His lectures are also long and horrible to sit through. But he is a nice man and will try to clarify point and answer questions in office hours."
3536,100516,4.5,3.0,"He's so nerdy he's hot!  I have had Homyk for two semesters of lecture, and he just keeps getting better.  Tests are from lecture material only, so the class tends to be time comsuming only around test dates.  He's always willing to answer questions, and he tries his best to make funny remarks.  Which, just in their nature, usually are hilarious."
3537,100516,5.0,1.0,No Comments
3538,100516,1.5,3.0,"Made EXTREMELY **** remarks in class the other day..concerning why summer sessions were shortened from 5 weeks to 4 &quot;The girls didn't have enough time to get suntans...&quot; etc.  Also, refers to female professor as &quot;Elizabeth&quot; and male professor of same class as &quot;Dr. Kittlesen.&quot;  Old fashioned and NOT with it.  I have no respect for people like him."
3539,100516,4.0,1.0,"This lab is the easiest class I have taken at UVA.  Professor Homyk is a cute funny little guy.  If you need to get rid of a lab requiremnt, take this!"
3540,100516,3.0,1.0,"this guy's the embodiment of a nerd, but he does try to make the class interesting, and he knows what he's talking about.  if you're thinking about taking  his usem science fiction and our future - the books are really good."
3541,100516,5.0,4.0,He knows everything he teaches. Sometimes mumbles but will always clarify any question a student may have. Great to see in office hours.
3542,100516,3.0,3.0,"He mumbles a lot, but if you ask him to slow down or to repeat himself he is very helpful.  I like him - hes a funny man, but don't believe everything he says - I think he likes a lot of science fiction.  :)"
3543,100516,1.0,3.0,"Can't stand this guy. All he does is mumble incessantly, about spy cameras. If you take a usem, don't take this one."
3544,100516,1.0,5.0,"impossible to understand, worst tests EVER!"
3545,100516,3.5,2.0,"great guy, little goofy but one of nicest people you will meet"
3546,985266,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor! Bateman allows ones' creative nature and perspectives to be actualized. Supports the process of individuation, and this is an important factor, especially when one is grappling with the process of defining the way Life's Artistic expression is taking form through their individuality."
3547,985266,4.0,5.0,"Ben never seems to be satisfied with the papers, but I guess that pushes us to try to make them better. He can be kind of scathing sometimes, but he's a pretty nice guy."
3548,985266,3.5,2.0,Annoying
3549,985266,5.0,3.0,"He is extremely helpful. If you are having trouble with a paper, just e-ail him and tell him what your issue is and he will give you some feedback.  He will challenge you to become a better writer, but give you plenty of help."
3550,985266,4.5,2.0,I love Ben! He is awesome.
3551,985266,3.0,3.0,No Comments
3552,829618,2.0,4.0,"I'm not sure why people love this man. He didn't seem to care whether or not students grasped the material and missed class multiple times at key points in the semester. He rarely posted resources, but gave some interesting real world applications with biomechanics every now and then. "
3553,829618,5.0,3.0,Kent is by FAR the best professor I've had at UVa. He has an extensive understanding of Strength of Materials and he makes a relatively dull subject interesting. He's very nice and approachable. I definitely recommend him.
3554,829618,5.0,3.0,"It would be a crime against education if Kent were to no get tenure.  My entire semester was full of kinda blah classes with boring to horrible profs, except for Kent.  He was pretty much the savior of my semester.  I LOVE YOU MAN!"
3555,829618,5.0,3.0,Kent is a the shiznit.
3556,911559,4.5,2.0,:)
3557,911559,5.0,3.0,"Take any class you can with this compelling professor!Professor Diarapha teaches women not to place their care in others hands, but to take care of their own self.  She has inspired me not only academically but personally.  I look up to her as a strong compassionate woman.  She will open your eyes and show you the clear view of feminism."
3558,911559,5.0,3.0,One of the best teachers I've had at UVa.  Very knowledgeable about the subject and you can tell she works hard.  Class was very fun and interesting.  I highly recommend her as a teacher!!
3559,911559,5.0,3.0,I took this class my first semester at UVa and Diarapha was awesome! So awesome that I took another class that she was TA-ing for this semester just so I could have her again lol.  She is extremely intelligent and always has really interesting things to say!  Also very helpful and personable! :-)
3560,911559,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed my semester in this class - she is engaging and keeps class discussion focused on topics of interest selected by students.  Not only did my French improve, but I found myself learning about current events relevant to other courses of study.  I thoroughly recommend this professor."
3561,911559,4.5,3.0,"Very well-structured, clear, interesting, and one of the few french classes at UVA which will actually improve your speaking abilities."
3562,2746582,5.0,3.0,This course was probably my favorite course that I have taken at UVA. Prof. Alexander is the ideal professor for a seminar format and made this course so interesting and enjoyable. We had to buy Austen's Persuasion and Aristotle's Ethics for this course and the entire seminar really just felt like a book club. The grade was 2 medium length papers.
3563,1173732,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely worst professor I ever had. No syllabus, no textbook, no help whatsoever. Didn't ever bother to tell us about office hours or even stay 2 seconds after class. Was patronizing when he was asked questions and was just absolutely awful."
3564,1173732,1.5,3.0,"The class might be easy, but Mirman is rude, unprofessional, and he makes derogatory jokes. He made fun of multiple Asian students throughout the semester, such as one boy's accent and he calls three girls Chinese during  a joke about China's economy. If these kinds of things infuriate you, take micro with a TA."
3565,1173732,2.5,3.0,"The first few weeks of classes, it will seem like he's all over the place but as the semester goes on you get used to it."
3566,1173732,3.0,4.0,Mirman teachers economics in an extremely math oriented way. He is straight numbers. He get's really mad in class if nobody asks questions. Do the study guide before the test and you'll succeed. Dutch Knockout also if you mess up the midterm. Final is your entire grade
3567,1173732,2.5,2.0,"He's a pretty bad professor, but the class is not very hard. There's no book, so GO TO CLASS. The class lessons and practice sets are entirely math-based (simple algebra); they are what you need to study for the exams. Do not waste your time on the readings he provides. The midterm was somewhat of a challenge, but the final was FAR more easier."
3568,1173732,2.5,4.0,"Mirman doesn't use a textbook, only 3 online readings, ungraded assignments, and two exams. But this class is pretty hard if you don't give effort. Attend class and participate actively, he doesn't like to hear nothing, just give a stab at being bold. Do the homework problems often, the tests will be just like them, and go to the TA (most helpful)."
3569,1173732,2.0,2.0,"He is sometimes funny, and other times he isn't, especially when he picks on you. This class requires very little work, and I actually forget that I am taking it sometimes, except for the fact that I failed the first exam. It is not an easy A, unless you really know the information VERY well."
3570,1173732,2.5,1.0,"Easiest A I got at UVA. Entirely math based Econ. He reviews the previous class every time, so you only have to go half the time. Also does NOT use a text book."
3571,1173732,1.5,4.0,"This guy does not need to be teaching. He is the last person to arrive to class and the first person to leave. If you don't like math or you aren't familiar with the concepts, don't take his class because he has no office hours, no email and no textbook. He usually just jokes around with people. Consider another professor."
3572,1173732,4.0,1.0,"Class with Prof. Mirman was thrilling. He is a very simple and funny man. He explains economics concepts with mathematical derivations, which is extremely practical. If you take this course with a mindset that you want to enjoy as well as learn, then you are almost guaranteed a good grade. Get used to his humor, do the problem sets, and enjoy."
3573,1173732,4.0,2.0,"Mirman is the best!! There is no discussion, and no text book. If you like math, take this course. Mirman takes a very math based approach to economics. Also, make sure you do the problem sets. They are not graded but they are just like the problems on the midterm and final."
3574,1173732,2.5,4.0,"This class seemed hard in the beginning. Professor Mirman doesn't have any office hours or wants to have any contact with students Even so, he teaches to make people understand economics and he is funny. The midterm is hard, but the final is so easy! Even if you fail the midterm, you probably will still get a B or A in the class"
3575,1173732,1.5,2.0,"Consider other options. Fun class, Mirman is hilarious, but if you actually care about your grade, try someone else. No textbook, no office hours, no discussion, and minimal outside work make it fairly easy, but there's also not much you can do if you don't understand the material."
3576,1173732,3.0,3.0,I went in to this class with only knowledge of a macro economics class.  I went for the first 2 weeks and then stopped going until the semester exam and received a 70.5 15 points higher than average. I didn't go to class 2nd half of the semester and got a 99 on the final and got an A+ in the class.
3577,1173732,1.5,3.0,"There are better choices for professors in the ECON 201 class. I came in with some background on Microeconomics, but he still managed to confuse me during his lectures. He's utterly useless when it comes to help: no office hours, no email, or textbook. You could probably learn more about Economics from anybody. Like your neighbor's dog, perhaps."
3578,1173732,3.5,2.0,"Mirman rocks! He's hilarious. He's also a great teacher. Very clear about what he expects from his students and consistently asks if there are any questions. GO TO CLASS! there is no text book. do the problem sets. that is what the tests are like. if anything, go to class for the entertainment factor alone! if you take his class, you'll enjoy it."
3579,1173732,5.0,1.0,"Mirman is amazing. I think that he is a wonderful professor. The concepts he presents are easy to understand, the methods are all logical, and he always breaks up his points with a ridiculously funny comment. And anyways, you have to love his Brooklyn accent!"
3580,1173732,5.0,1.0,"You gotta love Mirman, he?s so hilarious! Go to all his classes, but beware that if you sit up front he may just decide to pick on you. So if you have no sense of humor whatsoever then please do not take his class, but for everyone else who does?take his class!"
3581,1173732,5.0,1.0,"Professor Mirman is the best! He is funny, nontraditional, and his classes are never without interest. There is no book, no discussion sections, and the concepts are all straightforward. Although he seems a little crazy at times, he cares about all of his students. He is a great guy."
3582,1173732,1.5,3.0,"Lectures explain very vague concepts, while problem sets apply both math and concepts. Make sure you figure out how to do the problem sets with quick formulas (of which he sometimes doesn't give in class) because the midterms are based on strictly the problem sets and you have less time do solve problems than on regular problem sets."
3583,1173732,4.0,3.0,"If you like math and logical thinking, you will like Mirman.  Some people don't like his teaching style (mostly liberal arts types).  E-schoolers and TJ kids will do well in his class.  The class is based much more on logic and math than it is on concepts.  Mirman is erratic, but definitely right for some students and wrong for others."
3584,1173732,4.0,4.0,He is very nontraditional in his teaching methods which was good for me but others didn't like much. I think if you just go with it and study and do the problem sets you will do great. I didn't need to take the class but now I am trying to figure out a way to take another one of his courses. I loved this guy but he does have a temper.
3585,1173732,2.0,5.0,"Take this class if you are highly math oriented (preferably taking an elective outside of the e-school only, folks). If you like math or graphing a lot (just for kicks), want a challengingly narrow approach to economics, do not care that your professor is half-crazy, brash and unavailable - then by all means, this class is for you."
3586,1173732,5.0,2.0,Had for 4 courses over duration of college...great teacher; definitely knows his stuff.  Only take if you are math oriented or smart.  Material is hard but he keeps it straight forward and encourages questions (esp. from ppl who look dumbfounded).
3587,1173732,1.0,5.0,"He cancels his discussion sections and doesn't require a textbook.  He teaches advanced material and doesn't offer office hours.  Don't expect any help from him. Also, he has an extremely short fuse and treated the two sections differently.  Try taking another professor if you can."
3588,1173732,3.0,4.0,"Go for Elzinga...  Mirman's last exam:  50% average, 49% median"
3589,1173732,1.0,5.0,"Completely psycho-avoid like the plague...i made a 19 on the midterm, and that is with countless hours of studying and weekly tutors. The average on the midterm was a 49, with no curve."
3590,1173732,1.0,3.0,Avoid this professor! I thought that UVA had only good professors and after taking Mirman I know I was wrong! He is the worst lecturer and he is completely unaccesible if you need help...
3591,1173732,3.0,2.0,He is definitely entertaining and at least usually engaging to listen to in class (though you dont even have to go) the problem with Mirman is he really isnt very helpful if you dont understand the material and his lectures are very disorganized and sometimes hard to follow. Overall its not a bad class just make sure to study hard for the exams
3592,1173732,1.5,4.0,"He's probably insane.  I was one of those people who failed the midterm (and I think I'm a pretty smart dude) because I didn't do the problem sets.  If you can't get into Elzinga's class, I guess take Mirman's, but make sure you do the problem sets and go to every class.  If you screw the midterm up you'll have a hard time doing well in the class"
3593,1173732,1.0,4.0,"avoid him!! take a smaller econ 201 class with a TA, he's soo worthless...and he dresses like a hobo.  He doesn't care about his students, will tell you straight up he doesn't want to meet anybody or have office hours.  DON'T TAKE HIM, he fails everyone on the first mid-term!"
3594,1173732,3.5,2.0,"Funny guy, lectures straight from the text he posts on toolkit. The TA is mostly unavailable, but if you are a math person this a relatively easy class, you just come to lectures because there is no supplementary text to get the information from, try out the problem sets until you understand them, and then you will do fine."
3595,1173732,2.0,4.0,"funny guy, knows his stuff, but only take if u're good at math, cuz he teaches from that perspective; 2 grades (midterm and final); do problem sets because that's what they're based on; most people fail midterm b/c they don't do/understand problem sets, so go to TA for help bcuz prof mirman doesn't want to directly speak to u!!"
3596,1173732,4.5,2.0,Good teacher.  The lectures are a strong indicator of the test material.  The HWs are an even stronger indicator.  Know the HWs inside out (he posts the answers).   Go to lecture and do the HW (not much at all).  His examples in lecture are very helpful.
3597,1173732,3.5,4.0,"He isn't as easy as people say he is! The first half of the semester is a lot harder than the second half. You MUST do the problem sets to do well on the tests, there are only 2 tests so be careful! Don't memorize the problem sets, you actually have to understand the concepts. Go to the lectures because you don't use a book in this class."
3598,1173732,4.0,2.0,"lectures seem clear and understandable, but then the problem sets can be kind of difficult.  if you keep up with the problem sets and go to the TA office hours, the tests shouldn't be that hard to do well on.  as long as you understand the problem sets the class is at least an easy B."
3599,1173732,3.5,2.0,"if you struggle with math, you'll struggle in this class. but if math is your thing, i definitely recommend this class because there's practically no work and if you just do the problem sets a couple days before the midterm and final, you should be fine."
3600,1173732,1.0,5.0,"mirman is bar-none the worst professor ive had at UVa. he is unclear, insulting, and doesnt teach the same things that he puts on the exam. take elzinga and save yourself the torture!"
3601,1173732,1.5,5.0,I wouldn't recommend this class if you aren't inclined toward math to begin with. His lectures consist of very general examples which seem easy enough - but then the problem sets and tests are all applied versions of these examples. Definitely be sure to do the problem sets and go to TA office hours.
3602,1173732,1.0,5.0,he is not a good teacher at all.  he teaches using graphs that do not need numbers but you need numbers on problem sets.  you also don;t get a book or discussion...it sounds good at first but trust me you want the book and discussion because 4 office hours for 300 students just doesn't cut it...and it's not even him its the TA.
3603,1173732,1.0,3.0,I never know what the hell is going on that class
3604,1173732,1.0,5.0,"This man thinks he's a comedian, not an economist. He is funny, but because he makes fun of everyone."
3605,1173732,3.0,1.0,Easiest class ever. Very funny but also a cynical and eccentric guy. Occasionally drops the F bomb. He taught at Cornell for years. Tests are easy but there are only 2 of them. Don't screw up the tests. Do the problem sets! He does not like office hour
3606,1173732,5.0,1.0,the best teacher with the best jokes. he gives everybody good grade. take his class if you want to pump up your GPA.
3607,1173732,5.0,1.0,he is the best econ teacher I have ever met. so cool and gives good grade for everybody. you really learn something in his class and you like going to his class b/c he is a funny man.
3608,1173732,2.5,2.0,"Same thing everybody's saying. Go to class, sit in the front, pay attention, make sure to do and understand all the parts of the problem sets before the tests and you'll ace the class. He's a little out there but no HW, no textbook, can't go wrong."
3609,1173732,4.5,1.0,"Mirman is so underrated!  Everyone goes for Elzinga, but I thought Mirman was a pretty good professor.  I only did half of the prob sets and got a 75 on the midterm, but i did go to class and pay attention.  2nd midterm was really easy since i studied the prob sets more. intimidating at first, but a nice guy...he grades up. No hw and only 2 tests."
3610,1173732,1.0,4.0,"You either love him or you hate  him.  I hate him.  He teachers toward engineering students who can pick up everything very quickly.  Unfortunately, even though I went to EVERY CLASS, I still did poorly on the first midterm.  There are only two tests, 50% each, so be careful!!"
3611,1173732,1.0,4.0,"The 1st exam, people go scores from 40s to 90s, because some people &quot;got it&quot; and some people didn't.   I did the problem sets and went to every class before the midterm, but still got below a 50 on the midterm.  Reason was, I didn't know the PS's ENOUGH.  Go to T.A. office hours and u'll be fine!"
3612,1173732,1.0,1.0,if you know how to do the ps then tests are piece of cake.
3613,1173732,5.0,1.0,"He is helarious. Does lean toward the math end of the spectrum, but it is simple math. You can get a good grade if you pay attention in class and do the problem sets right before the tests. Also, fight for a seat in the front couple rows, it is a completely different world up there."
3614,1173732,4.5,3.0,"if you go to class and do the problem sets as they are posted, you'll be fine.  he teaches it from more of a math perspective, but it's not hard math.  the only qualm i have is that sometimes he gets sloppy when he's writing on the board.  other than that, he's fine."
3615,1173732,1.0,1.0,this class is so easy
3616,1173732,4.0,3.0,"As someone else said, he is a character.  With his New York accent and constantly solving problems by &quot;druah a pictah&quot; (draw a picture aka graph).  As for him being math oriented, I don't think so, although I'm in e-school.  He focuses on the bigger picture, and the concepts, not number crunching."
3617,1173732,3.0,5.0,"This class is hard! He is fun in class, but once you get the test back, he's not so fun anymore...No curve with a 65 class average&#63;"
3618,1173732,5.0,1.0,"People complaining about Mirman obviously take advantage of the fact that he has no outside work.  Just pay attention in class, look over the problem sets a few times, and dont be a heinous fool who has no sense of humor.  I got a 97 on first midterm.  Why&#63;  Because I pay attention.  Plain 'n simple"
3619,1173732,3.5,2.0,"Seems intimidating but is very helpful if you approach him/ask questions. Entertaining too. Though material can be difficult if you fall behind, there is little work outside of class. I highly recommend him. One of my fave profs"
3620,1173732,1.0,2.0,"Promised to consider the latter test if we did badly in the first one and improved in the second test,but didn't keep his promise.Ended up with a very BAD grade.Oh, he swears in class too."
3621,1173732,4.0,3.0,"Mirman is a character.  He thinks he's funny but you probably won't.  If you go to class and do the problem sets you can do well.  He can be intimidating but going to his office hours was one of the best things I've ever done, he is eager to help."
3622,1173732,4.0,3.0,"He is a unique teacher: students either like him or dislike him.  Many students don't have enough time to finish first exam, but 2nd exam is a piece of cake. DO PRACTICE the Problem sets he posts. If u do well on 1st exam, u can easily get an A."
3623,1173732,1.5,1.0,"Bad teacher, easy tests, no work, no textbook"
3624,1173732,4.0,1.0,"Teaches econ from math perspective. No out of class work except optional problem sets. If you understand what he's talking about the class is incredibly easy, but obviously most people don't with a class average of 65 on the midterm."
3625,1173732,2.0,3.0,"If you are considering Econ as a major/minor, DO NOT take his class...He is so uninspiring and his class is boring and repetitive.  The class avg after the 1st of 2 exams was around a 65.  On the upside, there is no required book and he ends class early."
3626,1173732,1.5,4.0,"Horrible teacher.  Flies through lectures, and if you're not quick with math you'll get lost easily.  One time he lost his temper, threw his chalk, and told everyone to &quot;go #%&* home&quot;...take this class if you want a maniac"
3627,1173732,4.0,3.0,Hilarious and engaging lecturer.
3628,1173732,3.5,4.0,"He's not bad. I find him entertaining and pretty easy to follow. He takes the test questions right from examples in class and the problem sets. He teaches econ from a math perspective though, so only take him if you know how to interpret a graph."
3629,1173732,4.5,1.0,The best Econ 201 to take if you like math.
3630,1173732,3.5,2.0,"He cracks on people all the time, its funny as hell.  His writing is hard to follow, but if you do the problem sets and understand them, its an easy A.  No hwk, you get out of class a half hour early every day...cant beat it!"
3631,1173732,4.0,3.0,go to lectures (he even ends them early) and review problem sets and you'll do fine...good teacher
3632,1173732,3.5,2.0,"Great guy, funny...it's kind of a coin toss between really liking the class, and really disliking it. Class was easy if you study the material and do the problem sets..."
3633,1173732,3.5,2.0,"he is hilarious, ends class early, and his tests are easy if you study the material"
3634,1173732,1.0,5.0,this teacher is horrible in lecture and tests are extremely difficult
3635,1173732,5.0,2.0,Lectures are very fun. He teaches economics from a math perspective.
3636,1173732,4.5,2.0,"Go to Class, pay attention.  Tests are okay but know your info."
3637,1173732,4.5,3.0,Great guy if you get to know him. Cares very much about his students
3638,1173732,5.0,1.0,"funny, no book, ends early, simple math problems, can't beat that!"
3639,1173732,1.5,5.0,No Comments
3640,1173732,2.0,5.0,tests are quite hard and abstract

3643,1976549,5.0,3.0,"Phenomenal professor. Some of the material can be dry given that it's an intro course, but Prof. Ali's lectures are lively and entertaining. He clearly demonstrates his passion for the subject and explains things very well. Outside of class, he is easily accessible and goes above and beyond for his students. Take a course with him if you can."
3644,1976549,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Really intelligent, helpful, and passionate about what he teaches. You can just tell he loves to teach and wants to get every one of his students to a new level of thinking. One of the best professors UVA's media program has to offer."
3645,1976549,5.0,4.0,Amazing professor. I took this class as a first year because none of the other MDST classes were open. I went in very intimidated. The class is difficult but gets easier throughout the semester as you get the hang of it. Just be very thorough in your writing and pay attention during the lectures. Readings are very helpful.
3646,1665254,2.0,3.0,Unfair grader. She does not care about the students. Absolutely unclear grading system. She is not respected by the students. Do not recommend!!!!
3647,1665254,1.0,4.0,Not a good TA. Extremely harsh on grading papers. Discussion section were dreadful until she finally dropped the cold call. This class was a pain.
3648,1665254,5.0,2.0,Probably one of the best TAs you'll ever have.  Really cares about her students.. very knowledgeable. Be sure to do the readings and take notes so you can participate in discussion.
3649,1665254,5.0,3.0,Great TA!
3650,379120,2.0,4.0,"I was extremely disappointed by this class. Class time was never used to hear student ideas on the books. Simply, he stood and spoke. Jewish Humor is such a great topic. Yet I found class time boring. If you're looking for a second writing requirement, I do not recommend this class. Perhaps his other classes are better."
3651,379120,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely my favorite professor. I've taken 4 classes with him. He's so kind and is committed to having students understand the material (even topics I didn't think I would like became interesting). He's always happy to meet outside of class, if only to chat. Definitely take any of his classes if you're interested in history and/or Judaism."
3652,379120,5.0,1.0,"Finder is an awesome teacher and an awesome person.  So glad to have taken this class with him, and I highly recommend any of his classes.  Very personable, not overly difficult, but does a good job keeping a class engaged."
3653,379120,5.0,1.0,"Definitely my favorite teacher at UVA. I took his German Jewish Culture and History class in the Fall, and his new class, Jewish Humor class this spring. He is unbelievably nice, very funny, and very helpful. If you go to his office you will definitely end up sitting and talking for at least an hour and he gives you really good advice for papers."
3654,379120,5.0,2.0,"Professor Finder is very, very kind and passionate about his teachings. I took his first year seminar, ""The Nuremberg Trial"" and he was very knowledgeable about the topic. Though there were times it kind of got repetitive, he kept the class alive and well."
3655,379120,5.0,3.0,Professor Finder is extremely nice and well-organized. He could answer your questions even before you ask them!
3656,379120,4.0,3.0,"Very nice guy, cares a lot about his subject, lectures can get a little boring but but you can bring your laptop and distract yourself while taking notes. It is a 300 level class so it requires in depth analysis but all in all im very glad I took his class."
3657,379120,5.0,2.0,"Finder is definitely my favorite professor at UVa. He is very helpful and engaging in his lectures. It's easy to understand what he's saying and the material is especially interesting. He makes himself available pretty much whenever you need to talk with him and his advice is always helpful. Lots of reading, but you don't really need to do it all."
3658,379120,5.0,3.0,"Finder is a great professor and is extremely nice.  Very fair grader, although it may be a little difficult to get an A he's not out to make people fail at all."
3659,379120,3.5,4.0,"Very biased about the material.  Class was three quizzes (he grades hard on) and a final paper.  LOTS of reading assigned, but you don't really have to do it.  Unless you love the topic, I would not take the class."
3660,379120,4.0,2.0,He is very nice and easy to understand.  Lots of reading but it's not really necessary.  Easy quizes if you come to class he basically tells you all the terms.
3661,379120,5.0,3.0,Sooo nice! Quizzes aren't bad if you study the terms. You can tell he really loves the subject.
3662,379120,4.0,2.0,"Finder is a nice guy and he is not that hard but he is very bias and extremely pro-Jewish.  This is a hard subject to discuss; I am not **** but I can easily detect that he teaches with an extreme bias and assigns readings that are similiar.  He is a great person if you ever talk to him, always willing to help, but the class is very slanted."
3663,379120,4.5,3.0,Professor Finder is a great Professor if you are looking to learn more about the Jewish experience during WWII.  He knows his stuff and is very open to different paper topics (class consists of 3 papers that increase in length).  Paper topics ranged from the Jewish underground to concentration camp Kommandants.
3664,379120,5.0,2.0,"Finder is a great professor. Really cares about subject matter and students. In Eastern European Jewish history, he was able to balance tragic and humorous topics."
3665,379120,4.5,1.0,"He is laidback, friendly, and sooo nice."
3666,379120,4.0,3.0,"His lectures are very clear though sometimes boring. I dont think people will ever fail that class, but dont expect an easy A. Good: No exams only papers. Bad: High level of analysis for papers is expected and sometimes it is hard to know what he expects."
3667,379120,5.0,2.0,Best proffesor at UVA
3668,665842,1.5,3.0,Review sessions were pointless and she confused me so much!
3669,665842,2.0,4.0,"No doubt, she's really smart. She tries to help, but sometimes attending her review sessions just makes you even more confused. Received a D in Biol 2010."
3670,665842,2.0,4.0,"jessie definitely knows a lot about biology. however, it's obvious that she doesn't feel comfortable talking in front of a crowd. she mixes up what she's says and stutters when she realizes it. she feels more comfortable and does a whole lot better explaining things when you're asking her questions on a one on one basis."
3671,665842,4.0,2.0,She is very in helping one understand what is being asked.  She is always willing to discuss grades or the class in order to help you get a better grade or be better prepared.  She's definitely the TA to get if the opportunity is presented.  She is very fair and an overall great TA.
3672,665842,4.5,2.0,She's a babe and she knows her stuff.  She's very clear  and explains the material very well.
3673,665842,4.5,2.0,"I agree that she gets pretty nervous lecturing, but she knows what she's talking about. She's really helpful, in class or through email. Though her lectures may seem excessive, they helped with the lab exams, which were 45% a piece."
3674,665842,5.0,2.0,"She's really nice, and willing to help whenever you have questions. She was nervous on her first day, and kind of still is, but it's okay. Sometimes she has a hard time explaining things, but it's obvious she knows what she is talking about"
3675,665842,4.0,2.0,"Although nervous on the first day of class, it's definitely unfair to say that she doesn't understand the material. It's obvious that she knows what she's talking about, she just can't always explain it clearly to the undergrad bio students. She is also sweet and always willing to help or ask questions."
3676,665842,1.5,2.0,Don't expect short labs. She lectures forever and doesn't understand the material.
3677,2681082,1.0,4.0,Strict grading with respect to assignments that are beyond the teaching syllabus. Mandatory group projects are useless and better if working on these alone.
3678,2189562,5.0,4.0,Professor Welch was a very kind and interesting professor. The way he structured class really helps the way you learn the material. he was very approachable if you have any questions. I would definitely choose him over the other professors! Highly Recommend!!!
3679,2189562,5.0,3.0,"Welch is by far the best lecturer to have for chem 1410. The content is the same as all of the other professors, but his way of speaking and use of examples makes the class actually interesting, and a hard one to fall asleep in. Beyond being a great prof, hes also an incredibly nice person. 10/10 would take him if possible."
3680,2189562,3.0,5.0,"Avoid this class if you can. Welch seems like a nice, cool guy but he holds only 2.5 office hours per week which are usually completely full and his TAs don't hold any office hours. His lectures cover only the most basic material of the course, but the tests are extremely hard in comparison. It's very difficult to get any help in this class."
3681,2189562,5.0,3.0,"Kevin Welch is always accessible outside of class and is also very very very accommodating of students and their needs. The tests were pretty straight forward with a few challenge problems if you study. With general chem being a known weed out class, I would highly recommend taking it with this professor."
3682,2189562,5.0,4.0,I took this class online due to COVID-19 so the format of the class was different than most years. Professor Welch was always amazing at explaining concepts and was very open to questions. The tests were slightly difficult and require a reasonable amount of studying but it is reasonable. I definitely think he is the best chemistry professor here.
3683,2189562,3.0,3.0,Cool dude. Bad lectures.
3684,2189562,4.0,4.0,"The layout of this class is constantly changing, so much of this feedback may not be that helpful for a future class. But Welch is a great professor to take into Chem with, he explains things much clearer than the other lecturers and has very funny and well planned lectures."
3685,2189562,4.0,3.0,Welch comes up with the non-chem major orgo lab material but the TAs run the experiments. Concepts are pretty straightforward (especially relative to CHEM 2420) and if you're willing to go to office hours for postlab help the class isn't hard to do well in. Welch himself is very helpful in office hours and for the most part the TAs are too.
3686,2189562,3.0,4.0,"My biggest complaint is how heavy his course relies on TopHat (online textbook). It often felt like I had to teach myself the material through these chapter readings. I also think expos (a discussion-type section of his course) were a waste of time. On a positive note, you can tell Welch is passionate about the material and cares for his students."
3687,2189562,4.0,3.0,"Welch is pretty chill. His lectures are a little scattered or off topic on occasion, but the readings are really good and on topic for the exam. This class is a lot of work but also if you pay attention and don't get behind you can get a good grade pretty easily. If you're going to take intro chem, take it with Welch."
3688,2189562,4.0,3.0,"Welch comes up with the non-major orgo lab course material but the TAs actually run labs. Some TAs are better communicators and grade less harshly than others. Pretty reasonable workload for a 1-credit lab, and not having to code in Mathematica or write lab reports is a huge plus. Welch is super helpful in office hours and very easy to talk to."
3689,2189562,5.0,4.0,"Kevin Welch is an amazing person. He really cares about his students. While the class was very challenging for me, I still passed because of the hefty curve. (The short answer exams could be daunting.) He is really passionate about chemistry, and it shows in his lectures. I recommend this professor, but do not expect an easy A."
3690,2189562,4.0,4.0,"Welch is a great professor and easily the best intro chem professor at UVA but it's not easy by any means. His lectures are clear but you still need to read the textbook. His exams were quite difficult this semester but they were curved up to a 77% mean which saved many people this semester. Overall, difficult class but a good prof."
3691,2189562,1.0,4.0,"I heard lots of great things about Welch. I experienced none of them. His tests were unfair and difficult and the averages were failing. The TAs for the class are useless and his lectures did not clarify anything. Unfortunately, I do have to say that he is the best option for an Intro-Chem Professor"
3692,2189562,4.0,3.0,"He's objectively the best Chem prof at UVA, however his tests can be bewilderingly difficult and confusing at times. He will curve, but it doesn't take away the fact that the exams are really quite awful for Chem 2."
3693,2189562,4.0,3.0,Show up to class and pay attention to his lecture. You don't have to read the textbook. Welch is nice and a lot of people think that he's super chill. Not an easy A but not hard overall. Definitely one of the better intro Chem professor at UVa. There is usually a waitlist to get into his class but don't panic most people will eventually get in.
3694,2189562,5.0,3.0,"Straightforward class. Test questions are like the homework questions, so do the weekly homework and make sure you understand it and you'll be fine. I definitely recommend reading the chapters to fully understand what's going on -- chem isn't easy, but Welch is chill and doesn't try to trip you up. Put in the effort and you should succeed."
3695,2189562,5.0,3.0,I love this man. He genuinely cares about his students and does his best to make sure everyone understands the material. Also adds some humor into his lectures which makes the class more enjoyable.
3696,2189562,5.0,3.0,"Dr Welch was a standard intro chem professor, except his dad humor made waking up early more bearable. The course included online hw on Sapling Learning, which was weekly problem sets. I recommend buying textbook access through there too. Reading quizzes on Collab. We had iclicker questions every day. He had a lot of office hours, as did his TAs."
3697,2189562,5.0,3.0,Good teacher take it with him. He gave out a lot of extra point in 1410. Test are fair but he do occasionally throw in about 3 tricky question each exam.  Your lowest exam score is only worth 6 percent. I mad because he didnt round my 92.8 to a A because the class average was a 85 percent.
3698,2189562,4.0,5.0,"Welch is a great professor. It is important to do the readings before lecture, otherwise lecture doesn't make sense and you're lost. He's very helpful in office hours. He didn't have practice tests this semester, which would've been nice, but moving forward he may. He made chemistry seem light, because of his humor. But chemistry is still hard."
3699,2189562,5.0,3.0,Professor Welch is honestly amazing! He explains topics so well and on top of that he's so funny I love his personality. He always uploads his PowerPoints onto Collab which is helpful when studying for tests. There is a decent amount of reading he assigns but it honestly helps for when he reinforces the concepts during lecture. So glad I had him.
3700,2189562,4.0,3.0,Welch is an excellent lecturer and won't put you to sleep. Power points and written out problem answers from class are always posted online. He has clicker questions in class (not graded by accuracy) that go toward a participation grade. Weekly problem sets are not as difficult as those used by the other chem professors.
3701,2189562,4.0,4.0,"Welch definitely seems knowledgeable about the subjects, and his tests and grading policies are very fair."
3702,2189562,3.0,3.0,"Welch is an excellent lecturer and teacher.  He is very good at explaining difficult concepts.  There isn't much homework aside from reading the textbook and weekly problems sets.  From what I've heard, Welch is the best intro chem teacher at UVA.  He posts all of his lecture slides online so it is easy to get any information missed during class."
3703,1354002,5.0,1.0,"This class was absolutely amazing, and you quickly learn a great deal of really useful Hebrew. I would absolutely recommend the class to ANYONE!"
3704,1575187,5.0,1.0,Really interesting material and he keeps things exciting by using different teaching methods. Really invested and would definitely recommend.  Never did a reading an A on the exam. Definitely take for ease and for interesting class.
3705,2279702,5.0,2.0,"Professor Allen is very passionate about this course, and he makes the content accessible to everyone. He is willing to stay after lecture to answer any questions and gives lots of guidance on how/what to study for the tests. It's important to participate in the discussion section for your own understanding and for participation credit."
3706,2279702,3.0,1.0,"Honestly really liked the class. Can be really boring, but as long as you use the study guides that he gives you, it's really easy to get an A in the class. Study for maybe 3 hours before each exam (including skimming the readings) and I promise that you'll do fine. Trust me, it's not a hard class at all."
3707,2279702,5.0,2.0,"I took his class on Eastern Religions during the summer through UVA Advanced (high school students), it was online though. And let me just tell you he is amazing! I learned a lot from him and his voice just draws you in. He is very passionate about the subject he teaches. You won't get bored, take his class!"
3708,2279702,4.0,2.0,"I took this class during the pandemic so everything was recorded lectures, and he has a really animated voice to listen to, never got annoying or boring. he really takes the time to explain things from a student's perspective. would definitely recommend!"
3709,2279702,5.0,2.0,"Professor Allen is a great lecturer and obviously knows what he's talking about. His class and the material needed for the class are easy. It's easy to feel sleepy in his class but as long as you know what's going on in the slightest bit, you'll get an a on his tests. Not much work outside of class."
3710,2279702,5.0,2.0,"This has been one of my favorite classes at UVa because of Professor Allen. He is such an adorable and awkward little man whose passion for his work just shines when he speaks, and he is lovely to talk to in office hours. He does a miraculous job of explaining really complicated aspects of different religions. Want to take more of his classes!!"
3711,1354008,3.0,4.0,"Not a good professor, there are very difficult tests, boring lectures. Helps to read the textbook."
3712,1354008,5.0,3.0,"I think this guy is actually a pretty good professor and lecturer. He makes the topic interesting and easy to learn, but the tests can be tricky."
3713,1354008,1.0,5.0,This professor was one of the worst I've had at UVa. He is a very non-engaging professor and expects you to memorize his powerpoints for the exams. His exams are nothing you've seen before and he is a very tough grader. There were only two grades for the semester (2 exams). He is also very snarky and unhelpful in office hours. Avoid this professor.
3714,1354008,2.0,3.0,"There isn't a textbook, so he expects you to rely entirely upon his lectures. There were only 2 grades (a midterm and a final). Very unorganized and unclear lecturer. Doesn't write test questions that gauge students' understanding. For the most part they are either trick questions or extremely obscure. Readings are arbitrary."
3715,1354008,1.0,3.0,"Awful professor. Extremely disorganized. Readings unnecessary. You must be in class because the powerpoints are not helpful at all; take notes on what he says. Cheerful guy, but he is not fit for teaching, nor writing tests. He is delusional in his expectations; it took a month to get midterms back because they were free response and he has 0 TAs."
3716,1354008,1.0,3.0,"Very unclear, ramble-y lecture style. Minimalistic slides do not aid comprehension. Snarky and unhelpful during office hours. Would avoid class with Lerdau if possible. Nice guy but terribly boring and unorganized professor."
3717,1354008,1.5,5.0,"Professor Lerdau is an extremely unclear lecturer. He thinks that you come to the class already with a good understanding of difficult topics when in reality, most people have not taken an EnviSci class since high school. Consequently, he explains things rather poorly. He is also a tough grader, you essentially need to memorize his lectures. "
3718,1354008,3.0,3.0,He loves what he does which makes it worth taking. Not all that easy. But most of the tests are short response. He is lenient when grading them and if you understand anything about what you are saying he'll give you a good grade. 
3719,1354008,2.0,3.0,"Professor Lerdau makes an easy class difficult.  His exams either consisted of memorizing every detail off of his lecture slides or ""what if"" type questions that did not correlate to what he lectured in class.  On our final test he wrote questions that he later admitted were unclear and poorly written.  Avoid taking Lerdau if possible."
3720,1354008,3.0,2.0,"The material that he is teaching is not all that difficult to grasp, but his method of teaching is more complicated than it should be. He focuses a lot on the specific equations that define the concepts, which turn out not to be very important. Also, he has not told us our grade on either of the first two tests and its been at least two months."
3721,51490,1.0,4.0,"Hill is the worst professor I have ever had. His course is so interesting, but he makes the material dull and unlearnable."
3722,51490,5.0,4.0,Prof; Hill is the best. the material is so fascinating and I must say that he's a great lecturer as well. very calm and clear. Tests can be tricky and challenging but if you study the power points and take good notes you should have no problems at all.
3723,51490,1.0,5.0,"Don't take this class unless you absolutely have to. Lectures are *not* &quot;entertaining and engaging.&quot; I found it incredibly difficult to pay attention to his lectures. Learned a ton from the textbook, but exam questions are extremely specific + heavily lecture based. If you don't write down everything he says, you're not getting an A."
3724,51490,4.0,2.0,Four tests is the entirety of your grade. If you don't show up to lectures you won't get an A; test questions are almost ENTIRELY lecture-based. Book helps a lot and goes into more detail than you need but it's all really cool stuff. He's easy to understand and the tests are easy imo but people often found them tricky.
3725,51490,1.0,5.0,I took his class because it was a requirement for general graduation. His tests are littered with trick questions and don't ever expect to get an A unless this is the only course you're taking. 
3726,51490,3.5,2.0,Mr. Hill gives really great and understandable lectures. The tests aren't terrible as long as you're in class everyday and study before the exam. The only  negative I would say is that he seems really condescending whenever anyone asks a question but still his lectures are funny and the material is actually interesting.
3727,51490,1.0,5.0,"The single worst class I've ever taken. Review sessions are utterly useless, unless you really want to be talked down too every Monday.  Trick questions for absolutely no reason on every single test. He tells you don't need to study something, only to put it on the test anyways. If you absolutely have to take this class, FIND ANOTHER TEACHER."
3728,51490,1.5,5.0,"His tests are nigh impossible- the multiple choice may actually make them worse. Interesting material, but extremely droning to listen too, which is a problem since he wants you to know every bit of minutia he has to spout. Unwilling to budge an inch on unclear test questions. You will NOT get an A, no matter how much you study. "
3729,51490,3.5,3.0,"He's really engaging and i enjoy his side stories and remarks. He really loves what he teaches and he gives you the information you need multiple times. Reading the book helps. Tests are a little tricky, but overall the class is not as hard as it seems and I found the material really really fascinating. "
3730,51490,4.0,4.0,"alright listen, this class is not as bad as everyone says it is. he is kind of boring, but repeats things to make them clear, so you always leave lecture understanding the material. the tests are tricky, but if you study for a few hours & read questions & textbookcarefully you will get an A or a B. tests comparable to an AP bio test in high school "
3731,51490,2.0,5.0,"Doesnt care about your grade.  He's fine with a C average for an intro class. Tests are basically impossible. Tests are all 5 multiple choice with trick questions like ""two true, one false"". I took this class for interest, and though it's interesting material, you wont enjoy studying 10+ hours for a test to receive a B-. Hope you enjoy memorization"
3732,51490,3.0,4.0,"David Hill is a fascinating and interesting lecturer. I found the material incredibly interesting, and was motivated to study throughout the semester. Unfortunately, tests are often poorly worded, and generally filled with ""trick"" questions. If you study, you will get a B, but I have yet to meet a student with an A average in the class."
3733,51490,1.0,5.0,"Extremely tricky tests. No amount of studying will help you there. He's rude and condescending during review sessions. Also led us astray with the wrong info several times, then tested on material he messed up. Would not recommend."
3734,51490,5.0,1.0,"Probably the greatest professor at UVA! I looked forward to going to class everyday. He was funny and awesome, and the stuff he taught us was just plain cool. I would recommend him to anyone. I would retake this class every semester if I could."
3735,51490,5.0,1.0,"I found this class enjoyable, and while it was easy, it was still valuable and intellectually stimulating.  Professor Hill is very helpful and truly cares about his students.  I became ill with the flu and missed 1.5 weeks of class, and he volunteered to make time in his busy schedule (during advising week no less) to allow me to ask questions."
3736,51490,2.5,5.0,"This class was a rickroll, should be in the biology department (we skipped the chapters that were relevant to psych, like emotion). Says tests are easy and they're not. He can be funny, but mainly awkward. Unless it's a requirement, avoid!"
3737,51490,2.5,4.0,"NOT EASY. he says it's an easy class- and he's lying. at least for me, it has absolutely nothing to do with psych. he's entertaining though."
3738,51490,4.0,2.0,Awesome teacher. I enjoyed going to class. He was funny and entertaining. Explains things pretty well and the book can generally clear up confusion. I really recommend going to class because the majority of whats on the test is talked about in class and while the ppts and book are helpful you won't do as well on tests without being in lecture.
3739,51490,3.5,4.0,"Hill was a good professor despite the fact that some of the time he would make the material a lot harder than it should be. Beware: his tests are not as easy as he says, and can be quite tricky. I would also recommend always going to class because the slides don't really tell you much if you don't. Overall a good class. Recommend him for psyc 220"

3742,51490,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Hill is AWESOME, psychobio is easy as hell, as it should be being an introductory course to a not-so-familiar topic. He is not an ass about wanting to fail people and rather wants them to do well."
3743,51490,5.0,3.0,"I love this guy.  Man, he is great.  Try to get him to go off in a tangent and talk about how much he loves his dog or how he's deaf in one ear.  Absolutely hilarious.  Took extra time to make sure everyone understood the material.  One of the best teachers I've ever had."
3744,51490,5.0,2.0,"I LOVED HIM!! Professor Hill is one of the best teachers I have had at UVA. Don't be fooled, this isnt really a psychology class at all but it is not difficult, especially if you go to class. The reading is not impossible and can be done right before the tests-which I recommend. Great class! You are allowed to drop one test, including the final!"
3745,51490,5.0,3.0,"This is the best class I have taken at UVA. Prof. Hill is an awesome lecturer and the material is really interesting. As long as you go to class, the tests are pretty easy. I highly recommend this class!!!"
3746,51490,5.0,2.0,"loved this class! very good teacher. always made sure everyone understood the concepts, & took a lot of extra time to explain it if you didn't. its a somewhat hard class, but not bad if you put forth the effort. awesome professor."
3747,51490,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher makes things funny but the class is kinda hard, if you dont read the material."
3748,51490,5.0,1.0,"One of the funniest teachers I have ever had. You can do nothing for this class and get a B, but an A requires a lot of extra effort. A great class even for non science majors."
3749,51490,5.0,2.0,Its a fun class and he makes it as interesting as possible. Takes time to make sure students understand and very helpful. Tests are easy with a few trick questions but overall a great class.
3750,51490,5.0,1.0,"Extremely clear in giving the concepts. Extremely straightforward definitive questions on tests, making them very easy. Good advisor. Even if you were taking 18credits, adding this 3credit course wouldn't hurt at all. It is easy and very interesting material."
3751,51490,5.0,2.0,"Really funny guy.  Class is pretty easy, as long as you go to lecture and skim the reading, you should do ok"
3752,51490,5.0,2.0,"A very good teacher, really takes the time to explain concepts fully.  Most test questions are easy, but he always throws in a few tricky ones so you have to be careful because there aren't that many questions on each exam."
3753,51490,5.0,1.0,"Exams are a cake-walk, powerpoints are clear and concise, and he gives clues to which things will the tested and which won't.  Very easy and stimulating class."
3754,51490,5.0,2.0,He's hilarious
3755,51490,4.5,2.0,Funny guy.  Easy Tests.  Offers to answer questions several times each lecture to make sure everyone's keeping up.
3756,51490,4.5,3.0,No Comments
3757,51490,5.0,3.0,"He doesn't teach from the book, so sometimes reading assignments are redundant, but his tests are harmless as long as you pay attention in class.  He's funny & offers to answer questions ALL THE TIME!  Great class.  Great prof."
3758,51490,5.0,1.0,thinks he's really funny...but always cracks a good joke or two
3759,51490,4.5,3.0,"dh is hilarious, great sense of humor..best lect i've ever had. semi-hard tests!"
3760,51492,2.0,5.0,"Lectures were extremely boring (literally I would feel like I was going to fall asleep) and the tests would have many questions from completely left-field. Even the test I studied for for AGES and repeated all the information 3 times I only got a B on WITH the curve. I liked the subject, but not the class at all."
3761,51492,1.0,5.0,Grading was ridiculous. Tanked my GPA as a fourth-year. Her lectures contradict material in the book. DO NOT TAKE
3762,51492,1.5,5.0,WORST class ever!!! Test are so hard and grading is sooo unfair. DONT TAKE IT.
3763,51492,4.0,3.0,"I liked this class because I found the material interesting. Although her lectures are kind of boring, she posts the slides online so you can view them later. Tests a lot of details from the textbook so make sure you actually read and know it all. For Spring 2011 she gave us 3 midterms but no final exam which was great!"
3764,51492,3.0,5.0,"Lectures are really quite boring - she reads almost straight off of slides, however I recommend you attend because she tests video clips that are not posted online. Gives super detailed exams that test really specific information from BOTH textbooks. Study HARD and DEFINITELY join a discussion section."
3765,51492,3.5,1.0,"Class was pretty easy.  If you read the book you should be able to get an A.  Class can be pretty boring though.  Take the discussion section, it's pretty much a guaranteed A as long as you don't skip or neglect the assignments. Reccomended."
3766,51492,1.5,4.0,"Do not take her if you value your interest in psychology! Perfect example of a teacher who can drive an interesting subject into the ground. She is incredibly boring, takes almost no test material from lecture, and a test question could come from something mentioned in a single line of the book. She's a nice person but a bad professor."
3767,51492,1.5,2.0,"Look she is boring and her lectures are not necessary to attend because she puts the slides verbatim online although videos are not there. I went to class 40% of the time and still got an A. Read the book, go over slides, make a study guide before each of your three tests and you will be fine! There is no final and join a discussion its an easy A"

3769,51492,4.0,4.0,Patterson is an interesting lady-- very approachable. Lectures are dead boring but I would suggest going just to reinforce readings. She does show fun film in class. I read the book cover to cover and still got a C so study. Go to her extra lecture once a week...helped alot for what was on the exams.
3770,51492,3.5,3.0,She wrote the book-- so its like she lectures to you in your apartment.... Expect to know the book word for word as the exams are picky with that stuff....  Very good lecturer tho...
3771,51492,5.0,2.0,Attending lecture is not mandatory and is pointless if you aren't interested in the material to begin with. Studying the book is a must on tests.
3772,51492,5.0,4.0,well organized and interesting instructor
3773,51492,3.5,1.0,"Relatively easy class. Must attend lecture and must read book b/c exam questions come straight from both.  Annoying exams b/c book questions are very detailed, but all MC so not entirely bad. Don't take discussion for granted since TA points [25] are straight points for your class grade. Overall, very interesting material and worth taking."
3774,51492,4.0,2.0,"Seems like an easy class and for the most part it is, except for how the test questions from the book are very detailed. At times, I wondered why I ever came to the lecture. Unless you're pretty interested, lecture is pretty much not necessary."
3775,51492,5.0,3.0,"This class is one of the most interesting I have ever taken. Discussion TAs were really good, and the lectures were always interesting. Be sure to read the book very carefully because most of the test questions are facts from the text. Overall, a really good class that you can get alot out of."
3776,51492,3.5,3.0,"There is a lot of reading for the class (the entire textbook), but the book is well written and interesting.  Most of the questions on tests are from the book, so read carefully.  There are very few questions on tests from lectures and she put the slides online, so going to class can be pointless."
3777,51492,4.0,4.0,"I enjoyed lectures, although they were very self-explanatory and not worth going to.  She puts all lecture slides online, only has 3 midterms (none of which are cumulative), and there is no final.  The test questions are almost all from the book with very picky details emphasized, and there is a lot of reading.  Overall, a good professor."
3778,51492,4.0,1.0,"I never went to class or studied and i got a B. She curves the grades and there are only three tests, with no final. Not that hard, but not that intertaining. Lectures were semi-interesting but you don't have to go. Discussion is a must though, although its not hard. I'd recommend it."
3779,51492,2.5,4.0,"i took child psyc just as a fun elective and ended up getting a C in the class...her test questions are not based on lecture material, the book, OR multimedia - she pulls them out of thin air! the lectures, while terribly boring, do present interesting material, but the tests are so ridiculous that it definitely was not worth taking..esp. &quot;for fun&quot;"
3780,51492,3.0,3.0,"I didn't like the class very much, my TA was nice and Dr. Patterson is also very nice, but it can be very boring and then the tests pull information from the oddest places in the text, lectures, and multimedia. If you have an interest in child psyc then you should take the course, otherwise there is probably something else to fill the requirement."
3781,51492,2.5,3.0,"i was very interested in child psyc before i took this class, but this class turned out to be one of the most boring classes i have ever taken!! she's so repetitive and my TA is a real tough grader for reaction papers!! i only go th the lecture because she puts certain stats from the calss notes in the exam. i don't really recommend tis course."
3782,51492,4.0,2.0,"Her lectures may never show up on exams, but they are very interesting and full of videos. She seems to know a lot about the subject and is very passionate about it. The class is not super hard and the exams are not cumulative, which makes focusing on each section a lot easier."
3783,51492,2.5,4.0,"lots of media, but completely irrelevent. She's a nice lady, but the tests are ridiculous. The answers to questions can literally be found in a single sentence of the book. Many questions which are taken directly from the CD have the wrong answer listed, so BEWARE"
3784,51492,4.0,2.0,"I enjoyed this class; the lectures were solid and interesting with video clips thrown in.  Yes, she goes through her slides a bit quickly, but if you know how to take good notes it shouldn't be a problem at all.  Those who complain are the ones who try to write down everything the prof. says.  Grades on papers depend on TA, & tests = strghtfwd"
3785,51492,2.5,4.0,"I was disappointed with this class.There was a solid amount of reading, but Prof.Patterson does a horrible job integrating what we read into her lectures, so keeping up with the readings at times seems pointless.The grading for the reaction papers was random at best and clear directions were never really given on how one can improve them.TESTS=HARD"
3786,51492,2.5,4.0,Just an all around poor class. The professor did not focus on important aspects and then expected you to know them for the test.....Dont even get me started on those reaction papers.
3787,51492,1.0,4.0,"Just bad.  What can I say&#63;  Spends too much time on irrelevant material, but not enough on the important stuff.  Lectures are scattered everywhere, and her exams are really random.  Seems nice, but I can't even tell you if she has that going for her either."
3788,51492,1.0,4.0,"Lectures were very unhelpful, scattered, and did not focus on important aspects concerning the text or subject matter.  Instead, she chose to use unimportant anecdotes and uninformative videos.  She flies through key concepts and dwells on useless photos and videos.  Overall, BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD"
3789,51492,3.5,3.0,Lectures are interesting but if you miss one make sure to get someone's notes! Study both notes and book for tests and the CD- many questions from there. I really enjoyed this class.
3790,51492,1.5,3.0,"Lectures are poorly designed.  Lots of media, which is good--but a lot of it really doesn't help.  Tests are confusing, yet refuses to tell you what to expect."
3791,51492,4.5,3.0,"great professor, great class"
3792,51492,2.5,2.0,"The class is some what easy, Patterson is also a little hard to talk to.  Just make sure you read and study for tests.  Also go to the grading TA with questions- she or he will be more likely to help you then Patterson."
3793,51492,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, really made the class fun including lots of video clips and other media."
3794,51492,3.5,2.0,relates a lot of her information to her own parenting experiences
3795,51492,2.0,3.0,"good professor in lectures, but no good if you miss something one day she flies through the lecture.  also, tests are extremely ambiguous, poorly written, and designed to cause problems.  she will tell you she is not out to make it difficult, but she is."

3799,51492,3.5,4.0,"tests try to trick YOU!  seems really easy,  but the tests are poorly designed"
3800,682278,4.5,4.0,Best professor I've had at UVA.  Brilliant but abstract thinker--sometimes its hard to decipher what he's trying to tell you.  You end up learning a lot more than printmaking in his classes.
3801,682278,3.0,4.0,"Dean is wonderful.  It's up and down with him, but just have confidence in yourself, take his criticism, and learn from the experience.  Go visit his office hours."
3802,682278,5.0,4.0,Excellent instructor and mentor
3803,682278,4.0,4.0,Dass is odd but thorough.
3804,682278,5.0,3.0,this teacher is extrememly dedicated; he offers plenty of criticism but in a very helpful and diplomatic manner. his enthusiasm is infectious. he takes enormous and unselfish pride in the acheivements of his students. he's outstanding!

3807,174377,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Marshall is now teaching at Temple U, and I am currently taking IH2 with her. I think Prof. Marshall is a nice professor and a kind woman, she just has very solid opinions and they do have a lot of influence on the way the class is run. Its not that I disagree with her standpoint, its just that she is very firm with it."
3808,174377,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Marshall is at Temple University now. She was very empathetic towards students, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. She genuinely cares about people and it shows. She definitely has firm opinions and can come off as abrasive but its because she is passionate about social justice and likes to debate."
3809,174377,5.0,1.0,"She was teaching at Temple when I took her class. She has very intense opinions, but always offers students in class to voice theirs. She may not agree with what you say, but always looks for opportunities to help you grow as a student, and more importantly as a person"
3810,174377,1.0,1.0,"Disorganized beyond belief, but it works in your favor just show up most days and collect your A at the end of the semester "
3811,174377,4.0,1.0,"She listens to what you have to say, so do not be afraid to speak up if you think any of her assignments are too difficult. Anyways, write a 500 word blog every week and do some of her main assignments which are not hard and you will be fine. Don't try to think of the grade too much just focus on class and enjoy!"
3812,174377,4.5,3.0,"She is a critic in the best traditions of the term, and her classroom is a place for spirited debate in service of improving everyone's argumentative rigor. Yet she does not walk you through step-by-step what she is doing, and her style may seem jarring for undergrads used to having their hands held."
3813,174377,5.0,1.0,She was the best! I loved how she completely changed the truth to make me feel better! I don't want to know facts- I just want to feel all is good. I like how she can share in Lysergia.
3814,174377,4.5,4.0,One of the best professors to grace the halls of our University. I learned more from her than anyone else during my four years. It's a shame that UVA couldn't appreciate her for her brilliance.
3815,174377,5.0,4.0,The best professor I have had UVA. I have learned more from Wende than any professor I have had at UVA. She is a phenomenal person who cares so much about her students. I'm sorry she won't be around to give other UVA students the experience her class has given me.
3816,174377,5.0,4.0,"One of the best teachers at the University.  Did not agree with a lot of her opinions, but she welcomed a debate. Will challenge you on so many levels."
3817,174377,4.0,1.0,"She has very strong opinions but it was a great class. All the readings were on the internet, no books. Easy to talk to. Participate in discussions and you'll do great."
3818,174377,5.0,5.0,FABULOUS!!!
3819,174377,5.0,5.0,She's the best professor I've ever had.  UVA needs more profs. like her around.  No one here speaks the truth and brings issues to the forefront like she does.  She is def. one of the only profs. that isn't afraid to say what's really going on around here and in this country.  She's absolutely amazing and  totally hot!

3822,174377,2.0,1.0,unbelievably miserable.
3823,174377,3.5,2.0,"This was definetly one of the better teachers I have ever had. She feels very strongly against biomedicine and makes sure everyone knows it, but her views are really interesting. Definetly a must-take, she's a very fun teacher!"
3824,174377,5.0,1.0,Anyone pursuing a health care career MUST take this class!  It was thought-provoking and inspiring.  I STRONGLY recommend this class as well as RELG 265 to those on the pre-health track.
3825,174377,2.0,1.0,"I have to agree with the person who said she was biased.The class was a study of her opinion,and she pulled topics from her butt 5 minutes before lecture.Very disorganized;the syllabus, and the grading format changed about 4 times the semester.Easy class, though; if you want an easy A,take her;if you want to learn something,there are better profs."
3826,174377,3.5,4.0,"Usually would read her own lectures she had given at conferences. Lectures were boring, but the articles were fairly interesting. Spent most of the time listening to students give their opinions and Marshall arguing with them. Strongly against biomedicine, but did a good job presenting her case."
3827,174377,5.0,4.0,One of my favorite teachers and the reason I pursued Anthropology. An inspiration and a blessing. My best friend and I attended her classes together and are better off.
3828,174377,5.0,3.0,"Great class, probably one of the best profs at UVA"
3829,174377,3.5,2.0,"I found her class to be thought provoking and interesting.  However, she has a severe issue with anyone she deems as coming from the &quot;privileged class.&quot;  I don't know what her deal is, but I had a really difficult time talking to her because of"

3834,2197810,5.0,1.0,"Lilian is a super sweet lady. She is a bit disorganized, but she always makes up for it and makes sure that everyone participates in class. Her tests are easy and straightforward; as long as you pay attention you'll get an A."
3835,2197810,4.0,2.0,Prof Feitosa really cares about her students.  Lots of homework but not difficult.  She makes her requirements very clear and as long as you put in the work you will get an A.
3836,2197810,5.0,2.0,"She is SO nice and happy and a very lenient grader. If you're really there to learn, you'll get an A.  There are oral exams and one group project. There is a lot of online homework, (normal for UVA languages) and it isn't hard, just time consuming and due whenever you have a test. She speaks really fast, but I highly recommend this class."
3837,485682,5.0,3.0,"An engaging, phenomenal lecturer. His passionate for literature is infectious, and he makes sure you have a solid understanding of works even if you didnt read all of them. Hes genuinely invested in students success. Hes also great at making class relevant and fun, often making jokes and allusions to current media. Overall, a great person."
3838,485682,5.0,3.0,"He is so kind, he really cares about his students and their work and is actually interested in helping his students learn, which shouldn't be a novelty at a University but it is. Definitely recommend his class."
3839,485682,3.5,2.0,"This is really great class because of the digital project, which is interesting and a great way to cushion your grade. O'Brien makes sure to give you more than enough time on even the smallest tasks. He is an expert on Samuel Johnson, so class discussions are always interesting. He's an easy grader if you follow his instructions."
3840,485682,3.5,3.0,"O'Brien is a nice guy.  The class, however, is a topic I'm not very interested in and took it only for a requirement.  If you're interested in 18th century theater, he's your man.  However, it's quite a bore in my opinion.  I did most of the reading and took little of value away.  Forgettable, but otherwise not too bad."
3841,485682,5.0,3.0,Lectures are a bit boring but overall he's a nice guy who really loves this stuff! Just do the reading. one performance (not a big deal tho) Midterm is easy. two papers...he's kindof a tough grader. You learn alot though and it is pretty interesting! I reccomend him
3842,485682,3.5,3.0,Smart man who just doesn't lecture enough.  Class is missing out on a lot because of his teaching style--class discussion.  He has a lot more to offer than the students get.
3843,485682,1.5,5.0,No Comments
3844,1067317,5.0,3.0,"You can tell he's really interested in what he's teaching. If you listened in class and did the work, then it wasn't hard to get a good grade, The professor was extremely helpful, there is no reason anyone should have gotten a bad grade in this class."
3845,1067317,2.0,3.0,Obviously didn't know what he was talking about and wasn't clear on the material.  Didn't teach what needed to be taught to do well on the midterm and final.  He once showed up to discussion ****.  Do not take any class with him if you want to actually learn the material.
3846,2197821,4.0,2.0,"This class is not hard if you pay attention in class and do most of the reading. Prof. Clowes is super nice, just beware that the tests require a good amount of memorization (like specific dates and artists). There are two tests and a good amount of small assignments to boost your grade."
3847,2197821,4.0,3.0,"Professor Clowes is a very considerate professor who knows a great deal on the subject of Russian culture. She assigns a decent amount of reading, but she's very realistic and doesn't expect you to necessarily finish it all. The classes can be a bit dull at times, but that's more of a question of taste and how interested one is in the material."
3848,2197821,4.0,3.0,"I think that Professor Clowes is an incredibly caring professor and really wants the best for her students. However, it is important to be warned that this is a CULTURE class, not a HISTORY class. Also, while all of the reading is super interesting, it isn't always worth it to do all of it, but it is all very interesting if you have the time."
3849,2197821,3.0,3.0,"I took this thinking it was modern Russian culture. This class is ONLY Russian history, so be forewarned. It's not that hard; study guides for the midterm and final, and no other tests or quizzes. One project at the end, group or solo, but there are basically mini essays due every day. A lot of reading but I skip a lot of it and I have an A."
3850,1927497,5.0,2.0,"Professor Pasero-O'Malley is easily one of the best teachers I've ever had. He cares so much about his students and their learning. I would recommend him without any hesitation. If you get the chance to take a class with him, do it. The class emphasizes participation but this was not difficult and helped me to learn."
3851,1927497,5.0,3.0,Estupendo. Uno de los mejores profesores del castellano del mundo. Fantastic professor and all-around nice guy. I've never seen a professor more animated while teaching. Even if one wanted to sleep one wouldn't be able to becuase of how exciting he makes even the most banal aspects of Spanish literature. Highly recommended.
3852,1927497,5.0,2.0,Amazing Spanish professor. I absolutely disliked Spanish and was discouraged that I had to take it again in college but Professor O'Malley made it my favorite class of my first semester. He'll make you feel excited to be learning Spanish. He's the man! 100% recommend! 
3853,1927497,5.0,3.0,Span 1060 is a difficult and time consuming course. Professor Pasero-O'Malley was an EXCELLENT professor. Aways helpful and did his best to be available to students and help them succeed. He is kind and very energetic. He makes a difficult class more open and fun. Participate! But he always encourages you even if your answer is wrong!
3854,1927497,5.0,1.0,"Professor O'Malley is awesome!! Having an 8AM is never fun but he made going to class worth it. He's really engaged and wants you to learn and do well and so he puts a lot of emphasis on participation (but you end up wanting to participate anyway!). One of my favorite professors so far at UVA- if you can take a Spanish class with him, do it! "
3855,1927497,5.0,3.0,Super enthusiastic & Helpful! One of the best teachers I've had at UVA so far! 
3856,1927497,5.0,3.0,"Professor O'Malley is really into Spanish. Being in an 8AM is tough, but he comes in with a bright smile on his faces and bounces all over the place. It's really hard to not pay attention or to fall asleep because he's just everywhere, but in a good way. "
3857,977227,3.0,4.0,"Going to lectures is absolutely a waste of time besides the Learning Catalytics questions. He reads off slides in the most boring manner and I think I left every lecture retaining nothing. The practice exams given to prep for exams are representative of the actual exam, but I immediately got a tutor which is the only reason why I didn't fail"
3858,977227,1.0,5.0,"lectures are such a waste of time, but you have to go to get clicker points. cannot teach worth anything, literally just reads the examples through and doesn't explain how to do them. also is rude when you try to ask for further explanation on a problem. highly don't recommend."
3859,977227,1.0,1.0,Make sure you show up to every class or he will penalize you harshly. Doesn't really know how to lecture so just be prepared for this man to waste your morning flipping through powerpoint slides. I'm going to some how scrape a Pass/Fail and that's only bc of corona.
3860,977227,4.0,4.0,"Because of the corona and consequent personal matters I missed the finals. He zoom called me and let me take it the next day. I didn't attend class often, but that's something I'll always appreciate him for. His tests aren't that bad, homework's pretty easy, lectures are boring except that damn Jaguar XKR, but he's a real one."
3861,977227,2.0,3.0,"Lectures are just a ton of examples with little explanation on the concepts. I usually like examples, but at times it felt like him just reading off numbers and equations from a slide."
3862,977227,2.0,3.0,"Meh Professor. Jaguar XKR. Really slow at everything: grading, lecturing, even starting class. But at least there are JAGUAR XKRs"
3863,977227,1.0,5.0,"While Professor Dukes is a better professor than the other option, it does not at all mean he is good. While Physics is obviously not my best subject, all year I had still tried hard. Attended all classes, did all my homework, read the textbooks but it amounted to nothing, tests are very hard, final even harder. Only come to class 4 clicker points"
3864,977227,5.0,1.0,dukes is the single realest professor at uva. dudes class is easy. attendance is optional but i mean this man spits hot fire in his slides so you're going to definitely want to catch him spit that real. this man made my physics grade rise like jesus' second coming son. shoutout dukes shoutout america word. 
3865,977227,1.0,5.0,Worst professor. Killed mu interest in physics. His lectures are worthless. 
3866,977227,1.0,4.0,"He's a jerk. Treats graduate students who work for him like crap. He doesn't nothing but fool around with younger women while someone else does all his work grading papers, etc. Better off working at mcdonalds than being anywhere near him."
3867,977227,2.0,4.0,boring. lectures are unecessary. he puts his slides online. his examples are nothing like the problem sets or the tests. you're better off reading the textbook than going to class.
3868,977227,2.0,3.0,Lecture was completely worthless.  We learned lots of facts about the Porshce 911 Turbo 3.6 (the car he wishes he owned).  Just learn the equations on your own....you don't need the lectures to take the tests.
3869,1280343,5.0,2.0,"Although it was only an ENWR class, Cara made it interesting for me. She truly knows her subject. I have emailed her with questions, and she always responds quickly and with clear, helpful information. I do not think of myself as a good writer, but I have definitely improved because of her."
3870,1280343,4.5,2.0,"Cara's class was one of the most insightful and interesting classes I've taken at UVA, and she's just a grad student! The reading list is fantastically interesting; it's a lot of stuff you've always wanted to read in an academic setting but never have (like Sherlock Holmes, for example). Highly recommended."
3871,1280343,5.0,3.0,Cara is an amazing! She's an extremely knowledgeable teacher--it's clear that she really spends time building a syllabus and really cares about her students' progress and really loves english and teaching. Really great reading list and always extremely engaging
3872,1280343,5.0,2.0,"I had Cara for ENLT 2552, and absolutely loved the class. Although I did not enjoy all the books we read, this class introduced me to some great writers, and spurred many great discussions. If you have an English requirement take Cara's class!"
3873,1280343,5.0,3.0,"I had Cara's class at 8 am but never wanted to skip because it became one of my favorites. She's extremely approachable and easy to understand. She challenges you, but is fair about it. I definitely feel like a better writer because of her. ENWRs can really suck sometimes, but Cara made it bearable/fun!"
3874,1321308,5.0,3.0,His lectures are well organized
3875,1321308,1.0,4.0,Not organized. Hard to understand. Doesn't care about the class whatsoever. Just avoid!!!!!
3876,1321308,1.0,3.0,"He doesn't care about this class. Read from slides and explain common sense for 30 minutes. Final paper was 15 pages with single space. Don't think he actually read my paper because it was absolutely horrible. He is not that terrible because he still gave me nice grade. However, if you want to learn something with that much tuition, avoid!"
3877,1321308,4.5,3.0,was really thorough and explained all the proofs well.
3878,1321308,1.0,5.0,"Once I spent an entire class trying to figure out that he meant ""bias"" and ""association"" when he said ""bears"" and ""a social issue."""
3879,1321308,1.0,5.0,Don't waste your time going to class because you won't anything. A graphing calculator will literally give you almost all the answers so if you learn how to use it and read the book for content understanding you will do fine.  This is probably the worst class I will ever have to take at UVa
3880,1321308,1.5,4.0,"3 exams and assignment. Zhou's explanation is very bad. 95% of my understanding came from reading the textbook and reading his slides from my room. Exam is pretty hard, though is quite fair because few obscure material. Need to put extra effort in this class. I will get a B+ or A depending if he curves."
3881,1321308,1.0,4.0,"I don't the the professor helped understanding the materials, and I ended up study all by myself."
3882,1321308,1.5,5.0,Worst professor I have ever had.  Nice guy...terrible teacher.  If you take his class you'll spend most of your time teaching yourself the material.
3883,1321308,1.5,5.0,"This professor is clearly very smart and knows what he is doing, however he does a really poor job of making sure the students know what they are doing.  This class sucks. Do not take unless absolutely necessary."
3884,1321308,1.5,5.0,"Seems like a nice guy, but is very hard to understand. The TA's are helpful though. Does nothing to help students actually work out the problems on either the calculator or excel. In short, you will end up having to teach yourself. It helps immensely to have taken this class in high school."
3885,1943906,5.0,3.0,"Paul Bourdon is an excellent professor. He makes difficult content accessible, and is incredibly kind and caring. I can't say enough nice things."
3886,1943906,5.0,3.0,"Professor Bourdon is one of the nicest math professors you will find. He doesn't make you feel stupid at all, but he relates to you when things are difficult and helps to break things down. He is not only extremely welcoming and helpful, but he is so sweet and has silly jokes. He gives plenty extra credit opportunities and is very responsive."
3887,1943906,5.0,3.0,"He's a great guy, knows what he's doing and very helpful. Tests a bit hard but by all means manageable."
3888,379245,5.0,5.0,"Congratulations on 40+ great years, to the Best Professor that has been on the University of Virginia faculty in my lifetime. Please enjoy your retirement, Sir:   you are well deserving of every accolade for your genuine and generous heart."
3889,379245,4.5,4.0,A great professor
3890,379245,4.0,3.0,Fr Fogarty is one of the BEST professors at UVA. He genuinely wants each of his students to succeed and will work with you to understand material.  You're a fool if you don't attend his office hours. Go to the BBQ that he has at his house and become besties with him. G. Fogs is best!!!!
3891,379245,3.0,3.0,"Father Fogarty is a very knowledgeable man, but because he knows SO much he often goes off on to tangents not related to the point of the lecture.  Lots of times the lecture is not chronological so it can be confusing. The class started strong, but then got harder and harder to follow as the semester went on."
3892,379245,2.5,5.0,"A very nice man and excellent priest-the worst professor. His lectures often digress into personal anecdotes. The class is definitely biased towards Catholics. The essay questions on exams are overwhelming and the multiple choice questions are designed to trip you up. When note-taking, stick to his outlines (provided on collab)!"
3893,379245,4.0,4.0,Father Fogarty is one of the best professors I have ever had.
3894,379245,3.5,4.0,"Prof. Fogarty is one of the best professors I have had at UVA.  He is incredibly knowledgeable and cares deeply about his students. He is a tough grader on exams, but if you get to know him, he will remember that when it comes time to give grades.  There is a reason he has taught here for over 30 years...because no one is more qualified than he is."
3895,379245,4.5,5.0,"I learned a great deal from Fogarty and his class on Catholicism even when I though I knew my faith!Fogarty might be hard to follow at some points, but he's more than willing to answer questions and clarify.He is very smart. Do the reading- it adds significantly to the class and helps with your understanding."
3896,379245,3.0,3.0,"Father Fogarty is extremely knowledgeable and fun to listen to if you're interested in the subject, and he's definitely easier to understand if you have a background in Christianity. The lectures and notes are very disorganized and he's often unprepared, so be ready for anything."
3897,379245,2.5,4.0,"Bascaically, everyone who has previously written a comment...they are all catholic or christian.  If you are not, then dont take this class, b/c it is exremely biased against you.  I have taken many religion courses, and this has been the only one that has had an underlying assumption that you are of the religion being taught."
3898,379245,2.5,3.0,"Class pace is painfully slow.  He’s a well-intentioned man with a good heart, but the class was incredibly boring and disjointed.  Often forgot the materials he needed in order to effectively lead the class and it crippled the discussion.  Overall extremely frustrating and a class I dreaded going to."
3899,379245,3.5,4.0,"Prof. Fogarty is an amazing person, and probably the smartest man I have ever known.  Sitting down and having conversations with him is fascinating, so definitely go to his office hours.  He loves getting to know his students.  The class is no joke, and the rading is kind of boring most of the time.  He can be a bit unclear during lecture too."
3900,379245,4.0,4.0,"the readings are massive but the class is well worth it. Fr. Fogarty is everything a professor should be. though he can be a bit confusing sometimes, he's very open to talk with students in clarifying abstract topics or just about anything else."
3901,379245,4.5,3.0,"Father Fogarty is great. Although his class is hard, you can tell he really knows his stuff and is passionate about Catholicism, which is important in a professor. I learnt a lot from this class although i found it really hard at times. but it was worth it."
3902,379245,5.0,3.0,"Fr. Fogarty is great. His class is always interesting, peppered with amusing anecdotes, and he is very available outside of class.  He is concerned about his students and overall, is just an awesome man.  I'd definitely recommend this class.  Although there is a lot of reading, it is worth it."
3903,379245,4.5,3.0,"He's awesome! Sometimes confusing, but if you do the readings before class, you'll understand. He knows so much, it's unbelieveable. He really cares about the students and is there for anyone who wants help or just wants to talk. He is exactly what I think a professor should be and I learned so much"
3904,379245,4.5,3.0,"Father Fogarty is awesome! Some people say the readings of Rahner, etc. can be challenging, and he sometimes is confusing in lecture (which can be true) but even they like his class a lot. He is really high up with Church leaders and is the smartest professor at UVA."
3905,379245,3.5,4.0,"He's a really nice guy, and I learned a lot about Catholicism, but his classes get somewhat boring and a lot of concepts are abstract and hard to clarify."
3906,1239407,3.0,3.0,"Not as easy of an A as everyone says it is. It is doable though, I did end up with an A but it took some work. The homeworks that are due every week take 2-4 hours and some can be pretty challenging. The exams aren't too bad. Just follow the previous exams he puts on Collab. Not a great lecturer but going to class helps."
3907,1239407,2.0,4.0,His lectures are a common cure for insomnia.
3908,1091955,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Betzer is an extraordinary mentor. In my 3rd year she turned me around to ARTH, and changed the way I see the world. She is thoroughly knowledgable, and draws connections from philosophy and literature to physics and psychology. Her lectures have a captivating narrative flow; she is very helpful in office hours. Take her and you will grow!"
3909,1091955,2.0,4.0,"I LOVE art history, but I HATED this class. This was my second semester of taking an art history class and betzer wasn't comparable to my last teacher. She pretends to be passionate about the subject but it is SO fake and she seriously repeats herself 20 times. SO annoying, take a different class."
3910,1091955,3.5,3.0,This class is amazing. Professor Betzer is extremely knowledgeable and her lectures are very interesting.
3911,1091955,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Betzer is intimately familiar with the ins and outs of Art Historical Theory over the last century or so.  More often than not her guided discussions led me to a much more complete understanding of philosophy, and her encouragement of debate and discussion between students provided helpful contrasting views about each topic.  Hard but worth it!"
3912,1091955,4.0,4.0,"A wonderful lecturer & her lectures always flow very smoothly & are extremely informative. Lots of info covered in each lecture. Her voice IS very soft & very soothing & yes, its a bit hard to stay awake, but it's worth it. LOTS of reading required for sect. discussions, and very interesting, but sometimes very dense. Midterm was HARD, great class."
3913,1091955,4.0,4.0,"This was my absolute favorite UVA class. She is an enthusiastic, informed, and helpful lecturer. Her tests are extremely fair, and always relate back to her lectures.  She is very clear, and interesting, though her voice can be soothing, and sometimes it is a bit hard to stay awake."
3914,1091955,1.5,5.0,"Very disorganized lecturer. She's very nice and you can tell she likes the subject, but it doesn't really help.  She's a hard grader and treats her students like children. She chose the most random slides for the final. I don't recommend her class."
3915,1091955,4.5,3.0,This class was one of the best I have taken at UVA. Betzer is enthusiastic about what she is teaching and the readings are actually interesting. Exams are extremely fair and easy as long as you study. She is definitely not unreasonable. She is incredibly interesting and helpful if you take the time to go to her office hours.
3916,1091955,2.5,4.0,"This was the  most boring class I have taken at UVA.  She is extremely dry and pretends to be overly interested in the material, it's gets annoying and old after about two lectures.  The textbook and her lectures contradict themselves! I wouldn't recommend taking a class with her ever"
3917,1091955,3.0,5.0,"While the class material was interesting, it did take some time so be prepared to read because she will do cold calls or require you to read outloud from your weekly journal response. The professor was quick to favor students whose beliefs and ideas paralleled her own."
3918,1853816,1.5,3.0,"Very knowledgeable on all things art (especially contemporary), helpful with exhibition installations. However: extremely condescending, unclear in instruction, self-important, unprofessional, hypocritical, downright rude in general. I have never had such a bad experience with a professor."
3919,1673601,5.0,2.0,"Take CHIN 101 with Sun Laoshi! She is the kindest teacher and will do whatever she can to help you. She's also pretty funny! If you do your homework, study before dictations/tests, you will receive an A+!"
3920,1673604,4.5,2.0,"I had never taken a psych class before and really enjoyed it! I didn't do as well on the tests as I wanted to but I never read the book.  Going to class isn't necessary, but you should because she makes the lectures fun and interesting."
3921,1673604,4.0,3.0,"Professor Trawalter tries to make her lectures interesting and funny! She is very approachable and will help you if you ask for it. However, I found her tests difficult; it's like you knew the material but the choices given were so close to each other, you didn't know which to pick! This class has 2 exams, 2 papers, and 1 final. Received an A-."
3922,1370505,5.0,2.0,Instructor is very helpful and continously invites classroom feedback. I found class to be easy primarily due to instructors effective teaching style and encouragment of classroom participation.
3923,1370505,5.0,1.0,"Not the best professor I've ever had, but far from the worst.  Extremely nice.  Bends over backwards for everyone to do well.  Reviews extensively for tests.  Will not seek out to ruin your life, instead will try to make you enjoy the class and the subject.  Recommend him."
3924,1370505,2.0,1.0,"Class is a joke.  Stopped reading around the 3rd week and still got an A, lectures are boring and hard to follow and, although you're supposed to attend, are useless because he puts up powerpoints."
3925,1370505,3.0,1.0,Very easy. Dumb slideshows. Pretty shocking that he is a UVA prof. Take for a gut class. Try to get an easy TA.
3926,27031,5.0,3.0,"Ditto.  Take Mills.  Fair, Clear, Helpful.  You'll get as much out of it as you put in!"
3927,27031,5.0,4.0,"Ditto.  Take Mills.  Fair, Clear, Helpful.  Work and you'll get out of it what you give."
3928,27031,4.5,4.0,"Very nice guy, but the class was not as easy as I expected.  Homework is done in groups, which was a pain.  Overall, it was a pretty interesting and applicable class, but you have to work hard, and it's not an easy A."
3929,27031,4.0,3.0,"Great professor! Very knowledgable and clear. It's one of those classes that if you work hard, you'll get rewarded. Very fair."
3930,27031,5.0,3.0,"Best econ prof. in the dept. Clearest teacher at the univ. Seriously, his lectures are very informative and easy to follow. Also, he gets 10 points in my book for being smart enough to figure out that you can use the air conditioning and still be heard by using a microphone!"
3931,27031,5.0,2.0,"Take Mills, it's a great class"
3932,2050456,5.0,1.0,"Easily one of my favorite profs of first semester. Shane gives awesome lectures, is clearly passionate, and quizzes and final are straight from lectures, so make sure you read them. I joined this class two weeks late and copped an A- so for most people if you study well you will do fine. Black Holes is a must-take with SHANE!"
3933,2050456,5.0,1.0,"I took Black Holes with him, it was a really easy class but still interesting. He is a great guy, very funny and gives good lectures. Would definitely recommend"
3934,2050456,5.0,2.0,"Shane is the man!! Material can be complicated at first glance but ur boy Shane will get u through it. I just took this class for the lols as a first year looking to take some interesting classes, and I would def recommend. Not all black holes -- lots of other physics/astr stuff, but all good. Office hours are 10/10, study a bit &amp; ur good."
3935,2050456,5.0,1.0,"First things first, this class is the Black Holes class (since ASTR 1559 is the mnemonic for new classes or classes that are irregularly taught).   Prof. Davis is honestly the best professor I have had at UVA. He was able to explain complex topics with ease and made this course very exciting. He was clearly passionate about what he was teaching,"
3936,559519,5.0,1.0,he is the best
3937,559519,4.5,3.0,"He's not in town much which makes him hard to meet with, but he's smart, funny and a good discussion leader.  The only negative is that he can give the impression that he doesn't really care about the group/wishes he wasn't there.  Oh, and did I mention that he's a total heartthrob&#63;  ;o)  Take him if you can."
3938,559519,4.5,3.0,"He was a very good TA, he made discussion section interesting."
3939,559519,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3940,559519,1.0,4.0,gone
3941,559519,5.0,2.0,Cool guy.  Good discussions.  Warning: he flirts with the ladies.
3942,559519,5.0,3.0,lovely and brilliant
3943,559519,3.0,4.0,He is pretty smart and is good at facilitating discussion during class.  He can be a little bit intimidating when you need to talk to him one on one.  Pretty easy going and relaxed.
3944,559519,5.0,3.0,"Talal is very fair, very smart, and very hot... Take him"
3945,1493426,4.5,2.0,Molly is down to earth and keeps sections fun. She's a good TA who knows her stuff and as long as you pay attention and participate she'll keep it interesting.
3946,2517428,1.0,5.0,"Not a psych major, but this class was so dull it was almost impossible to sit through. Horrifically unpleasant teacher, the material clearly made sense to her but she made no effort and had no success trying to present it in a way that made sense to literally anyone else. If you want to enjoy college stay far away from Nicole Long."
3947,2517428,1.0,5.0,"Probably the worst professor I've ever had, extremely rude and makes it super difficult to get a good grade in her class. She does not want students to do well, beware because this class was an absolute nightmare no matter how much I studied. "
3948,2517428,1.0,4.0,"Professor Long has poor knowledge regarding the subject & often answers ""I don't know but I can guess"" when asked questions in class. She has only memorized material and has no humane touch to her work. I am a lover of neuro and have taken multiple neuro classes. She is the only professor who has managed to make the content dull"
3949,2517428,1.0,5.0,Prof. Long was really hard to reach and get feedback from; she doesn't let students see what they got wrong on the tests unless they make an appointment with her (or a TA). The tests were unnecessarily difficult. I enjoyed the material but it was so much effort to still get a terrible grade.
3950,2517428,3.0,4.0,"Attendance isn't mandatory and all lectures are posted online. She drops the lowest exam grade out of 3 and the lowest 5 quiz scores out of 10. Material is lecture heavy, but textbook is needed to supplement that info and only that info. Assessments can be difficult, but can also be easy once you know what information to focus on."
3951,2517428,3.0,5.0,"This is now a 3000-level course, which it was not when I took it, so I can't pretend I'm not a little bitter about that. Even still, I can't pretend like I wasn't super interested in the material. Prof. Long does a solid job teaching a really interesting subject, but you really need to study hard to pass. This class is no joke, seriously."
3952,2517428,1.0,4.0,"took this class fall 2019 and absolutely hated it. material was so interesting but lectures were just so dull. she read from the slides pretty much word for word. exams were so detail oriented. you have to memorize the material inside and out if you wanna pass. there's barely any application, just pure memorization on the most useless concepts."
3953,2517428,3.0,4.0,"I like this class, but it is pretty difficult. Professor Long does her best but sometimes rushes through lectures when she could have gone a little slower and more in depth. I haven't used the textbook at all, and the tests are based entirely off of the lecture powerpoints. Missing any day of lecture will be extremely detrimental."
3954,379330,5.0,4.0,Kevin is the last true professor.
3955,379330,4.5,4.0,Kevin is a great artist and inspiring teacher. Extremely dedicated to his students and to &quot;art makin'&quot; in general. A wonderful mentor and friend.
3956,379330,4.5,2.0,No Comments
3957,379330,4.5,2.0,"Eye-opening, profound, insanely intelligent, and inspiring.  Classes aren't structured too well, but it gives the artists in the class the freedom to create."
3958,379330,5.0,3.0,"He's pretty intense and swears more than any human alive. But if you can get past that, then you will learn SO much about filmmaking - 16mm, baby. He supports his students 100% (will go to your plays, events, concerts, etc.) and will do anything it takes to help us make that art! KevEv is the MAN."
3959,379330,4.5,2.0,Kev is the man.  What an original.  You will have way too much fun in this class and make some cool art in the process.
3960,379330,5.0,2.0,"Kevin Everson (kev*), is WONDERFUL. Learn how to make films using cool old cameras; take this class! Recently, short listed for an oscar in short experimental film, the man has talent.  Plus, he's utterly devoted to his students--even takes them to NYC!"
3961,788933,5.0,1.0,"SLAV 2360: Dracula was an easy and fun A for me. Professor Stepanic is an entertaining lecturer, and the grade was largely based off of a lot of simple lecture and textbook questions. He made everyone feel welcome and never tried to talk about some political agenda. Warning: the class talks about some violent and sexual stuff."
3962,788933,5.0,1.0,"Stepanic is clearly very excited about what he teaches and maintains a casual, enjoyable class environment. Emphasis is pretty much entirely on learning and participation; there is zero reason to be concerned about grading in this course. Would recommend for anyone interested in Polish language or culture."
3963,788933,5.0,1.0,"TAKE THIS CLASS! Stepanic is awesome, the material is fascinating, and the lectures are engaging. For the final, we even got to do a LARP game in the Rotunda. If you have the chance, you have to take Dracula!"
3964,788933,5.0,1.0,Professor Stepanic is a great professor who doesn't assign much work. Exams are done online over several weeks and are open-note and open-book. His lectures are interesting and he's extremely approachable. Readings aren't really necessary if you go to lectures (which you should for participation) but you need the book on Top Hat to do homework.
3965,788933,5.0,2.0,"My favorite UVA professor by far! You can tell how much he actually loves what he teaches. I took the summer session and he made waking up early every day enjoyable with film clips, interesting facts, and his enthusiasm on the topic. On top of being a great lecturer, he's a really cool person if you take 5 mins and talk to him too. Take this class!"
3966,788933,5.0,1.0,"My favorite professor at UVa hands down, and across all of my education. Passionate about his subject, eccentric, approachable, interesting, all around awesome. His Dracula class is incredible and is the only class I have only been sad about missing because of a snow day. 11/10 6 gold stars"
3967,788933,4.5,2.0,"Stepanic is a great lecturer, and he has constructed a very intriguing course for UVA students. There are three research papers throughout the semester, and a midterm and a final. Exams are 10 identifications, and papers are straightforward. Also: no outside reading needed if you go to class every day! Lectures are great, so get to class!"
3968,788933,4.0,2.0,I absolutely loved this class. I looked forward to going to lecture everyday and you don't have to do the readings if you go to class. Prof. Stepanic is extremely intelligent and I came away from this class with so much knowledge on the topic as well as random facts he shared along the way. If you're looking for an awesome class TAKE THIS ONE!
3969,788933,5.0,2.0,"I absolutely loved this class. No reading is required (though they are recommended & posted) but basically as long as you do your papers and listen to lecture you should be set. Professor Stepanic is also super intelligent and full of knowledge. I honestly looked forward to going to class everyday. If you're looking for an awesome class, this is it"
3970,788933,5.0,1.0,"This class was awesome! First off, it's about vampires...everything from demonology to the origin of the vampire to vampires in pop culture. There were 4 5-page papers that were graded so easily (when you go to pick them up, you can see that just about everyone got 25/25 on each essay). Never read books and got a 99 on the final. Awesome AND easy!"
3971,788933,5.0,2.0,"I LOVED this professor. The class was always interesting and he was VERY approachable. This was overall my best class I've taken in college. He keeps you engaged and is fair. If you do the reading and come to class, there is no reason you shouldn't get a good grade. If you can take a class with him, I'd HIGHLY recommend it."
3972,788933,4.5,2.0,"This guy knows everything about Russian!  I didn't like the book we used, but it wasn't his fault.  It was a previous book from another professor who started the course.  Stan and his assistants did a great job making the class better for us!"
3973,788933,5.0,3.0,Excellent instructor.  Able to pull together everything important and teach it in such a fresh and interesting manner!  Willing to go the extra mile for students and do the right thing.  Incredibly honest!
3974,788933,5.0,1.0,"An amazing class, and an amazing professor in every respect. Tests exactly what he teaches, lectures are actually interesting and at least a third of the class is watching movies. If you're physically able to, take his class."
3975,788933,5.0,3.0,"Greatest class ever.  I don't think I've ever had a class where everything was so clear and comprehensible.  Really opened my eyes to how much a simple piece of folklore has affected so many things.  Very helpful, fun, yet stern when he needs to be."
3976,788933,5.0,4.0,Wow!  Awesome is all I have to say!  Take his classes!
3977,788933,4.0,3.0,Stan IS awesome.  I don't really think he's a weirdo even though he feels like everyone thinks he is.  The class was engaging. There were a lot of entertaining movies and the lectures after the first few weeks were cool. definitely a class I'd recommend if he is teaching it.
3978,788933,4.5,2.0,LOOOOVE HIM!
3979,788933,4.5,2.0,Lots of fun! Easy to understand when compared to Perkowski who turns his class into his own E! True Hollywood Story. I enjoyed going to discussion although he wouldn't share his nuts.
3980,788933,5.0,2.0,Stan is great. He is very helpful in clairifying what the professor rambles about in lecture.
3981,788933,5.0,1.0,"STAN IS AWESOME!!! Really cool person in general, he has a lot of insight on what he teaches, and makes the class very enjoyable. He's really easy to talk to, and if you stay awake and listen then you'll do well in the class. I plan on taking any class he teaches."
3982,788933,5.0,2.0,"Stan was one of the best TA's I've had. He grades a little hard thoguh :(. Overall, he is an effective teacher and made going to discussion fun and informative at the same time."
3983,788933,5.0,2.0,"stan was an awesome ta, and actually a significantly better teacher than the professor of the class. very interesting, very approachable, and clearly very intelligent. if you have to suffer through this class, take your discussion with stan."
3984,788933,5.0,1.0,GREAT TA. The lab's were great. He is just like one of the students. He jokes about silly things that the professor does in lecture. He definately made the class tolerable.  And doesnt really ask you to do anything other than show up and listen.
3985,1051087,4.0,1.0,"Easy class but very boring.  Stay awake, make a few comments each class and you'll get an A."
3986,1051087,4.5,2.0,The most organized professor you will ever have.  Good Guy. Monotone voice but so easy to follow.  Class isn't the most thrilling but its useful.  Definitely recommend.
3987,518612,5.0,2.0,"Professor Rawlings was a phenomenal lecturer. You get a sense that he deeply understands effective teaching: he uses emphasis stunningly well and appropriately, delivers extremely succinct, informative comments, and in general conveys the material very intelligibly. His knowledge and ability to interpret passages in Thuycidides is also incredible."
3988,518612,5.0,1.0,"Great Professor.  Participation is the majority of the grade (roughly 60%), so make sure that you do the readings (and really think about them).  Also, he is a visiting professor from Cornell, so understand that any papers you have to do will be graded on an &quot;Ivy-level&quot;.  Not hard as long as you contribute to class every time."
3989,518612,5.0,3.0,"Really interesting ready, awesome lectures.  Papers and exams were fair and engaging, one of my favorite classes I've had at UVA... highly recommended."
3990,518612,5.0,2.0,"Good professor. The exam the papers depend heavily on the reading, while the lectures help provide you with essay ideas for both. Counts participation in final score."
3991,518612,5.0,3.0,"great class. he is a very good prof, clear, nice, funny, all around wonderful. A LOT of reading-i wish i'd done it all-because it was all great stuff. if you aren't really into it though, it would be too much to read. i would recommend to anyone interested in the material. exam worth too much-40%"
3992,518612,5.0,3.0,"excellent professor, entertaining class, really interesting material, challenging, provocative"
3993,657878,3.0,4.0,Tough class; not an easy A. He goes through a lot of material not in the book and tests are all essay-format. I recommend taping the lectures since he tends to go fast. Worst part was he never had office hours and waited weeks before posting slides. Make sure you know what you are getting yourself into...
3994,657878,3.5,5.0,Professor Grainger is disorganized and very fast lecturer. Tests are not easy and need to take very good notes in order to do well. He goes over a lot of stuff/experiments not in the book and you need to know all for the test.Do make good use of his office hours to understand concepts.
3995,657878,5.0,3.0,"I love Dr. Grainger!  His tests weren't easy; go to class or have someone take good notes for you then read up on what he lectures on in the text.  If you do this, you'll be fine; he is very fair.  And very likable."
3996,657878,5.0,3.0,"An obviously brilliant guy and a great teacher. Keep ahead in class, because he's sometimes disorganized and assigns readings at the last minute... (He's distinguished-looking, maybe, but not really hot.)"
3997,657878,5.0,3.0,"really nice, good teacher"
3998,657878,5.0,2.0,Very good indeed.
3999,936408,2.5,5.0,"There are six papers that he assigns and each are five page double-spaced. He's a very harsh grader and the papers are usually extensive research on a certain disease or syndrome. Sometimes, he will put you on the spot and ask you what you would do if you saw certain symptoms. Be ready to work hard. This is not a drill. "
4000,936408,4.0,1.0,"dayton is kind of cynical and if you make a bad 1st impression ull be on his bad side for the year. lectures are kinda boring but the practical stuff is awesome. the tests are online and u can take 2x (with the corrected 1st attempt in front of u). no one gets below an A. must take for pre-meds, nurses, or anyone interested in cpr/first aid"
4001,936408,5.0,1.0,"Dayton teaches the CARS emt class and this occasionaly counts for UVA credit. Dayton is a great teacher and you learn alot, plus he is the squad cheif, so its good to be on his good side. EMT class is not hard and is a welcome break from more traditonal classes."
4002,2058714,5.0,2.0,"Because of the large class size, it can sometimes be difficult to engage with her, but she lets you know that she's available if you need her. Attendance is taken through Learning Catalytics. She assigns homework reviews once a week and there are two quizzes and two labs. Pretty low-stress class that provides good information on astronomy. "
4003,92648,4.5,1.0,"She has a very thick accent, but once you get a week or so into the course she's understandable. Her lectures are very clear although she doesn't always have the best idea of whether or not students are following her. Tests are easy."
4004,92648,4.5,3.0,"Marja is a very sweet lady. At first her accent and mannerisms are somewhat surprising, but she honestly is really helpful and just wants you to do the best you can. Her explanations are good and she writes a lot of helpful notes. If you need to take Calc 3 she is the person to take it with."
4005,92648,4.0,4.0,She is a nice lady and is very interested in the subject matter. There was a good amount of homework but then again it was 4 credit hours. I would definitely take another class with her. She writes REALLY fast in class but provides lots of her examples.
4006,92648,3.5,2.0,Has a hard accent to understand for some and some of her partial derivative signs look like other things so note taking can be annoying. she usually does a good job explaining things and if you go to office hours she is very helpful. she was kind of stingy on partial credit though so make sure to show all work on the tests. she knew the material.
4007,92648,2.5,3.0,She is very nice and means well. Her tests are pretty fair also. Lectures tend to drag on... she spends every minute of classtime gunning through topic after topic. She often writes lengthy proofs during class -- a waste of time in my view. Could just as easily learn this class from the textbook.
4008,92648,4.5,2.0,Best math teacher ever
4009,92648,4.0,4.0,"She was a bit hard to understand at first, but if you try, you'll get used to it in a little bit. Once you get past that, she's actually a very good teacher. Also, she's extremely helpful if you go to her office hours. I learned half a semester worth of stuff in half an hour. And it's not her fault that calc II is the most failed class at UVa"
4010,92648,2.0,4.0,Hard to understand what she was saying. Her tests and quizes were hard too.
4011,92648,4.5,4.0,"Pretty hard class, the average grade for my section for the tests was usually around 60s. However, i thought her lectures were pretty helpful and there was an abundance of review sessions and TA hours. (tho Santhana didnt seem to kno wut he was talkin bout) Overall, i thought it was a worthwhile class and i was happy with my grade."
4012,92648,2.5,3.0,Take Beck if you have a choice!!!
4013,92648,1.5,4.0,Can hardly understand a word she says.  All lecture notes and example problems come directly from the book and do not reflect the problems on the test which are much harder.
4014,92648,1.5,3.0,i cant understand a frickin word she says
4015,92648,1.0,5.0,Not helpful at all. I was forced to teach myself from the book the entire time.  Tests are very hard.
4016,92648,1.5,4.0,"I couldnt understand her at all, even when she tried to explain herself, she has bad handwriting too"
4017,92648,1.0,3.0,She doesn't communicate clearly.  I failed that class.
4018,92648,3.0,3.0,No Comments
4019,92648,4.5,3.0,Best math course I've ever had.
4020,92651,1.0,5.0,"She is the worst professor that I have ever met in my LIFE. As the below review said, she is extremely arrogant, super rude, doesnt care about students. If you want to fail the class, she is the one. Honestly, AVOID HER AT ALL COST. Thanks me later. Goodluck."
4021,92651,1.0,3.0,"Negative reviews I've seen on here about stonewalling and arrogance are very accurate. Never answered emails for me or others I knew in the class (in an online class at that), was rude to students, and was not much help with assignments and/or just didn't care. A select few of the readings are interesting but be prepared, there are a lot of them."
4022,92651,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Catherine D. Baritaud is an absolute GEM! I took her class and she is the best professor of all time. She values honesty, integrity, and treats all students with respect. She gave me a grade I deserved. She deserves to be tenured!"
4023,92651,4.0,4.0,"I took Prof Baritauds Utopias and Technology class in Fall 2010. The class consisted of 4 historically significant readings on fictional utopias and a group project on a tech innovation that brought society closer to the ideals seen in the readings. Looking at the class a decade later, it was one of the most formative classes I took at UVA."
4024,92651,5.0,4.0,"I think she is one of the best instructors I've had in my (few too many) years in school. She is a demanding teacher, and definitely doesn't coddle you. She can be terse/blunt, and she can be kind of a hard-ass. But this is all perfectly workable *for students who show up and put in the effort*. She's fair, but firm. And her lessons stuck with me."
4025,92651,1.0,3.0,"STS 1000 itself is a joke, avoid it if possible. (You CAN DROP, it really is NOT required) I would suggest taking a writing course if you want to practice. Also Baritaud's bad joke sometimes make me uncomfortable, and she's neither friendly or helpful. Homework are pointless reading and nonsense reports "
4026,92651,5.0,3.0,"Professor Baritaud is a knowledgeable, excellent professor who truly cares about her students.  She may assign more work than other STS professor, but all of her assignments build upon each other and ultimately help students understand the material.  I would recommend her to anyone taking these courses."
4027,92651,1.0,4.0,"Obvious Northeastern Type. Displayed blatant favoritism and I honestly felt stonewalled whenever I spoke to her one-on-one. She also had no idea what she was talking about, applying an ideal view to non-ideal real world situations. If you want to work your ass off for mediocre grade in a mandatory STS class, this is the teacher for you."
4028,92651,3.5,3.0,"A great person. Not really easy to understand. You need to come up with really creative stuff for your essays, thats how high she grades you. Not everybody likes her, but she has been a very good professor and an advisor to me. She would help you in anyway so that you succeed."
4029,92651,1.0,2.0,nice person- terrible teacher
4030,92651,1.0,5.0,"Oh, god, I've got so sick of her."
4031,92651,1.0,4.0,She's pretty bad and had no idea what she's talking about.
4032,92651,1.0,1.0,"i would say that the sts department is obviously a redundant division of engineering school that need eliminating. Having a teacher like Baritaud who knows little, grades randomly and assign awkward essay makes you disdain the reputation of UVa engineering school. This is just a shallow useless class which shouldn't be taught in engr schools"
4033,92651,1.0,2.0,She is terrible.  The class needs a fact checker for her words
4034,92651,1.0,5.0,"i would have thought the university of virginia would have had higher caliber &quot;professors&quot; than baritaud .. she exudes arrogance which is a mask for her real inability to teach effectively.  grades are given randomly to students and if you fail to suck up, you're in for a nightmare.  if she's the your only available teacher, skip taking the class."
4035,92651,1.5,3.0,"Definitely a terrible professor. She is the worst I have ever seen. She sometimes will judge the students by appearance, and completely ignore any student she doesn't like. DON'T EVER EVER TAKE HER CLASS."
4036,92651,1.0,5.0,"Baritaud is an interesting professor.  She is one of few that does not have a Ph.D., she has a very limited knowledge base, and she tends to be exceptionally worried about anyone clarifying that she is often wrong.  If your goal is to learn, to be treated fairly, and to enjoy your STS experience, be sure to stay far away from her."
4037,92651,5.0,4.0,"AWESOME teacher!! So nice and very willing to help!! if possible, TAKE HER! i would love to have her again!"
4038,92651,5.0,4.0,She truly cares about her students and teaches cross discipline skills that are paramount to the success of any engineer.
4039,92651,4.5,3.0,"Amazing professor, she really cared about us.  She even brought us cookies one day to have after getting back our first paper.  Could be confusing at times, but if you go to her office hours, she's the best lady.  I absolutely loved this class, and will try and get her again if possible."
4040,92651,1.5,5.0,"Baritaud is one of the least qualified professors I had at Virginia and covered up for that by repeatedly making things up.  She completely ignores people she does not like and has absolutely no care for anyone.  Indeed, she seems cold to people that she doesn't like.  If you're not one of her special students, stay away from her at all costs!"
4041,92651,4.0,5.0,"She is really nice and cares! Her drawings make you laugh! Some of the readings are really interesting and others were horrible! Sometimes directions were not clear. Overall good class, caring professor- would take it again."
4042,92651,1.0,5.0,Not very nice. Definitely has favorites.
4043,92651,4.5,4.0,Pofessor Baritaud has to be my favorite professor this semester. She really cares about you and your future in engineering. She is very approachable. I would definetly take one of her classes in the future.
4044,92651,4.0,2.0,"Slightly crazy but funny. Will do anything to help you, she actually cares!"
4045,92651,4.0,3.0,"Second week of school my grandmother died. I emailed my profs to tell them I would miss some classes for the funeral. Ms. Baritaud was the only prof to follow up. She gave me a hug when I got back, offered to have coffee with me and gave me an extension on a paper because my math class was not going well. She's a wonderful and I enjoy her class."
4046,92651,4.5,2.0,great professor! really interesting lectures but she expects perfection on papers. She's willing to point you in the riht direction on papers and give you good ideas.
4047,92651,2.5,4.0,"Be prepared for unorganized syllable.If you get into her class, try your best to make her like you for the sake of your grade!"
4048,92651,2.0,4.0,"If she doesn't like you then it is going to be very hard for you to get above a C the papers. I recommend reading everything assigned and participating as much as possible in class. If you don't, your best papers in her class will only get about a C. And forget about knowing what your grade is. you won't know until ISIS knows. Very bad grader. Avoi"
4049,92651,1.0,5.0,All her STS class sucks~!!!!don't believe her when she invites u to take her class
4050,92651,4.5,3.0,"She makes herself out to be mean, but she's really not. Plus, she is very supportive of her students - while you are in her class and even after you have taken it."
4051,92651,1.0,4.0,No Comments
4052,92651,5.0,1.0,I thought that the class was great and she was a very engaged teacher!
4053,92651,1.0,5.0,"****, ****"
4054,92651,3.5,5.0,She hated me from the begining of the class for some reason I don't know ( I guess she didn't like the way i look ). She always annoyed me so I hate her. whenever she gives a homework i try my best but still can't mannage to reach her standards. She is not helpful and very hard to like as a professor. She is like a cobra snake to be avoided !!!
4055,92651,1.0,5.0,She believes in favoritism. SHE HATES INTERNATIONAL STUDENT. Avoid taking her. It is all about the first impression. I just hated her class. I can't stand her. You don't learn alot from her class.
4056,92651,2.0,5.0,"Knowledgeable, but also prideful and makes things up as she goes along. If you don't get on her good side you're screwed."
4057,92651,1.0,5.0,"she is a bad grader. no, she is the worst!!!"
4058,92651,4.0,5.0,"good teacher, bad grader. try your best in her class, you can learn a lot although you may have a bad grade"
4059,92651,1.0,5.0,Don't every take her for your thesis class.  She has the potential of failing you.  She doesn't like foreign students either.  I will remember her as a bad teacher for the rest of my life.  Trust me.  Her class is not worth taking under any circumstances.  She shouldn’t favorites in a 4th year thesis class.
4060,92651,1.0,5.0,"She's arrogant, unfair, and biased.  She makes things up in class.  She says she has five masters degrees, and complains about professors during class.  Then, you realize she takes sides and if you're not on her side, you're screwed.  Regardless, your grade will be bad.  DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!!!"
4061,92651,1.0,5.0,DO not ever take this course..does not worth it..unfair grading..
4062,92651,4.5,3.0,Get on her good side.
4063,92651,1.0,5.0,Bad teaching and grading
4064,92651,3.5,4.0,"self described &quot;b@tch on wheels&quot;...she has experience, and knows what she's talking about.  She genuinely cares about her students, but she's arrogant and demanding.  She misplaces everything, and keeps you out in the cold until you see your grade on ISIS..."
4065,92651,4.0,3.0,"Alright here is the scoop.  Get to know her, I was so scared of her and hated her class until I started speaking up and geting on her good side.  You'll learn a lot in her class, but you will work for your grade."
4066,92651,1.0,5.0,"I can't speak english very good, so that's why I took 100, but she is so mean and I got no credit because I told her I am not going to take 101 with her."
4067,92651,1.0,5.0,"Ok, first, let me say that I am earning an OK grade in her class.  I believe that I have a pretty unbiased opionin about her class.  I have to aggree with the other opinions about the grading and favorites.  One of my friends got a 0% on a major project because &quot;it was just bad&quot;.  Very unfair."
4068,92651,2.5,5.0,Ridiculous grading
4069,92651,4.5,4.0,Great professor
4070,92651,3.0,3.0,Get on her good side.  She's a very biased teacher and she has total control over your grade.  Overall she is very nice and knowledgable but unorganization and differences in grading will make you mad.  Forget about it.  Make her happy.
4071,92651,1.0,4.0,"sucks at life... seriously, she's so bad.  nice woman outside of class, but grades are so objective and she choosed favorites, doesnt tell you what she expects and gets mad bc you didn't do what she wanted... DONT TAKE HER"
4072,92651,5.0,4.0,"Awsome Professor, hard because she will make you earn your grade but a very funny prof"
4073,92651,1.5,5.0,"if she likes you, she'll give you a good grade. if she doesn't, she will give you a bad grade no matter how good your work is. she's very disorganized and spends half of the time bragging about how smart she and her husband are. don't take her."
4074,92651,4.0,3.0,shes lots of fun if youre not too scared to talk in class
4075,92651,5.0,3.0,Amazing.  Made learning fun.
4076,92651,4.5,4.0,Very knowledgable
4077,92651,2.0,3.0,"Readings were interesting, but she didn't  significantly improve my understanding of them or have anything particularly insightful or intelligent to say. I tend to generally agree about the comments about rather inconsistent grading and favoritism."
4078,92651,4.0,3.0,"she is hard but if you get on her good side - not by being a loser, but by being funny and/or participating you can cruse through the class - and if you taken her before she'll like you a lot too"
4079,92651,5.0,4.0,You do a lot of work in this class but defintly get a lot out of it.  Try to make friends with her and get on her good side.  It'll definitly help you out.
4080,92651,1.0,5.0,"this professor mad emy life a living hell. she's the most smug person on the face of the earth. she has obvious favorites, usually boys, and she likes to see her students squirm. she will give you whatever grade she feels like, not what you deserve."
4081,92651,1.0,5.0,This could have been a class where very interesting discussions could have taken place but we ended up listening to the professor talk about her trips to Greece and how we are all lacking culture because we have not been there.
4082,92651,1.5,5.0,"Very Bias!!! If she likes you, then you are in luck.  If she does not like you. Try to transfer out of that class!!! She screws students over so many times. Try to talk to any former students if you plan to take her class."
4083,92651,5.0,4.0,Very strong teacher. Challenges you and makes you earn everything. Thanks!
4084,92651,5.0,4.0,"Incredible teacher! Will help you learn, but be ready to have a lot of homework."
4085,92651,3.5,4.0,"She's really hard, but you learn a lot, unlike other TCC classes."
4086,2148850,1.0,5.0,Worst class I've ever taken. The biggest regret of my life.
4087,1599986,2.0,1.0,"During the semester I took this class (2 semester class) I was a pedestrian that got ran over by a car at 45 mph. I missed the rest of my semester and was traumatized. When I returned, I was too depressed and traumatized to continue volunteering as part of this class. She ripped me a new one and told me I was horrible for abandoning my little."
4088,1599986,5.0,3.0,Definitely my favorite class of the semester. I never missed class! She worked with students and adjusted the course after feedback. Must be flexible for this class but I enjoyed it so much.
4089,1599986,1.0,3.0,Her bio is not indicative of what kind of instructor she is at UVA. I would never take her class again.
4090,1599986,5.0,1.0,Awesome professor who really cares about her job and her students!
4091,76276,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Adams is the best! He makes very complicated material fun. His class is very fair, but you do have to work hard to understand the material. He's very approachable and friendly, and he always brings his dog to the review sessions :) At the end of the year he holds a chili party at his house. GO TO IT. His chili is the best."
4092,76276,4.0,4.0,"He's friendly and gives good advising help. Extremely intelligent! Class material was interesting, but if you don't like to talk a lot, you won't do well. Have to write one paper, and the rest is participation. I thought you had to take a COLA in order to get an advisor; not true =/. I received a B."
4093,76276,5.0,4.0,Milton Adams is easily the best teacher at UVA.
4094,76276,5.0,4.0,"Milton is pretty g-status.  Awesome class, really easy to understand.  Would take it again if given the chance."
4095,76276,5.0,4.0,"He REALLY knows his stuff and is very helpful both in and out of class. Very nice guy teaching difficult material, and is always able to answer whatever random questions you ask him. The papers are graded pretty tough, though, so pay attention to details."
4096,76276,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher and awesome personality. However, don't confuse this with ease. His tests are very detail-oriented and all multiple choice. Luckily there are homework sets which are supposedly meant to bring your test average up. 3 papers, 3 tests, 3 homework sets and a final. This guy is good but hard!"
4097,76276,5.0,3.0,Clearly knows his material. Take his classes if you care about the subject.
4098,76276,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor, smart as hell, very clear.  Lame jokes every once in a while, but a good guy.  The class is interesting, probably the best ive taken at UVA"
4099,76276,2.0,1.0,"Milton is exuberant, but I didn't find him particularly helpful.  Embarasses confused student in front of the class."
4100,76276,5.0,4.0,"Milton is incredible. he teaches well, makes hilariously bad jokes, and invites the class over for chili in his awesome house. he's the best prof I've had. Take this class if you can. I'd vote milton president if I could. Seriously, he's just that good."
4101,76276,4.5,4.0,milton is frickin awesome...best professor i've ever had and probably will ever have
4102,76276,5.0,3.0,"Don't buy the book because he puts all his lectures and slides on the web.  Listen to lectures before the test, take notes on your notes, and you will do fine. Milton has great character, and is easygoing and charming. At the end of the semester, he invites the class to a chili dinner at his house!"
4103,76276,5.0,4.0,Best teacher I've ever had....period.
4104,76276,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, I think he's one of the best professors I've had yet.  Everyone in the class feels he is very easy to learn from.  He has a lot of personality and makes complicated material a lot simpler."
4105,76276,5.0,2.0,"Milton is the most incredible Professor I've had at UVa.  He honestly loves his students, he is very, very clear, and extremely reasonable.  Plus, he wears a bowtie every single day.  Awesome."
4106,76276,5.0,4.0,"He really does care about his students. The material is hard but he does a good job explaining it. Hard homework, but doing it pays off on the tests."
4107,76276,4.0,3.0,excellent teacher who made everything clear. the class is manageable as long as you do the homeworks.
4108,76276,5.0,4.0,"One of the best, if not the best, professor I've had the pleasure of taking a class under.  Hard material but he does an excellent job of teaching it.  A relaxed guy who really gets along with his students and is always willing to help them."
4109,76276,5.0,4.0,"amazing prof - the material is hard, but he makes you want to learn . . . i love milton!!"
4110,76276,5.0,3.0,My most favorite professor at the university so far.  The course material is not too bad.  But he is such a great lecturer that i get everything he says.
4111,76276,4.5,4.0,"Awesome professor, cares about students. The material's kinda hard though...requires attention to detail, definitely. Go to lab. Do the hw!"
4112,76276,5.0,3.0,One of the best I've ever had.
4113,76276,4.0,3.0,"He teaches hard material, but he is confident, relaxed, fun-loving. On top of all that, he truly cares about his students, and it shows every day in class."
4114,76276,5.0,4.0,Course material and tests are hard but he's very good at teaching and has kind personality.  Knows exactly what he's doing and enjoys his job.  Many students respect and adore him.
4115,76276,5.0,5.0,Very hard class but an amazing Professor!  He's so adorable!  Wish there was another class I could take with him.
4116,76276,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely great professor. Had trouble in his class, but eventually pulled through. Started out with a D, but helped as much as possible in office hours, and ended up with a B."
4117,76276,5.0,3.0,No Comments
4118,76276,5.0,4.0,"Milton is awesome.  The class is hard, but he does a great job"
4119,76276,4.0,4.0,"he's a good lecturer, makes everything look easy... but the exams are HARD!!"
4120,1599989,2.5,4.0,"Reading is absolutely necessary to be able to do well. Very difficult to get a good grade unless you are good at analysis. She is very nice and approachable, but it is a tough class."
4121,1812984,5.0,3.0,"If you are picking your ENWR class and enjoy reading ghost stories, this class is definitely your best choice! Eliza is AMAZING. She is very passionate about the topic and gives detailed feedback on every paper. She is always there when her students need help!!!"
4122,1812984,5.0,3.0,"Eliza is probably the most patient and approachable professor at UVA. Take this class if you are interested in ghost story! The reading is so much fun, and our homework is sometimes watching a horror movie. I highly recommend this class, even if you've already fulfilled first year writing requirement."
4123,1812984,5.0,4.0,"Eliza is the best! She is a difficult grader, but she is one of the nicest and most helpful teachers out there.  I highly recommend meeting with her about papers because she really knows her stuff and will help you succeed. Take any class Eliza is teaching and you won't regret it."
4124,1812984,5.0,4.0,Eliza was incredible. She is a really tough grader but puts in a ton of effort to help her students improve. She literally creates a color coded outline of your first paper and goes over it with you to improve your critical writing and organization skills. She also brought food to class and was the most passionate TA I've ever had at UVA.
4125,1812984,5.0,3.0,Ghost stories ENWR is one of the best classes. The readings are really fun and she's always there to help students do better. The attendance is mandatory but I never regretted going to class. There are five papers for the whole semester. The grading is little harsh but there are lot of other ways to make up for a bad grade. Definitely recommend!
4126,1812984,5.0,3.0,"Eliza is the best TA that I have ever had at UVa.  She expects a lot, but she puts tons of time and effort into helping her students to do well in return. She is always available to help and constantly provides helpful resources. This class helped me to improve my writing & critical reading skills and deepened my love for the Bard. Take her class!!"
4127,1788409,4.0,2.0,We only focused on the Merchant of Venice the whole time. We had to read it by ourselves within the first 2 weeks. We had 3 papers and a final project. 300-word responses due once a week. The final project is a revision of other works. I have really seen my writing improved. She can be a bit exaggerated but means well. Very passionate
4128,1788409,2.0,3.0,Interesting class. Professor not open to suggestions
4129,2591229,5.0,1.0,"Prof Kayser is amazing. He genuinely cares about his students, and I never dreaded going to class. He's fairly laid back and doesn't grade hard. Everything he lectures about is important material even if you aren't thinking about going into teaching. highly recommend."
4130,576033,1.0,4.0,"Terrible teacher, assumes the class follows everything he says and he just babbles on random stuff the whole class. Can never tell what is important and what is not. No class textbook and very lecture heavy. This class makes me want to rip my eyes out, do not take it and avoid van Wincoop at all costs."
4131,576033,5.0,3.0,One of the best Econ classes I have ever taken.
4132,576033,5.0,3.0,Professor van Wincoop is one my favorite professors ever! I learned so much from his class. His lectures were super helpful and he gives you the notes ahead of time so you can review what his lectures are going to be about before class. He is clear and concise and I definitely recommend his class if you are thinking about Econ.
4133,576033,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed Professor Van Wincoop for ECON 422. His exams are fair, and his lectures follow notes he uploads on Collab, so you can easily prepare ahead of time (no textbook). He really knows his stuff."
4134,576033,4.0,3.0,"I don't know why the guy up here rated him so bad, but I really liked his class. (maybe because the stuff was what I wanted to know the most, but still he is good) I did fairly well, but some people actually seemed like they didn't exactly know the stuff. anyways this Dutch guy is cool."
4135,576033,2.5,4.0,"I came to this site for the sole purpose of warning others against taking VW's class. He is HORRIBLE. I have rated him high in helpfulness, but he absolutely cannot lecture, and zips through the material, writing frantically on the chalkboard without explaining. Worst of all, he makes many mistakes "
4136,715299,2.5,5.0,"He knows his subject very well; however, this often means he would rather hear himself speak about the material than his students(including papers).  He highly regards his own opinions and in my opinion is narcissistic .  (He has a website: professorandy.com)  Yet, I still find myself looking forward to class because his lectures are interesting."
4137,715299,5.0,3.0,"one of the most inspirational and fascinating professors i have ever had. really cares about his subject matter, and this makes his classes extremely interesting. fair grader and very approachable. his classes are a must."
4138,715299,4.5,3.0,"Interesting material, but the discussions are either dominated by the prof or filled with awkward pauses. The books and readings are strictly for your private edification unless you plan on including them in your papers. Grading is fair but skewed to the tough side. The prof's Tolstoy fetish got grating after a while."
4139,715299,4.5,3.0,A brilliant thinker and lecturer who uniquely breaks out of the mold of dry academia to draw fresh and insightful connections to life in Russian literature.  Definitely would recommend him to anyone looking for wisdom and truth - not just an academic degree.
4140,715299,2.5,2.0,"Every class ends up with him going on an ego trip and telling stories that he thinks will make students like him, but that don't usually relate to the reading. I wish someone would tell him to his face how irritating he is!"
4141,1124910,1.0,5.0,honestly just a bot. class is pretty hard. he's a chill dude tho but im still confused on polymers till this day. Honestly idk why I had to buy wileyplus when hecoulda posted questions on collab. Although I am looking to major in MSE!
4142,1124910,5.0,4.0,"Floro is an amazing professor and person. Personally, I am not a fan of the course material, but he makes it more interesting. He is very intelligent and and truly cares about how you are doing in the class."
4143,1124910,4.5,3.0,He promptly answers students emails and really wants you to understand the material. He's the best professor I've have at UVA. His assignments are challenging and the tests are not easy but he sets up the class so you can succeed if you put in the effort. Does not make students feel dumb for asking questions. 
4144,1124910,5.0,3.0,great class and floro is the man. awesome teacher.
4145,1124910,5.0,3.0,I had zero interest in material science and he actually made it someone interesting.  he is really passionate about the subject
4146,1124910,4.0,4.0,Good class.
4147,1124910,4.0,4.0,Very good teacher but an intensely boring class. It will put you to sleep and the weekly homework sets are a huge pain. Avoid this class if you can.
4148,1124910,5.0,2.0,"He's a really cool guy.  He teaches the material well and is very helpful to students.  The exams are a bit tough, but all MSE 209 teachers give the same exams, so you might as well enjoy Prof. Floro."
4149,1124910,5.0,2.0,An excellent teacher.  He knows the material very well and keeps the class entertaining.  He even cracks some jokes during lecture.  Take this class!
4150,1124910,4.5,2.0,"Sure the material isn't all that interesting and neither is the textbook and sometimes the lecture, but he gets really into it and is very knowledgable. I enjoyed his class and went to every office hour and it helped a lot with homework. He's very willing to help! He does his best with the dull-ish material."
4151,690740,3.0,3.0,"Relatively straight forward class. Everything Kemp ever talks about is in the textbook he wrote. There are guest lectures and ""take-aways"" you need to know for the 3 exams. 80% of the questions on the exams are online beforehand in practice quizzes, but the rest can be tricky. Kemp himself is funny, but arrogant and repetitive. Beneficial overall"
4152,690740,2.0,3.0,"Do not take this class unless you intend on being pre-comm. I hated it. Most of what he says in lecture is irrelevant, but he has about 5 minutes of ""takeaways"" each class, and you have to memorize those takeaways for the exams. This class doesn't have much to do with understanding - it's literally all about memorizing his textbook (which he wrote)"
4153,690740,5.0,3.0,"Loved Professor Kemp as a person and would love to adopt him as my grandpa, but his lectures felt a lot like regurgitation of the book. I did enjoy his stories and the requirement to know takeaways ensured that I always went to lecture. Exams are easy, but TAs were either easy or crazy hard graders."
4154,690740,5.0,1.0,"I love his stories, the class is easy if you read the textbook. He is very enthusiastic and into what he is teaching. Nice man"
4155,690740,3.5,2.0,"Kemp is a nice guy. The class is boring though. You have to attend to get the ""take aways"" which are word for word on the test. Other then that, if you read the book there is no use for the class whatsoever. He's very excited about the material but he just repeats what is in the book. Its a rather easy class to get an A or B in w/o much work."
4156,690740,4.5,1.0,"He seems like he is experienced in his field but his lectures are useless. You still need to attend because he gives out ""takeaways"" of current events that you will need to know for the exams. Exams are very vocal-based. It made me feel as if I was in high school again. Also, he gives out very tedious, time-consuming assignments."
4157,690740,3.5,2.0,"I liked Kemp, thought he was a good-spirited guy, really experienced in the field and he genuinely likes to teach and wants to see everyone do well. The course itself is really tedious though, SO many assignments. VERY VOCAB BASED. Make sure you know your terms for exams.It's easy to get an A as long as you actually do all the work (I didn't)."
4158,690740,3.5,2.0,"Not really the class for me.  It's a very good introductory commerce class (as it's taught at UVA). It's pretty boring though. Come expecting lots of stories, which some students like, but eh.  Not too hard. Pretty typical comm professor."
4159,690740,5.0,1.0,"Kemp is utterly fantastic. His stories are wonderful and make it worth going to class. Honestly, it's all based on the book... which he wrote (and constantly reminds you of).  Has some regular homework (online chapter quizzes and discussions).  Has many GAs that are helpful.  Uses iClickers in class.  Says ""so forth"" and has a team to fix problems."
4160,690740,2.0,2.0,"He's always has good stories to tell and talks about his family a lot, but that's about it. His lectures are pointless. There were 3 midterms: the first one is easy, second one difficult, the third one is about medium in difficulty. He wrote his own textbook, so if you memorize all the vocabulary in the book and know concepts, you should do fine."
4161,690740,3.0,4.0,"Kemp is a nice guy. He's VERY repetitive and he makes it seem like his tests will be easy, but they aren't. Know vocab extremely well before exams. Only take this class if you want to be pre-comm."
4162,690740,1.0,4.0,"This class is absolutely horrid. It's so boring, half of the 350 signed up don't come until the exam, because it's pointless to since he reads off his book (which you will be reminded countless times, is his own book). It made me quit pre-comm. His tests aren't that easy! But on the bright side, he does have other opportunities for grade boosting."
4163,690740,2.0,4.0,"Kemp gives out lecture that are powerpoint slides based, which he uploads online at the beginning of the year. Lectures can be a bit dry when he starts on his stories, not to mention that they don't seem helpful at all. Just make sure you have some notes for lecture, read the textbook really well, and go to review sessions definitely."
4164,690740,1.0,3.0,INCOMPREHENSIBLE
4165,690740,2.5,2.0,"Average professor, who isn't hard to understand or anything.  Do not violate the honor code, though!"
4166,690740,5.0,3.0,"Kemp was by far my favorite professor of my first semester. He makes all of the concepts so tangible and easy to relate to. I enjoyed going to class and I learned a lot. Your grading depends totally on the TA though, some people get good ones, other ones not so much. Regardless its a great class"
4167,690740,4.0,1.0,"If you read the textbook this class can be a very easy A. Kemp's lectures have almost nothing to do with the tests, but I still went to all of them because he's very, very passionate about business which makes them interesting. Highly recommended if you're looking to learn the basics of business, or if you just simply want to take an easy class."
4168,690740,3.0,1.0,"Funny person, and is a pretty good professor. Tests from the book specifically, not the lectures. Easy easy class. Take it for fun and life advices, even if you are not going to Comm."
4169,690740,3.0,2.0,"He's the most precious man ever, but he gets off topic talking about his own stories. If you read the book on your own you don't really need to go; sometimes what he talks about just in class is on exams but not really. The exams are mostly vocab; you either know it or you don't."
4170,690740,1.5,5.0,Don't bother going to class unless you love life stories. Read the chapters carefully and memorize definitions. Some questions you just have to guess cause you never learned it.
4171,690740,1.0,3.0,worst professor ever. He barely teaches anything in class. you dont even need to go to class and will be fine because you can learn nothing in class
4172,690740,5.0,1.0,Professor Kemp reminds me of my grandpa.  He is incredibly friendly and has a great insight to all fields of study.  You should meet him for the sake of life lessons.
4173,690740,3.5,2.0,"Very easy class, just read the book and know the terms and you'll be fine. Kemp has done business just about everywhere it seems, so he has some cool stories to tell that make lectures a little more interesting."
4174,690740,2.0,1.0,Extremely easy class.  Don't go to lecture.  Just memorize the key terms.
4175,690740,2.5,1.0,"He's a pretty good teacher, but you can get an A without going to class."
4176,690740,4.5,2.0,"Nicest teacher man ever. The tests are super straight forward. Just memorize all the definitions. But dont subscribe to wsj cause it's pointless unless you really end up reading it. Lectures are boring, but he knows his stuff."
4177,690740,5.0,2.0,"He is a really enthusiastic teacher. He really cares about his students, and loves what he teaches!"
4178,690740,4.0,2.0,"Hilarious and dedicated man! The class is ridiculous easy in the beginning and then suddenly gets harder after the second test. Know the vocab, but also go to lecture!"
4179,690740,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Kemp is a great proffesor.  He is really good with sending out emails to the class, and tests are pretty easy.  Sometimes lecture can get a little boring with some of his personal stories. Visit him during office hours to just talk. He gave me a lot of useful information about applying to the comm school."
4180,690740,4.0,2.0,He was like an uncle to me. Always there with wisdom. He's a better teacher outside of the classroom. His heart is in it.
4181,1894967,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this Clinic. Stay far, far, away!!!!!!!!! There are other ways to pursue human rights clinical experience. Do an externship, pro bono, independent study with ANY OTHER PROFESSOR. 20-30 hours a week for FOUR graded credits and everyone gets graded on the curve. Incompetent with legal arguments/basic legal tasks, coercive, manipulative"
4182,1280572,4.5,3.0,"Probably the one professor provided through the physics dept for 2010 and 2020 that makes sense, but this class requires very heavy memorization. Learning and memorization 32 chapters of formulas in 2 months was really intense though."
4183,1280572,3.0,5.0,No Comments
4184,2591299,5.0,3.0,"Really great professor. Really cares about his students, makes the class a lot of fun to attend, and wants his students to succeed in understanding the material and passing his class."
4185,1403462,5.0,2.0,"Easiest A I've received at UVA. If you show up to 95% of the lecture, pay attention and take notes, do all the homework (easy, by the way), and study for about an hour for each test, you should get an A as well. Very nice professor who is approachable and tries to spicen up the lecture."
4186,748106,1.0,4.0,"The worst professor I have ever had in my life. She jokes about mental health issues, gets angry at you for asking questions, and gets annoyed if you ask questions. Never returns any assignments. Hands down the worst professor at McIntire, avoid at all costs! Has self-esteem issues and takes it out on students. Once told a student he was stupid."
4187,748106,2.0,5.0,"She is scary.   Will not hesitate to throw you or your group under the bus. Loves to make jokes, the students are usually at the butt of it. Especially when she is nervous. She was like a little school girl in front of executives during the ICE presentation. That did not instill a lot of confidence in me.  May have self esteem issues."
4188,748106,5.0,3.0,"The Best professor I have ever had! I have learned so much from her - and not only in communication but in other things. She's great in teaching, very supportive and helpful. I love the way she grades - she will spend an hour on each student's assignment to write out all good/bad comments and helpful hints. Which is super helpful!!!!!"
4189,748106,5.0,4.0,"I loved Pentz. She is an amazing, interesting, and energetic professor. You will see your confidence improve over the semester as well your public speaking skills. She knows the material and makes class lively and fun. She also has a funny, sarcastic sense of humor."
4190,748106,1.0,5.0,"Horrible. Incredibly inconsistent grading criteria, often contradicts herself, which makes her a very hard grader. Is energetic and interesting during class, but when it comes to assignments it's impossible to do something she wants - sometimes you'll get lucky though and get a good grade when you have no idea why and you worked the least on it."
4191,748106,1.0,3.0,a tough grader but great teacher
4192,748106,4.5,2.0,"This is a love/hate person. I love her. Shes has a super dramatic teaching style, but she really knows what she is talking about. Shes very helpful and understanding if you panic when you present-- Grading was consistent with me, but it varies by person."
4193,748106,4.5,4.0,"She has a genuine vested interest in her students.  No matter what she is doing at the moment, she welcomes students into her office and devoted 100% of her attention to them.  Take advantage of this, because you will leave her office positively energized and motivated.  She is willing to talk about anything and truly wanted you to succeed."
4194,748106,1.5,4.0,"arbitraty grading, says that everything is &quot;too general.&quot;  needs to relocate to the drama department, takes people's comments in class a little too personally sometimes. is scary."
4195,1321547,5.0,2.0,Take his class! Prof. McDermott is the professor who truly cares about what you have to say and improving your writing - he let me rewrite both of my papers because he was actually interested in seeing what I had to say and my writing skills. Invited the entire class over for dinner and made Middle English Literature incredibly interesting and fun!
4196,2640461,5.0,3.0,Incredibly good at teaching and obviously interested in what he does.
4197,2640461,5.0,3.0,"Easily the best math lecturer I have ever had. It is very easy to understand and take notes in his class, and he is very interested in making sure students understand the material, especially if they ask questions.

I am very happy to be in another of his classes this semester."
4198,2640461,5.0,3.0,Prof. Hellings taught the material in a way that was really easy to understand and always made sure to see if we had questions and help us understand the things that confused us. He seemed to really care about the success of his students and everyone in my class thought he was a really good professor!
4199,2640461,5.0,4.0,"By far my favorite professor! Professor Hellings is very routine and organized, and he gets through the material concisely, which I appreciate. He is very understanding, and will push back due dates if something comes up, meet with you for extra help,etc. Take this class with him!!!"
4200,2107984,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Hurst was a great professor to have for my first graduate level class. She always was free if you needed help and explained things in a clear way, which was very helpful because this class was online. I would definitely take one of her classes again"
4201,346729,5.0,3.0,"This was definitely my favorite class of the semester-Prof. Hoehler-Fatton is a really engaging lecturer and the material is really interesting.  She really does care about her students success and she was a pretty easy grader.  We did have reading quizzes, but she dropped your two lowest if you did the course evaluation."
4202,346729,5.0,3.0,"LOVED this class, and I'm not even a religious studies major. Prof. Hoehler-Fatton is very knowledgeable and one of the most approachable professors I've ever had. An extremely nice woman. You had to know the material, though, no faking it. She posts a lot of study guides and those really help."
4203,346729,5.0,2.0,"AWESOME CLASS! She is a wonderful prof. who will introduce you to a whole new world. Talk with her outside of class if you can - she is incredibly friendly and has tons of field experience with the Luo people. The work load is not bad, and class + exam are pretty straight forward. Oh! And WATCH the movies - they are well worth it!"
4204,346729,3.5,3.0,"This was my favorite class as a first year. There are several readings so you have to pace yourself, but it should not be difficult.  If you take it, be sure to take note of foreign words and their definitions.  It'll open your mind to so many incredible beliefs and customs.  Yep, hope my pitch was good"
4205,346729,4.0,4.0,"great readings, lectures parrot the readings a little bit but very interesting class, hard tests, study that**** real good, but besides reading, class is not too intense, i took it as a first-year without any of the prereqs and got a b-, its funny too the readings are kinda feminine-biased"
4206,346729,4.5,2.0,The course is very interesting and the lectures are extremely informative!!
4207,346729,4.0,3.0,"Interesting class, sometimes she can be alittle boring but the material makes up for it, fairly easy class."
4208,346729,5.0,3.0,she advised a friend and i for a trip to africa and totally made it happen for us.  she's awesome!
4209,1534575,4.5,2.0,"He really knows what he is talking about and is very approachable. However, his lectures are a bit boring and therefore hard to follow. But all in all, a good course that I recommend to those interested."
4210,1534575,4.0,1.0,"The lectures were at time hard to sit through but he presented interesting topics and theories. His material was pretty straight forward (he gave us a study guide that basically had a transcript of all his lectures). Although his reading quizzes were annoying, it kept me on top of things (and he was a pretty generous grader when it came to those)"
4211,1534575,1.5,4.0,the first professor i've ever had be outright rude and unhelpful. readings were long and dry and we were frequently quizzed. he really isn't interested in helping you learn if you have any difficulties.
4212,1534575,3.0,2.0,"He just started teaching this semester. His knowledge is incredible, he just needs to learn how to present it... Rarely uses visual aids and sometimes talks too fast. Really interesting demonstrative lectures (showed us stonemapping with obsidian!), but very dry theory lectures. My guess is as he gets more experienced his lectures will get better."
4213,1534575,1.0,5.0,"By far the worst 1st lecture I've sat through in my entire life. His presentation was incoherent, unenlightening and straight up boring. He gave a reading quiz at the beginning of lecture, regardless of whether you had just enrolled or not. No wonder there are only 15 students enrolled in his class, that has the capacity for 60!"
4214,1731189,3.5,2.0,"Fairly easy professor if you pay attention and put in the effort. Homework can be challenging, but rewarding. His exams are touch, designed so that the questions build on top of each other. If you miss one question, chances are you miss the others. If you take good notes, you'll do fine. He also curves cuz the exam averages are low."
4215,1731189,2.0,5.0,"Extremely hard course. Thought it would be interesting, but not. It was just memorization on your own."
4216,1722999,4.5,1.0,paul is a great guy. he is a fair grader and highly knowledgeable about the material. he wants you to do well and cares about his students. nice guy and a fair teacher.
4217,1124993,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor  Gilger's class my first semester at The University of Michigan, and I really enjoyed it. She is very intelligent and caring. Homework consists of short readings and the following classes are usually discussions on the readings. Be ready to write a few papers, but nothing over the top. She wants to see improvement in every student."
4218,1124993,3.0,4.0,"Kristin now teaches at The University of Michigan.  There, I unfortunately took her class. I got an A in AP English in high school, but was forced to retake the course for a B-school pre-req and managed a B+ while putting in a lot of effort.  She doesn't like giving out As/A-s and judges on your personal views in discussion. AVOID for easier grader"
4219,1124993,4.5,2.0,"Mrs. Gilger is a very helpful and knowledgeable professor. She expects quality work but that shouldn't scare you because she is fair about it. Compared to other ENWRs this is nowhere as rigorous or time consuming yet I found I got a lot out of it. The class i took focused on ""American Food & Culture."""
4220,1124993,4.0,1.0,"Great teacher, young and full of life.. She can really relate to the students. Very approachable and friendly."
4221,1124993,5.0,4.0,"Kristin is awesome! Smart, funny, helpful, and really helps you improve as a writer. Just take her class! Do it!"
4222,1124993,4.5,3.0,"Helpful teacher and very knowledgeable in her field. The class was still enjoyable and she made it fun, even if it wasn't your best subject. I would recommend her as an ENWR teacher! You'll learn a lot!"
4223,1124993,4.5,2.0,Great class!  We had great discussions in class.  She manages to simplify the material and make it interesting.  Highly recommend her as an ENWR teacher.
4224,2706050,1.0,2.0,"The worst math instructor I have ever had in my entire life. I had to attend the same classes taught my another professor in order to understand what was going on. Not accommodating, not caring, and just interacting with her is a headache. Should not be a professor at UVA. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS, find a different professor. "
4225,2706051,1.0,5.0,"This was one of the WORST prof. at UVA. He was so unorganized with this class. We had to purchase a packet and we didn't even read all of the articles. Whenever he assigns a paper, that's when he feels like to give the most work. THERE WERE NO RUBRIC for each paper. He would make the class create the rubric days after the paper is due. "
4226,1034886,1.5,4.0,"I'm sorry, 5 year olds don't understand the central limit theory. Very condescending, very rude, and very unhelpful."
4227,1034886,5.0,3.0,No Comments
4228,1034886,4.0,2.0,"Very clear, very simple course. Kim is the best because he's not a labor economist, neither is he an empirical macro economist... he's an econometrician. He's knows all the stuff inside out forwards backwards. A must take if you plan on pursuing a Ph.D in economics."
4229,1034886,5.0,3.0,I learned a lot.
4230,1034886,5.0,4.0,Good course
4231,1034886,4.0,4.0,"Good class overall, recommend to those who are series about Econ and love challenges."
4232,928391,5.0,1.0,She is one of the most enthusiastic professors I have ever seen.  She knows everything about the texts and she is so helpful and fun to talk to!  Her accent is endearing and she makes everything interesting!  I love her and highly suggest this class!
4233,928391,5.0,3.0,"She is very, very energetic and interested in the material that she teaches."
4234,928391,5.0,3.0,Everyone loves Zoe.
4235,1657481,1.0,4.0,"Hands down the worst professor I have had at UVA. She is nice enough during office hours and did try to adapt the course to the online form. Still, she provides information contradictory to that given in readings and lectures. Despite teaching assessment it seems that she does not understand how it is used in real-world applications."
4236,1657481,1.0,4.0,"I have never had a worse professor in my 5 years at UVA. Preaches grading and assessment practice but doesn't follow good grading or assessment practice herself. Very subjective grader, if she doesn't like what you have to say you won't get a good grade, even if you meet all criteria on the rubric. Is not open to discussion, it's her way or the hwy"
4237,748171,5.0,2.0,This man is simply amazing. His class is fun and he tries to eliminate as much stress as possible. Only teacher I've had that also takes a personal interest in your life and wants to help with non- class things like resumes and finding internships. Truly my all time favorite professor at UVA.
4238,748171,3.5,3.0,"Class was very insightful and interesting. Professor Sampson was very approachable, although he wasn't always clear about what he wanted on assignments... I felt like we turned in papers, and received grades without any explanations/comments"
4239,748171,5.0,1.0,"George is great!  He has his students call him by his first name- he's totally not a typical professor and doesn't refer to himself as such.  He's interested in getting stuff done at a practical level, not academic.  Reading isn't necessary; only for personal interest.  Introduce yourself, do the final project, and you'll get an A."
4240,748171,1.5,4.0,"He seems to be a very nice man, but grades were based almost entirely upon a final project and paper turned in at the end of the semester, never to be seen again.  The class readings were not incorporated into the class, and the lectures were scattered at best."
4241,748171,5.0,2.0,He's a wonderful teacher who is very understanding and helpful. Few teachers at UVA are as nice as him. His class is also very interesting
4242,289426,2.0,2.0,"A mean-spirited person.  She had favorites, and only cold indifference or mild distain for everyone else.  I cannot express how much I regret ever meeting her."
4243,289426,4.0,4.0,Love this woman!
4244,289426,5.0,5.0,"Betsy is mind-blowingly awesome, but you really have to step outside your box and put in crazy effort to get respect from her.  She definitely gets one or two favorite students in each class, though. If your not one, she can come across as judgmental and mean-sprited, but she's just trying to spur you to better things."
4245,289426,1.0,3.0,"I can't begin to explain how much I did not enjoy Betsy's class. She was only wanted to see what she personally liked. It was a class about Betsy, a class about her bragging about the previous shows she has directed instead of trying to help US, the students. It is really ridiculous how awful this class and her teaching style was."
4246,289426,4.0,4.0,"Five years after graduation, I'm still inspired by my classes and conversations with Betsy.  She's one of the best things about that department, because she looks to world theatre and pushes the envelope.  Not everyone digs her.  Being pushed by someone is challenging, and some don't like to be challenged in the way she pushes.  I dig her."
4247,289426,2.5,3.0,"the most mean-spirited person i have met in theater, anywhere."
4248,289426,5.0,4.0,INCREDIBLE!  Betsy is amazing.  You want to take class from her.
4249,289426,4.0,3.0,"****ed, intelligent, has a crackling laugh.  Throws out eloquent speeches.  She's inspiring, but never sentimental."
4250,289426,4.5,4.0,Amazing teacher for directing and great for 4th-year seminar as well.  Betsy's classes were the most important ones I took as far as growth and intellectual/artistic development are concerned.  She opened my eyes to amazing things.
4251,1747604,1.0,5.0,Hes very eccentric and loves his stories. Property Law is an extremely dense subject and I didnt think his method of teaching as at all helpful. He needs to stop rambling and just teach.
4252,1747604,5.0,3.0,Schragger is an excellent teacher - he cares about his students and makes sure that they understand property law. Some of these comments suggest that he's a super liberal but that's not true - he's liberal but he's balanced (so yes he's unlike other UVA law professors who are staunchly conservative but he's fair). I loved the class.
4253,1747604,1.0,1.0,Class consisted mostly of group discussions and then students would give a brief presentation to the class.  Very little lecturing or teaching of basic principles.  The professor definitely has a particular viewpoint on using property law to further liberal social policies and did not seem to welcome disagreement.
4254,1747604,1.5,4.0,Really confusing lecturer – spends too much time letting the class just make up what the doctrine should be instead of discussing what the law actually is.  There is also a hyper-focus on poverty / race instead of foundational property doctrines.
4255,1747604,1.0,2.0,I found the team exercises to be very unhelpful.  There was also a huge focus on distributional justice and what the law *should be* instead of what it actually is.
4256,1747604,1.0,1.0,I was really looking forward to this class but so far it has been disappointing.  The professor is very unorganized and spends too much time asking questions instead of teaching law.
4257,1747604,1.0,1.0,"A very poor teacher - wants the class to teach itself by spending class time on ""team"" discussions instead of actually teaching."
4258,1231509,4.5,2.0,"Helpful and nice.  Many language classes can be intimidating, especially the speech component, but he creates a comfortable classroom setting while encouraging participation.  If you do all of the assignments and follow directions, you should get an easy B+A-.  An A is harder because you need a 96(all spanish classes), but it is doable."
4259,1231509,4.5,3.0,"Dan is awesome! As long as you do the assignments and study hard for his tests, you should be satisfied with your grade. He's kind, funny, and approachable. He also tries his best to give you opportunities to receive extra points. You won't regret taking SPAN 301 w/him! Received an A- in the class."
4260,1231509,4.5,1.0,"Dan is a great guy! Fun, interesting, and helpful. He tries to make complicated grammar concepts easier to understand, and his in-class activities are a good way to practice Spanish and have fun! He's not too hard of a grader, and will tell you what will be on the tests."
4261,1231509,5.0,1.0,He is very clear in his explanations of confusing grammar concepts and his classes generally pass very quickly.
4262,1231509,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher. He's very nice.  He actually managed to make some of the most boring grammar painless.  If you dread taking Spanish, this is the man for you!!!"
4263,1231509,4.5,2.0,"I hate Spanish, but if you have to take it, try to take it with this guy. I LOVE him, he's really nice and pretty funny and actually wants you to learn. His version of spanish class is far more bearable than most teachers'."
4264,1231509,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher. Funny, effective and clear. Definitely worth taking spanish with."
4265,1231509,4.0,1.0,&quot;DVZ&quot; is love.  He enjoys when you laugh at his attempted jokes and enjoys speaking in spanglish.  He is hilarious.  His teaching abilities are excellent and he is very helpful.  DVZ should teach every Spanish class. &lt;3
4266,1231509,4.0,2.0,great teacher and makes class fun. very laid back guy. I would take him again if he was teaching 202A
4267,2321047,2.0,5.0,"He teaches straight out of the textbook and is very hard to understand. Lectures are usually fast paced and complicated, and he often misunderstands students' questions. That said, he is a great person - at his office hours he is happy to explain anything, including the homework. But the tests were too hard for me to take a class with him again."
4268,2321047,2.0,5.0,"This Calculus 2 class is insanely hard. First of all, the lectures are very fast-paced and the professor doesn't seem to care whether students are following or not. In addition, the final exams are ridiculous. Whoever made the exam definitely wants as many students to fail as possible. Studying hard does not guarantee you an A. Being a genius maybe"
4269,2721,5.0,2.0,had her for semester at sea and she is AWESOME!!!!!! I wish she taught at my school!!!
4270,2721,5.0,3.0,"Bear in mind, there were three sections of the same class. Prof. Norris could not deviate from what the other sections were doing. Unlike most professors I have ever had, Prof. Norris actually cares that you learn the material. I highly recommend her for Stats or any other course."
4271,2721,4.0,5.0,"Her mood swings are gone, and she is always happy.  Lectures are not perfect, and her notes handouts are just copys of other books, but she does try to make it easyer, and she cares a whole lot more than the other prob and stat professors.  Keep in mind, the amount of material and number of formulas will eat you alive."
4272,2721,3.5,3.0,"A lot of projects where it seems we only apply the most basic of all the statistical concepts we learned, even later on. She's alright at explaining things, but can make mistakes and things get confusing. She's better than average though, but can be moody."
4273,2721,5.0,3.0,Pretty good!
4274,2721,2.0,2.0,She's a psycho...we had a lot of time consuming projects that were worthless. Her TA (rob) was just as bad. They cracked horribly corny jokes at the board every day. And...the mood swings still exist...despite the end of the pregnancy.
4275,2721,4.0,3.0,"a very nice person, tho tests were long and the class wasn't too interesting"
4276,2721,3.5,3.0,"Hated the material, and sometimes got frustrated with the writing out definitions on the board but overall definitely a good teacher."
4277,2721,4.0,3.0,"Decent and helpful. I hated the content of the course but she made it tolerable.  Mood swings from pregnancy were a little much, but thats over now."

4279,2721,3.5,4.0,"Sometimes boring, but a good teacher and very willing to help outside class"
4280,2722,5.0,3.0,very well
4281,2722,3.5,2.0,"Let's face it, physics isn't the most exhillarating class, but PQ does his best to get people excited about it.  Really nice professor.  His class isn't that hard if you just do lots of practice problems (then it comes naturally)."
4282,2722,3.5,3.0,"I took physics201 and 202 only because I had to and I used to hate physics. However, I took his class for both semesters and I did quite well. His lectures were not the best and you had to study hard on your own. Go to his office hour. His a very nice professor and is willing to help his students."
4283,2722,1.5,3.0,"Funny, but not helpful when it comes to learning the material."
4284,2722,5.0,1.0,hes sweet
4285,2722,1.0,5.0,Didn't get back to me on any of the questions I had on homework until it was already handed in...never understood my questions when I asked him in person... offered no help other than to work more problems out of the book when I was having problems even working the easy ones.

4290,2724,5.0,2.0,"Tests are all short answer but straightforward. Textbook is good supplemental material but not necessary -- he gives you everything you need to know for the tests in lecture. I stopped using the textbook after a while and did fine. Prof is a good man, puts some dad humor into his lectures (i.e. using your hypothetical &quot;sweetie&quot; in examples)."
4291,2724,3.0,1.0,I took his perception class for fun as an elective and strongly regretted it.  The whole class was focused on making sure we got definitions into our notes so we could regurgitate them on the tests.  Dont take it for fun unless you love memorizing or you need a class that you can pass without ever using your brain
4292,2724,4.5,2.0,Great prof! Tests are short answer and fill in the blank but he tells you exactly what you need to know to get an A. He's an awesome lecturer & you'll always look forward to class. The TAs do post notes but take your own since they have sometimes have a few errors. Highly recommended.
4293,2724,4.0,2.0,This class was okay. The material was interesting as he goes over why some behaviors are caused but sometimes we learn stuff randomly like how to catch a baseball and music. The tests come from lecture and basically the TA notes provide most of the information but you should still go to class. Go to review session and take practice test. Got an A.
4294,2724,5.0,3.0,Great class and great teacher.  His lectures are very interesting and the subject material is incredibly interesting and useful. Tests can be fairly difficult and definitely require studying but you will use the stuff you learn in class all the time. I can understand how some people think he is a bad teacher but overall the class is worth it!
4295,2724,5.0,3.0,"Really awesome class! I didn't do as well as I had liked but the subject is absolutely fascinating - I don't think it's possible to be bored at all because the subject itself is interesting, and Professor Proffitt is brilliant, funny, and extremely good at explaining things. He really knows his stuff. I highly HIGHLY recommend this class!"
4296,2724,5.0,2.0,Great class and professor.  He made me want to be a Cog Sci major.  This class is awesome for teaching exactly how perceptions work. I would recommend this class to anyone.
4297,2724,3.5,4.0,"I LOVED this class even though I did not do extremely well in it. He is a great professor and I learned more in this class than I have at any other class here. Take this class. All you have to do is look at the TA notes, and study them. The test questions come straight from the TA notes."
4298,2724,3.0,3.0,"Overall, Proffitt is a good teacher. The tests are ok and too long for the time allotted. He is also kind of ambiguous in the way he asks questions on the test and he doesn't make it very clear what you need to know from the book. Not too hard to get a B."
4299,2724,5.0,1.0,"Take this glass before graduating from UVa, regardless of your major.  You won't regret it.  Don't focus too much on your grade though, since 1) it doesn't matter, 2) you'll learn more if you don't limit yourself to studying test material, and 3) the tests are poorly graded anyhow (i.e. the TAs don't read answers carefully)."
4300,2724,5.0,1.0,Proffitt is the man!  I loved his class.  Best PSYC class I've taken (I'm a 4th year PSYC major) and easily one of the best I've taken across all departments.
4301,2724,5.0,3.0,One of the best classes at UVa.  Definitely take it!
4302,2724,5.0,2.0,great class. exam is not hard.
4303,2724,4.5,2.0,"Great professor, very interesting material, not very difficult. This has been my favorite psych class at UVA, and I'm a third-year psych major. Highly recommended."
4304,2724,5.0,2.0,"A fantastic professor - very entertaining and very good lecturer. Makes sure you have a chance to hear his explanation once and then restates things for your notes. Not an &quot;easy A&quot; class, but frankly you shouldn't be at UVA if that's what you want. Just come to lecture and read the book assignments and the tests are a breeze. Take this class!"
4305,2724,4.0,2.0,Great Class. First exam is an easy A. Second one gets a little more difficult but its fair. Profitt is entertaining and will keep you interested. Take it.
4306,2724,3.5,4.0,great class...goo dbasis for later classes...
4307,2724,4.5,2.0,"I don't know why anone would bash the tests or exam.  While not a class that you skip and get an A+, the tests only test prep. needed is going to class and reading your notes.  The lectures are worth going to, if for no other reason than they are interesting and Proffitt is fun."
4308,2724,4.0,2.0,"Class gets much more interesting later on, good teacher, makes class fun, tests are not difficult though all q's are open response."
4309,2724,5.0,4.0,he good professor. he teach good. me learn lot.
4310,2724,4.5,3.0,"Proffitt is dryly funny and very smart.  The material is usually interesting (especially if you were one of those kids who liked &quot;How Things Work&quot; books).  The tests are pretty hard but an A is not impossible - the key is to take all written information from the class, but be able to apply it to/explain all VISUALS from the book, (graphs, examples "
4311,2724,1.0,4.0,"This guy's a jerk. The tests were ridiculous for the amount of time allowed. Good luck, you're going to need it!"
4312,2724,3.0,3.0,Intersting class. Tests are hard because they're all memorization and cover EVERY aspect of EVERYTHING he talks about in class. Graders were horrible and didn't understand the material b/c they took points off in wrong places (ex: I wrote &quot;bone problems&quot; and the answer was &quot;osteoperosis&quot;Same thing!)
4313,2724,2.5,4.0,"Though interesting material, has been teaching too long, so sounds like a talking book. Tests are ambiguous and few, so good luck with your grade in this class."
4314,2724,4.0,4.0,"Extremely interesting material, good and funny professor. Tests difficult. Study a lot and reading the book will help. Somewhat understanding though of poor test grades. Our class average for a test was a 78, and he made that a B so our grades wouldn't suffer too much."
4315,2724,5.0,2.0,The most interesting class Ive taken at UVA. Its the first class where i really felt like I missed out if i missed it.
4316,2724,4.5,2.0,Easily one of the best teachers I have had in the Psyc department. Even in an intro class the lectures were extrememly interesting. Proffit has incredible interest in the field. Highly recommended
4317,2724,5.0,2.0,Best Professor I have had at UVa.
4318,2724,5.0,2.0,"This has been one of my favorite classes at UVA, he is a great professor, and the subject material is really interesting.  Even though the tests are really detailed, as long as you study you'll get at least a B.  You will love this class!"
4319,2724,4.5,3.0,"very interesting professor, would strongly recommend the class, has TA's handle office hours, only 3 exams and a final, keeps me awake for the whole 75 minute class, &quot;sweetie&quot; jokes are great"
4320,2724,4.5,2.0,Very interesting class - the tests are more challenging because they are NOT MC. But he provides copies of the TA's notes on the class website and tells you exactly which information you need to know for the tests.
4321,2724,4.0,4.0,"interesting and funny guy, tests are very long and detailed"

4323,2724,5.0,4.0,No Comments
4324,1018534,4.5,2.0,As an anthropology major her course was extremely inspirational and I loved her lectures. She's very passionate about what she does and I loved hearing about her personal experience. If you're not a fan of anthropology you might not be interested in the course.
4325,1018534,3.5,3.0,"I took her at JMU for her Buried Cities & Lost Tribes course. She is so passionate about the subject matter, but isn't the most clear in lectures. 3 tests, 10 quizzes, but nothing was too difficult. Would definitely recommend for a gen ed. Does involve effort and studying though since the tests are mostly short answer, so be prepared to work."
4326,1018534,4.0,2.0,Was pretty nice. Gave us a lot of extra credit and food in class.
4327,1018534,3.0,3.0,"Ok class, subject not very interesting. If you really need to fulfill the archeology requirement, I guess this is the easiest one (since it has not discussions and no papers due.) McCarty is a nice person, and I like the class structure. However,I thought the cut off for an A was unnecessarily harsh. Despite that, I still recommend the class."
4328,1018534,3.5,3.0,"McCarty's nice and pretty funny too. Reading is not really necessary although she says it is.  For the tests, just study her powerpoints thoroughly. She brings in food fairly often and offers A LOT of extra credit, so take advantage of it.  Overall, I was not very interested in the subject matter, but it was worth taking the class."
4329,1018534,5.0,2.0,"Excellent class - extremely interesting.  If you pick up on the main themes, everything else will fall into place.  A few of the readings are dense but most are interesting and easy to follow -- READ THEM they can be very good readings!  Themes (modernity, hegelian dialectic, orientalism) apply broadly to the world, not just Turkey."
4330,2730,1.0,5.0,"I took this class twice, once with Elzinga and once with Doyle. When I took it with Doyle, everything made sense and was so much easier/far less time-consuming. I got an A+ in the class and learned a lot. Elzinga's final included references and questions/math that were never addressed/taught in class. Do yourself a favor and take it with Doyle."
4331,2730,3.0,4.0,"Elzinga is very knowledgeable about Econ, but his lectures are painfully boring and don't really go in-depth into the topics he tests on. If you get a good TA, his class isn't too bad, but if you have a bad one prepare to read your textbook and get study materials from other people. He's a nice guy, but not the best professor."
4332,2730,3.0,3.0,"Elzinga teaches the most popular course at UVA like a professional. Micro is interesting but the lectures are nothing spectacular, and he doesn't cover everything in class. Exams (most of your grade) are easy enough if you pay attention and go to discussion. Beware, though, Elzinga likes to talk politics even when he promises not to."
4333,2730,1.0,5.0,lectures are useless and the final is unnecessarily hard and also worth either 50% or 100% of your grade
4334,2730,4.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed the lectures and Elzinga in general. I didn't like the way he simplified everything in lecture and then makes the tests so difficult. He says and I quote &quot;the tests aren't meant to trick you&quot; and then there are so many deliberately tricky questions, especially on the final. Good guy, terribly structured class."
4335,2730,5.0,3.0,"Elzinga is an amazing professor who could properly teach economics to someone with no understanding of society. His lectures were insightful and fun, and his teachings were allowed me to fully understand some immensely complicated concepts."
4336,2730,2.0,5.0,"Worst professor at UVA. Last semester, I contracted COVID-19 as an immunocompromised individual and lost my taste and smell for months, and was knocked in bed for weeks. I had to take an exam during my illness given that Elzinga gives no opportunities to make up exams. Elzinga should follow what he preaches because he did not show any sympathy."
4337,2730,3.0,4.0,Professor Elzingas lectures just dont seem to be in depth enough to prepare you for the exams without reading or having a good discussion TA. I really loved hearing his stories/experiences though. This class had almost no homework- 80% of the overall grade was from 3 exams and the final was worth almost 50%. Head TA can really make or break class
4338,2730,1.0,5.0,Don't take his class unless you want to lower your GPA.
4339,2730,4.0,3.0,"This class is great for someone who knows nothing about economics. It's a really great class, but be ready to work. If you don't do the readings or participate, the exams will be hard."
4340,2730,4.0,4.0,"Professor Elzinga is great guy. He is super nice and respectful, and is really, really, passionate about economics. He is super knowledgeable and his experiences in anti-trust cases are mind blowing. However, his lectures aren't very detailed, so to get a good grade in class you must read the textbook and take good notes. The tests are tricky too."
4341,2730,1.0,5.0,Terrible professor
4342,2730,5.0,2.0,A lot of these ratings claim that Elzinga isn't &quot;all that&quot; and that the course is too difficult; I suspect that's more a result of the exams' focus on critical thinking (as opposed to memorization) than anything else. Elzinga is a true expert in economics and his lectures are enjoyable as well as engaging -- even with hundreds of students.
4343,2730,4.0,2.0,"Lots of stories and tangents in lecture, but it keeps them interesting. Very far from a textbook approach to microeconomics, is has the feel of a liberal arts course. You might never need to open the textbook if you go to class take good notes. Your TA really matters, they grade your tests (which are almost all of class grade). STUDY. ovr not 2hard"
4344,2730,2.0,4.0,"I studied and studied for this course, but could never seem to hit the nail on exams of exactly what he wanted to see."
4345,2730,1.0,4.0,Avoid this man
4346,2730,3.0,5.0,"He isnt all that, like at all. Ive had better professors than him. Also if you have an awful TA youre probably gonna struggle."
4347,2730,1.0,4.0,I have no idea why he is so famous. He legit sucks. Why is he so terrible?? Unclear. UVA needs to do SO MUCH better. He is a terrible lecturer and kinda annoying. He makes you buy his own book that he wrote under a different name so you don't know it is his.
4348,2730,5.0,3.0,"Professor Elzinga is one of the best teachers I have had the pleasure of learning from. His lectures are entertaining and engaging, and he encourages students to think about not just the nuts and bolts, but the application of Economic thinking to their lives. Very compelling, a legend of a professor."
4349,2730,1.0,3.0,I DON'T LIKE HIM
4350,2730,4.0,3.0,"Elzinga is legend here at Mr. Jefferson's University. Fantastic lectures, both interesting and informative. Tests are a combination of lecture material and reading material, so going to class and doing readings are both very important. Class was not overly challenging, even though I had an abysmal TA. Highly recommend this course."
4351,2730,1.0,4.0,"I found the concepts within the course to be quite interesting and I will probably end up becoming an ECON major. However, Professor Elzinga is simply a bad professor. I did not learn a single thing from any of his lectures and the course was basically learn it yourself. Luckily, I had a very good TA who helped me. Elzinga is famous, but he sucks."
4352,2730,4.0,3.0,"Professor Elzinga is widely respected, but he did not explained concepts in clear and concise ways. His lectures were long and pretty unnecessary, and the way he sets up his discussion sections and TA's are what I hear the biggest complaints from. Lectures and discussion are both unhelpful. Read the textbook and try learning it on your own."
4353,2730,3.0,4.0,"He doesn't really upload his notes anywhere and leaves a lot of material for the TAs to clear up in discussion. The TAs all vary in quality, so much of what you get out of the course depends on the TA. His lectures are funny, but he takes the long way to get to the actual point. The class is huge too, so it may be hard to focus."
4354,2730,2.0,4.0,"The lectures are amazing, but that's all I can say about his teaching. The lectures go over all the easy stuff, with little to no math involved, and the tests are really hard. I don't know how you can teach this way. If you take the test based on how he presents lectures, you will FAIL badly. Cool guy, bad teacher."
4355,2730,4.0,5.0,Well respected and my mom took his class. Everybody loves him but I didn't. His lectures are a little too simplified for the level of difficulty of the tests.
4356,2730,5.0,4.0,Elzinga is pretty famous at UVA (and in general). He teaches Econ well but reading the textbook is somewhat necessary to do well. His lectures are a bit more airy than the technical work you need to know how to do. The grading is really difficult/specific and some of the questions seem to come out of nowhere. Worth taking with the legend though
4357,2730,5.0,2.0,Prof. Elzinga is an amazing professor. He is a real gem and going to his office hours were one of my favorite memories of UVA so far.
4358,2730,5.0,3.0,Makes Econ applicable to the real world. You need to do a decent amount of reading and there are clicker questions in most classes.
4359,2730,4.5,4.0,"Tests are pretty tough, and you definitely have to work for a good grade in the class, but there's a good curve at the end. Elzinga is a good lecturer, incredibly interesting and humble, and extremely accomplished. A must-take before you graduate from UVa."
4360,2730,2.0,5.0,"I did not do well in this class, but I am not going to blame Elzinga for that. I think that for a 500 person lecture, he commands attention pretty well. The one thing I will say is that his tests are very hard. Make sure you know every detail and know how to clearly explain all terms and ideas."
4361,2730,3.0,4.0,"Great person, loved to talk to students. I went in with high expectations of his teaching because everyone told me Elzinga was God. His reputation is a little overrated. Didn't usually understand the concept fully in his lectures, so do background reading too and actively attend discussion sections, you should be fine! Test questions from guide."
4362,2730,3.0,3.0,Elzinga is a cool guy who knows a lot about Econ though I did prefer Macro with Coppock.  He uses metaphors and stories to make his points and doesn't use powerpoints (lectures at the podium with an occasional transparency). Go to class his econ minutes are on the exams. Read the book! Grading is fair and DO NOT rely on the dutch knockout
4363,2730,4.0,3.0,"I really liked Professor Elzinga. Sure, his lectures may have been a little on the boring side occasionally, but he's very passionate about teaching ECON 2010. He offers tons of advice. His final was not particularly difficult, if you attend class (you'll need to pretty regularly) and studied you're fine. Overall, great class!"
4364,2730,1.0,5.0,"He is not all he is cracked up to be. His tests are extremely tricky and he only has the TAs grade them, who are harsh. He rambles in lecture about nonsense and then will ask a deeply specific question on a test about nonsense whether or not it has to do with the standard microeconomics course material."
4365,2730,1.0,5.0,"He is one of the worst lecturers here at UVA. He rambles on about nonsense and gives unreasonably hard tests just to trick us. Also, he allows inexperienced undergraduates to grade our hard tests and they are harsh. I would avoid this at all costs."
4366,2730,1.0,5.0,He is super hard and his TAs are just students who grade too tough. He is overrated and does not deserve the high reputation  he somehow holds. 
4367,2730,3.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE.  Everyone who says he is a great teacher LIES. The tests are graded insanely tough. In office hours he can be almost condescending, which contradicts his general nice attitude. Take the other guy. "
4368,2730,5.0,4.0,"I took this class in the Fall of 1975.  It changed my major, my career and the way I think to this day.  Best professor ever. "
4369,2730,4.5,4.0,Prof. Elzinga is an excellent lecturer (although he failed to keep my attention sometimes). He is readily available outside of class to answer questions about class or anything else.
4370,2730,4.0,3.0,"Elzinga does a great illustrating Econ & ensuring everyone has an opportunity to understand it. Although the material can be dull at times, his side stories and examples are funny and keep you interested."
4371,2730,4.0,3.0,"Don't let yourself be fooled by the seemingly easy material. In a class of 1000 students, the exams have to be hard. I went in with a lot of confidence and then ended up with a B even though I liked Econ, did all the readings and understood it."
4372,2730,1.0,5.0,Everyone says that this is a class everyone should take. It. Is. Not. Not only are the lectures and discussions pointless but the exams are extremely difficult. Elzinga tries to make the lectures interesting but never gets his point across. The best lecture of the year was given by the head TA.
4373,2730,2.0,5.0,"His lectures are fun and informative, you will enjoy the class until you reach the midterms. They are not easy at all. The final is just something else, even if you think you did well because it's multiple choice, you probably didn't. If you are a pre-comm student, I advise you to take micro from a TA so that you can prevent your gpa from falling."
4374,2730,2.0,5.0,"People RAVE about this professor.. BUT: his lectures are pointless, he takes 35 minutes to get to the point, you need to teach yourself, the curve it terrible, and he really is not as kind as everyone says. I sent him multiple emails never to have a reply. Do yourself a favor and stay out of his class."
4375,2730,3.0,4.0,"Elzinga is fantastic, I thought his lectures were fascinating. People complain b/c they ""didn't relate to the material"" but that's what the discussion is for. His lectures take the material & make it applicable to everyday life. Tests are really challenging, especially his final. Go to lecture and really utilize your disc & TA and you'll do fine."
4376,2730,3.0,4.0,"While his reputation precedes him, the class itself is lacking in that it is large and lectures focus almost entirely on small cases studies rather than spent working through the material in detail.  While it would be admittedly difficult to dissect material in a class this size, considerable time and effort on the part of the student is required"
4377,2730,3.5,2.0,"Elzinga is a super sweet guy - I'd love for him to be my grandpa. That being said, I think his lectures are overrated. I learned most things from my TA (Ben Leyden, who's amazing) and from the text. Sometimes lectures help teach textbook material, but he usually spends the first 25 minutes talking about useless things."
4378,2730,2.5,3.0,"Elzinga really isn't a great lecturer. It seems that he is able to keep teaching based on his reputation as a professor rather than on his actual skill. His lectures sometimes have nothing to do with what you are learning, and his tests are unreasonably difficult. You have to read the book on your own, because he doesn't go over it at all."
4379,2730,5.0,4.0,"This is the best professor in UVa. I have no interest in econ but his lectures were very entertaining, I had no problem staying awake. (I normally sleep thru other classes). Take the class, you will not regret it."
4380,2730,4.5,3.0,"The rumors are true; this is definitely a class everyone at UVA should take. As far as grades go, he offers his signature ""dutch knockout"" which is great if you are like me and do better with multiple choice exams since that's how the final is. Genius professor!"
4381,2730,3.5,3.0,"If you've already studies and understand 90% of what the textbook said, they you'll find the lectures interesting. If you didn't, then like me you may not understand what the prof. said. This class requires passion on ECON and a lot of self-teaching."
4382,2730,1.0,5.0,DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS! DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS! DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS! Especially if you've NEVER taken Econ before! You'll have to teach yourself everything - DO NOT TAKE IT. If you really need econ for a requirement take it with a smaller class not a 1000-PERSON LECTURE!!!!!!!! You have been warned.
4383,2730,4.5,3.0,Elzinga is the most helpful and amazing guy out there. He teaches his lectures very clearly and makes it interesting for a person with any major. His classes are only 50 minutes long. I truly enjoyed this class and suggest this for anyone no matter if you are interested in Economics or not.
4384,2730,4.5,5.0,"Elzinga is such a nice guy, and Microeconomics with Elzinga is a class that everyone takes a UVa because Elzinga is legendary! Don't expect this class to be easy though. I never had Econ in high school, and I had to study hours and hours before exams and then I got B's. TA's don't speak good English which is annoying."
4385,2730,3.5,4.0,"Elzinga is probably the best micro teacher at uva, mostly because the ta's rarely speak english as their first language, but I didn't really enjoy the class too much. He has gigantic lectures and repeats himself alot... and then he repeats himself alot... but he is definitely the best here, so take his class. Its pretty hard tho, so be wary."
4386,2730,5.0,3.0,Mr. Elzinga is a living legend. 201 is one of those quintesential UVa courses you need to take to get the full experience here. Amazing lectures. Final is tricky but there is a generous curve. Take this class before graduating no matter your major
4387,2730,3.5,2.0,"Not as good as everyone thinks. He's a funny guy and his lectures are entertaining, but frankly, microecon is about the most useless subject, which nobody seems to recognize."
4388,2730,3.0,1.0,"Classes are not that bad, the topic is really interesting and the midterms are extremely easy. The final is really really hard, is worth 50% of your grade, and is nothing like the midterms. Make sure your TA knows how to speak English fluently! I got really disappointed of this class and professor Elzinga after the final."
4389,2730,5.0,2.0,"As has been said, Elzinga's the man. Take Micro with no one else."
4390,2730,3.5,2.0,Elzinga is wonderful. Final is abysmal. You must do well on the first two tests in order to buffer your grade. If you do poorly on the final it will drop at least a letter grade. This class is not for those who just get by with minimal reading.
4391,2730,4.5,4.0,"He is nice and fun. But unfortunately, I'm still not interested in econ..."
4392,2730,5.0,3.0,"Elzinga is an absolutely fantastic professor who is passionate about the material, able to bring real-world experience to his lectures, and personable enough to make you forget that there are 500 other people in the lecture hall with you. Not an easy A though. He'l make you work for it. And watch out, the final is notoriously difficult"
4393,2730,4.0,2.0,This class was awesome!  Elzinga is a wonderful lecturer who makes a topic like economics seem fun.  He jokes in class and is wonderful at office hours.  He loves teaching and it is obvious through his performance in the classroom.  Don't take microeconomics with anyone else!  You'll regret it later!
4394,2730,4.5,3.0,"Definitely THE professor to take ECON 201 with. Lectures are often funny which makes class enjoyable. Micro is not really my thing and sometimes I left class without feeling like I learned a whole lot, but that might be expected from a principles class. Still, Elzinga is a really nice guy and great at what he does so I definitely recommend!"
4395,2730,4.0,2.0,"Elzinga is the King of ECON 201. He's a wonderful guy and has a good sense of humor. His lectures are organized, interesting and very enjoyable. He is very enthusiastic and cares a lot about his students. The class itself is pretty easy. Definitely take this class!!"
4396,2730,5.0,3.0,I took introductory economics with Elzinga in 1975.  He is one of the 5 best teachers (kindergarten through law school) whose class I've had the pleasure of taking.  He lectured on antitrust at a CLE program I attended four years ago.  Still superb!
4397,2730,4.5,2.0,"I love Elzinga!  He managed to make a topic that would otherwise bore me into something fun and interesting!  I learned a lot in his class, and overall it wasn't too much work.  I highly recommend that everyone take ECON 201 with Elzinga."
4398,2730,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed this class. The first two exams are really easy but don't let that fool you into thinking the final is. It's worth 50% of your grade and the class average this semester was a mid-C. Elzinga is such a good professor though, definitely take his class."
4399,2730,4.0,4.0,very nice man but the exam is impossible! go into the exam with an A and expect to come out with a B or B-.  just warning you.
4400,2730,5.0,2.0,"Elzinga is the man. I went to every lecture even though they are optional, and enjoyed them all. He is also a superhero and most likely lives in a batcave underneath the chem building. Join the clicker club. Love it."
4401,2730,4.0,2.0,"If you take Economics, take it with Elzinga. He knows his stuff. He is VERY important in the economics world -- he's a powerful guy. He's funny, a good lecturer, and his tests really are not that hard. Study for like 1-2 hours and you'll be fine."
4402,2730,4.0,4.0,"READ!!! READ!!! READ!!! Although Elzinga is a great lecturer and just over all cool guy you will be COMPLETELY lost if you dont do the reading. Luckily the textbook isnt THAT rough, and once it clicks it clicks. Elzinga- totally awesome guy. I recommend this class but remember that a little effort goes a long way."
4403,2730,4.5,2.0,Everyone should take his class. He is just a great professor with lots of experience. Knows what he's talking about and gives excellent lectures.
4404,2730,5.0,3.0,The man is God. Legit teacher and a cool guy. Take this course!
4405,2730,5.0,3.0,"Everyone knows him and he lives up to the hype. Great professor, no one else can make ECON 201 clearer. Clicker questions aren't hard to come by and the majority of the final grade comes from the two midterms and one final. Take notes during lecture and maybe look over the book before tests and B+ or above is almost gaurenteed."
4406,2730,4.5,4.0,"Well, I got an F in this class even though I am otherwise a solid B+/A- student. Moral of the story: you need to go to every lecture, and do not rely on his &quot;double-dutch&quot; deal to save your grade. Clicker questions add up, the final is tough."
4407,2730,4.5,3.0,"Elzinga is very clear and the actual class is not that difficult, however be sure to study hard for the final because it was more difficult than people expected it to be!"
4408,2730,4.0,3.0,"Great class, great proff. Take econ w him if you have the chance"
4409,2730,5.0,4.0,"You don't realize how good Elzinga is until you watch your TA lecture, or you try to read the book and learn it on your own.  It's not really anything spectacular, but he teaches and does it well.  Tests and the final were not easy, but if you keep up, it's not all that bad."
4410,2730,4.5,5.0,"I really enjoyed class and Professor Elzinga, especially b/c the class is not strictly lecture.  It's a little relaxed.  That said though!  Tests were awful.  I never got enough practice to be able to apply lecture material.  I took this class &quot;for fun&quot; b/c everyone knows about Elzinga, but with my final grade, I should have waited."
4411,2730,4.0,3.0,"Professor Elzinga is amazing. His class makes you look at the world in a whole new (economic) way. Pay attention to the clicker questions...they tend to mimick the final. His unit tests are purely applications to the principles of economics and can be occasionally vague, but they're not that bad. The examples from the lectures help you understand t"
4412,2730,2.0,3.0,"very nice, but sincerely too many tangents... too little class... BORING"
4413,2730,5.0,3.0,"Take ECON 201 at UVa, and unless you've heard something great about one of the smaller sections (I hear they can be gems, if with the right teacher), Elzinga is a great choice!  Bit of a hard curve though."
4414,2730,4.0,2.0,The UVa. experience is incomplete without Elzinga.
4415,2730,4.5,3.0,"He is an amazing teacher! I love him! Attendance is not mandatory but exams are based mostly on the lecture so you need to go if you wanna do well on the exams. He manages 500-students incredibly well and gives very interesting, well organized lectures. He is just unbelievably amazing!"
4416,2730,4.0,2.0,He is an amazing teacher and really loves his subject! He is really concerned about the status of his students.  He will make time for his students and has office hours and offers Pepsi and cookies.  His class is really interesting and has a lot to do with everyday life.  I highly encourage every student to take this class at some point in time.
4417,2730,5.0,1.0,"Kenneth Elzinga is god. He teaches in a way that everyone can relate to. This is one teacher that almost everyone will have something good to say about. He is very comical and the tests arent too bad. Make sure you study hard for hte final because it is difficult. This man is so dedicated to his students, he will offer you to come over to his house"
4418,2730,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely wonderful! His lectures are always entertaining and give you valuable information that everybody should know. Mr. Elzinga genuinely cares about his students and is more than willing to help you outside of class. His tests aren't that bad, but watch out for his final!"
4419,2730,3.5,1.0,"I don't really care how intersting this man's lectures are. What I care about is the grade. So watch out, his tests are different from what you would expect. And the final is nothing like the previous tests, nor is it similar to the way he taught the class. Sure he is funny and a seemingly good Christian, but don't be caught off guard. Beware."
4420,2730,5.0,2.0,Incredible
4421,2730,5.0,3.0,Elzinga is an amazing professor that makes econ so interesting. His lectures are always engaging and he goes above and beyond to make himself available to his students. Definitely take his class while you're at UVA.
4422,2730,5.0,2.0,Absolutely great.  Highly recommended.  Go to class and do the reading (there is not too much outside work) and you will do fine.  Elzinga is an incredibly engaging professor who is open to his students even though he teaches two 500-person classes.  He actually lives up to all the hype.
4423,2730,5.0,2.0,awesome.thats all.
4424,2730,4.5,2.0,"strongly recommended. you may not learn too much about economics but elzinga is a very inspiring lecturer and he really teaches you what he calls &quot;the economic way of thinking&quot;. his exams are not that hard as most people say. test materials are usu in the text, apart from the part after the 2nd test (income)"
4425,2730,5.0,4.0,"OK, this was an amazing class. Elzinga is a great lecturer. He cares immensely about his students and genuinely loves teaching this class. He could be making millions elsewhere, but he loves his students and even invites you to thanksgiving dinner at his house. His passion shows through in class. Take it, you will definitely learn A LOT!"
4426,2730,4.0,2.0,"Elzinga is awesome.  advice:  LISTEN to what he was saying..I regret going to class and just taking notes.  If you sit and LISTEN, it's soo much better and you understand the material better.  he's a great lecturer and he presents the material with much knowledge.  If you're lucky, you'll get some free bee's in class!"
4427,2730,4.5,2.0,"Wonderful professor.  He explains everything very clearly.  Although you can get by without attending lecture, you really should go all the time because tests are almost entirely out of lecture.  Reading the text helps also.  If you take Econ 201, definitely do it with Elzinga."
4428,2730,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING TEACHER! Everyone should take this class regardless of major, it changes your life and the way you see the world!"
4429,2730,4.5,4.0,"Although he'll say his lectures dont parret the readings in the textbook its pretty much the exact same thing, just 3 tests all semester so don't mess one up. Also he'll let you take the final exam grade as your grade for the class which is really cool and he may be one of the best public speakers I have ever seen. Very knowledgeable and nice and y"
4430,2730,5.0,2.0,"Though it's too big of a class and doesn't really suit my way of learning, Elzinga's lectures are really interesting, and is always willing to help after lecture and during office hours. If you know the key concepts really well, then the class won't be so hard at all, despite what some of the other comments might say."
4431,2730,4.5,1.0,"This class is really easy.  There are a few key concepts you need to know (supply demand, marginal cost, etc) and that's it.  There's very little homework.  Elzinga is a pretty good lecturer, and usually dwells on topics for a few weeks, so you can afford to miss a lot of class.  Make sure you know the key concepts though, otherwise you're sunk."
4432,2730,5.0,5.0,"this is a great class to see how college should be...interesting, demanding, thought provoking... great guy who cares about his students if they care enough to ask for advice and help..."
4433,2730,4.0,2.0,No Comments
4434,2730,2.0,5.0,very tough classes... too many students... get noticed through office hours and study like a banchee...
4435,2730,4.0,3.0,very nice guy--get free soda and cookies if you go to office hours.  explains material very well.  there are only a few grades though so if you mess up on the first exam you should probably drop because you will probably do the same on the second and on the final (which is relatively difficult no matter how hard you study). recommend smaller class
4436,2730,5.0,4.0,"I love Elzinga! He had the most interesting lectures...tests were really hard, but if you kept up with the material in class they were'nt too bad because they were curved.  I also felt like it was my only useful class i have taken thus far, and that the subject matter was very relevant and interesting."
4437,2730,3.0,5.0,"Genuinley good professor..but nevertheless, the most challenging course I took this semester. Don't depend on lectures to help on exams, read and fully understand concepts in the text. If you do not do well on first two exams, final exam grade replaces entire semester grade for class (great option). However, do not be fooled..the final is no joke!"
4438,2730,5.0,2.0,"Elzinga is the man!  He really cares about the students and is willing to take the time nessecary to explain the material and in so doing, cultivate a love of economics in his students!  I love Elzinga!"
4439,2730,4.5,2.0,"I loved this class. Elzinga is a great professor.  He always makes jokes when you aren't expecting it.  He knows the subject very well and tries to be as clear as possible in lecture. My TA was decent and helpful, Peggy Huang.  The midterms are not easy by any means but it is possible to do well, but the final wasn't too bad.  Awesome class!!"
4440,2730,5.0,2.0,An institution at UVA and rightly so.  Instead of piling on even more praise for Mr. Elzinga (which he deserves)I give this advice: don't be afraid to keep switching discussion sections until you find a TA you like.  The importance of the TA is a bit overstated (because the final can make up your entire grade and its MC) but find a good one.
4441,2730,5.0,2.0,"He is a great lecturer and can keep a listener enthralled in his lectures, but the TA's are all horrible, making the class harder than it should be."
4442,2730,5.0,3.0,GREAT teacher! Best one I had all semester. He was easy to understand and taught a large lecture class well.  He was intresting and just an all around great guy. even if you are not planning to take any econ classes take his class. he is a great teacher and his class is very worth your time.
4443,2730,3.5,5.0,"great teacher, hard class"
4444,2730,4.0,2.0,Saving grace was the final exam. TAs were overly picky with taking points off of the midterms. Elzinga is a good man.
4445,2730,5.0,4.0,"Professor Elzinga is AMAZING.  ECON 201 with him is exactly the must-take course everybody says it is...take it, and do yourself a favor.  He is a brilliant, kind, and wonderful professor."
4446,2730,4.0,3.0,"Good speaker, great guy, but kind of overrated as a professor. I didn't follow follow his lectures very well, and they definitely din't stimulate my interested in econ. Don't expect too much from the TAs."
4447,2730,4.5,3.0,"Elzinga is good, but not as great as everyone says.  The structure of the class is horrible, no discussion leaders speak english, and your first two tests show it through the grading.  I would take a smaller econ to avoid the ambiguity of grading"
4448,2730,5.0,3.0,Elzinga is my favorite teacher ever! I'm so sad that Econ 201 is over! His lectures changed my outlook on life.
4449,2730,4.5,3.0,"Mr. Elzinga is fantastic and his lectures are awesome; by far my favorite class so far.  I've never taken Econ or a business class and I'm doing pretty well.  Keep up with your reading, study, and come to lectures-- it's a great class and very worth while!!"
4450,2730,5.0,2.0,"SOOOO dreamy. From the first time i stepped into the room i realized that i had found my true love. I am doing pretty well in his class but i would be doing SO much better if i could just help myself from getting lost in his beautiful, soulful eyes. AWESOME TEACH! VERY HOT! VERY FUNNY!  &lt;33"
4451,2730,4.5,2.0,"pretty much what you hear is right. awesome professor, and I predict he will end up being my favorite throughout my educational career, no joke.  tests aren't bad even though that one commetn suggests you ought to have done well on AP.  I've never touched business or econ and am doing very well. go to lecture, do some of the reading and you are set"
4452,2730,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Elzinga is the mam, pure and simple."
4453,2730,1.5,4.0,"Was explecting alot more from elzinga...Test are hard (with very open ended question, but just one specific answer), As a teacher he's terrible, lecture is a waste of time since the book teaches you everything he does and alot more, As for the TAs...good luck trying to understand them (I still cant pronounce my TA's name)"
4454,2730,3.5,3.0,"Tests are challenging.  Those who get A's probably got 5's on AP exams.  If you're one of those people, the class is no sweat.  Very little work and very little reading."
4455,2730,4.5,2.0,"funny, interesting, knowledgeable, has major credentials"
4456,2730,5.0,3.0,"Antitrust Policy is the single most useful class you can take at UVA.  Believe the hype, Elzinga is a top-5 UVA professor hands down"
4457,2730,3.0,4.0,"Elzinga is the most overrated professor I had at UVA. He's not an engaging lecturer. You can tell he uses stock jokes every semester. On a personal level, I lost respect for him after juxtaposing his frequent proselytizing with his career defending Wal-Mart, Du Pont and other corporations that defile the environment and consistantly violate human rights. Regardless of his Christian and Corporate Right values, I think he was only an average professor."
4458,2730,5.0,5.0,absolutely one of THE best professors at UVa
4459,2730,1.5,5.0,"overrated. really. i bet he's a nice guy, but not that great of a teacher, does not live up to the hype"
4460,2730,5.0,2.0,No Comments
4461,2730,4.0,5.0,"While he is definitely an econ expert, and a very entertaining lecturer, his tests were really difficult. Anyone who is just taking this class because they heard Elzinga is cool should try auditing or doing credit/no credit if not an econ genius."
4462,2730,1.0,5.0,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
4463,2730,4.0,4.0,"Elzinga is fabulous- a great lecturer, knowledgeable economist, and really sweet old man :) you will gain alot of useful daily knowledge from his class, and always be entertained. his tests are hard, esp. the final... make sure your TA is good."
4464,2730,3.0,4.0,"Elzinga is a great lecturer, definitely fun to listen to. However, his tests were really really hard. I was told to take him by so many people, but I found out later that the smaller classes seemed to learn things alot better...I would go with a small class if possible."
4465,2730,4.5,2.0,"He is an amazing person. Go to office hours and get to know him. It will be worth your time. He cares so much about students, and anyone who has anything bad to say about him either never really went to class or got the chance to know him, or is bitter because they did badly in the class."
4466,2730,2.0,4.0,"Highly overrated. Having struggled through what should have been an introductory course, I know now to warn others before they make the same mistake. His lecturer can be interesting, but know that his class doesn't really prepare you for upper level Econ, despite what you hear."
4467,2730,5.0,2.0,"Totally nerdy, yet totally cool."
4468,2730,5.0,3.0,"talks slow, but that is the only complaint. a fun guy."
4469,2730,5.0,4.0,"Elzinga is amzing- makes economics as fun as it ever will be in my opinion. Anyways, if you need to fill 3 extra credits, even if you have no desire to take multiple econ classes, I would recommend taking 201 with Elzinga"
4470,2730,3.5,4.0,"Great Teacher, but he loves making money.  Brags about being the economic consultant for Wal-Mart, Microsoft and every other big company.  I liked his class, but when I went to his office hours, he kicked me out only because Show Girls was playing on HBO."
4471,2730,5.0,3.0,"Very intertaining, good overall guy.  You don't need to read the book if you take good notes at the lectures."
4472,2730,4.5,1.0,"Elzinga is just about as good as they come.  Great speaker and very clear, the class is easy if you show up and listen.  Take good notes and ask questions in your discussion and reading the text isnt even needed.  Elzinga covers everything in an hour twice a week.  Bravo."
4473,2730,4.5,3.0,I loved the class.  It was a lot of fun.  Some of the lectures will be very useful in everyday life :)
4474,2730,4.5,2.0,"Great Class! I loved it. I didn't realize that Economics could actually be interesting before I took this class! Elzinga is very down to earth and approachable.  Don't let the large class size scare you away, I barely noticed there were 500 of us in the class (of course I sat in the front...)"
4475,2730,5.0,2.0,"One of the best classes to take, Elzinga's lectures are enjoyable and interesting."
4476,2730,5.0,3.0,"Undoubtedly one of the best lecturers I have ever encountered. It was a pleasure to take his class. I definitely learned a great deal, and would very much like to take another course with him."
4477,2730,4.5,3.0,Elzinga is the man!!!!
4478,2730,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher, tells lots of funny stories and has an awesome dry wit. While this class is a must take, it is not an easy A. Expect a B or so if you do the readings and go to lecture. Good, english-speaking TA is a must."
4479,2730,5.0,3.0,"Best teacher ever. He rocks. If he asks for a volunteer, raise your hand, he might give you money. The only class I would reccomend attending lecture. You won't need the book if you pay attention to him."
4480,2730,3.0,4.0,Very interesting teacher.  Keeps lecture pretty interesting.  Tests are hard.
4481,2730,3.5,4.0,"ECON is okay.  Elzinga's lectures are pretty hit or miss, with him hitting about 70% of the time.  Occasionally a lecture is just a series of graphs that is shuffled through too fast to comprehend.  You had better hope you don't have an international TA, too!"
4482,2730,5.0,3.0,Elzenga's definetly one of the best professors at UVa. His lectures are simply amazing and he has so much experience! He really teaches you all you need to know about econ. And he gives really good advice and is friendly and approachable.
4483,2730,3.5,4.0,"I think his lectures are nice, he makes them fun, still I also dont know what the hype is about.His tests are difficult!"
4484,2730,5.0,3.0,great sense of humor...loves and knows a great deal about sybject.
4485,2730,4.5,3.0,"He is a great guy.  The lectures are big, but pay attention and keep up with the reading and you'll be fine.  Go to his office hours! He will help anyone with academic advising.  You will appreciate him even more after talking to him.  Go to discussion to understand topics not covered in class."
4486,2730,3.0,4.0,"Good lecturer, but not a great teacher. Very enthusiastic despite a class of 500+ students. Pray you have a good TA or the class can be pretty challenging."
4487,2730,5.0,4.0,The GOLD standard!
4488,2730,5.0,3.0,"He is the man: a man of extreme intelligence, passion for his subject, and a willingness to serve every student that comes to his room.  An amazing person, in and out of class.  God bless you, Professor Elzinga."
4489,2730,3.0,3.0,I have no idea what the hype is all about.
4490,2730,5.0,4.0,love the dry sense of humor
4491,2730,5.0,3.0,"Elzinga is the man! He's totally brilliant and is a great lecturer. The class is large, but worth the experience."
4492,2730,3.0,4.0,good lecturer-- never made me miss econ 201 more than 5 times but hard exams... and NO i am not stupid.
4493,2730,5.0,4.0,Best professor ever!
4494,2730,3.5,2.0,not as good as everyone makes him out to be...hes a super nice guy...but his big room lectures are awful....can someone explain why his &quot;pegs&quot; don't organize his lecture at all&#63;
4495,2730,2.5,3.0,"The class is not that hard, but you get lost with all the other 500 students. The key is getting a good TA because Elzinga isn't that accessible. He tries the best he can, is very enthusiastic."
4496,2730,5.0,4.0,"this guy below me is absolutely correct. HE IS THE MAN. HE IS THE MAN. His tests can be tricky, but that's because you are dumb/stupid."
4497,2730,5.0,3.0,"elzing-zing is the man.....incredible speaker, funny lectures, best professor at the university.....tests can be hard, but they're manageable and worth it.....and dont forget about the good old dutch knock out"
4498,2730,5.0,1.0,"The Dutch Knock Out: Your grade is made up of two midterms, your discussion section, and the final exam.....OR.....Your final exam alone will be your final grade if it is higher. The final exam is usually multi-choice, which compensates for the difficulty"
4499,2730,5.0,4.0,Amazing. Take it before he retires.
4500,2730,5.0,2.0,"Awsome Class, Funny, great lecturer"
4501,2730,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors in the nation.
4502,2730,5.0,3.0,He's Incredible.
4503,2730,5.0,2.0,great lectures
4504,2730,4.5,2.0,He's pretty clear and helpful.  He has the lectures down like he's reading a script.
4505,2730,5.0,2.0,Great Lectures.  Funny and approachable.
4506,2730,3.5,4.0,best lecturer!!! uses lots of examples and material isn't hard. tests are weird (don't really cover material well...ambigious questions....) but material can be absorbed just from lectures. study for the final.
4507,2730,5.0,3.0,"Although I am merely a first-year, Dr. Elzinga is far and away the best professor I have. He's articulate, funny, and has every one of his lectures down to a science. I recommend this class to everyone."
4508,2730,5.0,2.0,"lives up to the hype...great lecturer.  make sure to get a good TA though, because a bad one can make the class a lot more stressful."
4509,2730,5.0,5.0,"Elzinga is perhaps one the nicest and most approachable person you'll ever meet; his lectures are always captivating; however, his tests are extremely hard and in a large class setting, it is often difficult to fully understand the material"
4510,2730,5.0,4.0,"Professor Elzinga is a great guy any way you cut it.  An amazing person and teacher, and his lectures are not only thought provoking, but fascinating as well.  Everyone should take his class."
4511,2730,4.0,3.0,"GREAT class, enjoyable lectures! The tests are intresting, however, but the class is still enjoyable, just the same!"
4512,2730,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Elzinga is simply amazing.  His class just cheers you up, no matter what your day's been like, and he's possibly the best teacher I've ever encountered.  This class should be required for every student at UVA."
4513,2730,5.0,2.0,"Elzinga is the man.  If you are going to take ECON201, you should take it with Mr. Elzinga.  Great lectures and very willing to helo students understand the material.  He goes above and beyond for his students, for whom he cares deeply about."
4514,2730,5.0,3.0,"Elzinga is the man. Plain and simple, he is brilliant and he does one of the few lectures that is always entertaining as well as informative. Again, the man."
4515,2730,5.0,3.0,"I had Dr. Elzinga 25 years ago for Micro.  He made a lasting impression on my life.  He is certainly one of the most well-rounded, impressive people I have ever met.  Ken Elzinga motivated me.  I have gone on to teach College Econ myself. I recommend him."
4516,2730,5.0,2.0,"nice guy, goes way and above and byond for his students.  he is also the head economist of microsft so he knows what he is talking about"
4517,2730,5.0,2.0,The best Prof I have ever had.  The only reason some idiots say bad things about Mr. Elzinga is because they didn't study for the final and it caught up with them.  He is great and everyone should take this class.  There is a reason he teaches 1000+/year!
4518,2730,3.5,4.0,Nice guy and good lecturer. Test questions are sometimes ambiguous.
4519,2730,2.5,4.0,"Definitely a nice guy, but I don't understand what all the hype is about."
4520,2730,4.5,3.0,"Incredible teacher, everyone should take his class."
4521,2730,5.0,2.0,The best! His lectures provide very good examples that are great for the material
4522,2730,2.0,3.0,"201 is overfilled and over-rated.  To be fair, he's really good in anti-trust"
4523,2730,5.0,4.0,Great teacher
4524,2730,5.0,3.0,Anyone who thinks Elzinga is a bad teacher is an idiot.  The best prof I know!

4537,2731,3.0,5.0,The final exam average was 54%. The exams are ridiculously hard and this shouldn't be an introductory level course. If you are coming to UVA as a freshman and want to take this class do it second semester. Be prepared to read and memorize 100 pages of text for 1 test. Do not pair this class with another strenuous course.
4538,2731,1.0,5.0,If this class wasn't required for the psychology major there is no way I would've taken it. Professor Brunjes clearly does not care about how his students do on the tests and the lectures are so scattered.
4539,2731,2.0,5.0,"Definitely the hardest class I've ever taken. READ THE TEXTBOOK. He doesn't use PowerPoints, he just shows pictures. He also doesn't use a microphone so make sure to sit close to the front. He drops your lowest exam grade. Questions on the exams can be very vague to super specific. Anything in lecture and in the textbook can be on the exams."
4540,2731,2.0,5.0,"This is by far the hardest class I have ever taken. He doesn't use any power points so the class bore me to death. The readings are difficult if you have not taken any bio classes before. Plus, the exams are very hard even if you have studied a lot. I would not recommend this class to anyone."
4541,2731,2.0,5.0,"Brunjes really enjoys teaching and wants you to learn, but he isn't very considerate of students who want to pass or are learning a difficult subject for the first time and can't memorize the text in detail. He doesn't use a microphone and there isn't a ppt, just pictures. Beware of exams and study since anything can be a question. Good luck..."
4542,2731,2.0,5.0,Y'know how a lot of teachers use power points and they'll upload the slides online so you can review what you missed? He doesn't do that. All info is spoken and the term might be written on the board so if you mishear or can't write something down before it's erased then you're screwed. Exams also use super niche lines from the text for questions.
4543,2731,4.0,3.0,"One word. MICROPHONE. Mans teaches a 300 person large lecture and doesn't use one. The lectures are genuinely very interesting, but you can't hear him if you sit anywhere near the back. And most of the test material (all of your grade) is from those lectures. I recommend you bring a hearing aid to class. Graded on a bell curve, not too hard."
4544,2731,3.0,5.0,"The info is very interesting and I liked him but his lectures bored me because he doesn't use ppts. That said, I barely went to class and just studied the textbook and did fine on tests. He likes to include info on tests that's specific and not general. Review old exams, he reuses questions."
4545,2731,3.0,3.0,"Brunjes was a funny guy who seemed to know a lot about his subject. This class was very bio based, and he sometimes seemed to dumb-down the info. Not the most captivating lecturer and he doesn't do a powerpoint. You get to drop the lowest test but they were pretty nitpicky with questions from the book and lecture."
4546,2731,3.5,5.0,"I wouldn't not recommend this class, though I wouldn't per se recommend it either. It has been the hardest class I've taken at UVa thus far. That said, I've learned a lot. He is a good lecturer and knows his stuff, and has a dry sense of humor. HIS TESTS ARE EXTREME!! I'm talking study all night and get a 65, extreme. Be wary.. All I'm saying..."
4547,2731,4.0,3.0,"I'd absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is considering it. Brunjes makes his tests difficult, but he posts exams from the past 10 years or so online, and they're great to study from. I found the tests difficult, but still did well in the class because of the curve. Definitely worth taking if you're willing to put in the time to study"
4548,2731,3.5,4.0,"Brunjes is a decent lecturer, but his tests always have poorly worded questions on them. The class is graded on a bell curve, so you don't really know where you'll fall until the very end, and you are able to drop one exam grade."
4549,2731,4.0,5.0,"Brunjes is great, but this class is really hard. It's cool cause you can drop any exam, including the final, but the exams are very difficult. Also, he curves it, which is nice. Lectures are fun and interesting, but you have to be listening to get his humor, which is hilarious."
4550,2731,5.0,4.0,awesome!
4551,2731,5.0,2.0,Wonderful!
4552,2731,2.5,4.0,"funny guy, but i didnt think the lectures were always clear. hard to do well in the class. DO THE PRACTICE TESTS!! they are extremely helpful! i wish i had done them more from the beginning."
4553,2731,4.0,3.0,"Brunjes is one of the best profs I've had! End up reading most of the book but in small chunks so it's manageable. Old school lectures without slides, just used the chalkboard, which was kind of nice. Really knows his stuff and will answer any question. Not as hard as some say, study old tests and go to class and you can get an A. Loved it!"
4554,2731,3.5,3.0,"Great class! You should read before coming to class but only take notes from the class lecture. Everything on the test will be given in the lecture (he even cites which date on his test answer keys). There are five exams, he takes the top 4. Half the class gets C or below. Easy course to comprehend, hard to do well in because of grade distribution."
4555,2731,4.5,4.0,This class was a lot of fun and was great for an intro level neuroscience class.  The lectures are entertaining and he makes an attempt to answer any questions.
4556,2731,3.0,4.0,It can be difficult to understand specifics about particular concepts from his lectures.  Grading system for this class is absolutley ridiculous.
4557,2731,5.0,4.0,"Very funny lectures, interesting, a wealth of extra information is provided to help you study for tests. The catch is, tests are hard. Yes, the average is 60%, but everyone who gets average or above gets an A or B, meaning grading is  100% fair. Questions are hard, study off old tests, it's one of the most fun classes i've taken at uva"
4558,2731,3.5,4.0,this class= READING!! Prof. Brunjes is a good guy and rather interesting during lectures but his tests are way too hard and detailed. If you want to do well you have to go to lectures and read all the chapters assigned...a lot of test questions are from readings. I liked the material but was not happy with my final grade!!
4559,2731,3.5,4.0,The test format (35 multiple choice questions) are not adequate to test an entire years worth of knowledge. This class is very difficult for someone who is not prone to biology. Overall I was disappointed.
4560,2731,5.0,4.0,"Great lecturer. Goofy, but in a good way. If you want a good grade you better go to class, because there are no powerpoint slides, and a lot of what he says isn't in the book."
4561,2731,4.5,2.0,"Really intresting if you like the topic. I liked his lectures and liked going to class. Tests are kinda tough, but you should do fine if you do some of the previous tests and go to lectures."
4562,2731,5.0,2.0,Explains everything very clearly... not background in the subject required. He cracks me up personally and has a funny personality which I can't put into words but he's cool. Know you're neurotransmitters.
4563,2731,5.0,2.0,"Brunkes = the man! His lectures are extremely entertaining and he's relaly helpful! Don't be swayed by these guys who say the class is hard. If you pay attention in lecture and at least skim the readings, you'll get at least a solid B. DO THE OLD TESTS ONLINE! They're beyond helpful!!"
4564,2731,3.0,3.0,"Brunjes tries to keep the class interested during lectures, though the material has moments where it's incredibly boring. The tests are not as easy as you would think so studying is a must."
4565,2731,5.0,3.0,"Awesome class! I love this topic, may major in it. Prof Brunjes makes it interesting. Humorous and straight forward lectures. You can ask questions during class. Talk to him outside of class, too, as he is always willing to help."
4566,2731,3.5,4.0,"Great lecturer and a nice person if you get to talk to him outside of class. The material was interesting to me, but not enough for me to major in it. Read the textbook closely (take notes on every chapter!) and pay attention MOST of the time. Definitely go over the old exams he provides - some questions are reused."
4567,2731,3.0,4.0,"Brunjes is one of the best professors at UVA - so dedicated to his subject, and an extremely interesting lecturer! Read the text, go over old tests he provides, and ATTEND LECTURES!! It's a tough class, but definitely worth it. He is old school - doesn't use a microphone or powerpoints - it's really refreshing. AND you can ask questions in lecture."
4568,2731,4.0,5.0,"brunjes is a great teacher yet i could not stay awake in class because i hated the material. it was NOT what i was expecting at all (biology&#63; ew). i tried reading the book, but got F's on all of the tests. somehow i got a D for the year though. do not take this class unless you want to go to class every day and read the book cover to cover."
4569,2731,5.0,3.0,Wonderful class and professor although you pretty much have to memorize the book and his class notes to get an A.
4570,2731,3.5,3.0,"Overall, the class is interesting. Brunjes is entertaining and has a sense of humor. Just read the book and keep up with the lectures and you will do fine."
4571,2731,3.5,4.0,an interesting class but you need to dedicate some time to it
4572,2731,4.5,2.0,"Brunjes is awesome. His lectures are entertaining and do a good job of going over the text as well as supplementing it. you can ask questions right in lecture, all of the old exams are posted online, his exams are easy to prepare for, you know what to expect, and he just does an excellent job. Not to mention he's fun and excited about the material!"
4573,2731,5.0,3.0,"WONDERFUL class and professor!! One of my favorites. Learned a lot. He is hilarious and helpful. Old tests are supplied--take advantage! I failed the first test, but aced the next four. I studied by taking two or three old tests and finding answers to them in the book by reading various sections. Prepared me well. TAKE THIS CLASS!! It's worth it!"
4574,2731,4.5,4.0,"Engaging lecturer. But, READ THE BOOK! This cannot be stressed enough. I learned this after the second midterm and was headed for a C- but read the book and ended the semester with a B+. If you just try to study lecture, you will fail. His tests pull out minute details from both book and lecture. Enjoyable class, just prepare to work for the A."
4575,2731,4.0,4.0,"Fun material, fun teacher. A fair amount of memorization, though."
4576,2731,5.0,2.0,Great Class. Really interesting material. Tests were tough but the curve is fair: 25% get As. Brunjes is really friendly and lets you ask questions during the lecture.
4577,2731,4.0,4.0,"great teacher, but tests are IMPOSIBLE--really must know every little detail, learned a lot tho!"
4578,2731,5.0,2.0,Excellent Professor
4579,2731,2.0,4.0,"Average workload for a psych class (I took PSYC before), but might be overwhelming. Engaging lectures, but, like most raters on here have commented on, focuses on minute details. Trust your gut instinct on tests and if you are trying to decide between answers, always choose the more precise one."
4580,2731,5.0,3.0,Wonderful
4581,2731,3.5,4.0,"Good lecturer - funny, engaging. Kept me awake. Interesting material. Tests were SUPER HARD though - must know every single obscure detail in the reading - even things never gone over in class. TA was incompetent and basically unhelpful. Take ONLY if you can commit yourself to lots of intense reading."
4582,2731,2.5,4.0,"the material was somewhat interesting, but was more bio than psych. he was a good professor, but beware of tests! very ambiguous and tricky. (example. how many of the following statements are true&#63;)"
4583,2731,5.0,3.0,he is the best professor who teaches this class (and it is a great class)
4584,2731,5.0,2.0,"This class was very interesting, and Brunjes can be quite funny. There is minimal reading, but you really have to study for the tests."
4585,2731,4.5,3.0,"Brunjes is a great lecturer - sense of humor and knows his stuff! The class isn't that tough - just do the readings (which aren't long at all - 10 pages every 2 days) and take notes in class. The tests can be hard, but not if you study. He'll ask small details, but maybe only 3 questions out of 35. VERY interesting material! Recommend!!"
4586,2731,2.0,5.0,"Although this was my most interesting class this semester it was also one of my hardest. The material in the class is very interesting. His tests are rediculously hard.  He asks questions about very minute details that he mentioned in class or that was a sentence in the book. If you care about your grade, I would suggest taking it 2nd semester."
4587,2731,1.0,5.0,BAD PROFESSOR! The material seems straightforward enough but the tests are REALLY HARD! The class average on tests was like a 60%! The test questions don't test your knowledge of the overall material but your remembering some minute point in the reading that was all of one sentence! Not recommended. :(
4588,2731,4.5,2.0,"I absolutely LOVED this class. I must say, it was th e only lecture that I actually looked forward to going to, and its pretty easy to make a decent grade in it. The readings arent usually long at all, and the material is really really interesting, especially with Brunjes who has a great since of humor. I would definately recommend this class."
4589,2731,3.5,3.0,"If you don't like to read...Don't take...You practically have to memorize the book to do decent on the tests.  But other than that, not demanding."
4590,2731,4.0,2.0,"very laid-back, not too demanding, fairly interesting class. Easy to get at least a B"
4591,2731,3.5,4.0,class is extremely interesting. attend lecture. dry sense of humor...funny and a good prof
4592,2731,2.0,4.0,"He seems like a perfectly decent professor when he lectures.  And then he gives you a test based on minute details and retarded examples he spent maybe 30 seconds on.  They are pretty much impossible unless you want to sit around and literally memorize the book.  If you dont have to take this class, i wouldnt."
4593,2731,5.0,2.0,"He's awesome! He has this dry sense of humour that makes class really fun. He's extremely clear and explains stuff well. DEFINITELY attend class and take notes because it will help immensely on the tests. Learn every detail in the book, the final is comprehensive and HARD!! but the class is super-interesting and definitely worth it."
4594,2731,4.0,3.0,he's a nice guy and he knows his stuff. you REALLY have to read the book for the tests but the lectures are pretty important too. if you're willing to do the work you can count on a reasonable grade in the class.
4595,2731,5.0,2.0,"He's a really good teacher, attend the class and you'll a) do well and b) learn some interesting stuff."
4596,2731,5.0,4.0,"if any professor at this school would be a ****, it is mr brunjes.  hilarious lectures, easy to follow, and a reasonable workload.  tests are usually a mixed bag, but he bell curves so it makes it ok."
4597,2731,4.5,4.0,"brunjes is awesome! he is funny and i had no background in psychobio before and i still follow him in lectures. he is tough, not gonna lie... i study hard for his exams and im hoping to pull off a B, but still a great, interesting class and brunjes is the only one to take for it!! hes 1 of my fav lecturers. tests are equally lecture and book-based"
4598,2731,3.5,3.0,No Comments
4599,2731,5.0,2.0,both the class and brunjes is awesome. he's really funny and you can tell that he's totally passionate about the subject
4600,2731,5.0,3.0,Easily one of the best professors I've had.
4601,2731,5.0,3.0,Very entertaining
4602,2731,4.0,2.0,Amusing lectures. Very interesting.
4603,2731,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Brunjes is one of the best (if not the) lecturer's in the psyc department. His classes are consistently clear, despite the difficult subject matter, and often funny.  Really hammer the book and take the sample tests and the actual tests should be easy.  Best 200-level psyc course - no doubt!"
4604,2731,5.0,1.0,he's funny...makes the subject less boring
4605,2731,5.0,3.0,"Very entertaining, and very easy to follow. Great class!!! I don't see how you can write a bad review of this guy. Great teacher, who is interested in and actually encourages asking questions during lecture. Read the book, take notes, and quizzes will be no problem."
4606,2731,4.5,4.0,funny
4607,2731,5.0,3.0,awesome teacher.
4608,2731,4.5,3.0,"brunjes is awesome- he explains the most uninteresting & complicated information in a way that lets you understand. although the tests are hard, if you do the reading & study well they're completely do-able. definitely take brunjes, he's a funny guy."
4609,2731,4.5,3.0,Very funny and enthusiastic. He is able to teach a lot of information without being boring.

4613,2731,1.0,3.0,Very dissapointed in this class and his teaching methods.  Sarcastic and rude to the students.
4614,2731,1.0,5.0,"Worst prof I have ever had. He should not be allowed to teach, seriously."
4615,2731,5.0,2.0,really entertaining and fun professor esp for large lecture class

4617,2731,4.5,3.0,"Very cool.  His lectures were fascinating, given the material."
4618,2731,5.0,2.0,"Excellent lectures! Very clear and helpful, will go out of his way to make sure that the point is clear. Very difficult material (ie neurons, hemisphere perception) made understandable.  My favorite class."
4619,2731,4.5,3.0,"One of my favorite classes, EXCELLENT lectures!"

4626,2731,5.0,3.0,excellent prof!
4627,2731,5.0,4.0,"Lectures are entertaining, very little regurgitation.  Gives tricky tests."
4628,2732,5.0,4.0,Math did not make sense for me.. until I took her course. Best teacher. Period.
4629,2732,5.0,4.0,"Mary Beck is the best. The material itself is VERY hard, and if you're looking for an easy A, this is not the section for you. But if you're looking for a professor who genuinely cares about you and teaches the material in a fun and interesting way, take this section. Go to office hours, as they can turn out to be both useful and enjoyable."
4630,2732,5.0,3.0,"Mary Beck is absolutely the greatest professor at UVA. Go to office hours, and you will learn some great life advice, and many interesting things about Prof. Beck. She is the coolest person ever. The class is challenging, but she is more than willing to help. I love her so much and wish she taught every math class. Get her if you can!!!"
4631,2732,5.0,4.0,Best professor ever.
4632,2732,5.0,1.0,"Best teacher ever! You cant miss her! Humorous, lovely and approachable. Her lectures are very will organized, and she will answer your question clearly and patiently. She is the reason why I never miss any calc 2 class. Take her class and you will looooooooooooove math!!!!"
4633,2732,5.0,3.0,"She is wonderful!!!!!! One of the best teacher ever! Really nice, helpful and tricky(just sometimes for fun)."
4634,2732,5.0,3.0,"Excellent teacher! I took this calss before and had a grade i didnt expect, so i decided to take it again with Prof Beck. She makes the subject easier and more fun. I actually like the class now thanks to her. She is really enthusiastic about teaching and offering the best of her helping hand."
4635,2732,5.0,4.0,OBSESSED WITH BECK. Best teacher at UVA
4636,2732,5.0,4.0,Beck is the best math teacher at UVA. This was the only math class I have ever had where the lectures are actually useful. Get her if at all possible
4637,2732,5.0,4.0,"Professor Beck is quite simply the best, most intelligent, clearest, most helpful professor here at UVA. APMA is difficult, that's why you'd be insane to take it with any other professor. You won't find anyone else like her."
4638,2732,5.0,4.0,"I had professor Beck for three semesters (APMA 1090, 1010, 2010) and she is definitely chill. A little spacey at times, but otherwise extremely friendly and fun to talk to. She makes obscure material clear and her class is pretty fair... But with all apma classes, a lot of homework and studying needs to be before you can do well in her class."
4639,2732,4.5,4.0,Professor Beck has a great understanding of the material and is a really cool person overall. This class is really hard but Prof. Beck gave a lot to help us through it. I highly recommend her.
4640,2732,5.0,3.0,Beck is awesome.
4641,2732,5.0,3.0,"I took Calc I and II with Prof Beck.  She is by far the most helpful professor I've had, she really looks out for her students.  She presents the material in a manner that just makes it extremely easy to understand.  Weekly quizzes are alright, exams are pretty intense.  Do the homework and pay attention in class."
4642,2732,5.0,3.0,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. Hands down best calculus teacher Ive ever had.I'm taking APMA 1110 with her right now.I actually took the same course with Pisano last semester and failed... Beck is like a calc god though. She makes the class fun and engaging and does lots of practice probs. She knows everyone's name and'll call on u.Wish I had her last sem..
4643,2732,5.0,3.0,Mary Beck is the best thing that could happen to your life in college.
4644,2732,5.0,3.0,She is the best!
4645,2732,4.5,2.0,"Phenominal, unmatched, involved"
4646,2732,4.5,4.0,You don't take this class for the grade because the average is a C. You take it for the professor.
4647,2732,5.0,2.0,"If you don't choose Mrs. Beck as a teacher, you are ill-informed and unwise. You are unlikely to find a better calculus teacher on grounds, especially one as friendly, open, and willing as she. Best advice ever&#63; Never study. If you're prepared everyday, you won't need to."
4648,2732,5.0,3.0,i love miss mary beck. her favorite thing to dine on is beaver. she thinks her daughter and her friends are way cute and will tell you so. she loves beets and bonjovi.
4649,2732,4.5,4.0,best calc teacher at uva. very helpful and friendly. definitely take her class if you can.
4650,2732,5.0,4.0,The way she presented the material on the board really illustrated the important points of the textbook.
4651,2732,5.0,3.0,No Comments
4652,2732,5.0,4.0,My favorite professor and probably one of the best at this university. Very up front and honest with you about your grade. Encourages you when she knows you're trying your best. Doesn't care much for the sleepers and the skippers which is perfectly understandable. Will give you the grade that you deserve.
4653,2732,5.0,2.0,Really helpful. She can tell you the main point of each chapter and help you to prepare for each quiz/test
4654,2732,5.0,3.0,Beck is by far the best teacher out there.. you would be lucky to have her.  She's nice and her class may be challenging but she's an awesome teacher and makes it much easier to understand.
4655,2732,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Beck is an amazing teacher!  As much as I am not a fan of math, I almost looked forward going to her classes.  She teaches with such enthusiasm that you can't help but enjoying the lectures."
4656,2732,5.0,1.0,Probably ... the best professor at UVA!!
4657,2732,4.5,4.0,AMAZING TEACHER! Unbelievably helpful. Only drawback is that office hours are crowded because she is so amazing
4658,2732,5.0,3.0,amazing teacher!
4659,2732,5.0,3.0,"Best math teacher I've ever had, period. If you need to take Calculus, take it with her."
4660,2732,5.0,3.0,"Beck is the best teacher on the PLANET !! she's so clever and helpful. She has an amazing diagnose capability. She will tell what your problem is and trust me, whether u accept or not it's the truth !! listen to what she says. Things she says are quite valuable. Class maybe hard but you'll get the courage to study and do well! i love you BECK!"
4661,2732,5.0,4.0,One hot mama. Mary is also a Bon Jovi freak. Points.
4662,2732,5.0,4.0,One of the top few teachers I've ever had.
4663,2732,5.0,4.0,by far the best teacher I've had
4664,2732,5.0,3.0,she's great
4665,2732,5.0,3.0,"I had her 2 semesters in a row and loved her.  She's the best teacher i've had in any subject.  very willing to answer questions, very clear in explanations, and lets you know how to study for her tests.  Her tests are a little difficult but its always done on a curve, so it evens out."
4666,2732,5.0,3.0,she's great
4667,2732,5.0,2.0,"Beck is one of the best professors I've had at UVA so far. Class can be difficult but if you work hard, you'll  be fine. Show effort, pay attention, do your hw! Tests were better than APMA109, but watch the time.  Visit her at office hours and don't skip. Your effort she sees factors a lot into your grade. Beck is so nice and explains really well."
4668,2732,2.5,4.0,After having her for 2 classes I have seen how she is extremely unfair. If you suck up to her early you will get a high grade no matter how poorly you do. She tells you she never uses a curve but what she really means is she only curves grades of people she likes and leaves the others really low.
4669,2732,5.0,2.0,"Incredible teacher, as long as you put in the effort she's more than willing to help you understand the material."
4670,2732,5.0,3.0,Its a tough course and you definitely have to work.  She is very approachable and is an excellent teacher.  Definitely go to office hours and definitely use past tests to study.
4671,2732,5.0,3.0,Best teacher in the APMA department
4672,2732,2.0,3.0,"The examples given in class are very easy, understandable, and do not prepare you for the tests at all.  Her office hours are so crowded that you will be lucky to even see her when you go. I regret taking her class."
4673,2732,5.0,4.0,"She is a great professor, better than the ones I've had so far.  She can EXPLAIN and is very patient.  Her tests are very difficult, but it is possible to get an A! Pay attention or she'll call on you! Unless you've taken BC, study hard until you KNOW exactly what you're doing."
4674,2732,5.0,4.0,Great teacher.Very helpful.Hard tests.
4675,2732,5.0,4.0,"Definately hard, but overall her lectures are clear and well laid out.  She remembers everyone's name, and her mental math and non-calculator calculations on the board are amazing.  She definately knows her algebra."
4676,2732,5.0,1.0,No Comments
4677,2732,5.0,3.0,"Mary Beck is a great professor, class is kinda hard but she's really helpful and a good teacher"
4678,2732,1.0,5.0,"Hated her as a teacher.  She played favorites to the point where I did better on all 3 tests, had a better qz average and did better on the hw and final than someone else by a considerable amount.  I knew the other kid, we both computed our averages I had an 86.5 avg, he a 70 avg, and we both go B's"
4679,2732,4.0,4.0,"She's great. She's compassionate and likes people who try hard. Office hours can be crowded, but she tries to answer questions."
4680,2732,3.5,3.0,"Definitely on of the better professors I've had.  She really tries to explain things, but is sometimes confusing (so if you have a question ask...she'll answer it!).  The examples in class are a little deceiving 'cause the tests are definitely harder than you'll expect."
4681,2732,2.5,4.0,"Her examples in class are easy as pie, then proceeds to put impossible questions on the test. The average on the third test was a 50%.  When she is teaching a lesson it often seems as if she does not know where she is going with things. I would try to not get her."
4682,2732,4.0,3.0,Great Teacher
4683,2732,1.0,5.0,SHE SUCKS.  NOT FAIR...Not the best teacher ever.
4684,2732,5.0,3.0,very helpful and takes interest in her students
4685,2732,4.0,4.0,She is just one of the more compassionate teachers I have pleasure to talk to. In office hours its fun even when were learning and she always has an ear open
4686,2732,4.5,4.0,"Ms Beck is THE best calculus teacher I've ever had, and although i'm just not good at calc in general, she helped me understand most of it and was always there to give help and always had a new way to explain things so everyone can understand"
4687,2732,4.0,4.0,"She was good with explaining and willing to answer questions. Intimidating at times, but one of the better math teachers here (which doesn't say much btw)."
4688,2732,5.0,4.0,"by far the best teacher i had in my first year at the university of virginia.  if you put in the effort, she will help you.  she does not like to see those who put in the time do poorly."
4689,2732,5.0,4.0,she is undoubtedly the BEST prof i've ever had... so nice and explains so well...
4690,2732,5.0,3.0,"She's a great teacher. She knows her stuff, will go the extra mile to help you, and she's a much better source of advice then any of the faculty advisors I've had."
4691,2732,5.0,4.0,"Smart, easy to understand, and HOT!"
4692,2732,5.0,4.0,"Excellent teacher, very fourtunate to have her two semesters."
4693,2732,5.0,3.0,greatest teacher on the planet
4694,2732,5.0,1.0,Very helpful
4695,2732,5.0,3.0,"Mary Beck is the best teacher that I've ever had, I took her for 109 and 111. I had never had calculus before and i went from a C minus in 109 to an A in 11 becasue she was so good at explaining and was willing to work with me."
4696,2732,5.0,3.0,KICKS BOOTY
4697,2732,5.0,3.0,"She is wonderful, I love that class because she makes it so easy to understand. It's a hard course but she is awesome!"
4698,2732,5.0,3.0,"she's the BEST!  i love the class.  even though it's hard she's always ready to help, and she is great at explaining things, take her for all math classes possible."
4699,2732,4.0,2.0,Great teacher...I really like her.
4700,2732,5.0,2.0,"Mary Beck is the best college professor that I have ever had. Not only is she a great teacher, but she is also a good friend that can help you out with anything you need. She's got my vote - Mary Beck is wonderful."
4701,2732,5.0,4.0,By far the best math professor at this school
4702,2732,5.0,4.0,Very good professor.  A good model for all professor at the University

4714,2732,4.5,1.0,Mrs. Beck is a wonderful person and a great teacher who makes a class fun.
4715,2732,5.0,3.0,"Best teacher you can get, and a nice person as well."
4716,2732,5.0,3.0,I enjoy going to class to see Mrs. Beck.
4717,2732,5.0,3.0,Best teacher I've ever had
4718,2732,4.0,2.0,No Comments
4719,2732,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Beck is the best math teacher I've ever had.  I learned so much.
4720,2732,4.0,5.0,"Nice lady, but moves way too fast"
4721,2732,5.0,4.0,Best APMA prof out there.  Her students learn the most and test the best.
4722,379563,4.5,4.0,"Professor Jones puts his students first. The material covered by this course definitely is not easy, but Prof. Jones' lectures are engaging and he is always flexible to help students outside of class. Definitely go to office hours when you don't understand or need help on a homework problem. He is great at explaining."
4723,379563,5.0,3.0,"One of the best physics teachers I've had! He explains the material and his office hours are worthwhile. Some concepts were difficult for me to understand, but when I asked questions he would give me different approaches to the problem to help me see it in different ways, which was very helpful."
4724,379563,3.5,4.0,"Professor Jones was a comprehensible teacher and his lectures were organized and clear, but the material was very difficult (but also interesting). He could be helpful in office hours, but he was occasionally condescending when you asked possibly trivial questions. Homework and tests were difficult, and the homework was time-consuming."
4725,379563,5.0,5.0,"My favorite professor! LOVE HIM! Great demos, fun, makes things clear"
4726,379563,4.5,4.0,Go to office hours.  Dr. Jones is always willing to help + it will help your grade
4727,379563,4.5,3.0,"Professor Jones truly seems to care about his students.   Go to his office hours, I cannot stress this enough.  He will work through some homework problems with you, which is not only a grade booster, but also helps you understand the concepts.  The tests are sort of hard, but he will help you if you go to him before, plus he curves to average a B."
4728,379563,5.0,3.0,"I pretty much love this guy even though this class is challenging.  As much as you think you shouldn't, I highly recommend going to office hours."
4729,379563,5.0,3.0,"He truely cares about the success of each student. He constantly extends his office hours. He stayed until 11:00pm to stay in help students with homework even though he had to drive to W&M for a conference at 6:00am. Great class demonstrations! Exams are very hard though, but he prepares you well."
4730,379563,5.0,2.0,"He's really cool, knows what he's talking about, tries to keep it interesting but some things are unavoidable (not his fault), does a lot of cool demos...i highly recommend him."
4731,379563,5.0,2.0,"very enthusiastic, keeps the subject matter interesting, always helpful and approachable... this guy's great"
4732,379563,5.0,3.0,"Great demos, fair grading, explains well and answers all questions without going on tangents, and great in office hours when you are working on problem sets.  If you are thinking about taking a class but not sure if you want to because you don't know Jones and he is teaching it, definitely take it!  I highly recommend him."
4733,379563,4.5,3.0,"Class should be fairly simple, but it's harder than you think.  He himself is a good guy, very approachable and easy to talk to.  You get the feeling he is ridiculously smart."
4734,379563,5.0,3.0,I love him!
4735,379563,3.5,4.0,"Funny examples, but not really that great of a teacher.  Stops going down one road of explaining when I'd like him to continue.  He does help during office hours, however, which is what saved my grade.  If you have him, go to office hours."
4736,379563,2.5,5.0,"The demonstrations are fun, but the class is very difficult.  The class description states no previous physics experiance required, but i would advice that  those interested to take AP physics in high school.  The basic concepts are given, but neither the book nor professor  provide basic examples for their application.  Homework is very difficult."
4737,379563,5.0,3.0,"homework pretty hard, but he's helpful.  Tries to keep lectures interesting and succeeds some of the time.  Since people who take this class have to, that doesn't really matter--he's a good guy and a good teacher after all."
4738,379563,4.5,4.0,he's a really nice guy and very helpful if you go to office hours. which i did often because this class was definitely not as easy as i expected it to be.
4739,379563,3.5,3.0,"I enjoyed the class.  His used technology well and made sure that plenty of study material was available.  The classes were a little dry, but considering the level of the subject matter, that is to be expected..."
4740,379563,3.0,3.0,"nice guy, not a great teacher"
4741,1854132,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Varon is clearly very familiar with her subject, and her assignments, while long, were not too difficult. Although the material is interesting, it's very easy to lose focus during lecture. She was very understanding outside of class, and the TAs were helpful and fair."
4742,1854132,5.0,4.0,"I cannot speak highly enough about Dr. Varon. Her HIUS 3071 were so interesting, and you could tell she was extremely knowledgable about the subject material. Do not be intimidated by her; she is one of the nicest professors I have ever had!"
4743,1854132,4.0,3.0,Professor Varon is engaging and the material is interesting. You can tell that she cares about the topic and about her students. Absolutely would take again.
4744,1854132,5.0,3.0,"Varon is so kind and really cares about her students (ex: I was sick and she was so nice and willing to give me an extension). Her lectures are super organized and easy to follow if you take good notes! Material is interesting and relates to events today. Shira is an awesome TA, literally the best I've ever had: funny, relatable, fair grader."
4745,1854132,5.0,2.0,"I love Professor Varon. She keeps me inspired to learn history and I'm not even a history major! Her class The Coming of the Civil War was extremely interesting. I originally thought that it would be some easy credits because history in high school was easy, but this class was challenging and actually made me think critically. I loved it!"
4746,2741,5.0,3.0,"I did Global First, so I took Professor Levenson's class in London. It was a great experience, and much of the class involved taking field trips and discussing plays we saw. He was very engaging, and discussions were always interesting."
4747,2741,5.0,2.0,"Levenson is a great lecturer and deep thinker. The class is built around reading global literature and discussing it. The grade will come very easily, so focus on enjoying the class and getting as much out of it as you can. The exams and assignments are easy. The subjects discussed are not! Levenson is a must-take prof at UVA."
4748,2741,5.0,2.0,He's a great professor! You'll love him. I had him as a professor in London and he made the experience brilliant. Take the class. You won't regret it.
4749,2741,5.0,3.0,Levenson is the best professor I've ever had - everyone needs to take a class with him
4750,2741,5.0,4.0,Take this class. I don't care if you're a commerce major or philosophy major. Don't graduate without taking this course. The lectures are amazing.
4751,2741,5.0,3.0,"An absolutely fantastic professor and person. I had him when he led the London First Program for the first time, and he was incredible and the made the experience even more memorable! Every class is engaging, he works hard to contextualize and make information more tangible, and truly cares about his students. Definitely take a class with him!"
4752,2741,5.0,3.0,Levenson is a figure here at UVA and for good reason. He is passionate and really cares that the students he teaches find something to love about the subject. He is great at making you feel like your commentary is worth while.
4753,2741,5.0,3.0,Levenson is so good it's difficult to describe him with anything other than platitudes. He's the man that turns business students into English majors. Lectures are actually fulfilling to some long starved center of the human soul.
4754,2741,5.0,2.0,"Levenson is the best lecturer I've ever had, bar none, in addition to being one of the nicest. 'Inspirational' gets thrown around a lot, but it really applies to him. His enthusiasm for the material (and Joyce in particular) is pathogenic."
4755,2741,5.0,3.0,"Easily the best lecturer at UVA. Basically every sentence to come out of his mouth was something profound and poetic that would probably get hella notes on tumblr. His reading assignments are about half what you would expecthalf not, but in a good way. When I wanted to switch majors, he was the one who made me want to stay w English"
4756,2741,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors at UVA. His lectures are incredible.
4757,2741,5.0,3.0,Fantastic instructor who gives his all to each and every lecture. His infectious love of literature really shines.
4758,2741,5.0,2.0,"He was fantastic! If you are an English major (or even if you aren't), you HAVE to take him. It will be fantastic. He wants you to think and assigns difficult readings but the lectures are completely worth it."
4759,2741,5.0,4.0,Best teacher I had at UVa.  A real live person.  Go talk to him in office hours!
4760,2741,5.0,2.0,Do the culture of London program with him!
4761,2741,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I have ever had. Words can't describe my adoration, respect, and appreciation for him. Taking a class from him is the best decision you will ever make."
4762,2741,4.5,3.0,I left all classes in a better mood than I came in...and every lecture was a joy to hear. This class made my semester. He is hillarious and expect his quotes and inspirational love of literature to stick with you for a long time to come!
4763,2741,5.0,4.0,He was the most engaging lecturer I had at UVA. Truly a pleasure to come to class. He joint taught a session with his wife once that brought my tears to my eyes. He was the speaker when I graduated and I couldn't have asked for more inspiring words and realism. His love for literature is contagious.
4764,2741,5.0,3.0,"Simply put, Michael Levenson is the greatest professor I have ever had. I've taken multiple classes with him & he is my advisor--not only is he the best lecturer on the face of the earth, he is an incredibly engaging and compassionate human being."
4765,2741,5.0,3.0,It's a joy to watch this man's mind work.
4766,2741,4.0,3.0,"Levenson is a treasure, simply put. He's like Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society. This class made me proud to be an English major. I looked forward to his lectures and felt like I was missing out on something if ever I couldn't make one."
4767,2741,5.0,3.0,"Michael Levenson is the greatest lecturer of all time.  Absolutely brilliant, friendly, engaging, funny, etc. (I could go on forever...!)."
4768,2741,5.0,3.0,FANTASTIC LECTURER! he gives me even more of a passion for literature than i had before.
4769,2741,5.0,1.0,"Again, his daughter- Sarah is amazing. His son, Alex, is also real kool-- he goes to Harvard. Ahh how I miss this family. Very kool people!!!"

4774,2741,4.5,4.0,simply awesome!
4775,2741,5.0,2.0,amazing (and do to summer London program as well!!!!)
4776,2741,5.0,2.0,"So cute!!! Great professor--engaging, fun, and to top all that off --BRILLIANT :)"
4777,2741,5.0,4.0,"THIS MAN IS ADORABLE.  And somehow, he's also an amazing lecturer."
4778,2741,5.0,3.0,best lecturer and a very nice professor
4779,2741,5.0,1.0,"Great professor. engaging, informative."
4780,2741,5.0,3.0,one of my all-time favs!  take him!!!
4781,2741,5.0,3.0,"Brilliant, yet approachable. A real advocate for grad students."
4782,2741,5.0,3.0,warning: you probably can't make it through a complete hour with Levenson without wanting to get up and hug him

4787,2745,1.0,3.0,"I have never had a more hateful professor before. He basically does your project for you and gets mad if you don't read his mind and do everything his way. Constantly hypocritical. I had a mental breakdown and was ready to quit a lifelong dream in one week of knowing him. He has an interesting way of talking and knows his stuff, but was very rude"
4788,2745,5.0,3.0,"The most insightful and completely kind professor I have ever had. Waldman will encourage you to think in connections and collages, unlike any sort of linear class. He values improvement is over perfection and is always available in his office. An absolutely genius person who sees the best every living thing. "
4789,2745,4.0,1.0,"Very wise and inspirational. It is obvious that you are speaking to someone who interprets the world through the lens of an artist. The only assignment was biweekly letters, which you had full control over and prompts were intentionally left open-ended."
4790,2745,1.0,4.0,"No matter how hard I tried, I could not for the life of me understand anything he was saying. His lectures left me perpetually confused. The weekly essays are the majority of the grade, so put your efforts into those, even though the prompts are incomprehensible."
4791,2745,4.0,3.0,"Waldman is confusing at first, because he uses his own language, but he does provide a glossary. I did not understand ARCH 1010 until having a studio with him. I loved him as a studio professor and I love him as a person. All his classes are interesting, and I love talking with him, inside and outside of class."
4792,2745,5.0,3.0,"Waldman is on another level. It takes a while to get used to his language and to stay attentive in class. At first, the class is confusing and difficult but trust the process. Hang on and the class starts to make sense. Waldman is a genius."
4793,2745,4.0,3.0,Amazing Professor!
4794,2745,2.5,2.0,"He is one of the smartest, most genuine professorsteachers I've had, though his lectures and assignments can be baffling they do push you to learn about yourself and your environment in new ways. "
4795,2745,2.0,5.0,This class is absolutely awful. Do not ever take it it unless you have to! I REPETE DO NOT EVER TAKE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO!!!! 
4796,2745,4.0,2.0,"Great professor.If you are unsure whether you want to pursue the Architecture major or not, this class may not be for you.Peter compares architecture to paintings and nature and creates genius connections between them.Only those that try to think deeply on his level will understand him.Others that dont try will just think that the class is  useless"
4797,2745,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE LESSONS OF THE LAWN UNLESS YOU HAVE TO FOR ARCHITECTURE. I missed nothing skipping his class and when I did go, he put me to sleep within 5 minutes. He is semi-comprehensible when speaking about buildings, but 3/4 of the time he tries to relate them to entirely unrelated things. A 3-8 pg paper a week. Teaches you to BS like a pro."
4798,2745,4.0,4.0,"Are these UVa kids rating Peter, or maybe Tech transfers? This class is not for E School or Comm School numbnuts, frat boys, or PreMed type a freakshows. This class lays it down for those entering the creative field of architecture. That means it is ambiguous and difficult and self-directed. No motivation and interest = you will struggle, and do poorly. Don't be fooled by the 101 tag - if you want easy see Anthropology 101, with the jocks and rugby folks. Peter seeks to inspire"

4801,2745,1.5,4.0,"The ratings make him look bad. If you really want to explore the mind of an architect, take this class and get ready to write BS papers once a week. So glad i took it."
4802,2745,3.0,4.0,"The man teaches class with his eyes closed half the time but he is a genius. He's out there but you got to respect everything he says, and the TAs are helpful and are the ones grading your weekly papers. I got an A so it's not impossible."
4803,2745,3.5,4.0,"Well,this guy is indeed controversial.But I would say he is a GENIUS!BEST professor I have ever had.In the first few weeks I didn't know what was going on with the class.He seemed to talk nonsense all the time and enjoyed himself.Thanks to my awesome TAs,I survived.Anyway, the stuff he taught you is extremely useful in you career as an architect"
4804,2745,5.0,4.0,"This guy is a genius!! He is absolutely dedicated to architecture, and everything about it. He teaches with passion and desire, and and wonder. He will make you think, draw, and build in the most wonderful of ways. a true educator in the largest sense of the word. Outstanding."
4805,2745,4.0,5.0,"This is not the guy to take if you just want to spit back what is needed to pass. He'll pull your brain out, massage it, and then it's up to you to       put it back in. Folks, isn't this the time to expand your view of this world&#63; Go with an open mind and you'll have memories and concepts for a lifetime. I did."
4806,2745,4.5,4.0,I loved all of his lectures eventhough at times they made no sense at all.  The only thing bad about the class was the weekly papers.
4807,2745,1.0,4.0,Waldman is absolutely insane. At times this can be fun and at times it can be infuriating. DO NOT take this class unless you are required to. If you are required then make sure to get good TA's becaue they do all the grading and they can translate Waldman's babbles for you.
4808,2745,1.0,5.0,"This class is useless. If you're not in the A-School or plan on transferring, don't torture yourself by taking ARCH 101 with Waldman. This class is terrible and I hope I don't ever have a class with this idiosyncratic man ever again."
4809,2745,1.0,5.0,Waldman is incomprehensible and his class is the worst. Most of the TA's are excessively anal about grades and their are no exact set of rules to follow or adhere to when writing papers. This class was completely useless and did not increase my interest for architecture. It's a necessary evil to complete the Architecture major.
4810,2745,2.0,3.0,"Waldman is the craziest teacher I have ever had. He babbles on about nothing and has a knack for putting people to sleep. Basically, he talks a lot, but he generally never says anything. In other words, he just talks about much of nothing. It's all about the TAs for this class. Do what they want and you can get a good grade."
4811,2745,3.0,3.0,"Waldman is an interesting professor to say the least.  However, getting a good (set of) TA(s) is crucial--since they do the majority of the grading.  The concepts and ideas that Waldman presents are generally off the wall and seem outrageous.  But later in your ARCH career, you'll be thankful."
4812,2745,2.5,4.0,"The lectures are boring most of the time. But when the topic is interesting, he is a great speaker. Getting a fun/fair TA is crucial. The assignments are hard to understand but the answers are all on that sheet of paper. Having taken the class, I am a much better writer."
4813,2745,2.5,5.0,"At times you will be convinced that Waldman was on something when he wrote the assignments.  USE YOUR TA!  If you have a good TA and you use them to your advantage, then it is possible to get a good grade in the class.  Otherwise you're screwed, unless you magically understand Waldman's (certainly deep) psycho babble."
4814,2745,4.0,3.0,"I love this man! He is a genius and I find the humor in him. He is very random, but that is what makes the class so great! The weekly essays are annoying, but extremly helpful. I love Professor Waldman and this class."
4815,2745,3.0,2.0,"It's been a few years since I took the class...however, when I took the class...I had no clue what was going on!  He would talk about Ken and Barbie...opera and swimming pools...interesting class...  But looking back I realize how helpful the class was to understanding the diagrams you have to produce later in architecture...and it's also and rite"
4816,2745,3.0,1.0,"They guy is definately out there, but give him a chance.  Go talk to him in office hours, you will take on an entirely new perspective on his teachings.  Also, do not miss the trip to his home.  It is amazing, this also give you an entirely new outlook on him."
4817,2745,2.0,4.0,"This class was way out there and pretty boring, and the weekly paper could easily be written without attending all of the lectures.  Expectations for papers completely depended on what the TA wanted."
4818,2745,3.5,2.0,"you might find his 101 lectures boring, but you won't realize until later how much the basic writing and diagramming techniques he teaches are useful. don't take it if you aren't interested in architecture.  as a professor, he's much better as a studio critic, where his seemingly non-coherent ramblings actually inspire your design."
4819,2745,1.5,2.0,"Completely discourages all interest in architecture.  Although with only one paper for the class due weekly, it requires little outside work and often this paper can be done without attending lecture, so little time at all."
4820,2745,2.5,3.0,"The guy is very eccentric, and the first few weeks even maybe the first couple months you will be wondering what is going on and whether you should withdraw and go pass/fail, but in the end you can still do fine you just have to step outside your comfort zone, realize most people are sleeping during lecture, and find awesome TAs."
4821,2745,3.0,3.0,"i had no idea what was going on for the first few weeks until i realized that the point is to be as random and out there as possible.. just like waldman. he even teaches with his eyes closed. learn to think outside the box, get a good TA, and you will do fine"
4822,2745,2.0,4.0,"Everything depends on your TA. The class itself is strange, the professor is strange, and the lectures are boring.  If you can successfully BS your way through this class you'll come out alrite."
4823,2745,3.5,3.0,"As much as I hated this class and the paper due every week, once you realize you can make any building seem meaningful if you bs enough (which is all lecture seems to be) its a lot more fun!"
4824,2745,1.5,3.0,"Ugh. By far my biggest headache of the semester. Waldman is either absolutely insane, or a genius. He usually leans toward insane. The material is interesting, but basically you just have to pray for a good TA."
4825,2745,1.0,4.0,Waldman's class is very time consuming. Your grade doesn't really vary with how much effort you put into it the work. You will probably get a B. His lectures are crazy and there is no point in going because he rambles on the whole time with his own thoughts. This class is not worth the time if you don't plan on majoring in architecture.
4826,2745,1.5,4.0,"The class starts out hellishly, but calms down once you realize grades are often unrelated to the amount of effort you put into the paper (varies with TAs). The lectures make no sense whatsoever, and the TAs have no clue what's going on. Not easy, not fun. This class is supposed to weed out the men from the boys."
4827,2745,5.0,4.0,"I took this class as an elective and it because of Waldman's enthusiasm, I transferred into the A-school. He is encouraging, helpful, and downright crazy. I love the man."
4828,2745,2.5,4.0,"In the very beginning he was interesting, then he became just weird, but now that the class is over I definately love him."
4829,2745,3.0,4.0,"i really loved this class once i realized that the assignments are more like guidelines... you can really do whatever you want, provided your TAs appreciate creativity. at first i thought the lectures were awful, but i grew to appreciate them once i started paying attention and sketching during them"
4830,2745,2.0,3.0,"This guy is crazy and impossible to understand.  He teaches with his eyes closed.  A good tip: show up to class 30 mins late - that's when he actually starts teaching.  The actual material is pretty interesting, but i wouldn't reocmmend taking it unless you have to."
4831,2745,2.5,2.0,Bring your pillow to class. It'll help
4832,2745,2.5,4.0,The class takes time to grow on you.
4833,2745,3.5,2.0,Amazing. You have to be open minded and somewhat creative to appreciate him and you have to give him a chance. The assignments DON'T get boring because you aren't limited to how you can do them. It's up to you to take that extra step. His ambiguity is what makes this even better. Good ta's help.
4834,2745,3.0,3.0,"As much as I complained about this class 1st year, Waldman's an amazing professor who genuinely takes interest in his students. Anyone who says the workload is cumbersome must be a first year or outside the A-school-it's really nothing once you reach second year. Critical thinking is a must."
4835,2745,4.5,3.0,"This is guy is the man, he may ramble, and he may lecture with his eyes closed, but he's awesome. He subtley allows for you to let go and embrace your intuitions. His assignment maybe rather difficult and the work load tough but it is an experience I have not regreted."
4836,2745,2.0,4.0,"Yeah, yeah, they say the man's a genius...whatever. Let me quote him when I say &quot;I had never seen liver above my head before.&quot; What does that MEAN!&#63; Well, if you like having your lifelong ambitions being shot down in a cloud of ambiguity, then this is the class for you. (Peter Waldman=Bilbo Baggins)"
4837,2745,5.0,3.0,"You have to be a little crazy to like this class, but the man is a genius"
4838,2745,4.5,3.0,I enjoyed the class.
4839,2745,2.0,4.0,don't take this class unless you have to or if you're insane.  waldman is really ambiguous about what he wants in your work and the assignments are really confusing--but i hear that it is really helpful in the long run (for a-schoolers especially)
4840,2745,2.5,3.0,It takes quite a long time to understand exactly what he is talking about.  The projects are very repetative and become quite boring by the end of the year.
4841,2745,3.5,2.0,"This is a very unique course, although very rigorous!"
4842,2745,2.5,4.0,"this guy is crazy but by the end of the class you will actually appreciate his insanity- i wouldn't recommend this class to those not required to take it, it is not a class to take &quot;just for fun&quot;"

4845,2745,4.0,2.0,"Peter Waldman is spazzy, odd, adorable.  His class is invaluable to seeing arch as more than just drawings and buildings. He connects architecture to real life (literature, philosophy, culture,art and dreams). You will learn about yourself. He is amazing!"
4846,2745,1.0,3.0,This guy's class is worthless.

4849,2746,2.0,4.0,"I skipped most lectures, never did any of the readings, but memorized the monument list and still passed. Reilly's lectures lacked any enthusiasm and my TA for discussion was okay at best, but I did not put much effort into this course either. Definitely not a course I would recommend for people who are not passionate about the subject."
4850,2746,3.0,3.0,The most important thing is that you show up to lecture. Pretty much all of the material you need to know for the exams will be covered during the lectures. The readings are pretty much optional. There is also a final paper and weekly reading &quot;quizzes.&quot; It does not matter what you score on the quizzes because you get full credit for just doing it.
4851,2746,5.0,4.0,"Lectures are intriguing and Professor Reilly clearly has so much passion for the subject. Section counts as a huge part of the grade so pray for a good TA, but Professor Reilly is nothing but great. She can be sarcastic from time to time, though when I visited her office hours she was really sweet."
4852,2746,2.0,4.0,"Professor Reilly can tend to be passive aggressive towards students when asked questions. Lectures also are very boring, she reads from a script which make the lectures non engaging. Having a good TA is key for this class as everything is essay based. Be sure to attend sections as those are a huge part of your grade."
4853,2746,2.5,2.0,"Lectures are boring and you could learn more from the textbook, but go because there are random in class turned in assignments to make sure you attend. Tests are pure memorization and are easy if you study/have good notes/ or read the textbook. She's not super approachable, and class could be so much more interesting than she makes it, but its ok"
4854,2746,3.0,4.0,"Not approachable, can be sarcastic and a bit rude. Be careful of falling asleep or asking a stupid question. Lectures are interesting and instructions are clear, do not ask stupid questions. Tests are tough but TA grades them, find one that you like and get to know their grading style. Impromptu in-class check-ins, go to class and section."
4855,2746,4.5,2.0,She is clear in what she wants you to know and some might say she has a dark sense of humor.
4856,2746,4.5,2.0,"Very good professor, great lecturer. As long as you attend class and memorize your class notes, you should should do fine."
4857,2746,4.0,4.0,"Was in no way as interesting as i expected. bring coffee to class, as lectures are not terrible but verge on boring. attendence a must. tests are extremely difficult, all essey. several times when i basically got the answer right she would put no comments and then just randomly give a B or C+. write as much as you can on each question. tough grader"
4858,2746,1.5,4.0,I attended her course carefully. But I still can't figure out what the point was... bleah
4859,2746,3.5,3.0,She's super boring and makes you do useless in class group discussions that are a waste of time.  Fill your Medieval requirement some other way.
4860,2746,5.0,2.0,Great teaching style. Very interested in student's learning and understanding of material.
4861,2746,5.0,3.0,Professor Reilly makes this one of my favorite classes ever. She is extremely approachable to ask any questions and is very encouraging to all of her students. I haven't missed a class yet and can't see myself missing a class just because she makes her lectures so enjoyable! She does her job well!

4864,2747,1.0,5.0,"I thought this class was going to be informative and fun- please don't take this unless you are planning on majoring in psychology!! It was useless and a massive GPA tanker. I am in the engineering school and taking very difficult classes, yet this was my lowest grade. Emery was no help, and the fact that your entire grade was only 4 tests was crap"
4865,2747,4.5,4.0,Professor Emery is engaging and approachable and makes you care about the material through interesting vignettes from his clinical practice. You do have to be interested in children to care about this class though: it's not an easy A and you won't do well if you skip class. Tests have essay questions but don't get discouraged! It's a fun class! :)
4866,2747,5.0,3.0,"Easily one of my favorite courses. The tests aren't too difficult if you attend lecture and pay attention. I can't say enough glowing things about Emery.  He's a brilliant professor, and his lectures are absolutely fascinating."
4867,2747,3.0,2.0,He makes the class much more boring then necessary. Textbook is exactly like the lecture but has just enough information that you also have to read it. The class is structured around DSM-5 rather than around the actual disorders. Wouldn't suggest it.
4868,2747,5.0,3.0,"Can be a hard class if you don't know how to study so don't take it as light workload....its pretty hard..EMERY is awesome tho, by far best professor at UVA!!!! also really interesting lectures"
4869,2747,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting lecturer, and genuinely cares about his students. Super interesting subject material, but lots of long journals to read."
4870,2747,5.0,1.0,He is a great professor. His anecdotes were fascinating and a his description of his cases were amazing. I was disapointed when I had to miss a class because I really enjoyed lectures. This is saying a lot considering it was at 9:30 in the morning. Take the class. You won't be disapointed!
4871,2747,5.0,1.0,He's a caring and enthusiastic professor who thinks of his students as his children. He also offers to be of assistance for any non-acedemic problems you may have.
4872,2747,3.0,3.0,First time he was taught this class although he WROTE the book.  Lectures were not engaging.
4873,2747,4.0,4.0,His lectures were just so interesting
4874,2747,5.0,3.0,Fun lectures.
4875,2747,4.0,1.0,"I got an A+ in this class, the best grade I've ever gotten in college.  This was also the only class I have ever truly not attended.  The few times I did go, I really enjoyed his lectures and thought he was very interesting.  The extra credit is easy and helps a ton!"
4876,2747,3.5,2.0,"He is a little backwards. Not open to new interpretations. Often found offense in his lectures (as a female), and found lectures to be dry and slow. He thinks he's funny. He's a little too sure of himself, could use a little humility. He obviously doesn't have all of the answers (though he thinks he does)."
4877,2747,4.0,1.0,lectures are a joke & BORING! went to the first 3 lectures & stopped. he elaborates too much on some topics & not enough on others. i got an A reading the bold words of the book & the ch summaries. exams &#63;s straight from the book. final is easy. all exams weighted the same. extra credit.
4878,2747,3.5,2.0,"Interesting lectures, easy tests, extra credit - if you're taking Psych 101, take it with Emery.  Your GPA will thank you."
4879,2747,3.5,3.0,"lectures are interesting and useful for the test. if you have time to read, you'll do well. fun projects for extra credit, but otherwise no papers to write or anthing like that. final is worth the same as other tests."
4880,2747,4.0,1.0,"Easy A (maybe A+ if you do the extra credit). Everything you need to know is in the book or slides, lectures were a waste of my time! He's an OKAY professor...don't think he really prepares before class though because sometimes he doesn't even know what's on his slides."
4881,2747,4.5,3.0,His personal stories made the subject matter come alive.  Really cool guy :)
4882,2747,5.0,2.0,"great lecturere, interesting class"
4883,2747,4.0,2.0,"great professor, very entertaining class."

4887,2747,5.0,1.0,he's great!!!
4888,2747,5.0,1.0,"One of my favorite classes, by a really entertaining teacher."
4889,2750,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class. Childress is extremely knowledgeable is his field and is one of the nicest professors I've had. I thought the material was interesting and provided a lot of useful perspectives on relevant problems. There was a lot of reading and the lectures weren't the most engaging, but I would overall strongly recommend this class. "
4890,2750,2.5,3.0,"Childress's lectures are SO boring that it's almost impossible to pay attention for the whole lecture. There is a ridiculous amount of reading (used for discussion-which is even worse than the lecture). He's a nice enough guy, gives useful study guides for the midterm and final, and there are only three 2-page papers, BUT I would not recommend him."
4891,2750,3.5,3.0,Childress is a legend in his field. The class is interesting and is worth the work. Lectures help but aren't always the best. Movies every Friday!
4892,2750,5.0,2.0,I would highly recommend you take a class with Childress.  His course was by far my favorite.  We had lecture twice a week and videos on Fridays.  Discussion once a week is mandatory and participation is essential.  Assigned readings can be extensive.  A study guide is provided with all you need to know.  Must memorize authors' names and opinions.
4893,2750,3.5,2.0,"This is a pretty interesting class and I highly recommend that everyone at UVA should take it.  Do the readings, as they are crucial to your success in the class!  There are only 3 2-age essays (which you get to pick), a midterm, and a final (which have study guides!) Do the study guides and memorize them for the exams, and you'll be in good shape!"
4894,2750,2.5,3.0,"This class should have been easy and fun. While the material was interesting, the tests were more difficult than they needed to be. Instead of quizzing students on understanding concepts, memorization of author's opinions was focused on. Only take this class if you'll have a lot of time to memorize unnecessary material."
4895,2750,4.5,3.0,"Childress is a genius, and while his lecturing style isn't very engaging the content is really cool. Never had lecture on Fridays, sometimes a movie. I loved this class--really makes you think about things. Also, discussion sections are very important and also really interesting; all the TAs were good my semester (and all were attractive men)."
4896,2750,2.5,4.0,Class gets very boring after the midterm. Discussion attendance is necessary if you want to be able to write good essays. I would not take this class again just because Childress's lectures are sometimes excruciating to sit through because of the boredom
4897,2750,5.0,2.0,"I had Childress for the class Theology, Ethics, and Health Care. He basically wrote the textbook and has been in the field for over 40 years, so he is extremely knowledgable. His lectures are very helpful and he explains things very well. However, his voice puts a lot of people to sleep. Definitely recommended, though."
4898,2750,4.5,2.0,"Really interesting topics and discussions that will inspire you to continue the discussions out of class, primarily because of the interdisciplinary nature of the class  Childress is very approachable and the TAs seem to be interested in the subject as well!  Not difficult to get a good grade if you do the reading and study."
4899,2750,2.0,5.0,The instructor took this class too seriously. It should have been interesting and easy. It was hard and boring.
4900,2750,2.0,4.0,The instructor was not interesting and the class was way to difficult for the subject matter.
4901,2750,3.0,3.0,"It is clear that Professor Childress is highly respected and an expert in the field of bioethics (he even wrote the textbook we used!) Although he is passionate about the subject, I found it very hard to pay attention during lectures. However, I enjoyed most of the readings (although sometimes a heavy load) as well as the outside events."
4902,2750,3.5,3.0,"Although everyone raved about this class I was disappointed.  I found the material dry and the ethics aspect rather self-explanatory.  Class was dull, and the reading very time consuming.  On top of that, the TAs graded harshly and more on arbitrary grammatical errors than content."
4903,2750,4.5,3.0,"While I absolutely loved the discussion portion of this class I got easily bored during Lecture. If you are reall good at keeping yourself motivated then this would be an awesome class, the information covered is very interesting. He does his best to help students though an is a very pleasant man to talk to. attending lecture is PERTINENT!!!!!!!!"
4904,2750,4.0,3.0,"While I absolutely loved the discussion portion of this class I got easily bored during Lecture.

4905,2750,4.5,3.0,Awesome course. within first day i knew i wanted to minor in bioethics. he is so passionate about the subject. awesome!
4906,2750,5.0,2.0,Prof. Childress is great! His class was so interesting.... You'll learn a lot... TAKE IT
4907,2750,4.5,4.0,absolutely amazing class. I would recommend it to all nursing and pre-med students...or anyone with an interest in ethics in medicine! childress is very knowledgeable and gives interesting lectures
4908,2750,4.0,3.0,Professor Childress is so knowlegable and truly passionate about the subject of Bioethics.  If you feel that it is something you are even slightly interested in then you should definitely take the class.  There is a lot of reading and lectures can at times get a little long but the topics are really thought provoking.
4909,2750,5.0,3.0,"BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT UVA! Childress is well renown in the field of bioethics so he knows what he is talking about. He is an overall great guy, great lecturer, and has sense of humor. Lots of reading, great discussion, and includes midterm, final, and 3 short discussion papers.  It's a class that actual makes you think. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
4910,2750,4.5,2.0,"prof. childress is one of the leading figures in bioethics. it's an interesting class and it isn't hard (he gives you study guides) but there is a lot of reading. a midterm, a final, and section (including 3 short papers). i definitely recommend the class no matter what your major- it's interesting and gets you thinking."
4911,2750,3.5,5.0,all pre-med and nursing students should be required to take Relg 265.  It's tough - a lot of reading - but it's an amazing class and childress is a great prof!
4912,2750,4.0,2.0,"This class is pretty interesting materialwise.  Towards the end of the class Childress's lectures got pretty boring, and since the test is mostly on the contents of the articles, the lectures weren't too helpful.  If you studied the articles a lot you would do fine on the midterms, which cover al ot of material.  He cancels class sometimes :-)"
4913,2750,3.5,2.0,"Fairly easy class, sometimes repetitive reading.  But if you do the reading and pay attention in discussion you will do fine.  Howard is by far the best TA!  Highly recommend this class, if you do the work easy A, even if you just read the articles you will do fine.  Can be boring, but not too time consuming.  Childresss talks insanely fast!"
4914,2750,3.5,3.0,"AWESOME CLASS.  Lots of reading, but do all of it - it's worth it.  I rarely went to lecture, but discussions were the highlight of my week.  Probably my favorite class I've ever taken.  As for Childress, he's a fine lecturer and goes off notes included in the text.  Kind of hard to get hold of, though - consult your TA for extra help."
4915,2750,4.0,3.0,"The class was very interesting.  There were lots of assigned readings and they were usually very interesting.  He is a decent lecturer, but sometimes his monotonous voice would disrupt our learning. Great topics chosen, great discussions (Karen and Howard are the best!), and overall a great class.  Take this if you are premed or not!"
4916,2750,5.0,4.0,This has been my favorite class at UVa so far; it's not the easiest (lots of outside reading and lots of information to learn) but it is so interesting. I love Prof Childress!
4917,2750,4.5,3.0,"Childress was an awesome professor! His class was a ton of reading and covered some difficult concepts, but he did his best to make it easy."
4918,2750,2.0,4.0,this class was not as good as I was expecting it to be.  It was hard to take notes and discussions were a complete waste of time.
4919,2750,4.5,3.0,Childress is an engaging and thoughtful professor.  He gives study guides to the tests which make them easy.  There is little work besides reading.  He can talk to both the science half of the class and the humanities.
4920,2750,2.5,3.0,"Not bad professor, but just talks and does not interact much with students seems to be telling instead of teaching"
4921,2750,5.0,3.0,This class and prof. are AWESOME!
4922,2750,4.0,3.0,"Best Class I've ever taken! Lectures are very hard to take notes from because he talks so fast. Just do ALL readings!Discussion sections really helped alot, so get a good TA. Exams cover insane amounts of material, but they are on such interesting material that its worth it. Movies every friday that are sometimes disturbing but always informative!"
4923,2750,1.0,5.0,The case studies are awesome
4924,2750,5.0,2.0,"He's a little boring, but he's very clear cut, providing a lecture outline to follow for every class which he follows very closely. Reading is very heavy, but interesting. If Jason Danner is a TA, get him. He's funny, smart, and gives you HIS personal reading notes for the final (EXTREMELY HELPFUL)."
4925,2750,1.5,5.0,"I was very interested in the class before signing up, and at first, it was interesting. But, the review sheets for the exams flat out LIE on what you need to know, and the TAs grade hard. Expectations for the 3 papers are ridiculous for 2 pages each."
4926,2750,4.0,3.0,"Professor Childress is very, very knowledgable about this subject, which is obvious. He literally wrote the book. He is well-known nationally in the field of bioethics. Class is interesting, the material even more so, and the two exams and 3 short papers are easy. Reading load is relatively heavy."
4927,2750,2.5,3.0,Lectures are boring and not very helpful.  His opinion is relatively clear and he bashes all the other opinions.  The assigned readings are long and repetetive.  Lectures consist of rhetorical questions which lead nowhere.
4928,2750,5.0,2.0,"Great lecturer, he really knows his stuff.  He TA'd one of the discussion groups, which was amazing!"
4929,2750,4.5,2.0,"his lectures are generally interesting, but can get a bit boring at times. very well organized and knows his stuff. this class requires you to think for yourself. excellent."
4930,2750,3.5,3.0,I enjoyed the lectures very much. The book by Childress himself is clear and understandable. I did not like my TA and he did not like me. This caused trouble. Make sure you get a good TA! I would have had a better grade.
4931,2750,4.5,4.0,"Common course co-taught w/MJ Smith. Definitely an expert and very organized/helpful outlines, but pretty boring. The class should be listed as political theory NOT int'l. relations."
4932,2750,3.5,4.0,"Co-taught with Smith (who gives poor lectures.) Childress knows his stuff, pretty good professor."
4933,2750,3.0,2.0,"He knows a lot, but he makes me want to drop out of school, i fall asleep in every class, and that's not normally my style."
4934,2750,4.5,3.0,TAKE THIS CLASS! makes you think.  childress is great lecturer...a little all over the place...but very prepared and insightful.  he wrote the textbook!
4935,2750,4.0,3.0,"not a particularly bad prof, but can get quite boring at times. however, movies on fridays and interesting subject material (cloning, etc.) in addition to having a great TA can more than make up for the occasionally boring lectures."
4936,2750,5.0,4.0,"Great class... a lot of readinng, but well worth it!"
4937,2750,4.5,2.0,"great class! a lot of reading, but watch captivating movies on fridays that offer a  platform for discussion. Childress is pretty good, material is a bit dry at times, but good overall."
4938,2750,4.5,2.0,"He makes an interesting subject even more so.  I found that, despite his reputation, he was a very approachable professor, provided you've done your part."
4939,2750,5.0,3.0,GREAT PROF! take this course!
4940,2750,3.5,2.0,"Good lecturer, but not very interested in students"
4941,2750,1.5,3.0,he co-taught with MJ Smith; didnt like Childress at all
4942,2750,4.5,2.0,No Comments
4943,2750,5.0,2.0,Childress is an awesome speaker and gives great lectures.
4944,2752,5.0,2.0,"I took this class knowing nothing about Greek history, and am now totally hooked! It should be a literature class, in my opinion, but still amazing. LOTS of reading, but you don't need to do it all so long as you show up to lecture and take good notes. He will always tell you everything you need to know!! Overall, great &amp; entertaining"
4945,2752,5.0,4.0,"Professor Dillery highly values attendance and participation (i.e. skipping is a BAD idea in his class). However, for the effort I have put into his class, he has put in exponentially more to make the course material come to life. He is highly respected, immensely knowledgeable, and I am going into my third semester taking a class with him."
4946,2752,3.5,4.0,"Dillery is extremely passionate and knowledgeable, but this can lead to him teaching the information at a level beyond what a 2000 level course should be. Two exams, two essays, and a lot of reading inbetween. You'll do best if you have a real interest in Greek literature, which is all this class is. That being said, if you are interested it's fun."
4947,2752,4.0,3.0,Great professor! Very knowledgeable about the subject and is very straightforward in lecture (almost always got out about 10 minutes early). Lot's of reading but he goes over the important passages in class. Good class for a literature credit or to learn interesting things about the ancient Greek world
4948,2752,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor. He's very passionate about it and his explanations are great. There's a lot of reading (but it's a clas course), but most of it is really interesting. One major thing that stands out is that when the TA was sick he did the discussion sections himself, which i've never had that happen before. Love it and had no interest before."
4949,2752,4.0,2.0,"very good teacher, he likes his subject and makes it interesting. A LOT of reading!! 90 pages  to read the day before the exam (that will be on the exam). write down all the quotes he reads in class ( you will have to know them for the exam)."
4950,2752,4.5,3.0,great class and professor. try to get into his discussion! because everything he puts on the exams are from lecture/discussion. reading is extensive but not necessary as long as you take good notes and pay attention. the material can get a bit boring but hes pretty enthusiastic which helps. only grades are 2 papers and 2 exams
4951,2752,3.5,4.0,"Initially I liked Dillery b/c he was so enthusiastic and really interested in helping me at office hours.  My test and paper grades don't reflect this though.  I never really found what he was exactly looking for in papers.  The tests were beasts and the IDs could be random and unpredictable.  A LOT of reading, skip The Histories."
4952,2752,3.5,3.0,"Dillery is a great lecturer, really enthusiastic. the readings may be long sometimes, but as you get used to greek literature more the readings get more interesting. great class, really recommend it"
4953,2752,3.0,3.0,No Comments
4954,2752,4.0,4.0,"This class should be called Greek Literature, not Greek Civilization.  If you are going to take it, be prepared to do a lot of reading.  However, Dillery is extremely enthusiastic and makes a lot of interesting points.  Go to class, get the handouts, and pay attention to every passage he remarks on, because the tests are all passage identification."
4955,2752,5.0,3.0,"energetic professor, willing to look over drafts for papers, very helpful"
4956,2752,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed this class!  I wasn't interested in Greek Civ at all before but he is so excited about it and made me excited about it too.  There is a LOT of reading but if you go to class and take notes, you don't have to do all of it.  The TA is super-sweet and energetic too and grades pretty nicely.  Overall, lots of reading but GREAT!!!"
4957,2752,5.0,3.0,"could have cared less about greek civ b4, and i still dont, but he did a good job at making it interesting.  to do well, underline every quote he reads from the books and know them for the tests.  go to lecture to get the handouts, they make life much easier.  for the discussion, make sure you get him and not some TA. lotta tedious reading though"
4958,2752,5.0,2.0,"He's so incredibly passionate about the class - it's impossible to fall asleep. BUT in all seriousness, a wonderful professor! Lots of reading but he makes it interesting!"
4959,2752,5.0,3.0,"This class was amazing!  I went into it not interested in greek history or mythology at all, but Dillery made me want to know more.  He taught my discussion section himself, which really helped.  He took a vasted interest in my grades and made sure I was on the right track.  Overall, he's a GREAT PROF!!"
4960,2752,5.0,2.0,he is an amazing teacher..really helps A LOT..i recommend this class to everyone..a lot of reading..but it's very rewarding to study the classics..going to class and taking notes helps more than the readings themselves..also highlite any quotes he goes over in class(they will beo n the test)
4961,2752,4.0,3.0,"more difficult than a 200 level class should be, but if you attend lecture and pay attention, it really isn't as difficult as everyone makes it out to be. subject matter can be boring, even though dillery is very enthusiastic."
4962,2752,3.0,4.0,"Very enthusiasic professor but assigned much much much more reading than I expected for a 200-level class; the tests tend to have rather obscure characters so it's not even an option to surface-read the assignments, it's an exhausting course."
4963,2752,2.0,5.0,This guy thinks that he's teaching something like CLAS 401 instead of CLAS 201.  I heard great things about him going in but instead got to experience 250+ pgs of mind-numbingly boring reading per week along with a challenging paper due five days before his final exam.  Would def. NOT recommend.
4964,2752,2.5,5.0,COD didnt reflect what his course was about...lots and lots of reading...goofy yet intertaining
4965,2752,4.0,3.0,"He is extremely well-versed in Greek lit and seems to enjoy espousing on it, but he assigns too much of it to read in a 200-level class.  Going to lecture and discussion is absoultely key."
4966,2752,3.0,4.0,"Dillery enjoys a zeal for classics, which is greatly appreciated on my part.  However, he seems to specialize more in Greek than Latin, making his translation discussions somewhat convoluted.  He assigns above average amounts of reading for a 300-level class, which can lead to difficulty on exams."
4967,2752,4.0,2.0,"The classes are interesting and easy, if you go to lecture, he goes over all the readings in class, so you dont really have to do the readings."
4968,2752,5.0,4.0,HE's great!!! Best professor i've had so far...he's so enthusiastic about what he lectures...it makes class sooo interesting.  Try to get into his lectures.
4969,2752,5.0,4.0,he's a huge geek. but lovable.
4970,2752,5.0,4.0,"Quirky, but VERY excited about the topic, so he's very interesting.  Always ends class early.  Hard, in-depth tests.  Interesting material."
4971,2752,4.0,3.0,"Quirky, but interesting even early in the morning."
4972,2752,4.5,3.0,"Wonderful professor, really excited about Greek history, a little quirky though and tests are in depth.  But overall very nice and helpful."
4973,2752,5.0,1.0,best greek class ever
4974,2752,5.0,3.0,such an awesome teacher; very passionate; try to get into his discussion- very helpful
4975,2752,3.5,2.0,more theory than story time.... but still pretty good
4976,2752,5.0,3.0,Take any upper level Latin with Prof. Dillery.  He's great.
4977,2752,5.0,3.0,"Very sweet, want's you to suceed!"
4978,2752,5.0,2.0,"He's an awesome teacher, he's really passionate about what he teaches"
4979,2752,5.0,2.0,Best professor I have! Take anything he teaches
4980,993989,5.0,2.0,One of the top professors I've had. Subject Matter Expert and someone who inspires others. Great sense of humor and intellect. A little on the PC side but always willing to hear alternative views.
4981,993989,5.0,3.0,Awesome- very helpful and insightful. One of my favorite professors at UVA
4982,993989,5.0,4.0,No Comments
4983,273104,3.0,3.0,"Prof Krushkal is a kind guy. He is hard to understand at times though and sometimes feels like he is talking through what is in his mind as he lectures instead of teaching a group of college students. 2310 is conquerable, just do the weekly WebAssigns and hw, go to discussion, and step up on the 1 midterm and 1 final. Best of luck!"
4984,273104,4.0,3.0,"The only problem I have with him is that he is at least 3 minutes late to each lecture, which comes off as disrespectful. That being said, his lectures clearly explain the material and in-class examples reinforce it well. The grade came from weekly homework, weekly quizzes, and 3 exams. The TA who ran the discussion section was entirely unhelpful."
4985,273104,5.0,3.0,"Very, very good professor. Professor Krushkal always answers emails in a timely fashion. He clearly loves math and knows it very, very well. Goes the extra mile if you need any extra help. Highly recommended."
4986,273104,4.0,3.0,Very helpful in office hours and shows a genuine interest in students' success. He also always has a smirk on his face which makes for interesting classes.
4987,273104,4.5,4.0,"Good math teacher. Go to class, do the homework, and ask questions if you don't understand something, and there's no reason you shouldn't get an A."
4988,273104,5.0,3.0,this guy's so smart you'll practically feel the brain waves emanating from him.. and he has a funny little grin that makes it seem like he always has an inside joke with the chalkboard... slava's awesome
4989,273104,4.5,3.0,"one of the nicest profesors in the math department, aside from being a little shy he's an excellent teacher and its very clear that he wants to be as helpful as possible"
4990,273104,4.5,3.0,He rocks.
4991,273104,4.5,5.0,"Extremely nice professor.  His Russian accent is soothing somehow.  Took extra time to hold extremely helpful office hours, even answered questions in email in timely manner.  Great guy."
4992,273104,3.5,1.0,"Besides his persistant coughing and clearing of throat, he's a great teacher."
4993,273104,3.5,2.0,"He goes slowly and reviews alot. If you do the homework, and had a decent AB/I teacher you will be fine."
4994,273104,1.0,4.0,Very disorganized and unhelpful.  It is clear he does not care about teaching.
4995,273105,1.0,5.0,"If you want a robot teaching you proofs, go right ahead. Or, you can sign up for his classes, buy the book, and don't even show up. Everything he pulls is from his book anyways, no engagement once so ever with his students. Feels like he truly doesn't care to teach the material. The material is devastatingly hard, with no guidance from him. "
4996,273105,1.0,5.0,"Honestly the worse professor I've ever taken in the UVA Math Department. Lectures are boring and plain, everything is straight off the book. No excitement or interest in teaching, you can tell by him just cramming material, feels like he's TELLING to you, not teaching you. Always feels like a race against time, cramming as much material as he can."
4997,273105,4.0,4.0,"He's not so bad for a robot.  Actually, he's nt a robot, I just thought he was at first."
4998,273105,4.0,2.0,"He's lectures are very organized, that makes the review for exams easier and clearer. The exam problems all make sense if you study for the homework. He graded fairly and he's nice in the office hours. He tried hard to give the students every possible help such as hw solutions all clearly written by his hand."
4999,273105,2.5,4.0,he's a very nice person and very helpful during office hours. but the materials are hard plus his style of teaching made this class seem boring. his tests are within reasons if you study. Homework is helpful as a review for tests.
5000,273105,2.5,4.0,"he's very organized and responsible. the accent may be hard to understand. didn't like his teaching style, he talks in a monotone and keeps writing on the board without interacting with students.lectures are full of notes and boring.his tests are reasonable if you prepare for it."
5001,273105,3.5,4.0,"He's incredibly organized and his lectures look like something that could be a book. Homework tends to be on the hard side, but he's trying to prepare his grad students for the General Exam, so it's a good-for-you hard. He also really does want to help students who come talk to him."
5002,273105,2.5,5.0,I only clicked hot so you would look at his rating. I don't like him.
5003,273105,1.0,4.0,He has very interesting way of giving lectures to the board. He races time without a concern for full understandment from his students. It feels that he is intimidated by them.
5004,273105,2.0,4.0,"Abramenko is the sweetest guy ever, but expect to learn everything from the book."
5005,273105,1.5,4.0,"He speaks in a monotone, and his lectures come straight from the book.  His exams were *very* long and proof-oriented."
5006,273105,1.0,5.0,"Extremely inarticulate and dry, his lectures are muddled and uninteresting.  He has a monotonous voice and, due to a language barrier, has difficulty answering questions.  Perhaps the worst professor I have ever had."
5007,273105,5.0,3.0,"Professor Abramenko is very organized.  His homework is challenging but very useful in helping us understand, and his lectures are quite clear."
5008,559826,5.0,4.0,Most of the people who have reviewed Dr. Brewer up to this point seem to not appreciate much nuance. It could be true that Dr. Brewer isn't the best professor for beginners (although I am not sure of this) but his ability to explain and critique/analyze high level concepts is exceptional. Lots of reading. 2 papers and 1 exam.
5009,559826,4.0,3.0,Brewer knows the material extremely well.  Take this course if you want to understand ethics on a philosophical level.  What others have called 'unclear' lectures are just Brewer being painstaking in elucidating authors' dense original works. You can't translate original Kant into conversational English.  I don't know what these others wanted.
5010,559826,4.0,4.0,"I'm going to have to disagree with most of these posts. Brewer  does a fantastic job of flushing out the important arguments in the texts and is critical of them too. If you actually devote all your attention to his lectures, you will learn so much. His passion for the topic is evident."
5011,559826,2.5,5.0,"He made concepts very difficult to grasp.  I felt like his desire to be true to the material made his explanations very complex.  For example, utilitarianism is pretty easy to understand, but in describing he made me wonder if I had read the same book as he did.  He knows the material, but can't teach it to undergrads.  Esp. if they aren't majors."
5012,559826,3.0,4.0,"This class was definitely challenging, but grading is not too bad. Meetings with TA's made the papers and exam so much easier, and they really try to help the students. Basically this class isn't impossible as long as you put in effort."
5013,559826,4.5,3.0,"I like the material a lot, so if you're not into it ignore me. He assigns way too much reading but gives paper topics in advance so you can pick and choose what to do. His lectures can be hard to follow, but if you do thay will haelp you a lot on the papers."
5014,559826,2.0,2.0,"He's a good guy and obviously very well-versed in philosophy, but he can't teach it.  He simply summarizes the readings in a very complex manner without any real analysis.  THe readings are looooong and you won't get to do half of them anyway because there's simply too much."
5015,559826,2.0,3.0,"Brewer is clearly a genius and a nice guy, but he's not a good teacher.  The syallbus is too ambitious, and even with the cuts, there is still too much reading.  His lectures are pretty circuitous, and he never gets to all the topics he wants to.  Stay away unless you're very interested in political"
5016,559826,3.0,3.0,No Comments
5017,2714321,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, clearly cares very much about students actually learning, very helpful in office hours, and goes out of his way to help students."
5018,2714321,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor who clearly loves what he does. I got so much help during the office hours.
5019,584409,5.0,3.0,"Emily Blanchard is the single best lecturer I had in my whole time at U.Va.  Extremely clear and entertaining.  The material is a bit challenging, but every econ major would enjoy this class.  Econ majors interested in int'l econ, trade, or development need to take this course!"
5020,584409,4.5,4.0,She's so intelligent and knowledgable! It's just so educational to me to go to her lectures! She also makes those complicated models crystal clear. Great professor!
5021,584409,4.5,3.0,"The class is not easy to grasp but she teaches with great enthusiasm, she is also always willing to help you... Great experience..."
5022,584409,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor! This lady know her stuff and she is honestly the best Econ professor I've had at UVa and she made me like Econ again. Very clear in her explainations and she makes class a lot of fun. BUT be cautious! She is NOT easy. Her exams are hard and the material is hard as well. But overall, a worthwhile class!"
5023,584409,5.0,2.0,"Very enthusiastic, engaging lecturer.  Occassionally moved too slowly, but generally covered a wide variety of material in an accessible and entertaining manner.  Presented topics in a generally unbiased manner."
5024,379611,4.5,3.0,"Professor Haines is great- really knows his stuff. Interesting course to fulfill your History requirement. Midterm is easy- he gives a study guide. 2 small quizzes-also easy. Hardest part is the NIE research paper due at the end of semester, but that's manageable. interesting lecture & you can get away with not reading- highly recommended"
5025,379611,3.0,2.0,Good class and kept it interesting. Moves through the slides a bit fast sometimes but it's usually ok. Although ex-CIA seems ok.
5026,379611,5.0,1.0,Awesome class.  One of the best teachers at UVA.  Very easy class and requires minimal work to pull out a good grade.
5027,379611,4.5,2.0,"Awesome professor! At first it is a bit slow but the class is easy and the material is clear. He often tells background stories on the CIA that are so interesting, I definitely recommend his class."
5028,379611,4.5,3.0,"Great and enjoyable class.  Every day was interesting, but all the classes are structured the same:  straight note-taking.  Grading obviously depends on TAs, but the material was really interesting and the exams were fair."
5029,379611,3.5,2.0,I was not that interested in the class at the beginning however the class ended up being really interesting. It might seem as too much reading but more than  half is not necessary. The midterm is really easy since Professor Haines gives a study guide with all the terms and essay questions that can be in it. Take lots of notes and you'll do fine!
5030,379611,2.5,2.0,I felt he was not very clear on exactly what he expected of us.
5031,379611,4.0,2.0,"Awesome prof, great class"
5032,379611,3.0,3.0,"This was a really interesting class, esp. b/c Haines has first-hand knowledge of a lot of what we talk about, having been in the CIA for a long time. The reading is helpful, but not crucial, since he sends out a study guide with a list of terms/concepts before both tests. overall a really good class and professor."
5033,379611,4.0,2.0,"If he's teaching, take the class. He's great."
5034,379611,4.5,2.0,"Mr. Haines is a great lecturer. Although he may be somewhat biased he gives you a good overview of the American motives and viewpoints in terms of relations with Latin America. The man is smart. His lectures are organized, the reading is not too bad (you can skip much of it) and the exams are really easy if you just sit and memorize terms."
5035,379611,4.0,2.0,"This is the best class I've taken at UVA! Professor Haines is a very engaging lecturer, and the material is extremely interesting. The reading for the class is a fair amount, but it's really not necessary. While the midterm and final did require a lot of memorization, they were very fair and do-able. Take this class!"
5036,379611,3.0,3.0,"Haines can be pretty obnoxious at times, and sometimes he IS just dead wrong with some of the things he says... a ton of reading, but thats like every history class here, but most of it is unneccesary apart from your small discussion grade. Midterm and final all-and-all were pretty easy"
5037,379611,3.5,2.0,"I personally like the guy.  He obviously enjoys teaching and history, and he knows a lot (he was chief historian at the CIA before).  But he is prone to tangents and saying things that sound unlikely to be true, and the suspicious ones aren't usually.  I think he has so much in his head he confuses different stories and mixes them up."
5038,379611,3.0,2.0,amazing!  I had him for latin american history and espionage.  don't do the reading unless you interested.  Don't expect him to be that available because he has many other commitments.  my favorite classes at uva
5039,379611,5.0,2.0,"The material is not very hard, but there is a lot of reading.  And he knows what he is talking about, because he used to be the head historian at the CIA."
5040,379611,2.0,2.0,"Boring, biased and sometimes blatantly wrong."
5041,379611,4.5,3.0,"I had him for this and for Latin American Relations and he is awesome.  As long as you study for the tests, you never have to do the reading.  Just go to lecture and take good notes"
5042,379611,2.5,3.0,"Hist of espionage & intelligence.  awesome class due to the subject matter, but really hard bc the only grades are a midterm & final, so if you bomb one of those youre screwed.  they consisted of 10 ID's of people/events, 2 short answer essays & 1 comprehensive essay.  the essays were really hard"
5043,379611,4.5,2.0,"great class, one of my favorite professors at uva.  very knowledgeable.  going to lectures is the key to doing well.  15 page paper is not too bad, its interesting.  love the class, love the material, love the professor."
5044,379611,4.5,3.0,"There's alot of material, and going to lecture is key, but he makes them interesting. A little heavy on the reading, but you figure out what's really important to read. Really knowledgable, tests not too bad."
5045,379611,5.0,2.0,history of US and latin american relations. haines works for the CIA and is on loan (for quite a while) to UVA.  exams consist of identifications and essays distribtuted beforehand-this helps.  haines buys first round at biltmore post-final exam :)
5046,1567455,4.5,4.0,"This professor is absolutely there for her students. She'll lead homework sessions that will last as long as students are there to do homework. Harder the homework, the harder she works to help you not only complete but understand. If you work in this class you'll have no problem getting a good grade. "
5047,1567455,1.5,3.0,"Brandt-Pearce is very smart, and tries to be a good lecturer, but unfortunately comes across as very disorganized. "
5048,1567455,3.0,5.0,You will struggle throughout the semester. Tests are overly hard for no reason and are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the material on homework and quizzes. Pop quizzes about every other class. If possible avoid taking this professor.
5049,1567455,3.0,4.0,she tries to cover a lot of material in so less time. her home works are  tough and so are the exams. but she curves and overall grade comes out fine. but its like struggling all through the semester!
5050,2785,5.0,3.0,"One of the greatest professors at UVa. I would recommend taking any of his classes, but sadly Fall 2012 was his last semester. His substitute, Professor Schulhofer-Wohl is rather good too."
5051,2785,4.5,3.0,"He's had a very interesting life, working under the Nixon administration and others, and that gives a personal flare to some of his lectures which makes them engaging.  Clear and consistent.  He is very understanding; he'll let you reschedule an exam if you're too busy, provided you stick to the honor code."
5052,2785,5.0,4.0,"BEST PROFESSOR I've had at UVA.  He is so knowledgable and really wants you to do well-doesn't try to trick you.  Do the readings, at least skim them, and go to class.  Totally worth the effort."
5053,2785,5.0,4.0,"He-Is-A-Baller.  I love him and am going to take every class he teaches at UVA. I've already taken two. Do the readings (there are a lot, but there is always a question on the exam on a random article.)  But for the rest of the exam/material... everything is verbatim in lecture - SO GO!"
5054,2785,3.5,4.0,Good class. If you're interested in the Middle East you should definitely take it.
5055,2785,4.5,4.0,"Quandt is the foremost Middle Eastern scholar at Virginia and arguably one of the top minds on the subject in the country.  His expertise brings first hand accounts to lectures, which makes them worth attending.  His tests are fairly difficult but completely predictable.  One of the top teachers at UVA."
5056,2785,4.5,3.0,"loved him and loved the class. just take it. it expands your knowledge of an area of the world the US is so involved in. Quandt knows what he is saying, he's been there, he's seen things. my favorite professor. last day of classes he gave special ME desserts to the whole lecture room!"
5057,2785,4.5,3.0,"Quandt was extremely clear in his presentations-you don't realize this until you go back through your notes-TAKE GOOD NOTES! The reading load was overwhelming, but he mainly asks about key themes and points in the readings, unless he's discussed specifics in class. Going to class is extremely helpful, since all of the ID's come from class notes."
5058,2785,3.5,4.0,Quandt is a great teacher. I feel like I can intelligently discuss the ME now. The class is not easy there is a ton of reading and like others have said the ID's on the test are stupid for a class where you more talk about themes. Overall I would totally recommend this class.
5059,2785,5.0,4.0,"quandt is clear, helpful and interesting! class is hard but worth it if you're interested in the ME!"
5060,2785,4.5,4.0,"very knowledgeable and approachable, but I do not like how he includes IDs on tests- too narrow a focus on details while largely not testing on major themes and dynamics"
5061,2785,3.0,4.0,"Another one of these UVa Government Profs who likes to toot his own horn.  However, his class is really very good, but seriously, do we need to be graded on a competitive scale&#63;"

5064,1493731,5.0,3.0,"Garner is the best professor in the department. He puts so much effort into making his lectures & labs interesting, practical, and also enjoyable. Take advantage of the time you have with him and learn as much as you can because you won't find many profs who care as much about students. He will challenge you but in the end you will be grateful!"
5065,1493731,5.0,3.0,"Best Professor in MAE. Him and Thacker genuinely care about their classes, but Thacker has lost his edge. Garner often speaks of a lack of useful classes in the MAE dept. He is a teacher first and a researcher second (Unlike Knospe). Do well in this class and take Adv Mechatronics. He restored my faith in uva MAE."
5066,1493731,5.0,3.0,This was my all time favorite class in the Mech major.  He teaches you things you will actually use in a fun/practical way.  He really cares about his students and loves to get involved in extracurricular projects.   He devotes a ton of time and effort in making this class a great and useful experience.
5067,1493731,5.0,3.0,greatest teacher ever! he is so nice and learns everyone's names and he puts more effort into his class than i have seen before.
5068,1493731,5.0,2.0,My favorite professor at UVa.  He is great at explaining everything you have to do.  This course is just plain fun and extremely practical to the field of Mechanical Engineering.
5069,1493731,5.0,4.0,He is very good at explaining electronics to students unfamiliar with electronics. He is very knowledgeable in electronics and computer control. He is excited and dedicated to his classes. he can seem ornary at times but that is usually because he was in the lab all night working on something for class.
5070,1084132,4.5,4.0,"Had her for J-Term and had a great experience. Was a very good, clear lecturer who got the class involved. Sometimes veered a little off track by introducing video clips that were more of a personal agenda than relevant material, but this was not often. Tailored the lesson plan perfectly for jterm, was extremely challenging but not impossible"
5071,1084132,4.0,4.0,"Dean Most is friendly, not that approachable. Gives good advising help. Class material was interesting, but if you don't like to talk a lot, you won't do well. Have to write one paper, and the rest is participation. I took this class because I thought you had to in order to get an advisor; this isn't true. Received a B."
5072,1084132,5.0,3.0,"This woman is incredible. Great teacher, even better advisor. I was so lucky to have enrolled in her class, because she totally fostered my love for anthropology and served as my foyer into the fascinating world of archaeology. Great &quot;textbooks,&quot; which are really just interesting and thought provoking best-sellers by Jared Diamond. TAKE HER CLASS."
5073,1084132,4.5,2.0,"Great class to take in your first semester!! Especially if you're at all interested in anthropology or history. She's also a really helpful adviser, love her!!"
5074,1084132,5.0,2.0,This class was GREAT! I was not sure I wanted to take this class-but am so happy I did. Dean Most is the best! She cares about you-she's a great teacher-and a really helpful advisor.
5075,1084132,2.0,5.0,"I AM BEGGING YOU...DO NOT take this class no matter what the circumstances! Even if someone has a knife to your big toe telling you to take it or a little girl is threatening to rip the head off your Cabbage Patch doll if you don't enroll, DON'T TAKE IT! Or else you'll be stuck suffering in a torture chamber, watching the seconds tick by..."
5076,2789,5.0,3.0,Lark is one of my favorite professors that I have had. He is likely the smartest person I have taken a class from and he is good at explaining things. Assignments were designed to make sure that you knew and understood the material rather than make you fail. Also go to office hours! Enjoyable to talk to and has lots of cool stories.
5077,2789,3.0,3.0,"He's a fine professor. Nothing special. His lectures are hella boring and I got annoyed that so many were for ""cultural edification"" that we weren't graded on when I had actual questions about the real material. But, he's not terrible. He has his policies and he sticks to them. He says attendance is mandatory, but do what you want."
5078,2789,4.0,2.0,"No reason to go to class half the time, class is very dry and boring anyway. Other half is quizzes and turning in homework. Two tests & a final, 1 project."
5079,2789,1.0,3.0,The worst teacher I have ever had at UVA. He is slow and boring. Most students took a nap in his class. He hates being challenged and he wont like you after that. Very eregant man. I had to teach everything I know about that class. I got a B but I strongly believe I would of got an A if I was a girl. My girlfriend got an A!!!!!! I thought her every
5080,2789,4.5,1.0,"QUite interesting to talk to.  He doesnt think his class is the only class we have, very considerate. NO TESTS, just projects and is very easy with his grading"
5081,2789,5.0,3.0,"James Lark is the man! Great lecturer, had SYS 201 and APMA 312 with him, and he really knows his stuff.  Would recommend him for any class."
5082,2789,4.5,4.0,He is meticulously thorough in everything he does. Some classes get longwinded and there is no such thing as a short stop by office hours. He is very bright and very fair on tests and grading. Great professor.
5083,2789,5.0,1.0,"No reason to go to class at all, 3 projects, no work at all - no grades- VERY EASY!  Really nice guy, but the class is just pointless... take it!"
5084,2789,5.0,1.0,"3 projects, no other work."

5090,2789,5.0,1.0,Great Professor; his projects are interesting and his lectures are helpful
5091,2789,3.5,2.0,3 big projects but besides that almost zero workload
5092,1166057,3.0,3.0,"Was it Latin narratives or the professor, but the course oozes sexuality and tension.  I loved every minute of it.  Excellent, stimulating, titillating experience taught by an expert.  This is what I came to college for.  I wish I could take more of this and recommend it highly.  I learned so much. Wonderful.  Best Class Ever. I crave more!"
5093,1166057,5.0,3.0,"An interesting, fun class with a great professor."
5094,1166057,5.0,3.0,Prof. Engle is one of the best professors I have had in UVA.  His class on Latino narratives was the best this semester. I loved the readings and the class discussions were great. Prof. Engle really stimulated my thinking on these issues. He has great passion for the materials and inspires others.
5095,1166057,5.0,2.0,Mike is a great teacher who cares about his subject matter. His classes are interest and its clear he really loves the materials.  He's also pretty hot.
5096,1166057,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher who really knows what he's talking about. Sometimes goes off on tangents, but they're usually interesting (and sometimes weird) enough to keep your attention. I definitely enjoyed the class and learned a lot."
5097,1166057,5.0,3.0,No Comments
5098,1166057,2.5,2.0,"Teacher was nice and helpful though somewhat unorganized, ansd often he wouldn't plan out class time well.  Not hard to do well if you like literature.  I didn't have a particular interest in the subject matter but i still found the class interesting."
5099,2793,4.0,5.0,"Professor Fraser and the TAs made this class not only tolerable but truly enjoyable. It was an incredibly challenging year, but despite it all I feel that the work I put in was valuable and the class was worthwhile.   This class will be HARD WORK especially 2nd semester. Choose easier classes alongside it. I  worked 15 hours on just Orgo some weeks"
5100,2793,3.5,4.0,"The benefit of taking orgo with Professor Fraser is that she pushes you to understand the concepts and not just memorize. Her class has a lot of components (weekly homework, reading questions etc.) so be organized. Discussions and office hours are SUPER important- go every week! Tests are the hardest part, so take advantage of the regrade."
5101,2793,4.5,4.0,"Fraser requires a lot of work, but is very understanding and extremely kind. She has an amazing mind and really helps you get excited and interested in Chemistry. I've had a lot of horrible Chemistry professors, but I would major in it if I had a chance to be taught by Fraser every time. 1010 Would recommend! "
5102,2793,2.5,4.0,"Fraser is one of the most caring professors I've had so far at UVa. The work load is rough, but it's all for the better. Organic chemistry requires a lot of work and having her guidance is a huge plus. Tests are hard and comments are not too helpful. TA's grade everything and are used as direct references for help. Fraser has good office hours too."
5103,2793,4.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Fraser in for Orgo II in 1996 (her first year at UVA, I believe).  Her class was challenging, but I learned a lot, including the importance of hard work.  I am a professor of chem now as well and remember that she seemed to care a lot about making sure that we learned.  This meant a lot.  Thank you, Dr. Fraser."
5104,2793,1.5,5.0,"Fraser is the worst. She's not helpful - I'm the sort who really loves to go to office hours, but after the first few I stopped going. The tests are impossible and in lecture she's a mess. Read the textbook, though, and you'll do okay in the class."
5105,2793,2.0,4.0,"Prof. Fraser is a very nice and pleasant person to talk to. However, her Inorganic Chemistry class is very difficult - mostly due to a serious lack of organization and a big difficulty gap between what's taught in class and what's asked on tests. Teaches basic concepts only to test you on details and extreme cases."
5106,2793,3.5,5.0,"Not a terrible lecturer, but not very interesting. Her exams are ridiculously hard which she intends because there is a big curve. She teaches you the basic concepts, but expects you to be able to apply them at a much higher level making the book a necessity. Probably one of the most difficult chem classes I've taken so far."
5107,2793,1.0,5.0,pure hell
5108,2793,2.0,5.0,This class is by far THE hardest class at UVA.  Proceeding through the chemistry major I have found that the class focused too heavily on the details; much of which we never have seen again in other classes.  Life was hell in that class.  The only things that keeps you going are the friends you have.  Be prepared to get beaten into the ground!
5109,2793,4.5,5.0,"Thoroughly agree with the guy who said &quot;prepare to fail your other classes&quot;. Chem literally becomes your life. That said, she's an awesome person - very nice, dedicated, and makes you learn A LOT. The class has really made me appreciate orgo. Plus you become great friends with your classmates. Very worthwhile class if you enjoy chem."
5110,2793,4.0,5.0,"Fraser's lectures are very useful, she presents information clearly and orderly. She is very excited about the subject and is a nice person, the only reason the class is so hard is because that's how you'll learn best. This class made my life hell, I'm not gonna lie, it was rough, but I learned so much. I loved it."
5111,2793,3.5,5.0,"Hardest class at UVA I don't care what anyone says.  Youur life will be chemistry. Our second midterm average was a 28%.  But, if you do the work you'll have at LEAST a B.  You will learn stuff in class, but it will have little or nothing to do with the homework you're doing. Prepare to fail all other classes though, you will have to ignore them."
5112,2793,2.0,5.0,ridiculous!
5113,2793,2.5,5.0,"This is the class with the 38% exam average.  Fraser's a nice lady, but she's not very good at explaining things -- and neither was the TA the year I took it.  It IS possible to get an A, but be prepared to work 30 hours a week on the problem sets."
5114,2793,1.5,5.0,"I have nothing good to say about this class. I love science but I hated this class with a passion. The work load is rediculous. She could have taught us more, better without it. You will not learn much that you didn't learn in 182. You will hurt. You will hate your life. You've been warned."
5115,2793,3.0,5.0,"Exams are hard. She really knows her stuff, but is vague in answering questions.  Prepare to work in this course."

5117,2793,5.0,5.0,Great class..She sets very high standards.
5118,2793,2.5,5.0,It's the hardest class I've taken at UVA. She's horribly vague at answering questions but she's okay with the lectures.
5119,2793,3.0,5.0,"Frasier is a really nice lady to get to know, but this lady is HARD.  She can be very vague with answering questions.  Lectures are pretty clear though."
5120,2793,3.0,1.0,"Very very very very very extremely hard class, feels great when you're done though"
5121,2793,1.0,3.0,bad than ever

5126,183021,5.0,3.0,Barolsky is truly wonderful. Those who said otherwise really haven't got a clue. He is a true connoisseur of renaissance art (as well as many other subjects) and presents his vast knowledge in an utterly charming and unassuming fashion. He does not presents incontestable facts but rather conveys opinions and theories on art he clearly loves. 
5127,183021,1.0,5.0,"Worst ""professor"" I've ever had. Unclear, doesn't use the latest scholarship to provide different viewpoints. He just talks, basically to himself, and at us, with no engagement. It's impossible to follow him and he doesn't make any sense. Very unhelpful, standoffish, and boring. "
5128,183021,1.0,3.0,"He really talks to himself while look at the screen. Difficult to follow. Not a dynamic or at all engaging professor. Not very structured class. And a tough grader. I was very much looking forward to the course (I'm ARTH major), but found myself dreading Barolsky's lectures. Would not recommend."
5129,183021,3.0,3.0,"Barolsky is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the topic. However, he expects students to put in too much time outside of class. He assigns way too much busy work, but the mid-term and final are pretty easy as long as you spend enough time memorizing the artwork. Requires a lot of time, prof is sometimes unclear. Take only if majoring."
5130,183021,2.5,3.0,"Prof. Barolsky is really smart, and definitely knows his art history. He's really fun to listen to in lecture because he knows so much, but don't think you can get away with not reading! He expects a lot of memorization, so this class is excellent if you have a visual memory. I found Barolsky interesting, but a bit tough to decipher."
5131,183021,2.0,2.0,"I love art history, but Barolsky has a very monotonous voice and just  shows one slide after another. For the tests he chooses 5 random pieces from about 100. Gives no comments on papers/journals. Arbitrarily gives grades on those. Randomly checks attendance. Says Dante won't be on exams, but it is. I don't reccomend any class taught by him"
5132,183021,2.0,5.0,"Took his Italian Renaissance class, did not enjoy it. Tests were based solely on identifying 5 slides from around 75 pieces, not fun. Refused to use email as a means of communication. Was very vague in expectations on some assignments, almost seemed intentional. Wouldn't recommend this class at all."
5133,183021,4.0,1.0,"PB was more than gracious and willing to teach a 1st year who accidentally signed up for a graduate seminar. The course load was unquestionably manageable, and the atmosphere in class was fairly relaxed. I often felt as if he wanted us to talk more than we did, rather than him lecturing. Overall, though, a great professor and the perfect courtier."
5134,183021,3.5,5.0,"He is definitely knowledgeable, but his tests are impossible because you don't know what he's asking for.  Unless you can read minds, don't take his class.  He's somewhat entertaining, though."
5135,183021,4.5,3.0,"He is absolutely amazing! I don't know what he's like in a lecture, but the seminar has been by far one of my favorite classes at UVA. It's laid-back but extremely interesting, and the work load is totally manageable. MUST TAKE!"
5136,183021,4.5,3.0,Best professor at UVa.
5137,183021,4.5,4.0,"Barolsky is one of the most amazing professors at UVA. Yes, he teaches the class his own way, but that is what makes it so interesting. He obviously loves what he does. If you go see him after class/during office hours he is very helpful. And to all the people complaining about grades, you need be more creative and think like PB!"
5138,183021,1.0,3.0,"dont take. no guage of grade. lectures boring and unclear; dwells on one work too long. was v. excited about subject; 'italian renaissance' but didnt get to michel. or da vinci - nothing past botticelli! clearly loves; inclusion of dante and vasari good, paper was fun, but unfair grader. unapproachable; wont even read email. tests on trivialities."
5139,183021,5.0,3.0,"This has been my favorite class so far! Prof. Barolsky expects his students to be able to really THINK about what they've learned, and his exams are just a push to get you to draw even connections among the things you've learned. If you are open-minded and intrigued, take this class and get all you can out of it! Barolsky's passion is wonderful."
5140,183021,4.0,3.0,This man is brilliant. Go talk to him and get to know him. He has so much knowledge and experience that you should take advantage of it. Absolutely take him for your seminar. It was my favorite class of all college!!
5141,183021,1.0,5.0,"I took AP art history in high school and it was my favorite class. Then i took Barolsky's class which was dreadful. He's by far the worst teacher I have ever had. He asks obscure exam questions. He makes no comments on exams or papers, just places a grade at the bottom and refuses to answer any questions or give reasons for the grade. stubborn."
5142,183021,5.0,3.0,"Be careful, he's a harsh grader. But in all honesty, the material is SO interesting in this class. It is definitely worth taking. Also, he was incredibly helpful when I came to see him about my paper. Lastly, he tells you what is going to be on the exam! Just give yourself ample time to study for them."
5143,183021,4.5,3.0,Easily one of the best classes at UVa - not an easy A but fantastic lectures and professor.
5144,183021,1.5,4.0,"Tests are completely random, class called him B+ Barolsky, impossible to get an A, don't think he read either of my exams or my paper.  Passionate, knowledgeable, nice guy -but don't take the class."
5145,183021,2.0,3.0,"A Harvard grad, Barolsky thinks he's God's gift to earth. He's picky, unclear and evil when it comes to grading.  Steer clear!"
5146,183021,4.5,3.0,"Great lecturer, very enthusiastic about the subject but he's unconventional.  So you don't get traditional art history tests and that irritates people - you can't care about your grade too much in this class.  He's a great contrast to the ARTH formula."
5147,183021,5.0,4.0,"I love his class. But you do need to be interested in the subject. He is very funny, brings in outside materials to show how what we study pertains to the present. As to the darkness, everything we need to know is in the book. I'm taking ARTH232 next :)"
5148,183021,4.5,2.0,I don't see why people had problems with this guy.  He's very clear and his lectures are entertaining.  I took his Italian Renaissance class the next year.

5150,183021,2.0,3.0,"I heard great things and was excited to be taking the class.  Needless to say considering his ave. overall rating, i was a tad disappointed.  He means well, but he is an ineffective teacher since he is largely inaudible, and his grading method unorthodox."
5151,183021,1.0,2.0,Can't hear much of what he is talking about on the account of his little voice.  Didn't explain how tests were set up.  Leaves no lights on so you can take notes.
5152,183021,1.0,3.0,Extremely vague and unhelpful.  Never gave us criteria for papers/tests before or after the fact.  What exactly were we graded on&#63; I still don't know!  Voice never got above a whisper despite large class size.
5153,2801,2.0,2.0,"The class is perfectly fine; it's just the professor who's a bit of a jerk. If you need help, contact anyone but him and you'll live a happier life."
5154,2801,4.0,3.0,"A very no BS teacher.  He is genuinely interesed in the subject and lectures on many concepts to get you thinking about the class.  He is a very fair teacher, though many who don't follow the rules and expectations set out in the syllabus will complain about him.  Expect a very interesting class and careful outside reading."
5155,2801,1.5,3.0,I can describe George Cahen in one word: uncompassionate.
5156,2801,4.5,3.0,"Friendliest, most helpful professor on grounds. Though some claim he is hard and unfair, he is one of the most reasonable professors. Just be willing to make an effort and don't be afraid to talk to him."
5157,2801,1.0,1.0,"Horrible profressor, not helpful at all.  Any time I asked him a question he was mean and very unhelpful.  H didn't even want to help.  Does not seem to care about students at all."
5158,2801,1.0,3.0,"Worst Professor. Really mean and completely unfair in grading. People would have the same exact answers, one person would get 6 points of the other 20 POINTS!!! Did he care.. no! Simply told you that you obviously didn't read the book and that he should take more points off. Terrible teacher who has a class that is a requirement. Ridiculous!"
5159,2801,1.5,4.0,"If he's not the meanest professor in the world, he's certainly the meanest at UVA. I asked for help once and he basically told me I was too stupid to be in school. I left crying, still not understanding the how to do the lab..."
5160,2801,5.0,1.0,Fantastic guy. Laments for the blue van. =p
5161,2801,4.5,4.0,"Good teacher, especially knowledgable about engineering failure and materials failure.  Good class"
5162,2801,1.0,5.0,very unfair on grading I shouldve received A+ but got only A
5163,2801,5.0,3.0,"It's not hard to do well, but he does require you to put in decent effort. Forces his students to really stop and &quot;think like engineers.&quot; Really easy to talk to though."
5164,2801,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Cahen is a very knowledgeable guy and sincerely cares about how his students do.  You do learn a lot in his class.  HOWEVER, he is a harsher grader and will require significantly more work than the other professor who teaches ENGR142R.  They'll all get A's for less work."
5165,2801,2.0,2.0,Cahen is a very unforgiving grader.  He is one of the worst teachers i have ever had.  I do not recommend taking any classes with him.
5166,2801,5.0,2.0,"Cahen is one of the nicest guys I've ever met.  Hes been at UVa since 1968, and he loves everything about it.  He cares for his students, and his enthusiasm makes his class enjoyable.  He is one of the most knowledgable professors i've ever had."
5167,2801,2.0,1.0,not very helpful during the labs
5168,2801,4.0,1.0,"Cahen is a good guy. His class is fun, because the lectures are interesting and all you have to do is listen to him and focus on what he says, b/c he doesn't test you. He knows A LOT about material science and cars. Ask him about swashplates!"
5169,2801,5.0,3.0,"Great lectures interesting guy, HAS NICE CARS!"
5170,2801,5.0,4.0,"He is a great advisor for the solar car team at the University.  He teaches us a lot about cars and technology, as well as drive us around cross country."

5173,2802,1.0,5.0,"Professor Kingston is not the best teacher, his office hours are a joke. He is not helpful at all. If you want to learn. Do NOT take this class you will regret it. Professor Kingston does not try to teach, expects you to know already."
5174,2802,4.0,2.0,"Kingston's lectures could be pretty dry and boring sometimes, and he assigned a lot of reading, but he's a really nice guy.  He responds to emails quickly and is very understanding.  Plus, he makes clear what he expects from you and what will be tested (study guides are great).  Overall, his lectures could be rough to sit through, but he's good. "
5175,2802,3.0,3.0,"Although Kingston is very nice, his lectures are extremely dry and boring. He makes comprehensive study guides for the tests, so the class is not really hard. Also, there are two relatively easy projects and one easy essay. Don't wait until before test time to read."
5176,2802,3.5,3.0,"Kingston is a really nice guy, but his lectures are DULL. The readings are not too numerous and are actually pretty interesting. Easy papers, and projects. Makes EXTREMELY helpful study guides for each test. Try not to wait before test time to read!!"
5177,2802,3.0,2.0,"Class was somewhat interesting but pretty controversial.  Always include your own opinion in the papers even though he never says to really because he will take off a lot of points if you don't.  Would I take it again if I had to do it over&#63; No, but I'm not mad I took it.  He's a really great guy though and his voice sounds like buzz lightyear."
5178,2802,4.5,2.0,"Friendly, down to earth, and interesting."
5179,2802,4.0,2.0,"Good class, not too many readings, interesting stuff... but in its goal as an introduction to sociology, it doesn't really work... he talks about a lot of interesting topics but fails to bring them together and really define sociology too well (this was Fall of 05)"
5180,2802,5.0,1.0,"Solid class, even more solid guy.  Going to class is not all that necessary.  Nor is keeping up on the readings because you only need to know  selected readings for the final and midterm and its probably most efficent to  go back and read what you need. Still the readings and class are worthwhile, and that strategy would require a lot of cramming."
5181,2802,3.0,2.0,"Terrible lectures, I couldn't stand going and listening to him tell us about two terms in a whole class. I skipped two thirds of the semester and got an A."
5182,2802,4.5,2.0,Funny nice guy.decent material and lectures.too much reading for a 101 class.easy projects and paper.
5183,2802,4.0,2.0,"Good stuff; Get Ryan Gruters as your TA, hes awesome; kingston has intesting ideas and the material is pretty easy"
5184,2802,4.0,2.0,"I loved SOC 101!The class material was interesting and the lectures were decent. Kingston cares about students knowing the material and if at anytime he feels he might have confused the class,he sends an e-mail in attempt to clarify it.The study guides=VERY USEFUL!Keeping up w/the readings would make the class easier.I'd recommend SOC 101 to anyone"
5185,2802,5.0,2.0,"I love Kingston! He is so smart and tried his best not to make the lectures boring, though sometimes they were. The tests are not easy, but you can do well if you've gone to class. I did the reading, but you probably didn't have to do it all. This class is not a gut, but close to it."
5186,2802,4.5,1.0,"I enjoyed the class- he did a good job presenting materials that are controverial to those outside the field of sociology. It is very important to go to all his lectures, and take advantage of his study sessions and &quot;Convenient Guide to an A on the Midterm/Final Exam&quot;"
5187,2802,4.5,1.0,good
5188,2802,4.0,1.0,"Class is easy if you attend.  Gives study guide before both exams which tells you exactly what to do.  I recommend Kingston, lectures can be boring but very informative."
5189,2802,4.5,2.0,"Good lecturer, not too hard of a class"
5190,2802,4.0,1.0,Easy and interesting course/proffessor
5191,2802,3.5,2.0,repetitve but easr
5192,2802,3.5,2.0,"the lectures are pretty interesting at first, but become increasingly more boring. he tries to make tests easy by telling you what's on them ahead of time, but still turn out more difficult than you'd expect from a 101. hard to get really excited about this class..my recommendation: don't take it un"
5193,2802,3.5,3.0,"his lectures were quite interesting, and not bad although not many people show up to his class. grades depend on the TA you get since all papers and exams are graded by them. you learn a lot but grading system of TAs vary."
5194,2802,3.0,1.0,"boring as all get out. presumably he knows the material, but his pretentiousness makes teaching a bit more difficult. unless you really have never read a book about some other culture, any other culture, don't take this course."
5195,2802,5.0,1.0,"This is a great Sociology class-he explained many key concepts, like social stariication, the issues of correlational research, and I had no backround in it. The projects are fun and easy.  Good class."
5196,2802,4.0,4.0,great professor. go to every lecture.
5197,2802,4.5,2.0,"A lot of fun, a really interesting class, taught by a man who knows his stuff and can present it clearly.  This was my favorite class first semester firt year, and I am so glad I took it.  I would definitely recommend it!"
5198,2802,3.0,1.0,"kingston is a little too full of himself.  easy class though.  lectures are well prepared and interesting, light homework load, discussions were usually fun."
5199,2802,4.5,3.0,a great course to help you be open-minded; Kingston presents a variety of perspectives in a concise and clear manner...great course
5200,2802,4.5,2.0,"it's a really fun, low-stress class"
5201,2802,4.5,1.0,"Professor Kingston is an excellent speaker who puts together simple but very interesting lectures.  The class is very easy with minimal reading, and the material is almost always of some interest and presented well in lecture."
5202,2802,2.0,2.0,he is soo arogant
5203,2802,3.5,2.0,"The class is okay, but there are better professors who teach it"

5207,2802,5.0,1.0,Great lectures.  Keeps it interesting and exciting to learn
5208,183027,4.5,3.0,wide topics and easy to follow. bring a different cultural perspective about architecture.
5209,183027,4.5,2.0,"Such a sweetheart, don't be discouraged by his accent. Prof. Huang is a rebel in his discipline, teaching thematically rather than chronologically which is far easier to learn. Prepare to embrace culture as well as architecture (including where to find the loveliest ladies in China) and do take good notes and ask questions. CRUCIAL."
5210,183027,3.5,2.0,"Such a sweet man who really loves what he does.  The class is not much work, but can be very interesting.  I knew nothing and cared little about Eastern architecture before this class, but found most everything very rewarding."
5211,183027,4.0,3.0,Wonderful man.  Open to ideas and really loves engaging people in discussions about architecture.
5212,183027,4.0,2.0,No Comments
5213,1690356,4.0,2.0,"Very easy professor. Never attended a single lecture and still ended up with an A-. Usually, 80% of the exam points are stuff covered in class, and the other 20% is much more application-based to something not discussed in class too heavily, which is why he's is a 2/5 rated difficulty, not a 1."
5214,1690356,4.0,3.0,"Straightforward professor, definitely takes time to cover material. Tests are usually insultingly easy, although he will be the first to acknowledge when an exam was particularly difficult and curve generously. Overall, he was a pretty great teacher, definitely one of the better ones in the Math department."
5215,1690356,3.5,3.0,"The first exam starts off easy, then it becomes a disaster, but don't worry because he gives a very generous curve. Most of his lectures consist of proofs that no one cares about, but other than that I have to say that he is extremely knowledgable, informative, and a nice guy overall."
5216,1690356,2.0,4.0,To be fair I am not a huge fan of the topics covered in calc 3. The lectures are useless. Consist entirely of walking through proofs which are not tricky or enlightening. The tests cover the most obscure ideas possible and trick you into a lower grade.
5217,1690356,4.5,3.0,"My favorite professor this semester.  The class is hard, but he explains everything very well, and is extremely fair."
5218,1690356,1.0,4.0,Really strict grading policy. Don't curve even if the final exam is really hard. I struggled the whole semester in an very easy class.
5219,1141489,4.0,2.0,"Leblang is a good professor.  Clear, funny, and helpful."
5220,1141489,5.0,1.0,David lights up my life.  He gives me hope to carry on.  He lights up my days and fills my nights with song.
5221,1141489,5.0,5.0,Hasn't even taught a class here and he's already my favorite!  We love his sharp wit and clever comments.  You'd never guess that this man was once a roadie for Helen Reddy.  Is that cool or what&#63;
5222,1837809,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors I've had at UVA in terms of his ability to keep you captivated. CSO is not an interesting topic but somehow he manages to keep you paying attention. He's a bit of a character but in the best way possible. You can tell he's a very smart professor and is genuinely interest in what he's lecturing.
5223,1837809,2.0,5.0,"Grading: Tests (40%), Homework (40%), Lab (20%), Weekly Quizzes (20%)

A very tough course. The lectures are great, but sometimes it doesn't have to do with the content in the quiz or exam. Failed the last test. Homework Assignments are HARD AF!

Bit fiddling, Assembly (I hate the bomb hw), and schat (asks you to make a chatroom in C Programming) "
5224,1837809,5.0,2.0,Prof. Tychonievich is absolutely fantastic! He really tries to explain everything as clearly as possible and provide plenty of resources for everybody to learn the material. He was very patient and always willing to try to explain a concept in another way to help someone who was confused.
5225,1837809,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic. Favorite, most enriching class Ive taken so far. Apparent that Tychonievich put a great deal of thought and effort into the assignments in such a way that gives students a great understanding of the course material. Never has a class been so exciting and rewarding."
5226,1837809,5.0,2.0,"Professor Tychonievich is a wonderful discrete math instructor! I went in not knowing even what discrete was and now he's made the topic fun! He teaches with pen and paper rather than computer, however it's still a great course! Quizzes almost every friday, however for a 20 minute quiz, you get a 30 minute review. Take this if you can."
5227,1837809,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors. Even though his lectures are recorded, everyone still shows up because he is a great lecturer. His projects are hard, but the class feels great!"
5228,1837809,2.0,5.0,"So he's not a bad guy, but I hate the way he teaches. The material in Computer Architecture is hard enough. He doesn't have to try and make the class more difficult than it needs to be. His constant quizzes are an annoyance and the labs have literally never helped me learn anything. In fact, I found that they confused me more than I was before."
5229,1837809,4.5,3.0,"I found this intro class to be very easy, and L. Tychonievich was very helpful in keeping the class fun, interesting, inspirational, and educational.  He was great at teaching the class, gave good feedback, solved problems with ease, and was excellent in interacting with the class."
5230,1837809,4.0,2.0,"Tychonievich is such a character, I'm really going to miss him.  I took CS 1110 without any prior knowledge of coding and enjoyed it alot.  If you dont have prior experience, find someone (preferably in your lab) who really understands and can study with you.  Make sure you go to TA office hours early because the wait time can be very long."
5231,1837809,2.0,4.0,"Tychonievich takes the time to respond to anonymous feedback and explain misunderstood concepts.  However, his lectures have little structure and come with little visual aid.  His test questions are long and ambiguous and there have been multiple times when his own answers have been wrong or ambiguous as well. The book prepares you more than him."
5232,1837809,4.0,3.0,"So if you have coding experience he is great for CS 1110, however if you know jack about coding take 1112. The class can be a lot of work and it will suck if you get behind on POTDs. I would recommend this class if you want to be a CS major because its fun and you get to code cool stuff, lots of software design. Don't take 1110 if you don't like CS"
5233,1837809,1.5,5.0,"Definitely not an intro level class. I had zero coding experience coming into this class and it left me struggling big time. Large amounts of assignments that take hours of work, and tests that are very unlike the assignments. The book is what teaches you the most. The guy is sarcastic, teaches way too fast, and doesn't directly answer questions"
5234,1837809,2.5,5.0,"Stay away unless you love Computer Science and are ready to dedicate a lot of time and work. I had zero knowledge about coding when going in and the programs we had to write were definitely NOT intro-level. First 2 weeks might seem easy because he only teaches concepts but the material from lectures isn't helpful for HW. Use the book, it helps."
5235,1837809,1.5,5.0,Even though the professor is super smart he teaches at way too fast of a pace and gives too much work. Avoid this class.
5236,1837809,1.5,5.0,"Class is super hard and involves a lot of math. If you are not good at math, stay away! He lectures at a breathtaking speed so if you don't understand something once, seek help immediately."
5237,1837809,5.0,5.0,Always helpful at office hours and answers all questions. Great lectures but workload was high.
5238,1837809,4.0,4.0,"Very entertaining in a nerdy, quirky kind of way. Goes through lecture material very quickly. He's hyper intelligent and really helpful outside of class so I highly encourage going to his office hours if you're stuck. Recommended only if you're a CS major and interested in the topic he's teaching though because he does expect a lot of work."
5239,1837809,1.0,5.0,Too much work given. Does not realize that the students have other courses/a social life to take part in. His homeworks make you build a graphics engine from scratch forcing you to use his arbitrary input syntax while there not being any online resources that are helpful for the homework - probably because no other graphics class is as tedious.
5240,1837809,1.0,5.0,"He may be all energetic and enthusiastic, but he is totally useless. I can never understand a single thing in this class. His quizzes are stupid multiple choice that are just trick questions."
5241,1837809,3.5,2.0,"best professor for CS 2110! He goes through the material somewhat quickly, but if you're the kind of person that understands concepts easily then this class should be a breeze. Tycho. is a very quirky guy, but nonetheless energetic and VERY enthusiastic. he might go a kinda fast if you're looking to have him for CS1110, but he taught CS2110 well."
5242,1837809,5.0,3.0,Very energetic and quirky but in a good way. He is very knowledgeable in his field. Attendance is not mandatory but his lectures are always engaging: so much so that I feel as if I've missed out if I miss a class. UVA needs more professors like Tychonievich.
5243,1837809,4.0,3.0,"That previous review was clearly written by Tychonievich. That said, he was pretty much on-point with his assessment of his  class."
5244,1837809,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic, energetic professor. Codes super fast, so pay attention in class, but will take time to explain any tough concepts. Class isn't tough; just keep up with homework. Entertaining lectures, with original poems and jokes."
5245,576251,1.0,5.0,Prof. McGarvey is one of the worst professors I've had at UVA. He seems to want you to fail. He loves to show off how intelligent he is rather than help his students succeed. The TAs are more resourceful than he is which has its pros and cons. He is accessible outside of lecture bc students don't attend his office hours. Laughs at confused student.
5246,576251,2.0,5.0,"He basically talks to the chalkboard. Also he's very example-focused, rather than helping you understand overall concepts. He randomly goes on drawing tangents and draws these huge compounds you'll never need to know. Going to class was more or less useless because the book was WAYYYY better than his teaching style."
5247,576251,2.0,3.0,Exams are fair and has a huge curve at the end. I took Serbulea for one semester and McGarvey for another and their exams are similar except McGarvey has a huge curve. No need for textbook!
5248,576251,3.5,4.0,"He is a great professor. The only problem with him though, as the previous comments have mentioned, is that he goes pretty fast. But he is a very very nice guy, pretty easy going, but definitely knows his stuff. Tests were tough though. You really really have to know what you have studied, and be able to think analytically, not just conceptually."
5249,576251,4.5,4.0,"Really helpful if you go to office hours. Kinda works fast, but is very willing to help students."
5250,576251,5.0,3.0,Best chemistry teacher I've ever had.  Draws chemical structures like an artist.
5251,576251,3.5,3.0,The nice thing about this class is that you don't have to read the textbook at all (unless you want to). I think I only used it once for nomenclature. It's actually not that bad as some of the comments say if you like organic chem even though it's a hard class.
5252,576251,2.5,5.0,"Mcgarvey draws molecules at the speed of light.  There is no catching up with this guy.  Bring a good pen, thick notebook, and make sure to write fast enough to annotate your notes.   His tests are hard, but the curve really helped."
5253,576251,2.5,4.0,Lectures like a tape recorder; there's no stopping! Also likes to show off his drawing. Write down what he says and don't just copy from the board; he doesn't annotate his reactions. Assumes you know more than you really do. Good class if you are an independent and detail-oriented learner.
5254,576251,1.0,4.0,Just stands up on the chalkboard and writes away with little interaction with students.  He probably is one of those professors who knows their stuff but can't teach it well.  Don't take a class with him.
5255,576251,3.0,4.0,"he taught, spoke, wrote (on board), and drew (molecules) at the speed of light. he stopped for maybe like 3 seconds to answer any questions. never reviewed for midterms. avg's on midterms were around 50-60 and problem sets were very challenging. the class was really time consuming overall, but there was a decent curve at the end."
5256,576251,3.5,2.0,"Don't let these comments sway you; McGarvey is an excellent teacher and very fair.  He's a human ChemDraw, and the lectures are both interesting and informative.  Stop whining and do the work - it's not outrageous and you're learning more than you think."
5257,576251,5.0,2.0,"McGarvey is an excellent teacher!  He makes things very clear.  Exams are fair and there is partial credit.  Harman is not teaching the 80's anymore, so deal with it.  McGarvey is great for the course.  Don't let others comments stear you wrong."
5258,576251,2.0,3.0,just do not take his class unless you love organic chem so much -- so much that you really do not care who would teach it.
5259,576251,3.0,3.0,"I'll try to give an objective criticism.  Prof. McG is a very nice guy, but can come across as somewhat unapproachable in lecture.  You can't let this intimidate you.  His lectures are decent, but you have stay on top of the material and ask him questions if he confuses you.  His tests are fair, and will stick to material covered in lecture."
5260,576251,1.5,4.0,"After Harman, McGarvey was a disappointment."
5261,576251,1.5,4.0,"Very unclear in lecture, but if you spend the time examining your notes, it's possible to decipher the points he tries to make. Probably not worth taking the 80s if he's the teacher again."
5262,576251,4.0,1.0,"While McGarvey may not be the best lecturer, he is a very nice guy and always willing to help if he is asked.  He doesn't hang kids out to dry like all of these other reviews seem to indicate.  Also, his tests are very fair and he answers questions during the test very well."
5263,576251,1.5,4.0,"Regardless of whether he's a good upper-level chem professor, he can't teach the 80s series. We want Harman back!!!"
5264,576251,1.0,4.0,Worst teacher ever. Do not subject yourself to his class. He has ruined the 80s series.
5265,576251,2.0,4.0,"Bizarre.  He tries to teach an honors chem class like the intro course.  Instead of teaching, he stands in front of the class, talking and drawing pictures, leaving us to figure out what the heck he's talking about.  If you like reading the book instead of going to class, enjoy.  Otherwise get out."
5266,576251,1.5,4.0,Possibly one of the worst lecturers. Ever.

5269,2813,2.0,4.0,Took this class after reading that it is pretty straight-forward and an easy A if you put in the effort. This was definitely not the case-- it's really difficult to pay attention to his lectures and certainly not an easy class. Many of my friends who took this class ended up taking it pass/fail
5270,2813,2.0,3.0,"While I find him to be a fun and interesting professor, his lectures were rather boring, making note taking a pain. I also took this online, so it's possible that his in person lectures may be better. I found that the class had little direction at times. The tests seemed to bring in curveballs I was not prepared for at all, regardless of studying."
5271,2813,5.0,3.0,"Professor Thuan is such a sweet man! Even though this class is just an intro level course that most of us took to fulfill requirements, he tried really hard to make the lectures interesting and to inspire awe about the universe we live in. People who complain about his accent are just lazy and racist -- his lectures are extremely easy to follow."
5272,2813,3.0,1.0,"The class and material is straight forward. Lots of math and science, but it's all very easy and basic. Attendance isn't required, but his lectures are really important, although they are pretty boring and dry. If you pay attention and take good notes, it's an easy A."
5273,2813,3.0,3.0,"Pretty straightforward material thats not difficult.  That being said, the class is not very interesting and most people to it to fill requirements.   Thuans explanations not always clear."
5274,2813,4.5,2.0,"He is an incredibly nice man who wants the best for his students. Everything that you need to know he writes on the board, so it is very important to go to class and take notes. He doesn't necessarily test on the book material, so you only need to review the notes to study for the tests. Its a very easy class if you show up and pay attention."
5275,2813,5.0,1.0,He is very helpful and care for his student. All you have to do is right whatever he rights on the board and study that and you be fine. 
5276,2813,4.5,2.0,"Not a bad class, but it gets boring. Take notes in class, and reading the textbook won't be necessary. This class is an easy ""B"" and a very difficult ""A"". The way he curves is basically to give 50%-60% of the class a ""B"". Helpful in office hours."
5277,2813,2.0,3.0,"I barely went to class- just read the chapters the night before the tests and did reasonably well. Thuan's accent is a little hard to understand but as long as you are paying attention it shouldn't be a problem. Very nice guy and kind of funny, but a little all over the place. Lectures were not very focused and some of the math came out of nowhere"
5278,2813,2.5,1.0,"pretty easy, straight from the book"
5279,2813,2.0,1.0,Very interesting class. You can tell he is passionate about his subject but it takes a while to get used to his accent. Its not too terribly hard to understand him though. His tests are very very easy if you study both the book and his lectures (which go along with each other.)
5280,2813,3.0,2.0,"This class is pretty boring but fairly easy. DO NOT buy the book. Its very expensive and 100% of the test material is based on the lectures so if you skip ALWAYS make up the notes (if you care that is). So yeah, if you need to take an easy class I definately recommend this. The final was kind of hard so don't completely slack off near the end."
5281,2813,1.5,4.0,"Very passionate about what he does, but it terrible at conveying it. His office hours are helpful, though."
5282,2813,2.0,4.0,"He knows what he's talking about, but he's hard to understand and the tests are based 100% off what he says in lecture. Don't bother buying the book."
5283,2813,1.5,3.0,"Dreadful. That is all. He talks into the board, and his accent makes him completely incomprehensible. Don't waste your time...this class is lethal."
5284,2813,2.5,4.0,its bad. you can barely understand him. very boring. easy class write what he does and look at him with adoring eyes. very attractive yet don't take the class to get your kicks
5285,2813,1.5,4.0,"i never went to class, never read, and didn't study for tests and i got a C. i'm not complaining. so even with the slightest bit of work you can do better than me!"
5286,2813,4.0,2.0,"Honestly, I don't understand why people are complaining. This is not a high-level class. It is an intro course. You learn these things in grade school. Go to lecture, take note, do not buy the book, and you will do fine. You have to go to lecture but on the plus side, when there's an exam, all you have to do is read your note, which is not much."
5287,2813,2.5,4.0,"You can barely understand what he is saying, because of his asian accent. He is VERY dry, & his lectures are painstaking. His tests are ridiculous & even if you study, his questions are so tricky it doesn't matter. Take the OTHER astr professor who teaches 121. For NO OTHER astr 121 class is it required to take a telescope lab except for this one."
5288,2813,1.5,4.0,"Thuan really knows his stuff and he writes everything on the board. Don't buy the book, it's a waste of $125 since you never use it. The tests were a bit difficult, he takes seemingly easy material and makes it difficult with critical thinking questions. I don't recommend this class...it's not easy."
5289,2813,3.5,1.0,"Basically: go to class, only write down things he puts on the board, and bring your laptop to use the internet -- you WILL be bored. Tests are a joke. I never studied and aced the class. VERY easy subject matter."
5290,2813,3.0,2.0,"Hard if you don't want to come to lectures. But seriously, if you go to lectures and write down pretty much everything he says you'll do fine. he doesn't use the book AT ALL. he even tells you that! sometimes hard to understand but it's not like he's teaching quantum physics."
5291,2813,1.5,4.0,"ok..I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU!! Find another class. Truly, you can miss out on this one. You HAVE to go to class because he doesnt follow the book at all! Be prepared to work MATH problems because he turns even the simplest thing into a complicated math problem. You can barely understand him and he's very boring on top of it all. SKIP IT!!"
5292,2813,2.0,3.0,"Sounds like Arnold, the only thing worse than his accent is his horrible handwriting."
5293,2813,3.5,2.0,"This class wasn't that hard; tests weren't that bad at all.  He talks like a miniature Arnold Schwarzenegger, so you have to sit a little closer to understand.  All you have to do is come to class and take notes, the book is COMPLETELY unnecessary.  He's a good teacher though, he knows his sh!t."
5294,2813,3.5,3.0,"he is adorable and funny but kind of hard to understand.  much much much harder than i expected, so be prepared.  however, just read the book and actually study some and you'll do fine."
5295,2813,4.0,4.0,"The class was &quot;sleep-time,&quot; i.e. pretty boring.  Test were easy, though."
5296,2813,4.0,2.0,"Its not true that you can just read the book. You HAVE to attend the lecture...the book is unecessary. His accent is NOT hard to understand. His tests are a bit hard, but only because ASTR 121 is 'supposed' to be an easy class. If you go to class and pay attention though, his curve is VERY generous."
5297,2813,2.5,2.0,"This class is easy, the guy isn't that hard to understand if you actually go to his class. I feel bad for you if you can't get atleast a B"
5298,2813,2.0,3.0,"did not enjoy class, hard to follow"
5299,2813,1.5,3.0,"Seems like a very nice, knowledgeable professor.  However, he does have a tendency to be boring, granted his subject matter isnt the most interesting.  You can get lost in his accent if you dont pay close attention.  If you want to take this class just be prepared to listen to close detail."
5300,2813,2.0,3.0,"Extremely boring and hard to stay awake in. Hard to understand and makes mistakes then corrects them later, making him confusing. Tests are only on what he teaches, no need for book. Not worth taking if you can avoid it"
5301,2813,4.0,3.0,"Unlike most of the comments here, I actually like his class. He does have an accent, but he can teach, and if you pay attention, the accent isn't so bad. The tests aren't easy, but I've learned a lot!"
5302,2813,3.0,1.0,"It's too bad about the accent, but the class wasn't hard at all.  If you're open to him you realize he's actually an amusing quirky guy."
5303,2813,1.0,3.0,"He was awful...I don't know how else to say it.  The class was torture, his tests were torture.  It is not an easy A...take it with Tolbert if that's what you're looking for."
5304,2813,1.0,1.0,"baaaad, i would be more angry with him if the material weren't so easy. Steps to success: register for the class, don't attend lectures, absorb the textbook the day before the test, and you'll get an A. Or at least a B+"
5305,2813,1.5,4.0,"the main challenge in this class is staying awake! understanding what he says is impossible, and he is extremely boring.  on a good note, you don't need to buy the book because his tests come directly from notes.  dont take his class unless you must!!!!!!"
5306,2813,1.0,3.0,"extremely boring, lectures all class, hard to understand"
5307,2813,1.0,3.0,I was one of the people actually attending lectures and trying to learn the material and he made me feel like an idiot when I asked him a simple question.
5308,2813,1.0,3.0,"He is probably the worst teacher I have ever had. It's not that the subject is boring, or that he can't speak english well, it's the fact that he can not teach."
5309,2813,1.5,3.0,"So boring! I mean, I read the book and it was more interesting! It takes him 10 years to describe how something happens which he could describe in five minutes! I fall asleep every day!"
5310,2813,4.0,2.0,"sure he can't talk well, but it wasn't boring"

5314,2001666,5.0,3.0,Absolute legend. If you go to class and show effort he will 100% hook you up. I wish I had him for every spanish class I had to take.
5315,2819,1.0,2.0,He urinated in front of the whole class.
5316,2819,4.0,1.0,"ECE 2066 is super easy if you intend to do EE or CPE, and have some knowledge of the field already. If you are not EE or CPE, the class will be hard and honestly you probably shouldn't bother, unless you just love a challenge. Reed is a little intimidating, but his lecture style is engaging and he will teach you a lot of cool stuff."
5317,2819,4.5,5.0,Reed is a great professor who pushes you to think out problems and find the answers using any resource you can find. He is an interesting man with a unique sense of humor and is very helpful during office hours. Homework is more lengthy than hard. Find a study group and work together.  2066 is my favorite course.
5318,2819,4.0,4.0,"Great professor in general, teaches a very wide range of subjects. Please don't get intimidated by all the negative ratings, his lectures are easy and straightforward, however his homework is fairly HARD. But he encourages people to work in groups for the homework (no pledge needed) and if you ever get stuck, be sure to go to his/office hours!"
5319,2819,2.0,4.0,"Very poor grading policy with no communication about students? grades.  Majority of homework problems were trivial and did not provide specifics about circuits. The professor presented lectures in a poor fashion and jumped from subject to subject. Overall, the professor did a poor job teaching this subject."
5320,2819,5.0,5.0,"The most worthwhile class you will ever take; I wish half of my professors had a quarter of his style and clarity. Pay attention in class, go to the problem sessions, drop by his office, and be prepared to be greatly challenged by the homework."
5321,2819,4.0,4.0,"Prof Reed is a brilliantly great guy who is really passionate about his area of expertise, which makes his lectures interesting.  But sometimes the lecture content can just go right over your head, and there is no textbook.  Go to lectures, listen, take notes, and ask questions.  Also the homework will consume your life."
5322,2819,4.0,5.0,"Yes.  All of Reed's classes are extremely hard.  The homework is an insane amount of work, and you probably won't even do that well after spending 10+ hours a week.  HOWEVER, you will learn a lot from class and feel proud in what you accomplished over the semester."
5323,2819,1.0,5.0,"The worst professor I've ever had in my life. His lectures are horrible and the book is even worse. The weekly homework sets take 20+ hours, are graded for correctness, and count for 90% of your grade. I don't know where you're suppose to learn how to solve the problems in the hw b/c he doesn't teach it and the book is useless."
5324,2819,2.0,5.0,"This guy's homeworks can at times be impossibly hard. If you have good TAs, it shouldn't be that bad. All the same, he never really goes over many problem solving examples, so you'd do well to take 203 in the Spring if you can. On the bright side, he grades 90% HW, 10% Lab."
5325,2819,2.5,5.0,"He's a really nice guy, but his class is ridiculously hard. The homework never relates to what is taught in class.. if you can even understand the lecture."
5326,2819,1.0,5.0,"take his class only if you are interested in not learning anything.  I showed up to every class, read the book, and went to every TA session, and I know about as much as you should know through a week of this course.  He is by far the worst professor/teacher I have ever had in my life"
5327,2819,5.0,3.0,"He's a great guy, and knows how to explain everything very well.  However, he gave very difficult homework. Expect to spend a lot of time and get very frustrated on the homework."
5328,2819,4.0,5.0,"If you don't know MathCAD very well, make sure you do before you take this class. He assumes you understand if you don't ask, so ask questions if you have them. If you can't, the TAs this year were very very helpful."
5329,2819,4.5,3.0,"Great class, just howmework, which wasn't that easy but do able, NO TESTS!!   Good teacher, liked what he was teaching.  Take his class if you can"
5330,2819,1.0,5.0,"not really though, his homeworks just suck. A LOT"
5331,2819,5.0,4.0,"He's a very good prof. He'll teach it and makes sure to ask if everyone understands; if you don't say you don't understand he'll assume you do. He tries to teach as well as possible. The book is helpful, but homeworks are quite hard. HE DIDN'T TEST US AT ALL. Grade based only on homework."
5332,2819,4.5,3.0,"Nice guy.  You need to go to lecture.  Homework isn't bad if you go to the help session he has.  Tests are pretty hard, but nothing unexpected.  The labs are easy."
5333,2819,4.0,3.0,Do not be a slacker.  Come to this class and take notes or you will be screwed for the final.  Reed es el Diablo.  Do not let him learn your name or it will be called in every lecture and every class you take with him.
5334,2819,4.0,4.0,"Challenging, but knows his stuff and is capable of explaining it.  You'll learn things without even realizing it."
5335,2819,3.0,4.0,"If you aren't a whiz at Mathcad, the homeworks are very hard.  Tests are pretty easy compared to the time on the homework.  Very tedious.  Makes it interesting."
5336,2819,3.5,5.0,"Reed will force-feed you more circuits in a semester than you can imagine.  His lectures are helpful and I'd recommend not missing any.  If anything, his bizarre personality will make lecture interesting.  I think that he likes to be remembered. Bad book!"
5337,2819,3.0,3.0,"He knows what he's doing, but canNOT teach. I strongly urge to NOT take this class at all. You must take ECE203 or ECE230 before taking this class in order to do well."

5339,2819,3.0,4.0,"The homeworks are impossible, tedious, and long. The textbook is completely useless. If you miss any of the classes, you're screwed."

5345,2820,4.5,4.0,"It's the first class that I ever finished auditing from the beginning to the end. Ruth has a very strong background between hardware and software, and she has experienced the whole process from using assembly language to C and she was like an electrical engineer who works in the CS. I'm confident about her knowledge between hardware and software."
5346,2820,4.5,4.0,"She explains very well, but is very strict with grades. (she actually gave me a D, although I got the average on the final and spent an average of 15 hours/weekly labs==&gt;had to retake it)"

5351,2820,5.0,3.0,"Had her for 216, then took 415 again with her. She is just fantastic. One of the best profs I've had at UVA. Even went out of her way to talk with me about grad school and research opportunities. I learned a lot in both classes I've taken with her. Very friendly and nice."
5352,2820,5.0,3.0,"She's the best CS professor in the department. Her lectures are clear, and she will help out any student who doesn't understand the material. Her assignments were fair in difficulty. The course material is pretty interesting and fun sometimes. She's a very friendly and knowledgeable professor too."
5353,2820,4.5,2.0,"Very intersting class. If you start on the labs BEFORE the night before, then you will be fine, I find the labs to be very helpful. Also, do the practice exams and you will do just fine on the real ones. Great class and teacher."
5354,2820,4.0,5.0,"My impression was that her lectures are good, but labs are bad. Labs are just plain too hard; a lot of the later ones are huge projects that most other classes would make long-term assignments (ie: greater than a month), but you have to do them in just a week for her class."
5355,2820,3.0,3.0,placed too much emphasis (grade-wise) on assembly programming
5356,2820,5.0,3.0,She is amazing! I learned SO much in her class! She really makes the material interesting and the labs and exams reflect exactly what was in the lecture. Later labs are longer and harder so be prepared! A GREAT professor! One of the best in CS!
5357,2820,4.0,3.0,Class could have been much worse.Tends to have you do things by hand on tests versus programming.No one does a post/pre/in order traversal or insertion of elements by hand on a tree.Covers data structures well and how to speed up algorithms using them.
5358,2820,4.0,2.0,"Better than other teachers I've had, but not exceptional. Organized lectures.  Boring labs. Helps to have some background in the material."
5359,2820,5.0,3.0,"Doesn't stand out in any one area, but is good all around."
5360,2820,2.5,3.0,"One of the better CS professors at UVA, but that's not saying a lot..."

5376,1944333,4.0,2.0,"Super nice and enjoyable overall. Don't know what problem the other person had with her, I found her extremely helpful, even if there was a lot of little homework assignmentsreading. All the drafting for essayspapers was annoying at the time but super useful later on, she really teaches you how to write a paper job Spanish. "
5377,60174,3.5,3.0,Professor Kriete is great. All of his lectures are very clear and concise and all tests are very straightforward. I highly recommend him.
5378,60174,5.0,4.0,Very good lectures and clear expectations.
5379,60174,3.5,4.0,Tests can be brutal.  You'll be find as long as you read the supplementary class notes.  His lectures are straight from the notes so you don't even have to pay attention in class.  Just print out the current unit and follow along in case you have questions.
5380,60174,3.5,5.0,"Some lectures were better than others. Exams were tough, rather unforgiving grading. Okay in office hours though."
5381,60174,5.0,3.0,"TK was an awesome teacher.  He made his lectures amazingly clear and organized and was always available to help.  The tests were fairly straight-forward, but this class takes a lot of outside work in order to do well.  Definitely take TK if you plan on taking Diff EQ!"
5382,60174,5.0,2.0,"This guy is simply amazing.  His lectures are stunningly clear and organized.  He makes himself avaiable and is exceptionally helpful on subject even outside of diff. eq.  The tests are ultimately fair.  For this class, however, the textbook is somewhat useless.  Later on he does many things not really covered in the book."
5383,60174,2.0,5.0,lectures are disorganized. sometimes his calm voice was putting me to sleep.
5384,60174,4.0,4.0,"Kriete is SO much better then some other professors teaching this class. He is really helpful and wants you to learn. And most importantly, the lectures MAKE SENSE!"
5385,60174,5.0,2.0,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Key to this class is not going thru blindly. Take time to understand what's happening, it does not take much difficulty/stress to comprehend everything. TK makes it easy but like every high level math class, it needs your utmost attention w/hw and lectures! TK is your best bet!!!"
5386,60174,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, when he explains something he goes all out and explain all kinds of theories behind it.  Tests are very clear."
5387,60174,4.5,2.0,"clear, helpful, makes what we are learning interesting  if you gotta take diffeq, get him"
5388,60174,2.5,5.0,"REALLY hard class, but he's very nice"
5389,60174,3.5,5.0,ruined my GPA forever...do not take 132 it is worth 4 credits and can ruin your entire GPA for the rest of college.
5390,60174,5.0,4.0,He's clear and actually speaks English.
5391,60174,3.5,5.0,"this is the hardest class ive ever taken... he's cool, but way over my head"
5392,60175,2.0,3.0,"Just a solid meh. Technically lectures are required, but I would usually skip and just get the info from discussion. Entire grade based on quizzes and tests, which are taken home paragraphs answering questions. Lectures were very hard to follow. Still finished with an A- minus though, so not too bad."
5393,60175,3.0,3.0,"Your grade depends entirely on your TA and their grading. You get graded on maybe 3 quizzes and a final paper, it's very hard to get an A with how some philosophy TAs grade. IMO take another philosophy class - this one is a snoozer with the exception of Socrates and Descartes, the class is very repetitive but prof is cool"
5394,60175,2.0,3.0,"A very disorganized course. The discussion section doesn't match the lectures at all. The Professor just rambles on. He spends way too much time on Descartes which results in us rushing through other philosophers. He barely gives any direction for class. Some people might enjoy his class, but not me."
5395,60175,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Secada is a super nice man. I took his class on medieval philosophy and it was really neat to learn about the history and the thinking back then. The lectures do require a bit of coffee but are super interesting. The reading is also a bit dense, but it's usually short enough that it's manageable."
5396,60175,3.5,2.0,"His lectures can be confusing, but its mostly because he tries to cover so much in such a sort amount of time. Bring coffeetea with you and open up your brain to new things. There are whole semester classes for what he tries to get through in 4-5 weeks. Overall, the TAs will help you if you're not into office hours, but he's a helpful nice guy. "
5397,60175,1.5,4.0,I attended almost every lecture but I have no idea why because there is absolutely no need  to go. I could never follow anything he was saying. The only reason I was bale to even know what was going on was from my discussion section. 
5398,60175,4.0,4.0,He's a very interesting guy and knows a lot about a variety of areas in philosophy.  He is considered one of the smartest professors on grounds.
5399,60175,1.0,3.0,Horribly organized class. No sense of what we're doing at any given time
5400,60175,1.0,4.0,Native Spanish speaker and often rambles; not really a good teacher overall; tries to go way more in depth in the intro class than he should; TAs often complained as well
5401,60175,1.0,4.0,Boring lectures. Boring material. No use of powerpoint (or equivalent) what so ever. About 50% dropped out after the first class. I was dumb enough to stay.
5402,60175,2.0,4.0,"Not a very gifted pedagogue.  I wasn't very interested in the primary texts at first, and I wasn't afterward."
5403,60175,3.0,2.0,"Secada clearly knows a lot about philosophy but he does not teach it well for an introductory class. I skipped lectures a lot and learned most of my information from discussion sections. The content of the course was worth it though. Don't be afraid of how he comes across the first lecture day, he makes the class seem much harder than it really is."
5404,60175,3.0,2.0,"Professor Secada is a very intelligent prof on philosophy, going to lectures is your best bet to do well, but ALSO have to learn to listen and write down notes. Do well by writing down notes, his ramblings are interesting tho. Gives you a good spectrum of philosophy and topics in it. Interesting, just listening and note-taking in class tho. Smart p"
5405,60175,2.5,4.0,He is difficult to follow during lecture.  He rambles often.  I only stuck with the class because of my TA Matt Tirrigan.
5406,60175,3.0,3.0,"Not a bad professor, but don't take unless you're really really into metaphysics and Descartes, Spinoza, and Liebniz. Reading the primary texts is not half as important as reading the secondary literature and going to lecture. You have to learn how to listen to him, but it's worth it to try."
5407,60175,2.0,2.0,"He's a rambler. Really smart though, but hard to follow. But, I think he knows it, so he makes up for it by making the tests easy."
5408,60175,2.0,3.0,"This man is brilliant, but let's say he's just on a different plane from the rest of us. Lectures usually ramble on and he takes sporadic attendance. It's not too important to come to class although I'm pretty sure he favors you during grading if he's seen you. You'll basically be guaranteed a B-/B just for breathing."
5409,60175,2.0,4.0,"His class is not very well structured, and I found it very difficult to follow along in lecture since they were almost never related to the assigned readings at the time.  If you love philosophy, go ahead, but not for someone who isnt in love  with it.  Also, &quot;The Ethics of Conquest&quot; is misleading.  The class is more about...well, i couldnt tell yo"
5410,60175,4.0,3.0,"bored me, but if youre interested in phil, not a bad class"
5411,1805072,3.5,2.0,Hard to understand sometimes but genuinely nice guy and gives out a lot of extra credit in the class. 
5412,1805072,1.0,5.0,Arguably the worst professor/teacher I have ever had. Completely incapable of relaying information clearly. Changed the grading policy in the middle of the semester. Avoid any class with him if you can.
5413,1805072,1.0,5.0,"Where do I start? His section is a mandatory 9am MWF for mechs and he gives pop quizzes. He randomly calls on students in class, changes the course grading policy every week (eg he put in clickers half way through the semester), and he is hands down the worst lecturer I have ever has the displeasure of learning from."
5414,60176,4.0,3.0,"Professor Hunter made this class interesting. His style of lecture is easy to take notes on. One key thing about the class is how important the lectures actually are. Tests are straight from lecture rather than the readings. The textbook for the class was not helpful, The readings would have been extremely tedious and time consuming."
5415,60176,3.5,3.0,"The only readings you need are from the book of compiled articles, not the textbook. My TA wasn't a super easy grader but if you take good notes and just repeat everything you're told you'll do fine. It's a great class that opens your eyes to the ways of the world. Take it is you get a chance, Hunter is really great :)"
5416,60176,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hunter has been one of the best professors I've met in UVA. His lectures are really good because he puts the material in an interesting way and explains it clearly. I see the world differently after taking this class, as cheesy as that sounds... TAKE THIS CLASS"
5417,60176,5.0,1.0,"Even though professor hunter is my father, I actually really enjoyed his class and thought it was one of the most relevant classes I've taken at U.Va."
5418,60176,4.0,1.0,He was exactly what I would expect from an introductory level professor. He gave a lot of insight during lectures but if you skipped class it wasn't the end of the world. I would definitely recommend taking this class
5419,60176,4.5,3.0,"Make sure you go to lecture! His entire tests are straight off lecture, and his multiple choice likes to make you think.  He is a great lecturer and really engaged you in the topic. He is also very easy going and funny.  I definitely recommend it."
5420,60176,4.5,3.0,"Professor Hunter is amazing, he knows what he is talking about and teaches it very clearly. He is able to captivate his audience in a way that you don't feel time passing by. Make sure to go to every class and take notes all the exams are based on his lectures."
5421,60176,4.5,1.0,"Professor Hunter is great!  All exam material will be right off his lectures, so attending class and taking clear notes is mandatory.  I thoroughly enjoyed this class."
5422,60176,4.0,3.0,"If you are taking Hunter's SOC101 class, the most important thing to succeed is to go to his lectures and take good notes.  His tests are long and will take the entire amount of allotted time, but you can do well if you study the notes A LOT.  Also, grade depends a lot on TA, and mine was not so nice.  There is 1 3-5 paper, and it's not bad at all."
5423,60176,5.0,3.0,"If you can get into this class, take it. Professor Hunter is hilarious, helpful and knows his stuff. He is very well respected in the sociological world and for good reason. Very available for office hours and loves to answer any questions about sociology, life, whatever."
5424,60176,2.5,2.0,"Hunter is a great speaker, hands down, but I just hate the subject. Easy class, since the subject is common sense, but exams are pretty long. Grades depend heavily on your TA."
5425,60176,4.0,2.0,"The only class at UVA that I have gotten an A+.  That said, I attended every class and studied long and hard for tests.  If you do this, you will get a good grade, but if you don't, you won't.  It's that simple.  The class contained more abstract concepts than I'd thought, but I would take the class if I were you.  Good guy, good prof."
5426,60176,4.5,2.0,"the man&#63; I don't think there's much more to say...probably the most approachable prof at uva, very kind, very enlightening.."
5427,60176,5.0,1.0,This was my favorite class my first semester.  Every lecture is amazing and makes you want to come-and do because most of the material for the LENGTHY tests is discussed in lecture. Not difficult...Also cancels class occassionally:)
5428,60176,4.5,2.0,"Overall a great class. His lectures are interesting and relevant.  It's a great introductory class to sociology and not hard at all.  However, this class is not a joke, you'll need to take notes every class and study for the tests, which can be long."
5429,60176,4.5,2.0,"Hunter's lectures are epic.  They leave you feeling enlighted on the human condition.  This class tied in to all of my classes, none of which were blatantly related to sociology.  This was my favorite class my first semester, I highly recommend it."
5430,60176,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed every single lecture. Hunter did a good job in telling the grand narrative of sociology. Overall, it is a very worthwhile class. It made me to consider minoring/majoring in soc. Just a note, this is not an easy intro class."
5431,60176,4.5,3.0,He was very clear
5432,60176,2.5,3.0,"The topics are interesting but Prof. Hunter teaches in a very &quot;preachy&quot; manner, it sounds as though he is reading off an essay he wrote years ago. It's hard to sit through his lectures when he constantly repeats himself in every way possible. Discussions are good if you find the right TA"
5433,60176,3.0,2.0,No Comments
5434,60176,4.5,2.0,"great class, interesting lectures on interesting topics"
5435,2632469,5.0,2.0,"This is one of the best professors Ive ever had! She is extremely caring and allows for at least 1 week after the due date has passed to submit work (for few points deducted). All assignment modules explain everything perfect, making the work easy to complete. Take her!!"
5436,2624294,3.0,5.0,The class was very reading heavy up until the last quarter of the semester and some of the papers were 30-40 pages long while others were shorter. You have to be prepared to put effort into EVERY assignment and there are no &quot;freebies&quot; or easy As in this class.
5437,1895210,2.5,2.0,"The class is called ""Major British Authors,"" but it really looks at corresponding movements in art and literature. Mapp is a bit scatterbrained and we were constantly a day or so behind on lectures, but she is really very intelligent and accepting of ideas. She knows and loves her stuff."
5438,1477421,4.0,2.0,Sage is so great! She really made class interesting and went above and beyond to help students out. She even offered to write my recommendation for study abroad!
5439,1477421,5.0,2.0,Sage is a really great teacher. I was not a huge French language fan going in but this class is really fun. I have done better this year then I have ever done in French. Take this class with Sage!
5440,1477421,5.0,2.0,"Sage is awesome. For an accelerated intro French course, I was a bit hesitant, but its not bad at all. Highly recommend."
5441,1485667,4.5,2.0,"Beth is very nice and gives good feedback on essays.  Lectures can be kind of boring, especially since they don't matter very much (since the 3 papers make up the bulk of the class).  It is hard to get an A, since you would need an A on at least two of the papers, which is hard for any English class.  We didn't use a textbook, just online readings."
5442,1485667,5.0,2.0,Beth is awesome! She is the most laid back TA ever - but she still manages to teach beautifully. TAKE HER IF YOU GET THE CHANCE - I took a Jesus of Nazareth ENWR (which i didnt initially want to take/have any clue about) and she made it AMAZING and i actually learned a great deal. Very fair and very pretty! Favorite TA/prof
5443,1485667,5.0,2.0,I loved her! She is TA and extremely enthusiastic about her job.  This was my favorite class this semester.  We had to write four essays varying in length and over the entire semester review three of them.  The readings she assigns were interesting and short.  TAKE THIS CLASS&gt;
5444,1485667,5.0,2.0,"TA for the discussion section. A brilliant person, and cares so much about her students...if you show that you're trying hard, she'll help keep your grade high. Such a caring person, always more that helpful, and always has insightful things to say. Very down to earth and quirky. Loved her, one of the best TAs I'd ever had!"
5445,912229,5.0,2.0,"Professor Heins is passionate and knowledgeable about her field, and Tulane is lucky to have her as a visiting professor. The readings, screenings, and assignments were never too burdensome, and she has always been helpful, available for office hours, etc. I also really like her accent - somewhere between American and German."
5446,912229,5.0,2.0,"This was my favorite class of the semester! I love her implicit support of socialism, it's so refreshing! She's an awesomely smart individual, she shows excellent (complex) movies then decodes them during the next class. She was helpful, and the class is set up such that if you show up and put fourth some effort you'll do well. TAKE HER CLASS!"
5447,912229,4.5,2.0,"She is an awesome professor! Some people find her a little bit dry, but she is so intelligent that it doesn't really matter. There aren't a lot of readings and she isn't hard when grading. Overall great classes. And she's hot!"
5448,912229,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite professors, which is why I have taken three classes with her. She is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about course material, but she does not necessarily expect everyone in class to be. She is a bit dry, but very easy to approach and welcomes questions or individual clarification. Awesome professor and class."
5449,912229,4.0,2.0,"Easy class, but you have to go to do well. Lectures are pretty boring because she just lectures the whole class. Nice lady though, and really knows the course material"
5450,912229,5.0,1.0,Great professor who cares about the material and is very intelligent!
5451,912229,5.0,2.0,very interesting class and she knows her stuff. small amount of reading for each class
5452,2411378,1.0,5.0,This is your worst nightmare. She is very restless and very unorganized. She loves to critic and so times the critic she give you today may be changed by her tomorrow. Very minimal coherence and consistency in her critic on projects.
5453,748416,1.5,4.0,This Teacher Sucks. She actually treatS global like an 400 level course. There is a lot of writing that is just busy work and she grades really hard. Be prepared to attend the most boring class ever. I didn't even want to be in this class they switched out my teacher with her the last second. DO NOT TKAE THIS CLASS.
5454,748416,4.5,3.0,"Cool professor. She can be a tad vague at times, but she is a real sweetheart. She gets very deep into her thoughts, and she is just an overall great person."
5455,748416,2.5,5.0,"a bad experience. not a good class, try something else.  paper topics are really obscure and its hard to come up with anything for them.  I dont think she is a real prof...&#63;"
5456,748416,3.5,4.0,"science and identity - horrible, horrible, avoid like the plague.  Class was BORING.  I wanted to die every t/r by 10. watched the clock. the worst class i have taken at uva.  NOT ur typical english class - no literry analysis just random bs about early photography, phrenolgy, etc in novels. grades stuff hard to top it all off."
5457,830344,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher, really caring and inspirational"
5458,830344,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I've had at UVA. Very friendly and engaging. Cares more about lively discussion than the assignments. 
5459,830344,5.0,2.0,This class was overall really effective. The guest lectures were engaging and interesting. Prof. Sheras lets you know what he is looking for and how it will be graded.
5460,830344,4.5,2.0,"Loved this class.  His guest lecturers were amazing, and you learn a lot that can be applied to the classroom."
5461,2370441,2.0,4.0,WAY too much reading. It's like she assumes everybody in her class only has her class.
5462,2370441,5.0,3.0,"Professor Buckelew is one of my favorite professors at the university. I've taken intro, a 3000-level course, and this class with her. Her approach (grading method, amount of assignments) is different depending on the course level, but she is always clear about her expectations. Reading is necessary but I always found the topics interesting."
5463,2370441,1.0,4.0,"She assigns gigantic readings and poorly summarizes them in lecture slides which she doesn't even post online. She was also rude and when I had a problem with my TA, she refused to hear me out and took the TA's side. I had to take it up the ladder to obtain an apology from her afterward. Overall, she's an awful person who I hope I never meet again."
5464,2370441,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors at UVA and am planning on taking another class with her. She's flexible, available out of class and so encouraging to help you grow as a student. She's great. It's not an easy A, but did you really come to UVA for an easy A without it helping you grow at all? Take her class!"
5465,2370441,5.0,4.0,"Professor Buckelew is brilliant. I've never felt myself grow intellectually as I did during and especially by the end of her course. She fostered such a healthy and fun learning environment each day. Not a harsh grader at all, people are just sensitive. Her feedback is constructive and improves you as a writer and thinker. Sooo thankful for her."
5466,2370441,5.0,3.0,"I love Prof. Buckelew! A lot fo these reviews say she's a hard grader or whatever, but for an intro class, there's always going to be a lot of material covered. Don't let that discourage you from taking her class, she's amazing and I assume that any class with her will be extremely educational."
5467,2370441,2.0,4.0,i think this course was harder than it should have been especially for a intro level course. There's so much information to cover with no review guides for exam 1 or 2 with an exception with final exam. if this class was not a requirement towards a Soc major i would i highly encourage you not to enroll in it. I hope this helps.
5468,2370441,1.0,4.0,"I did all the readings, participated in discussion, and went to lecture and still ended up with a B. Her exams are unpredictable and I would not recommend taking this course to study for the MCAT. It should be a Women and Gender Studies course, and not a sociology one."
5469,2370441,1.0,5.0,she makes things harder that they have to be. she assigns lots of time consuming readings. she doesnt help you prepare for the difficult tests which which make up your entire grade for the class.
5470,2370441,1.0,5.0,Too much reading and hard exams.
5471,2370441,2.0,5.0,"Professor Buckelew does some things very well. Elaborates on readings and cares about her students. However, her grading criteria on the papers (25% of class grades) is very very unclear. All she tells you is that they'll cover materials the class has covered, but she does give you a cheat sheet of your own work. Work extremely hard for the grades"
5472,846734,5.0,1.0,Professor Zhigilei was one of the best professors I've had at UVA thus far. He is very caring and considerate towards his students and makes concepts/course content easy and clear to understand. He's also extremely approachable and just an overall delight.
5473,846734,4.5,2.0,Great professor. Little to no textbook use. Presents the necessary information in a Power Point format. Textbook (Porter/Eastrling) is useful and provides greater detail on the subject.
5474,846734,4.5,1.0,"Prof Zhigilei is great.  The subject material of the class is a tad dry but he explains it as best you can.  If you attend lecture, read the book , and do the homework, the class is a piece of cake.  He has an accent that is a little hard to understand at first but you  get used to it."
5475,846734,5.0,1.0,Great teacher and fun to work with
5476,928659,4.0,3.0,"I was disappointed in the class, but not because of Professor Chevalier. His own enjoyment of the subject was evident in his teaching and conversations with students outside of class. The lectures were interesting, and covered all the material needed to do well. Homework was not common, but enjoyable, and I actually wish that he had assigned more."
5477,928659,4.0,3.0,"Chevalier is an interesting guy and the course material was really exciting. I would absolutely take this class again. He often talks about his own travels to various archaeological sites around the world. Just pay attention in lectures, and there are no worries."
5478,928659,2.5,4.0,"The class sounded really interesting but it was ridiculously dull.  Chevalier mispronounces things all the time, mumbles some, doesn't make too much sense, etc.  He's really smart though, but you don't want an Astrophysicist teaching ARCHAEOastronomy.  Study hard for tests and make a friend in your class."
5479,928659,1.5,4.0,"Boring lectures. Extremely rude and unhelpful when I went to see him in office hours after being sick. Practically laughed at me for being behind. Did all the reading, took tons of notes, and still clueless about where he got some of the test material. Lectures will make you fall asleep."
5480,928659,4.0,3.0,"Really cool guy, gets the material better than most professors, talks about his son and cats all of the time which can be entertaining.  I don't know where the whole smoking hot reputation comes from, his son is really hot, but I guess he's just not my type.  I'll still give him a pepper though LOL."
5481,928659,3.5,3.0,No Comments
5482,928659,2.0,3.0,"The subject is interesting in theory, and you will probably end up doing well in the end, but I would not recommend taking this class unless you enjoy being bored out of your skull in lecture and looking at pictures from 30 years ago."
5483,347033,1.0,1.0,Terrible teacher. Has done problems incorrectly multiple times and has had to be corrected by students over and over again. He does not have a good grasp on the probability he is teaching. Also tests on things like definitions as opposed to making you apply the definitions to problems. Overall terrible class if you are interested in learning prob
5484,347033,4.5,5.0,Very good at teaching
5485,347033,5.0,1.0,"Nice and cheerful guy. The class is well structure. I just read the slides, did a ton of practice quizzes, and read the book if I didn't understand something, and I got an A. Really useful information too ? I learned a lot."
5486,347033,4.5,1.0,He's very clear and straightforward. This is by far the easiest and least demanding 4 credit course I have taken.
5487,347033,4.0,3.0,"If you're enrolled in this course, it's likely not by choice. Given the pre-requitory nature of this class, most want to sail through as seemlessly as possible, and Holt is certainly the professor with which to do it. Attending lecture is completely optional, grading is fair (if not forgiving) and exams are very manageable if you put in the effort."
5488,347033,4.0,3.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Holt is a nice guy but doesn't teach you anything. the quizzes and homeworks are easy because you can use excel but you get screwed over on the midterm and final because you can't have a computer.
5489,347033,3.5,2.0,"While he is enthusiastic and willing to help, He lectures once a week and reads directly off of slides. HW and quizzes are taken thru webwork. Quizzes are randomized. There is no common midterm and all you learn is how to plug stuff in to formulas into excel, which dooms you in the end when you can't use excel for the paper and pencil final exam."
5490,347033,5.0,3.0,"Though I don't agree with the logistics of the STAT 212 classes (randomized quiz questions, WebWorks), you couldn't have a better prof than Holt. Always enthusiastic, very lenient and understanding, has weekly help sessions, gets you through as painlessly as possible."
5491,347033,4.5,2.0,"Jeff Holt has a love for statistics that becomes obvious in his enthusiastic teaching and willingness to help his students in and out of class.  He lectures once a week and leaves the other class period open for homework questions.  I don't love math, but I enjoyed going to Holt's lectures. Make sure you get Holt!!"
5492,347033,4.0,2.0,I enjoyed his class.  It was definitely an easy class and you have to try to fail.  Attending class and lectures were mandatory.  Lectures were basically a time to ask allll of your homework questions.  So basically we'd ask the T.A. every hard question assigned to us.  This class was pretty interesting and very easy. Go for it :)
5493,347033,4.0,2.0,"I loved Holt! He was smart, funny, enthusiastic, and very down to earth, and always so peppy!  Those who complained about the grading in this class were probably ones who didn't take a little time to do practice quizzes. His one-lecture-a-week routine was brilliant, and this class is easy if you're careful with your work."
5494,347033,5.0,1.0,"One of the easiest classes I've ever taken at the University. I personally liked the weekly online quizzes because if you take enough practice ones, you're sure to ace the graded ones.  If you have trouble with the hw you can go to class and he'll basically give you the answer. Holt is extremely friendly and helpful."
5495,347033,3.0,3.0,he seems like a very nice guy offhand but really wants to stick to him being correct and you being wrong. his class gives no partial credit and quizs are heavily weighted. i would take another professor if i could do it over again.
5496,347033,5.0,2.0,"one of the best profs at uva by far. contrary to others' comments, i thought he did a great job teaching...i learned a lot and had fun doing so."
5497,347033,2.5,3.0,"the material is not difficult(basically plugging numbers into excel), but the grading is harsh-no partial credit, getting one out of five wrong on the weekly quizzes means you're stuck at best with a B since quizzes are so heavily weighed. there're no curve to compensate."
5498,347033,3.0,4.0,"A terrible class.  Definitely take another professor if you can.  He tried to cram all his lecture material into one day a week, which means you don't know how to do half of the homework.  He was a nice guy, but i hated this class."
5499,347033,2.0,3.0,"this class should be retitled &quot;we don't teach stat, we teach how to use excel in a statistical manner.&quot; i understand nothing, i just know how to click and enter numbers into excel. an AWFUL class. take the other teacher if you can. he acts nice, but does no real teaching or grading b/c it's all on webwork which means NO partial credit, even on exam"
5500,347033,4.5,2.0,"He's very nice, and very helpful, even if you feel like an idiot walking into class, he makes you feel otherwise. The lectures aren't that great, though I have a feeling that our computers really distracted us. The labs are easy and simple, and tests are about average. Do the practice problems on the tests, they help a lot."
5501,347033,4.0,3.0,"He's the nicest guy i've had as a teacher. He takes the time to answer your questions and cares to make you really understand, not just to answer because he feels obligated. He's awesome..makes things easier."
5502,347033,5.0,2.0,Truly the nicest professor I've ever met.  Genuinely cares about his students and wants them to do well. Awesome teacher.
5503,347033,5.0,3.0,He is the nicest guy and his class is not hard if you put forth some effort. He has very clear notes and actually makes linear algebra interesting. He's hot too!
5504,347033,5.0,2.0,"Professor Holt is the best APMA professor. His lectures are very clear, he is very organized, and he explains the material extremely well that any student at any level can understand. He is very helpful and really does care about how his students perform in the class. I give him an A+. :)"
5505,347033,5.0,3.0,"Professor Holt is one of the best professors that I have had for math here at UVa next to Michael Palmer.  If linear algebra is offered with Holt, take his section as opposed to the other sections.  He made everything very clear.  Tests are easy too ;-)"
5506,347033,5.0,3.0,"great professor, get him if you can"
5507,347033,3.5,3.0,I tried taking Linear Algebra before but had to drop it because my other professor was not helpful in the least. Professor Holt on the other hand makes the class somewhat painless and is willing to answer any questions you may have. If you absolutely must take Linear Algebra take it with Holt!
5508,347033,5.0,3.0,"What a great guy, get him if you can."
5509,347033,5.0,3.0,"Very good math professor.  Clear, well-organized lectures, and class time and notes are actually valuable.  Very enthusiastic and a pleaseant guy."
5510,347033,4.5,3.0,You want this guy as your professor.
5511,347033,5.0,3.0,"I must say, Im not the biggest fan of this class. However, Prof. Holt makes it easier to endure. It's a long hour and 15 min but without Prof. Holt it could feel a lot more painful."
5512,347033,5.0,2.0,"I love this guy!  He's energetic, funny, laid-back, kind, and very approachable.  Not hard to get a good grade with a moderate amount of effort."
5513,347033,5.0,2.0,"Linear Algebra isn't the most interesting subject, but Prof. Holt keeps things lively and presents the material very well. He has the kind of personality that makes him very approachable, and is completely willing to answer your questions."
5514,347033,5.0,2.0,"the course material gets boring at times, but prof. holt always manages to inject a whole lot of positive energy and happiness into his lectures. kudos to him for effort and i must say being in his class is definitely a pleasant experience!"
5515,347033,5.0,3.0,"Very clear teacher with linear algebra. Very charasmatic guy, and his notes are complete. Class is not hard, but not easy either."
5516,2591652,4.0,3.0,"Ferguson is chair of the department and a very cool guy. He knows so much about French history and loves to talk about it. Grade in this class comes from 2 exams, 2 papers, and 2 presentations. He does not give high grades generally, so you will have to really work for it. Exams are not hard though. Very nice in office hours. Readings r reasonable."
5517,928679,5.0,1.0,"Awesome, nice, lenient, hot."
5518,928679,5.0,2.0,"Best Classics TA you'll find at UVa. Pray you're lucky enough to take Latin or Greek with Rachel. Smart, fun, and interesting - made my Latin class wonderful."
5519,928679,5.0,1.0,"Very easy and nice. Helpful. Clear. Makes class enjoyable. If you have to take this class, definitely get Rachel."
5520,928679,5.0,2.0,She is awesome!!!! I loved having her as my TA!!!! Def take a class with her she is the BEST! She really helped me like latin more!
5521,928679,5.0,1.0,"Rachel was the best Latin TA I've had at UVA.  She was always extremely friendly and helpful, and she made Latin so much more enjoyable than before.  Definitely take a class with her if you get the chance!"
5522,928679,4.5,1.0,Rachel is a great TA. Very helpful and very friendly in class. She makes everyone feel welcome and is very approachable outside of lecture. Definitely get into a section with her. Best Latin TA I've had thus far.
5523,928679,4.0,1.0,"Rachel was a FANTASTIC teacher. She was the most understanding and approachable TA I've had, thus far, at UVa and she was always willing to help you out with whatever you needed. If at all possible, take Rachel's section without a doubt."
5524,928679,5.0,3.0,Such a great professor! Very approachable and helpful during office hours. Really nice person.  All of her exams are fair as well.
5525,928679,5.0,3.0,Rachel is a great TA! She is very knowledgeable and explains everything clearly. She is also very friendly and cute!
5526,928679,5.0,3.0,"Oh my god; she is gorgeous: just this side of slinky, in a way that makes you want to cry (with happiness). And really really nice. Mikalson is a bore. I mostly go to class for Rachel. Smart too. Some days she blushes. I love her. I think I should major in Greek (not; but it would almost be worth it)."
5527,1412024,4.0,1.0,"Easy A, definitely. Skipped most lectures, but attended all recitations. She's helpful when you want to discuss something or have questions. Subject matter isn't too interesting. Very long reading assignments, but you can get away with not doing them (trust me). "
5528,1412024,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Bonilla was wonderful! She was always cheerful and always tried to get the students to participate. She never discounted anyone's opinions even if she disagreed with them and basically, was just fun to be around. It was a nice break from the typical classroom setting of professor droning on while the students sleep or are on facebook."
5529,1412024,2.0,1.0,"Useless prof... does not prepare classes and was constantly late to lectures! It was a very easy class to get a good grade... But her level of engagement and interest in teaching the course was inexistent. If you want a good grade, take the course. If you want to learn something about anthropology, you will not get it from her."
5530,1412024,4.5,1.0,"Interesting class about the Caribbean. Reading is a bit dense and weekly posts are annoying, but it's to work on key points and bounce off other people's ideas. TONS of extra credit, attendance mandatory, helpful office hours, TONS OF EXTRA CREDIT. great class (BUT it only meets once a week for 2.5 hours so be prepared)"
5531,289723,2.0,4.0,"While Professor Acton is a nice guy, the class is a joke. What he teaches out of his modules never shows how it really relates to labs and what's on the test. The grader's for this class are tough too. You either got all points or lost 6, no partial credit. You always want to attend the class before the test, always. But not an amazing class, sad."
5532,289723,4.5,4.0,"Acton is a great professor, would recommend to any student."
5533,289723,4.5,3.0,"Prof Acton is great! Sometimes lectures will feel disconnected, but just ask him or the TAs for clarification, and you'll be good. If you hated signals and systems, DSP is a good chance to actually learn all the material you should have gotten out of S&S, and then some. If you turn in all the assignments, you are almost guaranteed at least a ""B""."
5534,289723,2.5,5.0,"The classwork, homework, and tests were all disconnected. They all covered different material, and the professor just made his TAs do all the work."
5535,289723,3.5,5.0,Love him!!
5536,289723,4.0,2.0,Acton was awesome.  He covers a wide range of material and weaves hilarious stories and comments in the whole way through.  He is the reason I became an electrical engineer.  Plus the bow ties are hot
5537,289723,3.5,2.0,No Comments
5538,289723,4.5,2.0,"The class is fairly easy, but I still learned a lot of new information from it.  Acton is a fun guy who seems to enjoy teaching.  In the class you will learn many interesting things about technology we use every day."
5539,289723,4.5,2.0,"Acton's an awesome professor & a nice guy. Enthusiastic, hilarious and very helpful. Do your hw, go to class and you'll be fine. Office hrs help a lot. Class was almost two hours, but Acton did a good job of keeping it interesting although he moves around a lot when he lectures. Acton is one of the professors who makes you want to stay in e-school!"
5540,289723,4.5,1.0,"Acton is hilarious. Rambles, but makes it as fun as it can be. For 2nd yr eschooler it was easy as anything too. Wish I'd taken it first year, has lots of useful content. Best 'science' elective ever!"
5541,289723,4.0,2.0,"Acton is awesome.  He's funny and very entertaining, and also cares about class and the students.  Some of the material is boring at times, but it's e-school so what do you expect... I recommend this class because Acton is a cool guy."
5542,289723,5.0,2.0,"Animated, and happy to be teaching. He taught from his own book (xerox's of the notes), so you could just pay attention in class and be fine. ECE 200 was an easy class, and I actually stopped showing up halfway through the semester despite it being my favorite class (too early for me...)"
5543,289723,5.0,1.0,He is funny and the class is easy and relaxing.  He always starts the class with music.  Even bought us bagels and coffee to enjoy in class once.
5544,289723,4.5,2.0,He's a good professor.  The class is pretty easy.
5545,289723,5.0,3.0,Great professor.  He's funny and keeps the class interesting.  Material's pretty interesting too.Plus he wears a bowtie!
5546,289723,4.5,3.0,"Man this guy is cool.  But for shizzle, ECE 200 is whack.  Stay the hell away cuz you'll just come out scratching your noggin.  But yeah, he's a good teacher.  It's just that what he teaches is some bullll shiet.  Try to catch him in another ECE class."
5547,289723,5.0,3.0,great teacher...really cares about his students and attempts to make everything as interesting as possible
5548,289723,5.0,3.0,"a very interesting teacher, very funny ,and you will learn a lot.definitly take that class"
5549,289723,5.0,3.0,"Funny, very interesting, lets you take cheat sheets to tests, which makes sense, because in the real world you'll have reference books when you're tackling a problem. Also, course material is very practical."

5551,289723,5.0,3.0,"Great guy, good class, interesting material."
5552,289723,5.0,3.0,A very easy to understand professor who loves to teach.  Take his class.
5553,1043393,5.0,4.0,"Professor Vaman gave a fascinating lecture in String Theory.  It was at an easy pace, and the lectures were coherent and informative.  She's very knowledgeable of the subject matter and clearly loves the subject.  I would recommend Professor Vaman to anyone."
5554,1043393,5.0,4.0,"Professor Vaman is an exceptional lecturer.  She can be fast, but her lectures are coherent and easy to understand.  She encourages students to visit her during her office hours.  She's eager to help her students.  She does believe in the dictum that practice makes perfect.  Her homework problems are not impossible, but can be time consuming."
5555,1043393,5.0,4.0,Amazing teacher
5556,1043393,5.0,4.0,"Possibly the best teacher i've ever had. She moves very fast through the course but she is extremely clear. She used about a dozen textbooks, but they are all in the library if needed."
5557,1043393,5.0,4.0,"Possibly the best teacher i've ever had. She moves very fast through the course but is extremely clear. She used about a dozen textbooks, but they are all in the library if needed."
5558,1043393,4.5,2.0,"Great professor who always finds time to answer your questions and talk to you. Class does go by fast, but read the book beforehand and it's not bad."
5559,1043393,1.5,4.0,"Diana Vaman is probably the least helpful teacher I've had at UVA.  She obviously knows what she's talking about, but she is really bad at communicating to her students.  She is really condescending to her students when they ask questions in class.  Not recommended at all."
5560,1043393,1.5,4.0,No Comments
5561,2198471,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed this class and the case studies. The reading requirements were normal for this type of commercial law. Assignment were very reasonable. Make sure team members in group projects are active participants. Attend class, come  ready to discuss reading assignments, be an active collaborator, and post regularly to weekly forums."
5562,1084360,5.0,2.0,I have had Kate as a TA three times.  She is great!
5563,1084360,5.0,4.0,She was very helpful in discussion and very enthusiastic. Fair on participation grading but grades tough on essays and exams. Great TA though.
5564,1084360,5.0,4.0,"Best T.A. I have ever had. I really mean it. She was great, she made the concepts A LOT easier to understand. Definitely extremely helpful, she really just wants students to do well."
5565,895956,1.0,5.0,her tests are extremely difficult
5566,895956,1.5,5.0,"This man is extremely kind and he seems to care, but honestly I don't see why he has such amazing reviews. His lectures are not helpful and unclear. He speaks at a lightning pace.I would choose to skip class everyday almost except there are clicker questions that count as part of your grade, therefore, I attend."
5567,895956,4.5,1.0,This class was pretty easy and Prof Liyanage had some great demonstrations to go with his lecture. He also posts all his notes online (and they're up on or the day after that lecture). The homework problems given as well as the examples from class help prepare you for his exams (there were only 2 plus a take home final).
5568,895956,4.0,2.0,"Very smart teacher and class does not require much effort - just be sure to turn in your homework problems and do them well. There are 2 papers due, the first is pretty easy, work hard on the second one (due during finals) - it's not impossible."
5569,895956,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING teacher. I have never had a more helpful and caring teacher in all of undergrad. He is very approachable, always willing to help, and his lectures are very clear."
5570,895956,4.5,1.0,good teacher
5571,895956,4.5,5.0,"Physics is a hard subject, but Liyanage is very good at explaining the material and I think he makes it as comprehensible as it can be.  He has fun demonstrations, which are nice breaks and are helpful to understanding the concepts.  He is nice, devoted to the subject, and is very helpful during his office hours.  Good teacher."
5572,895956,4.5,3.0,Liyanage is a great professor and really does everything he possibly can to keep physics interesting and help you understand it.....His demonstrations are the best!
5573,895956,5.0,3.0,"I hate how this class was run. It's basically skimming over a bunch of random topics (beware the &quot;intro&quot; classes). And the curve is a nerve racking experience. BUT in terms of having the most painless experience, Liyanage is certainly the way to go. He's a great lecturer, even for the pace of the course, and he's very approachable in the office."
5574,895956,4.0,5.0,"Good professor - does interesting demonstrations and tries to keep things interesting.  Also very cute and funny.  Has an accent but you'll get used to it after a few classes.  The exams are very very hard, though, but Professor Liyanage seemed willing to help out."
5575,895956,3.5,3.0,"He is the better of the two professors. Reasoning: better lecturer, performs experiments in class, he's funny/cute. Just pay attention in class, and make sure your equation sheet for tests is filled. He talks kinda funny though"
5576,895956,4.0,4.0,"This man is a great teacher. Its hard, but its physics and he can mostly turn it into something understanable. There are clicker questions (so you have to go to class) and a weekly discussion with a quiz and weekly homework. If you can deal with this is isnt a bad class and a bad prof. Way better than louca (the other teacher)."
5577,895956,5.0,5.0,"Cool teacher. a little bit of accent but very funny man. Very good with demonstration and engaging lectures. Absolutely helpful and I actually learned something. As long as you follow his lectures, you can learn physics like you have never learnt before.Definitely first recommendation!!!"
5578,895956,5.0,3.0,entertaining and good lecturer!
5579,1420248,4.0,2.0,"Lectures can be a little boring, he speaks at a very low volume so sit towards the front. The content was clear and easy as were the essay assignments. He is very helpful in and out of the classroom. He is very knowledgeable about French and is always willing to answer questions. "
5580,1420248,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lyons is very helpful and straightforward. He obviously cares that his students process and understand the material on their own but is always willing to help if you fall behind. Highly recommend.
5581,2755545,5.0,3.0,"I loved FREN1020 with Katia, shes really attentive and understanding, her exams arent too hard if you study, and homework is on VHL which pretty much guarantees a good homework grade if you put forth effort. Very transparent about assignments and not judgmental, which was nice for an elementary level course. Highly recommend Katia."
5582,1854426,4.0,3.0,"I had her for Business Spanish, and she really is an amazing person, but the workload for the class is kind of crazy. You always have to be on top of things because deadlines are almost always back-to-back. This class consists of a lot of projects and group work, but she is always there to help and if you like business, then def take the class!"
5583,1854426,4.5,3.0,Lot of hw. Pretty easy A-. It's really tough to get an A
5584,1854426,3.0,2.0,"She gives a lot of unnecessary homework and makes everyone do blog posts for every reading through Collab. This class is more about culture than it is about grammar. When we do grammar, though, it's very easy. I would have liked to take this class with a different professor. She a very nice person, but my Spanish didn't improve."
5585,1854426,5.0,2.0,"POVEDA IS AMAZING. She is engaging and helpful, really eager to help her students but also wants them to learn how to write better and how to understand deeper topics (biculturalism, identity, immigration) better. Her use of vosotros is a bit off-putting at first but it's not difficult to get used to."
5586,2722780,3.0,4.0,"This whole class is a group project, so depending on who you're with (and what time you have to take it), your own experience may vary. Bill Pearson is a pretty light-hearted guy with an impressive background, and he knows his stuff. However, this is an Engagements class, and he teaches it like a high level Biology class at times, so be warned."
5587,1477597,5.0,2.0,"Best TA in the UVA econ department. She is fair with grades, tests what she teaches, and makes clear all expectations. Take her instead of Prof Elzinga"
5588,1477597,5.0,2.0,"Ms Demperio is the best TA available in the UVA Econ Department. She is (1) fair with grades, (2) tests what she teaches, and (3) not big on the memorization of economics factoids. Highly recommended."
5589,1477597,4.0,3.0,Good Class. pretty interesting examples
5590,1477597,4.0,2.0,Professor Demperio definitely takes the time to prep the material. She doesn?t just teach from the book and finds some pretty good/cool examples to keep it interesting.
5591,2722783,3.0,4.0,"He talked so much during class. It wasnt even lecture, just him asking us questions about the readings and expecting us to give profound answers. It gave me so much anxiety to speak in that class."
5592,2722783,3.0,3.0,"Isaac Reed is indeed a Professory of Sociology. If you've taken a SOC course before, you probably know what to expect, so if you like that kind of professor, you'll like Prof. Reed. Personally, I liked him, and I'm glad he tried to let us meet in person despite the circumstance (distanced and masked of course). It's still the Engagements though."
5593,2354144,5.0,5.0,"She doesn't put up with dumb questions or people who aren't willing to put in the work. Definitely one of the harder chem courses here, but if you pay attention in class you won't have any issues."
5594,2354144,1.0,5.0,She does not care for her students and is an absolutely horrible professor. Your entire grade essentially consists of only exams and her exams do NOT align with her practice problems or homework at all. I took first semester with Samonina and I HIGHLY recommend taking both semesters with her instead if you can get into the section. Frantz sucks.
5595,2354144,4.0,3.0,"The class IS hard as reviews below say, but its as hard as any other stem class would be. If you practice, write notes before class AS PROF. FRANTS RECOMMENDS you will do just fine. She offers test corrections that gives up to 50% of missed points &amp; its hard NOT to get 100% on HW &amp; quizzes. If you arent willing to work hard, just do liberal arts."
5596,2354144,1.0,5.0,Do not recommend her at all.
5597,2354144,1.0,5.0,I have nothing good to say about Frantz. Her class was my worst experience at UVA. I cannot seem to justify the amount of work she assigns -there is just no good reason for it. This is supposed to be a weed out class and wow Frantz good at it. I'm convinced it's the only reason she still has a job here. If you like yourself don't take Orgo w Frantz
5598,2354144,1.0,5.0,Frantz does not care about her students well being. She treats students as if Orgo is their only class and makes the class as demanding as possible. Her class is a nightmare. It is a hard subject to begin with but she is no help. If you want a prof who cares about you and makes class possible look somewhere else bc you won't find that with Frantz.
5599,2354144,1.0,5.0,"Frantz is a horrible professor. Her tests her ridiculously hard, she does not spend time teaching difficult material and just blows over it like her students should already know it. She is not understanding about absences or grades. DO NOT TAKE HER ! Try samonina or chruma"
5600,2354144,5.0,4.0,This class is tough but Frantz uses an engaging curriculum that teaches students through examples and problems. She has a ton of TAs and everyone is always willing to help. Wiley plus (the textbook) can be super annoying but it does have good practice problems
5601,2354144,1.0,5.0,"Frantz is an okay professor at best. She gives a ridiculous amount of work that feels impossible to complete. Her tests are much more difficult than the other Orgo professors, and she is not very understanding of her students. She is the reason you will be doing work on Friday nights while your COMM major friends are out partying. Take Samonina!"
5602,2354144,5.0,4.0,She makes the best out of a hard situation
5603,2354144,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely loved Professor Frantz, probably the best teacher I've had at UVa. She is great at explaining complicated material and really pushes you to know your stuff. Be ready to work, but I can't recommend her highly enough. Also be sure to attend office hours when you can - she's really helpful there."
5604,2354144,4.0,4.0,"Orgo is hard, but Prof Frantz made it manageable and easy to understand. Her exams were difficult and the final was really something else, but this class was overall enjoyable. Don't be scared about this class, but get ready to work. Do the readings, do book problems, do test corrections, go to office hours (so helpful), and you will be fine!"
5605,2354144,5.0,4.0,"Frantz is one of the best professors I've had at UVA, her lectures are engaging, concise, and thorough and her class is extremely organized. Her tests are wicked but it's organic chem so I can't complain."
5606,2354144,4.0,5.0,"Orgo 2 is a lot harder than orgo 1, but Frantz made the final exam worth a lot more than last semester despite far lower exam averages. Lectures were solid but exams are very hard - start studying at least a week and a half in advance because you will need to. You will have to memorize reagents for at least 150 reactions. The textbook was useless."
5607,2354144,5.0,4.0,"Frantz is fantastic and made orgo a lot more manageable through her clear explanations of topics in lecture. Frantz herself is very easy to talk to and the TAs are good as well. Furthermore, Frantz's exams are difficult but you can get up to half your points back through test corrections. My one complaint is that the Top Hat book has many errors."
5608,2354144,5.0,2.0,"45% of her grading scale should be easy points (clicker points, homework), and each of the 3 midterms is only worth 10%. Rewrite for half your points back on each midterm plus extra credit from discussion, which is usually 2-4 points. Lectures are more practice problems than teaching, but the grading scale is very forgiving. Take orgo with her"
5609,855009,1.0,1.0,Terrible course. Her knowledge is lacking and not a lot of new information
5610,855009,5.0,2.0,"Easily one of the best teachers I've ever had!! Higginbotham is hilarious says whatever she wants to in class, so she keeps it interesting and very engaging. You are going to be expected to talk and participate in class but she is very helpful and outgoing so even if you're shy it shouldn't be a problem.  AWESOME professor."
5611,855009,5.0,2.0,"My favorite teacher at UVA. She's incredibly lively, passionate, and funny! She knows what she's talking about and she will get make you appreciate if not get excited about the material. As for grading, she's fair but you have to do legitimate, thoughtful work."
5612,855009,5.0,1.0,She's so awesome everyone should take her class! Im an art history major and she was the best i had in the department
5613,855009,5.0,1.0,She's so awesome everyone should take her class! Im an art history major and she was the best i had in the department
5614,855009,5.0,2.0,"Professor Higginbotham is easily one of the best professors I have had at UVA.  She is so passionate, and her lectures are so engaing and interesting, you never look at your watch and you don't want to leave.  You owe it to yourself to take American Art II with her."
5615,855009,4.0,2.0,"African American Art-not really her area of interest, but a good class nontheless. Overall the class was hindered by students that were not well versed in basic art history. Prof. Higginbotham is funny, patient,  and fair."
5616,2755554,5.0,2.0,"Taking Intro to Fiction Writing with Prof. Horn was such a good choice. The class was very chill, and Prof. Horn really allowed for the class to get to know each other and feel comfortable sharing our work. She led great workshops, gave good feedback on our writing, and was very transparent about assignments and deadlines. Highly recommend Horn."
5617,2354145,4.0,4.0,"Organic chemistry is hard, and Hsu's approach to teaching it is different from the other professors here. While I do find the order in which he taught us the material to punishing early on, I have overall enjoyed his class. Lectures are not mandatory but I recommend going for extra examples and repetition. When the TAs tell you to memorize, DO IT"
5618,2354145,1.0,5.0,"Not sure if it's the class or the professor, but if you're taking this class, the only piece of advice I can give is: good luck. Each exam is worth 130 points, and even though you get half the points you missed on test corrections, the average for the tests is usually somewhere in the 50s. If you are pre-medicine, do not take this class with Hsu."
5619,2354145,2.0,5.0,"This class is insanely hard. Hsu's O Chem course is structured differently than the other professors' are. His is more problem based instead of straightforward lecture. He dives into difficult examples before teaching background. Hardest tests of my life. If you can, take with one of the other professors. Otherwise, ask a lot of questions and read."
5620,2354145,3.0,4.0,"Work is needed to pass this class. Organic chemistry is hard within itself, but he does make sure everyone passes. If you try in this class you will pass."
5621,2354145,3.0,4.0,His class is super expensive. He requires the book and two other sites. I spent $200 just in his class alone. Maybe other teachers will ask you to spend less. He is nice though.
5622,396255,5.0,2.0,I love this man with my entire heart. Easy class (he literally tells you not to study for his exams) with two exams and a paper. Take his classes. Please. Smushiest man ever and he's so obviously passionate about his work.
5623,396255,4.0,2.0,"Vickerman lectures without a powerpoint, so you have to go to class to get notes! There are readings each week which are all interesting, but you don't have to do them to pass. The grade is based on a weekly one page (completion) memo, a 10 page research paper, and a final. Vickerman will make an outline for the paper with you!"
5624,396255,2.0,2.0,"Professor Vickerman's lectures were often off topic and didn't relate to the readings or the day's topic. I don't think this class was well designed and I didn't learn much about the &quot;Sociology of Immigration.&quot; Personally, would not recommend."
5625,396255,4.5,3.0,"The class was very interesting and was very relevant to modern day stuff; I felt like I really began to be able to converse in a more adult fashion by taking this class. There is one midterm, a 10 page paper, and a final. The midterm is fairly easy if you study the lectures and memorize some key points from the readings. The final was a bit harder."
5626,396255,3.5,1.0,The class is a little boring and repetitive but he is such a good professor. He's SO chill on assignments and papers. Doesn't mind if you turn things in late. He's so nice and easy to talk to. 
5627,396255,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite professors in the sociology department. Lectures are thought-provoking and he encourages lots of discussion. A lot of reading, but mostly new books and recent news articles. One paper and a final exam. Take this class!"
5628,396255,1.5,1.0,"lectures are full of tangents, and he doesn't analyze what we've read for class, just regurgitates it.  Classes felt like a waste of time."
5629,396255,5.0,4.0,"A really great lecturer.  His class was really fun and I learned a lot.  The tests can be difficult especially if you are not very good at essays, but he is very fair."
5630,396255,5.0,3.0,My favorite class at UVa! Vickerman kept me enthusiastic and interested.  I actually would want to go to class and listen. Classes are varied. Exams are easiest if readings have been done but being attentive in class is fine to pass the exam.
5631,396255,4.5,2.0,"Great class! Interesting, papers have nothing to do with readings (which means you don't have to read them), final essentially has nothing to read them (again - no need to do them), and the lectures are interesting.  He's a pretty easy grader too, and a really nice guy, and lectures in a clear and concise way to make sure everyone gets it."
5632,396255,5.0,1.0,"I had a great experience with Vickerman as both a teacher and advisor. He was helpful, interested, and extremely efficient. I would recommend his classes to anyone who wants to learn and is willing to do some work."
5633,396255,4.5,2.0,"Vickerman is a great professor he really knows his stuff and what he says is interesting, he´s also an easy grader and you dont have to do all the reading to understand whats going on in class"
5634,396255,1.0,5.0,"As an advisor, Vickerman is terrible.  He seems annoyed at having to deal with students, loses paperwork, and doesn't respond to e-mails/calls in any timely manner (expect to wait weeks if not months).  Major source of frustration with UVa."
5635,44006,4.0,4.0,A hard class.
5636,44006,2.5,4.0,"If you must take this course, here's some advice: DO NOT listen to what the TA and prof say about failing the midterm-I swear they WANT students to freak out. All that is difficult is the format. If you complete the hw and understand it, the exams are simply re-worded hw probs. Do practice problems and don't depend on excel formulas to do them."
5637,44006,1.5,3.0,"Just don't go to the lectures. You won't know what he is talking about. Read the powerpoints and maybe textbook by yourself. You could get a nice grade if you know when to use those formulas (don't need to know WHY the formulas could solve the problems). Anyway, don't go to the lectures to waster your time."
5638,44006,1.0,5.0,"I came to this class with some understanding of statistics.  I'm leaving wondering what the heck he was talking about.  As has been said, he teaches from the slides, which usually don't make much sense.  His lectures simply aren't clear and he doesn't seem to care."
5639,44006,1.5,5.0,pretty hard. good luck! youll need some with this course
5640,44006,1.0,5.0,Chang does not teach.  His power points are unclear and do not explain the material.  Homework is no help in preparing you for the his impossible quizzes and tests.  Expect to spend a lot of time with a stat textbook if you want to pass the course.
5641,44006,1.5,5.0,"STAT 212 is the absolute worst class I've ever taken at UVA.  The way the class is run is terrible... it seems as if Ted Chang and his TA's WANT you to fail.  Tests are extremely difficult and nothing at all like the homework.  The only reason I took this was for my Econ major.  For an intro course, it's unnecessarily painful."
5642,44006,1.5,4.0,"If you have no background in  stats, absolutely avoid this class. He honestly reads directly off the powerpoint, (which he didn't even make), and he is no help if you ask any questions. It always seems like he just wants to get out of the class as quickly as possible. He is the worst professor I could ever imagine having in college."
5643,44006,1.5,3.0,Not very intresting. Reads off powerpoint. Often gets things wrong. Exams are difficult.
5644,44006,1.0,3.0,Drop and wait until he isn't teaching to take the course.
5645,44006,1.0,3.0,An absolute waste of time.  Do yourself a huge favor and drop whatever class you're taking with him and wait until someone else teaches it.
5646,44006,1.0,4.0,"Seriously the worst teacher I've ever had. Take my advice and find another teacher. You'll be glad you did. Lectures were incomprehensible, he was really weird and grading on the final SUCKED. he is not consistent with grading at all. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS!! :("
5647,44006,1.0,5.0,"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID !!!!! He is like a nightmare! Terrible lectures. And he is really mean to you. He is a Monster. The homework is hard. You spent so much time on it, and you still couldnt get a good grade. Worst Professor Forever. If you dont want to torture yourself, be wise and don't choose his class."
5648,44006,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Mocks his students, mean, biased, overall horrible teacher. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!"
5649,44006,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I've ever had; doesn't know how to teach; you will learn nothing from him. Just stands in front of the class and mumbles incrompehensibly. The class is so useless; less than 20 usually show up out of 140. He is also very mean and not willing to help students either. If you have to take this class, please find a different professor."
5650,44006,1.0,5.0,"class was absolutely useless, so was the homework. Read the book in each and every detail, because it will be asked on the exam. HORRIBLE teacher, do not take Stats with him."
5651,44006,1.0,5.0,I should have read these ratings before I took his class last semester.  They are all true.  The book is a life-saver.  Don't go to class unless you enjoy the company of only 20 other people who want to waste their time.
5652,44006,1.0,5.0,"horrible teacher, biased, mean, avoid at all costs. WORTHLESS"
5653,44006,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely useless!!! He might be a statistical genius but he cannot teach worth his life.  As a former Physics student, I have to say that he was the worst quant professor I've ever had.  He needs to stay in research not in undergraduate education.  Avoid at all costs.  Never take a class of his. Ever!!!"
5654,44006,1.0,5.0,Makes an extremely difficult class even worse.  I will honestly always regret taking this class.  Avoid - at all costs.
5655,44006,1.5,4.0,Terrible class altogether. Professor Chang makes it no better he merely reads lecture slides that he puts online. Therefore I stopped going a month into school. Got a B from strictly teaching myself out of the book.
5656,44006,1.0,4.0,"Chang lives in his own little world and constantly amuses himself with his stupid jokes. Boring, abstract, a waste of time basically. I went to no more than 10 lectures throughout the whole semester...the materials can be very challenging though so even if you don't go to class, make sure you know the stuff. There's a nice curve at the end."
5657,44006,2.0,4.0,"Seems to be in his own world. Is not particularly interested in going out of his way to help students learn. With around 120 enrolled, lecture attendance was  routinely under 40."
5658,44006,1.0,5.0,"Chang is the worst professor I've had at UVA! His lectures are abstract, almost impossible to follow, and his inability to use powerpoint even after a full semester is mind-blowing considering he is a math genuis. His tests are nothing like the homework problems."
5659,44006,1.0,3.0,"He is a useless professor and just babbles about data. He makes it clear that he will not really teach the subject, so don't waste your time going to class.  Just read the textbook instead. Overall, it isn't a hard course if you do the homework and read the book. The TAs can be helpful, but discussion isn't mandatory."
5660,44006,1.0,3.0,Change is honestly the worst teacher I've ever had. Do not take stats with him!! Being in his class is like being in a self-taight class cuz at the end you end up learning by yourself from the book. The class wouldn't be hard at all if you have a teacher that actually teaches.
5661,44006,1.0,5.0,Prof. Chang did minimal teaching. In my experiences he was very unhelpful. My TA frequently seemed irritated after questions. The homework did not help in preparing for the test. Our time was wasted learning how to use computer programs. I'd strongly recommend another teacher.
5662,44006,1.0,5.0,He is by far the WORST teacher I've even encountered in my life! Avoid having a class with him at ALL COSTS!  My GPA is pushed down due to his horrible teaching.. actually... he cant even teach!
5663,44006,1.0,5.0,"This is BY FAR the worst professor I have EVER had.  Lectures are absolutely pointless and he makes the class SO much harder than it needs to be.  Tests are SO much harder than the homework, and in a much different format than the homework.  He has you do the homework with a computer program, but you have to do the tests a different way."
5664,44006,1.0,4.0,stay away stay away stay away. about three weeks in you will realize lectures are pointless. early on the material is so easy  that it doesn't matter that chang is a babbling idiot. test questions nothing like the hw. get a different teacher at all costs.
5665,44006,1.0,5.0,"WORST PROFESSOR OF ALL TIME AVOID AT ALL COSTS, no help at all, ta's are horrible as well"
5666,44006,1.0,4.0,"Avoid at all costs. Takes a simple, easy topic and just confuses everyone in lecture. Don't go, you're better off reading the book. The worst part is he assigns HW on webwork with numbers that are so exact, that you CAN'T DO THE HOMEWORK because you can't use the book charts like on the test. webwork gets impossible at the end."
5667,44006,1.0,5.0,No Comments
5668,44006,1.0,5.0,Probably the worst teacher I've ever had.  Not helpful outside of class and will make fun of you if you ask a question during class.  Stay away--it'd be worth staying an extra semester to take the class from someone else.
5669,44006,2.5,2.0,"Weird guy, but if you've taken stat before, it's almost all review. Obviously knows his stuff - just not so good at getting it across to the class. Stutters a lot. He's the only person who laughs at his jokes. Bizarre is the best word to describe him. The TA SUCKED - could barely speak English. Do the weekly homework though and you'll be fine."
5670,44006,1.0,2.0,"class is awful, no exaggeration. i went and tried to take notes for the first couple weeks but he goes into unnecessarily complex examples not only ocnfusing the students, but also himself. i learned to spend class time doing homework instead. very easy though, no question there."
5671,44006,3.0,3.0,"really hard to follow since he always confuses himself. Pretty boring class, I would recommend a different teacher if you want to stay awake and learn something. I basically taught myself with the book."
5672,44006,5.0,1.0,What a cool guy.  Teddy has cool stories and jokes out the wazoo!
5673,44006,2.0,2.0,"He is very hard to follow, not very clear, & kind of weird at times. His notes are not very helpful, but you can def. pass the class by just reading the text book and doing the homework. The tests are pretty easy and the topic is not difficult. For e-schoolers, stats will def. be an easy math course"
5674,44006,3.5,2.0,"Read the text first, then only go to the lectures if you didn't understand something. WARNING : The midterm and problem sets are easy. Everyone walks into the final with an A. It is the final that determines the grade distribution, so don't slack at the end."
5675,44006,2.0,5.0,hard to follow
5676,44006,3.5,3.0,"weird guy, thats for stuff, but  best of stat teachers, takes a while to get use"
5677,44006,1.0,3.0,"Makes class extremely boring, not worth attending"

5680,191463,5.0,2.0,Prof. Palmer is an amazing professor who really cares about the well being of his students. He makes class fun and exciting through fun projects and really puts effort into engaging with students. Def recommended!!
5681,191463,2.0,2.0,"This is a really great class, but Palmer isn't very helpful. Don't go to him for questions-go to your TA (and make sure you have a good TA at the beginning of the semester, your grade will depend on it)."
5682,191463,2.0,4.0,"Getting a good TA is a must in this class. Palmer doesn't do much and his weekly lectures are not helpful. Sometimes what he said during lecture is wrong (Harman had to correct him a few times). The class is on a fixed grading scale and the lab reports are graded harshly, so don't be too disappointed when you don't end up with an A."
5683,191463,2.0,5.0,He was clear when he wanted to be but could also not be very straightforward at other times.
5684,191463,4.0,5.0,"This course is very challenging to people who does not have a strong chemistry background.I would not recommend taking this class unless you have a deep interest in chemistry cause it is very ti consuming.Go to review sessions & TA office hours, those are very helpful.Don't wait until you receive a bad grade to go because then it would be too late."
5685,191463,3.5,5.0,"The class is pretty difficult. It also seems like Palmer doesn't do much. He leaves the majority of the work to the TAs, only some of which are competent enough. His lab lectures are mildly helpful; the help sessions are more useful to attend. The class is a drain on time and don't be too hopeful for an A."
5686,191463,4.0,2.0,"Not too difficult if you have some background in laboratory chem.  Lab reports can be difficult, make sure you take advantage of his writing clinics in the beginning and office hours.  Digital media project at the end of the year is a fun break from the lab."
5687,191463,4.5,4.0,"Way tougher than Harman's 181 class due to fixed grading scale. With 500 total points in the class, it is difficult to get an A especially because everyone loses points on each lab report (extremely frustrating). The lab reports takes FOREVER to do (at least 4+ hours per week) and the TAs grade randomly. Exam = hard. Seriously, don't expect an A."
5688,191463,5.0,5.0,"Palmer's great; the TAs are not.  It will seem like a big scheme to shoot down your GPA while you're in it, but remember that there are enough easy points in the class to make up for the lab reports."
5689,191463,5.0,4.0,"Pleasant and approachable. Concepts are difficult, but you will be OK if you see your TA's out of class to understand the material."
5690,191463,4.0,3.0,cool guy. rarely shows up for lab but lectures are okay
5691,191463,5.0,2.0,Best teacher ever!! And HOTT too! Everyone in my class loved him. (girls AND boys)
5692,191463,1.0,5.0,"avoid, avoid, avoid."
5693,191463,2.5,5.0,"very frustrating class, worked my rear end off, impossible to understand lectures. take Beck instead."
5694,191463,5.0,3.0,Palmer is a gangster!
5695,191463,4.5,3.0,"good guy, get to know him and take advantage of office hours, it will be helpful...quizes arent bad, if you are good at tests then they are not bad, but if you are bad at them, be prepared for studying your ass off."
5696,191463,3.5,4.0,"The course is designed for &quot;those who have not had previously had calculus&quot; but it is almost impossible to pass if you haven't. only those in the class that had calculus before were passing. That aside, Palmer is really a nice guy and will try t"
5697,191463,5.0,2.0,"a good guy, clarifies the stuff that my dinosaur aged high school teacher should have taught me, has many office hours, good grading system"
5698,191463,5.0,2.0,cool guy. has a thorough teaching method and won't bore the living daylights out of you.Really if you fail the course then it was probably your high school teachers fault(wink)
5699,191463,5.0,3.0,I don't know but this guy is a ****.  He is one of the only good teachers in the Engineering school and he could possibly get the most play in the world.  Even if you are not in the Engineering school i think you should take this class.
5700,191463,5.0,3.0,Strongly recommended. One of the most respectable professors around. Fun things he did was competing with Mary Beck's class in terms of grades. Ended up his class WINNING.
5701,191463,5.0,5.0,"contrary to popular belief, i found apma 111 rather challenging. but palmer was cool, when not busy listening to 90's rock in his cubbyhole office, he is a good lecturer and likes to have a fun time in class. holla."
5702,191463,5.0,1.0,overall good teacher... funny too...
5703,191463,5.0,1.0,yo this guy could possibly be a superhero duders
5704,1518573,5.0,3.0,"While he is wordy he isn't difficult to follow and you get a lot out of the class, even when the material is dry. He is really into his field and definitely prepared us to move forward in it as well. And yes, never hurts that he is one of the few hot guys in the department."
5705,1518573,4.0,2.0,He was my TA for soc 1010 with Hunter.  He helped clarify fuzzy concepts and he was always very helpful outside of class.  He's very knowledgeable a relatively easy grader and on top of that he is very cute.  He does like to talk a lot though.
5706,52217,2.0,3.0,"While most professors are organized and clear about what you need to do to do well, Sanders' tests are horribly worded and the research paper's requirements increased the night it was due. Lectures are all over the place and while I think I'll get an A, I'd rather take a tough course that at least feels organized because to me, that's less stress."
5707,52217,3.0,4.0,"A very nice person and accessible outside of class, but in class she is very disorganized. The tests are written very strangely and are hard to prepare for, but she does give curves/extra credit, though at times she can be very unclear about it. Take the class if you're interested in political science research, but prepare to be a bit frustrated."
5708,52217,2.0,4.0,"Extremely disorganized and it shows, her lectures are unstructured. Tests are worded with terrible grammar, even the TA admits they are designed to trick, not teach. Don't even bother purchasing the books for the class, it won't help. Furthermore, she is high-school level controlling about students leaving to use the restroom in class."
5709,52217,1.0,4.0,"This is quite possibly the WORST class I have ever taken with an even worse professor. She is extremely entitled and quite condescending. She not only lacks general managerial skills, which makes her lectures extremely boring and all over the place, her tests and quizzes are worded so weirdly that people often do do not do well on them."
5710,52217,1.0,5.0,"She is very rude, unclear, and an all around bad professor. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! One of the worst classes I've taken- her exams are irrelevant to course material. Saunders should not be at UVA. We do not deserve such poor teaching and testing."
5711,52217,1.5,4.0,"She's awful. Not only can she be rude and condescending during class, she is very one-sided and teaches the class with regards to HER perspective.  She's terribly unfair and is paranoid for cheating. Quizzes are WAY too detailed, almost everyone fails them. She doesn't post her powerpoints either."
5712,52217,1.0,4.0,"I thought it was going to be a fun class, and it would be, but she just can not teach. She stops in the middle of lecture and spends 30 minutes out of 50 talking on random things. Def. avoid this class."
5713,52217,1.0,5.0,uva students deserve a better professor than this
5714,52217,3.5,2.0,Professor Sanders is incredibly nice but her lectures jump can jump around at times. Work loads are manageable and grading is somewhat generous. Interesting class.
5715,52217,5.0,4.0,"This class was incredible! Prof. Sanders makes herself extraordinarily accessible and clearly has a love for the material she teaches. She sets clear expectations and although she has a tough grading scale, if you focus in class and on the readings she tells you to, you will do well!"
5716,52217,3.5,4.0,"Race and Gender Politics:     I should start off by telling you that this woman genuinely loves what she teaches, and that alone makes her a great professor. You WILL be annoyed at her tendency to forget herself and at the intense reading. But MAKE A STUDY GUIDE for tests and put in some effort when doing your papers and youll be fine. RECOMMENDED!"
5717,52217,4.0,3.0,"I loved this class! She is enganging and helpful. She is a bit unorganized, but its understandable given her work load. The course is not easy by any means, but it's definitely interesting and worth the effort. Two papers, presentation, discussion, and a final. She is not an easy grader; but it's not impossible to do well."
5718,52217,5.0,2.0,"Great Professor. Dont be intimidated by the huge reading load. just skim and really pay attention in class. Before tests, get into study groups and each write and compile a summary of readings. This makes the class 1000000 times easier."
5719,52217,1.5,4.0,"Although she's a professor of some topically interesting courses, she hereself is indeed in need of some better teaching skills. She was hardly on time, and moody. She doesn't check her facts and is probably overworked...and it shows."
5720,52217,5.0,3.0,"Grading is on a 93-100 is an A- to A+, so watch out. This, coupled with the specificity of the course makes it hard to get an A. However the class is incredible and she is an amazing teacher. Very kind and accessible. The readings are interesting but long; however she tells you she doesn't expect you to know everything. Just pay attn to highlights."
5721,52217,3.0,3.0,"tons of reading, but not as hard as ppl make it out to be, just have to learn what to study and what not to waste time on!"
5722,52217,5.0,2.0,Great Class!
5723,52217,3.0,4.0,"super hard class, tons and tons of reading, expects you to know minute details for exams; do no take this  class unless you have a high interest in the topic and are ready for the reading load!"
5724,52217,3.5,3.0,"Yes, a little flighty sometimes, but knows her material, and is incredibly nice and accessible."
5725,52217,1.0,4.0,"terrible class, and she's a terrible person. i don't recall her coming to class ONCE on time. she referred to the fetus as &quot;cancer baby&quot;. unprofessional, moody, and completely overrated. dont take her course. she sucks."
5726,52217,5.0,3.0,"Sanders' classes can change the way you understand politics, adding some much-needed nuance. If you are willing to tolerate a dose of complexity, which you should be if you are going to study politics, you can learn a lot from her. Engage her in discussion and you will benefit even more from her insight."
5727,52217,5.0,4.0,A great Professor!  Her quizzes were fair and objective - you just had to study.  Very approachable and willing to meet with students outside of class!
5728,52217,4.5,4.0,great
5729,52217,1.0,5.0,"This was a terrible class.  Her lectures were all over the place.  Truck questions on quizes.  She only focused on issues pertaining to african americans which I think is a major bias right there.  12 weeks of how african americans have suffered prejudice and ONE lecture to cover Hispanics AND Asian issues&#63;&#63;  please.  I think the issue of racial politics has more colors than black and white.  Plus, I never got my grades back for assignment until the very end of the semester.  Totally sucked. Do not take."
5730,52217,3.5,2.0,Racial politics should be required for all UVa students!
5731,52217,5.0,3.0,"I feel sorry for those who cannot appreciate the awesomeness of Lynn Sanders -- this is one of the best classes I've ever taken at the university.  Changed a lot of my views, not because I was indoctrinated with bias but because it was so thought provoking."
5732,52217,3.0,3.0,Lynn is an extremely nice person but her lectures are all over the place.
5733,52217,1.0,2.0,"He's a mess.  Her lectures are all over the place, they make little sense and tend to be repetitive.  She's flighity and moody.  I feel she puts on a show in an attempt to be liked rather than do an honest job that might get her a little flack."
5734,52217,2.5,3.0,"worst class ever- TA's very hard graders, lecture is disorganized and sporadic, she is too caught up in the power point slides"
5735,52217,1.0,5.0,worst teacher I've ever had.  seriously.  not even exagerating.
5736,52217,2.0,3.0,baised...doesnt even make an effort to present two sided material.  hasn't been to class on time yet.
5737,52217,3.5,3.0,"you never wrote that letter for me, Lynn!"
5738,52217,3.5,4.0,"Wonderful teacher, great material- a little heavy on the reading, but overall very interesting.  She needs to lay off the coffee a bit, kind of fidgety/nervous."
5739,52217,4.0,2.0,"is a good professor, beware of ta's"
5740,52217,3.5,3.0,"I also took PLAP 370 with her too. She is a very good professor, though 355 is much better than 370. She is extremely helpful, but is a little disorganized and that may bother you. She speeds through her notes, but other than that, she's a solid teacher."
5741,52217,5.0,2.0,"Totally sweet, helpful, very very smart, love Lynn Sanders to death! She knows your name even in a class of 60!"

5743,52217,5.0,3.0,this was a foundational class in my intellectual development
5744,1960957,5.0,1.0,Loved Madame Erhlich! Would definitely recommend to anyone. She's so sweet and so helpful. 
5745,1797120,1.0,4.0,"He winked at my girlfriend in middle of the class, weirdo.."
5746,1797120,4.0,2.0,"He was an awesome teacher who really knew what he was talking about. So friendly, I definitely recommend going to office hours every week!"
5747,3073,3.0,3.0,"He is undeniably an intelligent man whose teaching quality is above average, but his PHIL 2340 was one of the most boring classes I've ever taken. I don't know how someone manages to make topics like world-destroying AI boring, but Mr. Humphreys definitely knows how to. Readings are jargon-laden and dull."
5748,3073,2.5,4.0,"I took his Phil. of science class. I learned an astronomical amount in the class, but nearly all of it was self taught. Humphrey's is clearly an expert in his field, but he illustrates example after example without really explaining anything. He presupposes both a scientific and philosophical knowledge, with was fine for me, but may be problematic."
5749,3073,5.0,3.0,Exceptionally clear and precise. Very friendly and fair.
5750,3073,4.5,3.0,"Humphreys great. Funny guy, awesome British accent, extremely intelligent. If you show up to class and let him know you're interested and taking his class seriously, you'll do well."
5751,3073,4.0,2.0,"Easy class if you do all the readings and coming to every class.  Homeworks are great because you can check to make sure they're correct before you submit, and that's 40% of your grade.  Needs to make sure his mic is on before lecturing with his back to the audience.  My TA was great and explained things well, so that also helped."
5752,3073,3.0,3.0,"Tough course, but getting an A is possible.  Not the best lecturer, but not the worst.  Overall, I felt like he would rather be somewhere else."
5753,3073,3.0,4.0,Lectures not all that helpful occasionally actually just puts the book on the projector...TAs a little weak
5754,3073,2.5,3.0,Not worth it if you are looking for an easy A.  His tests can be from pretty obscure lecture notes.
5755,3073,4.0,4.0,"Not the most helpful/encouraging professor--crams many questions into a 45-minute exam that it makes it difficult to finish tests. Homework is assigned weekly & some sets can take up to 6-8 to complete. T.A. Kristina doesn’t know subject well and stumbles in explaining core concepts. Without determination, this class can get pretty tough."
5756,3073,4.5,3.0,"loved this class! good lectures, and his responses to bad questions are funny. have to do the work but it is a great class, very smart teacher. highly recommended."
5757,3073,2.5,5.0,"Not really a difficult class in terms of material, Humphreys packs in about two hours worth of material into a 50 min. exam, in which a few math/logic oriented people do well, and the vast majority do a mediocre job. You get to teach yourself because his lectures don't help. Also, one goof-up will turn your A exam to a B-. Take only if interested."
5758,3073,2.5,4.0,You do need a science background.  The readings are dense and jargon-laden.  Such is philosophy of science.  There's also too much reading; the class moves fast.  Stay away unless you're really interested in science--doesn't feel like a philosophy class at all.
5759,3073,2.5,1.0,"If he didn't have a cool British accent, I would have never gone to class.  Don't take this class unless you're already interested in logic because you end up teaching all the material to yourself.  If you like the subject, the class ends up being pretty easy.  Get Clint as your ta!! He's awesome."
5760,3073,5.0,2.0,"If you dont do well in this course then you're just lazy.  Do the reading (don't just skim, either), do the homework, go to class (pay attention).  Very straightforward, easy once you try."
5761,3073,1.0,4.0,Simply wouldn't reccomend
5762,3073,1.5,4.0,"It is very difficult to perform in strict 50 min. tests and your grade often does not reflect your knowledge. The class material itself is not all that hard, he makes it so. Is not really very helpfull in office hours and his lectures consist of example after example with minimal clarification."
5763,3073,2.5,4.0,"Humphreys is all right, but the homework is a pain, the class is boring and mundane, and how to study for the tests is unclear.  Humphreys doesn't do a good job of helping you to study, doesn't supply strategies for solving the problems in general.  You'll have to teach yourself."
5764,3073,4.0,3.0,philosophy of science was awesome -- he has contributed to the field but is modest. he likes class participation.
5765,3073,3.5,2.0,"Humphreys does a good job of making a boring subject like symbolic logic seem fairly interesting. Anyone taking his class will probably dig his British accent and his sense of humor. The tests are straight forward, and the material is fairly easy."
5766,3073,5.0,3.0,"great class.  helps to have a math background, but i didn't and i did fine"
5767,93190,5.0,2.0,"I took Professor Tolbert's ASTR 124 as a First Year planning to major in Biology.  Four years later, I had an Astronomy degree.  Great professor."
5768,93190,4.0,2.0,"If you go to lecture every day, don't buy the book. That being said, take extremely detailed notes on what he says, because oftentimes his tricky true/false questions come from obscure details from lecture that you would otherwise skip over."
5769,93190,1.0,5.0,Wow - this guy really isn't doing any research.  I can't take him seriously.  Makes sense he spends his days teaching freshmen how to spot the big dipper
5770,93190,1.0,5.0,"He?s the most intellectually vacuous person I?ve ever had the misfortune of encountering. However, he?s in the right department?if you?re interested in black holes, the space between Tolbert?s ears is a perfect place to look!"
5771,93190,4.5,2.0,"Probably one of the most interesting classes I have taken at UVA- fairly layed back and funny, yet very knoledgable and informative"
5772,93190,4.0,4.0,A lot harder than I thought because of the true false questions.
5773,93190,4.5,1.0,"He tells you everything you need to know in lecture, no need to buy the book.  Doing the constellation lab early gives you + half a letter grade.  Don't think too much on the true/false parts of the quizzes and you'll be gold"
5774,93190,3.5,3.0,"Tolbert's a good professor. You will never have to use the textbook if you attend the lecture and there is no outside work. Make sure you do the constellation lab early, the extra credit helps a lot. Also, the quizes are true and false but are still very tricky."
5775,93190,4.5,1.0,I loved Astronomy 121 and I love Professor Tolbert. The class is really interesting and Tolbert will randomly tell jokes or funny stories which keep the lectures form getting boring. If you take good notes they will be all you need to study for the tests. I never even opened my textbook! Definitely take this class.
5776,93190,2.5,3.0,"Well, Tolbert is really boring and dry and you'll want to fall asleep in class. It's a tricky class: a lot of the test questions are very unfair - lots of minor details. You DO definitely have to study, and the constellation lab helps TONS. I don't recommend the class overall, but it's probably one of the easier sciences."
5777,93190,3.5,3.0,"Professor Tolbert has rather boring lectures. You do not need to buy the book. All you need to do is study the lectures. The true false can be very tricky at times, but if you study what he says in class, you should be able to figure it out."
5778,93190,1.0,4.0,He is completely worthless. You will learn absolutely nothing in his class. His quizzes are True/False and basically impossible. He will say one thing and have a different thing as the correct answer. If you actually want to learn stay as far away from this man as possible.
5779,93190,2.0,4.0,"How much did he pay the people who commented below me&#63;! WOW...DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It's guaranteed to put you to sleep. He's constantly contradicting himself which makes it very hard to understand, tests are mostly true and false and this old man is a tricky one. He should come with a warning."
5780,93190,3.5,2.0,"Easiest class ever. He practically gives points away, and you never have any homework. Just take notes at lecture and study a few days before the quizzes and you'll do fine. I learned a good amount about astronomy and Tolbert is cute and hilarious!"
5781,93190,3.5,1.0,"Anyone who can't handle this class shouldn't be at UVA. Pay decent attention in lectures and study for an hour or so before quizzes. T/F really isn't hard. I actually think he's a funny, generally nice guy. Also don't try to be the kid who wants to understand the a topic more than he's trying to explain....that will mess you up."
5782,93190,5.0,2.0,"Amazing teacher, best of from what I hear.  T/F tests are hard for some, and some find him confusing.  Not me -- my advice is go to lecture and this class should be a pretty fun time and easy A.  I really enjoyed it."
5783,93190,3.5,3.0,"I had Tolbert for both 121 and 124, he is definetly the best intro astro teacher from what Ive gathered.  The class is very interesting, attendence not mandatory, but it helps a lot because notes are the only thing you need to study - no book needed!  No homework and one lab you have to do on just one night. Not a given A, you do have to study."
5784,93190,3.5,4.0,I was told it would be an easy science and he seemed really easily at the start of the class.  But his tests are tricky even if you know the material.  I studied a lot for this class and it really hurt my GPA... dont take this class with tolbert
5785,93190,1.5,3.0,"The most bunk-filled class at the university, even Thomas Jefferson himself would take crucial naps during Tolbert's lectures. Avoid this nasty old man at all costs."
5786,93190,2.0,2.0,boring.  he's a funny guy but the quizzes are rather rediculous and the class isn't that interesting.
5787,93190,2.0,4.0,"He is extremely boring! You don't even have to read the book, just manage to stay awake and take notes on what he says. His tests are tricky (especially true and false)and based only on lecture. Do the lab early!!"
5788,93190,1.0,5.0,No Comments
5789,93190,2.0,5.0,&#61558; Tolber is a Tricky little old man there is no other way to put it.  The true and false is almost impossible.  He seems like a nice old man but don't let that persona deceive you!  He makes it clear that you dont need a text book for the class just go to lecture...Just drink a red bull before you go or you'll never stay awake.
5790,93190,1.0,4.0,IF YOU VALUE YOUR EDUCATION AT UVa DO NOT TAKE ANY COURSES WITH THIS PROFESSOR.
5791,93190,1.0,3.0,He should change his name from Tolbert to Useless. Wonder why he only teaches intro courses&#63; UVa should get rid of this worthless prof.
5792,93190,1.0,5.0,WORST teacher I have had. Tests are REALLY REALLY REALLY hard. I got my worst grade ever. The education system needs to outlaw TENURE!!!
5793,93190,1.0,4.0,worthless professor. UVa needs to seriously clean house beginning with this waste of space!
5794,93190,5.0,1.0,He's so cute! I love all of his anecdotes he tells in class which seem unrelated but then in a weird way fit in. You don't have to crack open a book so long as you go to class. Sometimes his questions are tricky but if you know your stuff you should have no problem.
5795,93190,4.5,1.0,"Funny guy who can explain concepts very well. If you go to class you will never have to read. Easy course, take it."
5796,93190,5.0,2.0,"There is a reason Tolbert's classes have room for many more students in ISIS: his jokes may be awkward at times, but it just makes him all the more funny. I recommend going to office hours (which he holds almost 24/7) to sort out the T/F (which are tricky). Do the lab early for extra credit and ask questions if you are confused - he wants to help."
5797,93190,5.0,1.0,"I loved this class. It is very interesting and Tolbert is actually quite funny. I dont know what the other comments are talking about, but the class is an extremely easy A. Just show up and listen, read over notes, the T/F quizzes are not bad if you know your stuff. It was a joke of a class really, I'd do it again."
5798,93190,4.0,2.0,"The class is boring no doubt because there is soo much information, but overall the class is great.  If you want a science class that will get you a A/B WITHOUT reading.. TAKE IT and just pay attention.  Watch out for the quizzes, go to the reviews, do the constellation quiz early and you should be fine!"
5799,93190,2.0,5.0,I absolutely regret taking this science class. It is by no means &quot;easy&quot; and the T/F questions are really difficult. Astronomy is BUNK. Please don't waste your life taking this class.
5800,93190,1.0,5.0,"Oh, my goodness, this was the worst decision of my life. the class is so boring and the tests are IMPOSSIBLE. do NOT TAKE THIS as an easy A. It it miserable and tolbert is a tricky, tricky, little man. his true/false tests are so effing hard. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!!!!!!"
5801,93190,3.5,4.0,"I enjoyed lectures when I went.  Tolbert is actually pretty funny and definitely smart.  I know I didn't go to every class, but definitely most of them and I still thought it was hard. True/False quizzes suck---this is NOT an easy A.  There's GOT to be a better way to get an A in a science class.  Don't buy the book!"
5802,93190,3.5,4.0,"Quizzes are primarily T/F and usually 3-4 will be tricky. Textbook helps me because I always fall asleep in his boring lecture but if u can stay awake and take good notes this class will be pretty easy, and also he will NOT adjust points even if you have a good point because hes stingy in that way."
5803,93190,4.0,3.0,"I'm in the class right now.  The man is currently doing some form of odd math on the board.  He's pretty excited about it.  The girl next to me says to make sure and mention the quizzes suck.  But he's a cute, funny old man and class attendance is more than optional as long as you get the notes.  Just go for it."
5804,93190,2.0,5.0,Tolbert's a boring lecturer and his T/F tests are impossible. I haven't missed a class and take good notes but have gotten bad grades on the quizzes. He does add a +/- grade if you do an easy  lab w/in the first month of school and lets you decide how much your final counts for. Unless you like astronomy dont take this class. Don't buy a book.
5805,93190,4.0,2.0,"this is a pretty easy class if you get good notes and look over the book once in a while. i had little interest in astronomy before, but now i really like it."
5806,93190,2.0,4.0,"I took this class expecting an easy science credit.  While there's very little actual work involved in the class, the quizzes are a ****.  I would study my ass off and still have trouble.  Lectures are boring and I personally found Tolbert to be kind of an ****.  If youre looking for an easy A science class, take Physics: How Things Work."
5807,93190,5.0,2.0,"Professor Tolbert is a really cool guy.  He's funny.  True and false quizzes suck because they're tricky, but they're only 3 of them.  Take the class, and it's okay to skip some, but make sure you get the notes."
5808,93190,5.0,1.0,So cute and Funny...
5809,93190,5.0,5.0,"Tolbert is by FAR the best professor I've had at UVA-I hate science, but I ended up loving astronomy. During office hours, he patiently answered my q's for one hour. However, I HATED his quizzes. The true/false questions were so tricky that even when I felt I had a good understanding of the material, I did poorly. It was not a gut class for me!"
5810,93190,1.0,1.0,No Comments
5811,93190,4.0,1.0,"I got an A in the class, but it came with a little work. Have someone take pretty good notes in lectures and study them a night or two before the quizes and exam, and you should be fine. Don't buy the book. There's usually 1 or 2 &quot;tricky&quot; T/F questions on the quizes, but the lab is a joke if you get it done early."
5812,93190,4.5,1.0,Easiest science class I have ever taken in my life. The lab was a joke and he tells you all you need to do is attend the lectures and you'll be fine. You don't even have to read the book! Pay attention in class though... he's slightly picky with the quizzes.
5813,93190,5.0,1.0,This is a great class.  If you think the T/F is hard I have no clue what you are doing at UVA.
5814,93190,4.0,2.0,"Incredibly easy as long as you take notes (or skip class and have someone give them to you). Book not necessary. True/False can be tricky, but if you know the material, it's not bad."
5815,93190,4.0,3.0,"quizzes are kinda unfair because wording is hard and confusing and true/false can be miscontrued...otherwise very helpful and very humorous, enjoyed lectures!"
5816,93190,4.0,2.0,"this class is very easy if you either read the book or go to class. i am not at all interested in astronomy, but tolbert is so jolly and into it that the class is not bad."
5817,93190,3.5,1.0,"It's everything you've probably heard-- the material you probably learned in 4th grade, lectures are boring, but the test are tricky.  It's an easy A if you study."
5818,93190,2.0,4.0,"Boring, tests are unfair, unless you are good at true/false."
5819,93190,3.0,1.0,"This class was very easy, and if you read the book there is no need to go to class."
5820,93190,5.0,1.0,"(dont do 124), easy class, tests not hard if u study, got a solid A not a sci person, if u want to ask question during test ask TA, go to review sessions, no m-term, 3-4 tests and final. on final u pick how much it counts so do well early then dont worry. very clear lectures, write everything down, tests = regurgitation of lecture. you can do it."
5821,93190,2.5,4.0,"Everyone told me how easy ASTR 121 was, and how I should take the class, but guess what&#63;   They lied!  Maybe it was easy in the sense that there was no reading or papers or anything like that, but his quizzes were difficult and tricky and one word in his questions like &quot;appear&quot; throws off a majority of the class.  He was not helpful in office hours"
5822,93190,1.0,5.0,This class is NOT easy!!! Tests are entirely true/false and designed to trick you. I don't understand why teachers do this... The material seems easy in class but then the tests ask VERY specific questions that you get wrong. Studying the book doesn't help at all; I think this alone is retarded.
5823,93190,4.5,2.0,Easy class if you can manage the tricky quizzes. Take good notes. Look at past quizzes especially for the first one. DONT BUY THE BOOK!
5824,93190,4.5,2.0,"This class is not hard. It's a gut if you attend every class. Don't bother buying the book, just memorize your notes (so take good ones). Tolbert's kind of boring, but worth the good grade."
5825,93190,4.0,1.0,"I ADORE Tolbert. He's the reason I became and Astro minor. The lectures are really clear and you absolutely don't need the book. The quizzes can be tricky, but not nearly as bad as people on here have made them out to be. AWESOME prof/class. Take it!"
5826,93190,1.0,5.0,"cynical jerk, poor command of basic english vocabulary. You will cry alone in the night because the lecture material is so elementary...and yet you find yourself getting C after C on the duplicitous true and false tests. Remarkable how little he actually knows about science."
5827,93190,1.0,5.0,"Horrible horrible prof... doesnt teach, has a huge attitude about everything, donsnt care if we learn or not, worthless in his office hours, rude, unfriendly"
5828,93190,1.5,3.0,"The class was OK. THe exams were very tricky. If you need a science class take How things Work, PHYS105."
5829,93190,5.0,1.0,"Tolbert is the professor to take.  He is the nicest man, also all you need to go are the lectures.  He even says you do not need the book.  Tolbert's test aren't bad, very little outside work.   Great class."
5830,93190,4.5,1.0,Dont be scared away from these other comments.  Class is very easy if you go to lectures. Dont need the text book. Lectures are clear as can be. Just look over notes a couple days before quiz and youll be fine. Tolbert's a good guy and even lets you look over past quizzes before you take them.
5831,93190,3.5,2.0,"lectures were ok, sometimes interesting, sometimes boring.  the fact that the class was early in the morning made it difficult to attend.  i was lucky to have a pretty good ta so his review sessions really helped.  the quizzes are a bit tricky but its not ridiculously hard"
5832,93190,3.0,3.0,"He's one of those people who shows off in front of big group of people but really isn't that nice in person. During lectures, he answers students' questions very thoroughly, but in person, he sounds quite cynical and seems to be annoyed with you."
5833,93190,4.5,1.0,"so boring, but really easy class... whatever you do, do NOT buy the book, you'll never even open it"
5834,93190,2.5,3.0,"Very boring material, poorly designed T/F tests. He's a nice enough guy, but he is really unclear at times, especially when he is drawing diagrams on the board (he does this a lot). Don't take it unless you need to fulfill a science credit, as overall it's pretty underwhelming. Go to every lecture."
5835,93190,1.0,4.0,CAUTION: The tests are T/F with trick questions.  He will not help you when you go to him but will shrug you off.Worst teacher in all my classes.For one test I have 25 pages of front/back notes.  NOT very easy even when you attend all classes because he puts trick questions on the tests. A-HOLE TOO.
5836,93190,3.0,2.0,Not the greatest teacher...funny to watch though.  Class is boring.  I read the book even though others say not to cause it helped me.  His lectures don't always help on the T/F quizzes.  Oh yeah his quizzes suck cause they are true/false so don't overanalyze.
5837,93190,4.5,1.0,"tolbert's hilarious. awesome teacher. easy class really, but go to his lectures because all test material is from his lectures. you really don't need a book, but it's helpful. he has a way to explain things easily. approachable and friendly"
5838,93190,4.5,1.0,easy class if u go to lecture
5839,93190,4.5,2.0,GO TO CLASS.  Taking notes will take you far in this class.  Also if you are unhappy with a grade on a quiz talk to him.  He is generous with the points and will adjust your grade if you have a good point.  Overall its easy.
5840,93190,3.5,3.0,lecture based tests so outside work isnt necessary and wont need the textbook unless ur not good at taking notes or miss something in class.
5841,93190,5.0,1.0,"Even though he is a little boring, he knows what he's talking about and he's a cute little old man. I loved it when he jumped around to demonstrate the concept of &quot;falling&quot; through space."
5842,93190,2.5,3.0,"Good God.  Take 121 - it's easy.  Whatever you do, don't take 124.  The subject matter is so ridiculously boring, and there is way too much memorizing of processes involved.  Take EVSC courses if you're lookin for easy sciences - 124 is NOT one of them."
5843,93190,3.5,4.0,easy class. go to lectures. quizzes are a pain- t/f part is VERY TRICKY. but the extra credit with the lab helps a lot.
5844,93190,5.0,2.0,How could you dislike Charlie&#63;  Man this dude rocks.  This class is a SINCH.  Don't listen to what they say...buy the book and you'll be fine.  That's all you need to know.
5845,93190,4.0,1.0,"The easiest class that could exist, attend classes, lsn, never buy the book and never study get an A or even better an A+"
5846,93190,2.0,2.0,"Very very very boring. Don't buy the book if you're taking the class. Teaches his own version of astronomy. If you go to lectures, you'll get a way. The trick is trying to stay awake."
5847,93190,5.0,1.0,"I have taken both of his classes. I have to say that 121 is more interesting and easier than 124. Although the subject can be boring for some people, he is a good teache and person."
5848,93190,4.5,3.0,"Some people find it very boring some dont, I thought it was a very interesting class. He will always answer your questions as well."
5849,93190,1.5,3.0,No Comments
5850,93190,3.5,1.0,"I don't understand all of the people who dislike Tolbert. His class is boring, true, but it requires absolutely no outside work, except for some studying the night before the test.  Who COULD make Astronomy interesting anyway&#63;  Easy science, take it."
5851,93190,2.0,1.0,"Oh my God, he is so boring! But, he has inspired me to finish the New York Times crossword puzzle numerous times. Read the book and screw off in class. Have fun with this tool."
5852,93190,4.0,2.0,i like the guy a lot-very helpful...the class isn't demanding at all...go to class...get an A.....don't go to class...get a B....those are pretty much the only options...nice guy...and i find him more interesting to listen to than some of the others
5853,93190,3.0,2.0,"VERY boring, not too difficult - but usually teaches HUGE classes.  Tests consist of T/F questions and a few short answers - No outside work needed - just go to class and take notes.  You don't even need to buy the book"
5854,93190,3.0,3.0,"He is soo boring!!! OMG!! please if you are planning to take his class, and attend his class (hint..hint...) take a newspaper with you, or something else that will keep you awake...otherwise don't be surprised if the person sitting next to you is snoring!"
5855,93190,3.0,2.0,"very BORING - however, not too difficult.  but be prepared for a BORING class."
5856,93190,2.5,4.0,"Tolbert, while not a hard teacher or an incredibly demanding one, likes to trick his student.  He is a troll-like man and I am pretty sure we caught him drinking at the front of class one morning.  He does however have an opportunity for extra credit."
5857,93190,5.0,2.0,I don't understand all of the Tolbee bashing. He lectures clearly and interestingly and there is no outside work or reading. Tolbert is knowledgeable and very approachable. He's a nice guy and solid professor. I thoroughly enjoyed both semesters with him.
5858,93190,3.0,1.0,"pretty easy, people are making him sound terrible, he's not that bad....just easy"

5864,93190,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE ASTR 121 OR ASTR 124 WITH TOLBERT.
5865,93190,1.0,5.0,TOLBERT’S CLASS GAVE ME A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH UP ON CLIPING MY TOENAILS.  I WAS BORED OUT OF MY MIND FOR 16 WEEKS!
5866,93190,1.0,5.0,This professor shouldn't even be allowed to teach at a community college.  He's that bad!
5867,93190,1.0,5.0,QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST PROFESSOR IN THE ASTRONOMY DEPARTMENT!!!!!!!!!!! RETIRE TOLBERT!!!!!!!!!!!
5868,93190,1.0,5.0,No Comments
5869,93190,1.0,5.0,"Tolbert's class centers around knocking God and the Bible. If you believe in Jesus, Tolbert isn't a professor you want to encounter!"

5872,93190,1.0,2.0,AVOID THIS PROFESSOR.
5873,93190,5.0,2.0,Tolbert rocks our world!!!!
5874,3078,5.0,4.0,"Professor Zelikow loves to answer questions, but be ready for a super long response and tangent. Overall a lot of reading and you better do it because he has daily quizzes. He is a great lecturer and knows his stuff. He has great experiences and stories to share. If you love history and foreign affairs, this is the class for you."
5875,3078,5.0,3.0,Phenomenal.
5876,3078,5.0,4.0,"Zelikow is an absolutely phenomenal lecturer. This, mixed with the interesting subject matter of WWII, his insightful nature, and a bit of comic relief, has made him by far the best professor I've had. The catch is that there are really only two grades (both papers). However, if you have gone to class and are able to write well, you should be fine."
5877,3078,5.0,2.0,"As long as you do the readings, this class is a breeze, but Zelikow's lectures are some of the best at UVA"
5878,3078,5.0,4.0,"Incredibly knowledgeable about the stuff he teaches. Phenomenal lecturer and in discussion (seminars). I've taken both a 15 person seminar on The Rise of Liberalism and the much larger History of American War from WWI on with him and both were amazing. It's a good amount of writing, but you don't need to memorize any tedious stuff for tests."
5879,3078,5.0,4.0,"Zelikow is one of the most interesting professors I have had. He has served several high level positions in the government and uses his experiences in the lectures. This class requires about 100-150 pages worth of reading each class, with a weekly quiz on it. The midterm and final are both 12 page papers. The discussion section was engaging as well"
5880,3078,2.5,4.0,He is very knowledgeable and clearly loves to teach history. The class is demanding with one 75 min lecture and then a few hours a week of watching lecture videos and then a few hours of reading. There are weekly online quizzes & class quizzes based on videos & readings. Several papers and grades depend on your TA. Exams are written to confuse you.
5881,3078,5.0,3.0,very smart! relatively approachable. Love the online lectures.
5882,3078,5.0,1.0,He is a gorgeous teacher!
5883,3078,5.0,1.0,"He is an excellent MOOC professor: clear, suggestive and engaging"
5884,3078,5.0,3.0,"Prof Zelikow is one of the most respected authors about history and American politics. He´s class is a must, even if you are online or only in internship"
5885,3078,4.5,2.0,Very Smart
5886,3078,4.0,4.0,Tests are very very tough and requires you to read or skim over all readings since that is what they are based on. I didn't have study much (or at all) for the exams because I did the readings.He is a good lecturer but lectured on things I was not interested in. I did well but would not take this again.
5887,3078,3.0,3.0,"This is the first time Zelikow has done this class, and it's... challenging. There is a TON of reading for each class and supplementary reading quizzes. You MUST read for the two Midterms. Lectures are neither bad or good. If you're in love  with History, I suppose it wouldn't be awful, but otherwise the readings are overwhelming."
5888,3078,5.0,3.0,"If you like history, all aspects from economics to politics, specifically in the 20th century, then this is the best class that you can take. It was very interesting and changed my perception of many key events and people in the early 20th century. There is a decent amount of reading that needs to be done, but it is easily managed."
5889,3078,4.0,4.0,i would never miss his class. if you like history this is where it's at.
5890,3078,4.0,3.0,"Very good teacher. His lectures are clear and easy to follow. There can be a lot of reading each week, but it can be done. Make sure to get an enthusiastic TA. Two midterms and a final, no papers, pretty specific, but if you've done the readings and go to lecture you'll be fine."
5891,3078,3.0,4.0,This class is very dry and Professor Zelikow's lectures are not interesting.  The exams require you to regurgitate the opinions of Zelikow and are not open to discussion.  I would not recommend this class to anyone unless you have a lot of background knowledge and are willing to learn a lot on your own.
5892,3078,5.0,2.0,"Extremely knowledgeable and sometimes really hilarious. His lectures are extremely well-organized and clear. A lot of reading to do, but not a lot of work in the way of papers. Tests are fairly difficult, but not unmanageable. Definitely recommended."
5893,3078,3.5,4.0,"Professor Zelikow is a big shot on Capitol Hill and was the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission.  He is extraordinarily intelligent and his lectures are crystal clear and exhilerating.  He respects students and dedicates ten minutes of every lecture to questions, but he is often inaccesible."
5894,3078,4.0,3.0,"A very clear and interesting lecturer.  Lots of reading and not necessarily easy, but definitely worth taking."
5895,3078,3.5,4.0,"he was on the 9/11 commission.  runs miller center.  get ready to read your ass off, but good lectures.  TA's are actually more arrogant than he is, which if you know him, is hard to believe.  He deserves to be, the TA's are b/c he chose them.  He is an amazing resource.  In a word, imminent."
5896,3078,4.0,2.0,"I took his WW2 class. Extremly smart, excellent lecturer, very difficult to approach. His excellent lecturing style allows the class to be easy."
5897,3078,1.0,3.0,I took several of his courses over the years and he always came across as overly pleased with his own smarminess (like how he got kicked out of Japan) and an obvious political shill...
5898,3078,5.0,3.0,"Very Intelligent, Best Professor I have had here at UVA"
5899,3078,2.5,4.0,Not approachable at all and seems more into research than teaching
5900,3078,5.0,2.0,Most intelligent professor I have ever had.
5901,3078,3.0,4.0,Very intelligent and knowledgable. Not approachable.
5902,3078,5.0,3.0,No Comments
5903,3078,5.0,4.0,Probably the smartest professor I have ever had.
5904,3078,4.5,2.0,"good communicator, likes to teach"
5905,3078,4.5,3.0,"very interesting, excellent lecturer"
5906,1190926,5.0,2.0,"My class with Ms. North was enjoyable. As long as you pay attention and do the work, you will do well. She is my favorite."
5907,1190926,5.0,2.0,She is the most awesome teacher!  Her class rocks my world!
5908,1190926,4.0,2.0,Janice is super nice and very helpful. If you do the work and take the class seriously getting an A isn't hard at all.
5909,1051665,3.5,1.0,"I hardly went to class because he just kinda rambled, i did well in the course anyway by simply studying what i was interested in.  You get to choose what you write about so I skipped over a lot of stuff.  I guess thats a bit of a loophole"
5910,1051665,3.5,4.0,"I took professor Hitz's Leadership class for the Batten School.  We read a book each week and I enjoyed most of his choices.  However, I thought it was really impossible to finish all of the reading.  Also, I felt there was a lack of women leaders in our discussions.  I also would have liked more of a distinction between lecture and discussion."
5911,2108434,5.0,4.0,"This was a cool course on art, literature, and migration. We wrote and read comics, we had people coming to class, and the final exam was a paper. We had to choose a work of art and a literary work. It was one of the best courses I have even taken. Prof. Bonino is awesome. This class was on Zoom, but it could be in person now."
5912,2108434,5.0,4.0,"Profesora Bonino was very accommodating and understanding of the challenges of online classes and the realities and stresses of living in a pandemic. Going into the semester, I was very stressed about this course being online but she was very reassuring and was accessible for all students who needed her. She genuinely cares for her students."
5913,2108434,5.0,3.0,Profesora Bonino was a fenomenal teacher. She is extremely approachable and is always willing to help. She makes class discussion fun and inviting. No one in the class was afraid to participate because she was so helpful in and outside of class. The best Spanish teachers I have ever had.
5914,2108434,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bonino is absolutely the best teacher I have ever had. She is funny, intelligent , and engaging. Her explanations are super clear and interesting. I have learned a whole lot in her class. She is super prepared. I definitely recommend her."
5915,2108434,5.0,3.0,Nicole is the best Professor I have ever had. Very fun and smart. She is available outside of class and makes everything easy to understand and relaxing.
5916,289809,4.0,1.0,"Reading generally optional. Very little discussion, mostly lecture from Tolczyk. Interesting lectures but amazingly monotone voice; make sure to take a nap before class to avoid taking one during class. Doesn't seem to particularly care about the class. Very few mandatory assignments graded fairly generously. Brilliant professor, take this class."
5917,289809,5.0,3.0,Very well spoken highly educated and intuitive prof. Doesn't hurt that he's really handsome too   Take his class Interesting readings and philosophical thoght
5918,289809,4.0,1.0,Great class. Mostly watched Polish films. Grade is based on a short-answer midterm and a 6-10 page paper on the topic of your choice. If you show up and take decent notes you should do well.
5919,289809,4.5,2.0,"A brilliant professor with a wealth of knowledge on various Eastern European topics(esp. Poland).  The class is refreshing, with most primary sources being films. Attending class will ensure a very good grade."
5920,289809,5.0,2.0,"Fascinating class, great material, and he's really, really smart & well spoken (cute accent a bonus).  Almost a guaranteed A-, but he does get behind the syllabus. Go to class and participate, you will be rewarded--material & prof. an intellectual pleasur"
5921,781341,1.0,4.0,"Faith and Doubt is a worthless class. First, there is no faith involved whatsoever, and all you do is read nonsensical philosophy which she rambles about for an hour twice a week. Discussions were helpful, but then they didn't even help my grade. Ferreira was incredibly vague about the grading system. This class is a waste of time."
5922,781341,1.0,5.0,Faith and doubt is TERRIBLE. She rambles on about philosophy incomprehensibly for an hour and it's awful. The only way to pass is to get a good TA because she makes literally no sense.
5923,781341,5.0,4.0,I absolutely loved taking Faith and Doubt with Ferreira. She was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject. Despite what people say she really isn't against faith. The class really makes you evaluate what and why you believe or do not believe. I wish she was my grandmother! She is the best professor I have had at UVa!
5924,781341,3.5,4.0,"Overall nice teacher. Seems a little bitter towards religion and faith. Readings were manageable and interesting. Very important to attend lectures b/c test material is derived directly from what she says in class. Very interesting subject material. Highly recommend, but its not for the weak of heart or faith."
5925,781341,1.5,3.0,"Interesting subject material. Classes are necessary to attend. I was very interested in the subject matter and initially liked the professor a lot but I have changed my mind since attending office hours. When a personal issue came up that conflicted with an exam, she was unwilling to help out at all. Thanks for the great student teacher relations."
5926,781341,5.0,3.0,I took her Existentialism seminar and loved it.  The best class I took at UVA.  She is a wonderful professor and person.
5927,781341,5.0,3.0,AWESOME!! I want to be Prof Ferreira when I grow up. She's brilliant and her lectures are clear and interesting. She can seem a bit intimidating at first but go talk to her; she's very committed to student learning.
5928,781341,4.0,3.0,"This is basically a philosophy of religion class. Fair amount of reading, and lectures are very important not to miss, but I got a lot more out of this class than I expected. She is a good teacher, and this class was very interesting to me."
5929,1322013,4.0,3.0,"Very sweet guy, extremely intelligent, but sometimes he moves a little fast. He's shy, so be sure to see him in office hours if you want extra help - he'll definitely provide it. Overall a good TA if you make the effort to get extra help."
5930,1322013,1.0,4.0,"HORRIBLE TEACHER! He seemed like a very nice guy and is definitely brilliant, but should NOT be teaching ever ever ever! He moves very fast without making sure concepts are explained clearly. I had never taken calc before and struggled to understand the concepts at the speed that he moved. Very poor in explaining things in different ways."
5931,1322013,3.5,3.0,"he's a shy guy, but super smart. almost too smart to teach it but he's a fair grader and a really talented guy."
5932,1322013,1.0,5.0,No Comments
5933,134194,1.0,5.0,"Prof. Holt was the rudest instructor I ever had at UVA. The course was graded on 3 assignments (2 exams and a paper). My exams were graded by TA's, but he graded the paper. His feedback was unprofessionally harsh, rude, and discouraging - the exact opposite of constructive criticism. He was the only professor to ever give me such horrible feedback."
5934,134194,4.5,3.0,"Professor Holt is GREAT.  I took Coming of the Civil War, The Civil War and Reconstruction, and wrote my thesis for him.  Great teacher with a very unique theory of history that is very well thought out.  A classic old boy with a great attitude."
5935,134194,4.5,4.0,"Holt is an amazing professor. There is a fair bit of reading, and the prospect of only 3 grades is scary, but you can succeed if this is your primary history class of the semester. DONT miss a chance to take a class with him! The man is a legend. He's taught at Yale and UVa for probably 40 years combined, and knows this era better than anyone."
5936,134194,3.0,5.0,"Holt is a his way or the highway kind of guy who grades grammatical errors more than content.  Ridiculous amount of useless reading.  Lectures are often unclear.  He knows his stuff, but this class was the worst US history class I've taken at UVA."
5937,134194,2.5,5.0,Really interesting class. Lots of reading.
5938,134194,4.0,5.0,"It's an awesome class, but you really have to do the reading! Also, it's a plus if you are interested in US history."
5939,134194,4.0,4.0,"I learned a ton in Holt's class.  Lectures were always interesting.  That said, you have to read a ton of material, ~300 page book per week.  And you need to do all the reading, and study a lot for the tests to do well.  I put the most work that semester into HIUS 307, and got a B+, but learned a lot."
5940,134194,4.0,3.0,"prof. holt is amazing. i highly recommend him. he is extremely animated and isn't afraid to swear or pound something to emphasize a point. if you go to lecture, pay attention, and do most of the reading, you'll be fine. there's a midterm (30%), a paper (30%) and a final (40%). if you get the chance, take prof. holt's class- you won't regret it!"
5941,134194,4.5,1.0,"Holt is the best professor at U.Va., and I'm not even a history major.  Coming of the civil war is such a fun & interesting class, and the exam is surprisingly easy."
5942,134194,4.0,3.0,"Coming of the Civil War has been the best history class I have taken so far.  The reading, when compared to other history classes is not overwhelming---about one book every 10 days."
5943,134194,4.5,3.0,Holt is a very animated and entertaining professor.  His lectures are interesting and fun due to his constant barrages and outbursts.  He has his quirks and is definitely set in his opinions but I really enjoyed this class.  It wasn't too hard if you put in the work and I enjoyed hearing him berate other historians.
5944,134194,4.5,2.0,"He's an awesome lecturer, no doubt, but a bit staunch in his opinions. Despite this, he's still fairly open to new ideas on exams and papers. His viewpoint on the subject is certainly thought provoking, and his animated character keeps class interesting."
5945,134194,4.5,3.0,"Great lecturer, clearly knows what he's talking about and made an otherwise rather dull subject enjoyable. Lots of reading, though..."
5946,134194,2.0,2.0,Blah Blah Blah - His way or the highway kind of prof.  he knows a bunch but you better agree with him or else.  Takd Gallager instead
5947,134194,5.0,3.0,"History majors, those with a mild interest, everyone should take this class!  Holt is an excellent lecturer and it's well worth waking up to hear him yell at long-dead political actors and historians.  Very well organized.  You will come out of the class with a very thorough understanding of the era, guaranteed."
5948,134194,4.0,2.0,Holt is pretty awesome.  His class is not too hard and he is a good lecturer.  Pretty much ditto to what everyone else already said.
5949,134194,4.0,4.0,"Professor Holt's lectures are often entertaining, but only take this class if you're interested in American history. Paper is tough and so are the exams but if you do the work you can get the grade."
5950,134194,4.5,3.0,Perhaps one of the most under rated  professors in the History depart. by students...a fantastic lecturer and a must for any american history major.
5951,134194,5.0,4.0,"Professor Holt is a GREAT Professor.  Lectures are very interesting and very funny.  Professor Holt uses &quot;colorful&quot; language to spice things up, and he does not care about political correctness.  In other words, he uses every available method to teach history to his students.  Also, it is worth  going to his office hours  He is very funny."
5952,134194,5.0,2.0,"Holt is awesome! Anyone interested in political history, Coming of the Civil War is one of the best political history courses there is."
5953,134194,5.0,3.0,"Excellent professor.  Makes the material very interesting.  By far my favorite prof. so far at UVA.  Even though the class meets at 9:00 MWF, it is WELL worth it.  Highly recommended."
5954,134194,4.0,3.0,No Comments
5955,134194,4.5,4.0,"Coming of the Civil War is an eye-opening class with Holt.  And he's a HILARIOUS lecturer, especially if you can catch him with a small class (try during the summer)."
5956,134194,5.0,3.0,"I took Holt a long time ago, a little after the Civil War ;-).  Great professor, one of my most memorable. Never cared about CV before, but since his class I still visit battlefields and read CW books.  Made CV come alive. Still communicate via email."
5957,134194,3.5,3.0,Wonderful course material.  Incredible lecturer!!!  Very funny.
5958,1076277,3.5,1.0,One of the better PHYS professors at UVa
5959,1076277,4.0,3.0,Professor Yoon was very enthusiastic during lectures and his midterms were relatively straightforward. Homework required TA assistance most of the time. Final exam was killer.
5960,1076277,1.5,5.0,Yoon is not professional at all in class and in office hours. he didn't care about his students.
5961,1076277,1.0,4.0,"It is clear that Dr.Yoon was learning C/C++ together with us, but that's not what I want to complain. What he really needs to pay attention to is his communication skills with students. Whenever his mistakes were pointed out by students, he became mad and tried to hide his false."
5962,1076277,1.0,4.0,He is mean and boring. His son appeared in class several times.
5963,1076277,5.0,4.0,No Comments
5964,2657344,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors Ive had at Uva. I took his 316house class in the fall of 2020. I received an excellent grade but I know that some of my classmates did not. It was a really difficult class but I feel like it was very fair. The matchies were really hard tbh. I would definitely take DOPE9980 again though!
5965,1403969,5.0,3.0,"Very smart guy, and it shows. Understands very quickly what students are asking, and is able to answer questions really effectively. Tests are tough, but hw balances that out. Learned quite a bit from him."
5966,1403969,3.0,4.0,"Definitely an extremely smart guy. His teaching is pretty good, but it is sometimes hard to understand the content he is teaching. He tends to make the exams pretty lengthy and challenging. Hard class."
5967,1403969,3.0,4.0,"This was a frightening introduction to college level math. Though Tom is a hilarious guy who clearly knows the material, he teaches it as if you already know it too. It wasn't 'till the end of the semester that I figured out to understand the lectures you had to have already read that section in the book. Once I figure that out it wasn't so bad."
5968,1403969,3.0,4.0,"Calc3 was way harder than I expected. Professor Mark knows his stuff, but I think he might be too smart for the class and often breezed through things. He's a quirky but likeable guy, though I'm certainly not going to be a math major after taking this class."
5969,1043532,5.0,4.0,He lectures but the lectures are easy to follow and understand.
5970,1043532,3.0,5.0,Tim's humor kept a dry subject interesting and he sure looks good in a tight pair of khakis!
5971,1043532,5.0,1.0,"He has a lottttttttttt of patience, probably too much, even with rude students, and teaches verrrry slowly so that everyone understands.  Couldn't ask for a better professor."
5972,1043532,5.0,3.0,No Comments
5973,1895512,5.0,3.0,"I honestly kinda liked this class. But Prof. Woo is a great teacher who really cares about students and is very helpful in office hours. Labs are easy, just show up. HW is not too bad and make sure to do practice problems he sends out to prepare for exams. I have heard is one of the more annoying Stat classes, so it gets cooler after 2120!"
5974,1895512,5.0,4.0,"Woo is a really caring guy. I really struggled in his class but he grades in a way that you can still do well if that's the case, and is always around to help outside of class if you need it."
5975,1895512,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Woo is awesome. His material is very straight forward, his lectures are to the point and are very beneficial to attend because he gives relevant examples that help a ton with homework and studying for exams. He provides everything you need to get an A in his class just show up and do the work it's not super hard plus he's witty."
5976,1895512,5.0,2.0,"Good class, although somewhat boring.  Professor Woo is really easy compared to other statistic class.  I would say it is one of the few easy A classes as UVa.  But make sure it is him, not other professors.  Otherwise, this is not applicable."
5977,1895512,5.0,2.0,I took his stat 5120 last semester and it was great. There were lots of practical labs and really made me learn a lot. And Jeff is extremely helpful.(in his office almost all the time). stat 5170 is less interesting but still a good class.
5978,2321497,5.0,3.0,"She's one of my favorite teachers and you really get to know her throughout the semester because of how small the class is. She knows how to moderate workshop feedback well and encourages class participation. There is 1 writing assignment per week, and those can be edited and turned in again. I learned a lot about myself as a writer in this class."
5979,2337889,1.0,5.0,"HW never returned-Only a grade posted online. Forced to compare his cryptic solutions against your HW to find errors. Solutions not always correct. No HW grading rubric provided, so expect mystery points deducted. 3 HW ungraded before final exam. Evident that course is his lowest priority. Assigned problems before reading them. Made learning harder"
5980,1051751,2.5,2.0,"Speaks French in class only 60% of the time, directions are always unclear, has the students teach half the classes, completely disorganized. My french actually got worse."
5981,1051751,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Hommel is the nicest man ever. that is all there is to say. He makes the subject of Qubec lit super interesting, cares an inordinate amount about his students, and will do all in his power to make you interested and engaged with the material. TAKE this class! Prof. Hommel is GREAT!"
5982,1051751,2.5,4.0,"Nice man, but very unorganized and unclear about assignments. He doesn't openly welcome differing viewpoints and is very harsh when correcting mistakes. Class schedule is repetitive and monotonous. His tests are very random, so you never know what to truly study. Get ready to write...a lot."
5983,1051751,2.0,3.0,He seemed alright at the beginning but quickly became disorganized.  It would take a long time to get grades back and there was always confusion abuot topics and due dates.  Not a super difficult class but not a good one either.
5984,1051751,2.5,3.0,I did well in this class but I did not enjoy it at all. The professor was very disorganized and grading seemed almost completely arbitrary. This class was disappointing because the professor was unclear about his expectations and did not communicate well about grading or any of the assignments. he was also not welcoming of original opinions
5985,1051751,4.0,2.0,"Great Professor, keeps class interesting and fun and a fair grader. You will enjoy it and the workload is perfect if you are not a French major."
5986,1051751,4.0,3.0,"I love Hommel. So funny and really gets class to laugh, know each other and have fun! Much better than Hopwood I have heard. Tests can be funky and studying doesn't really help all that much. Definitely reccommend taking a class with this prof!"
5987,2313326,5.0,5.0,good guy
5988,2755698,1.0,4.0,Don't take this class. Ever
5989,1559690,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Paschke is a really good professor, and really helpful. Runs demos and answers questions in class, and asks plenty of clicker questions. He writes very difficult tests, but the curve is very generous and I got a higher grade than I expected. Go to office hours, do the readings, and keep doing practice problems, and you should be prepared."
5990,1559690,5.0,2.0,Best Physics Professor I've had.
5991,1559690,4.0,3.0,"If you're taking Physics at UVA, I'm sorry. That being said, Paschke is the best man to take it with. He's incredibly brilliant and pretty good at explaining concepts. But, face it, you have to teach yourself everything out of the book."
5992,3212,4.0,3.0,"She was great and really helped me become more interested in the material. Outside of class, she was also very kind and eager to help."
5993,3212,5.0,4.0,"Cannot say that the class was easy and highly enjoyable, yet I am completely satisfied with how much knowledge I walked out with! Lots of reading due 2 theoretical nature of the subject. Negative comments r probably from those who r not into linguistics and who most likely gave her a reason to ask to drop the class."
5994,3212,4.0,1.0,"Significant amount of readings (all hit or miss), but manageable. Lectures = readings in verbal form sometimes. Ellen is pretty cool. Just 3 non-cumulative tests. SUPER interesting & SUPER applicable. Loved this class by the end of it."
5995,3212,3.5,3.0,"Boring lectures which seem more conversational than informative,but interesting nonetheless.Not much note taking goes on in class, So definitely get a good TA."
5996,3212,2.0,5.0,"Lectures were boring to me because I find linguistics confusing and very difficult. She didn't explain concepts very well, and tests were a lot more in-depth than anything we talked about in class or discussion. Every once in a while there were interesting concepts but overall, I do not recommend it.I withdrew from the class, it was horrible."
5997,3212,2.5,3.0,"boring lectures, hard to follow and difficult to understand.. tests were harder than anticipated.. dont take this if you dont have to"
5998,3212,3.0,4.0,"it is boring, and harder than you would anticipate what with it being an anthro class after all. She is  nice but not the best lecturer.  Readings are ok, but there are too many of them.  Be careful who you pick for your discussion, try them out and switch if  she/he doesn't speak english."
5999,3212,4.0,2.0,"Not a very exciting lecturer, but she picks really interesting information that keeps you awake.  A pretty linguistically inclined class, but I would reccommend it if you like learning about dif. languages."
6000,3212,4.0,2.0,"She is not the most interesting lecturer, but her classes are easy to follow and the information isn't difficult to understand.  The tests are pretty easy if you look at the study guide."
6001,3212,5.0,3.0,"Took two upper level and one lower level classes with her, and enjoyed all of them. (The lower level was a large lecture, which made it less fun.) She's very knowledgeable and personable. Recommend."
6002,3212,5.0,2.0,I had her for two small (10-20) upper-level classes and she was great.  She really knows linguistics and is excellent in both field methods and theory; both classes have well-planned progression of subject.  She's very kind if you work hard.
6003,3212,2.5,2.0,"EXTREMELY BORING. However, the tests are pretty easy. She basically gives you the questions and answers before the test. For an anth class. it is not too much reading either. About 20 pages a night."

6005,3212,2.0,3.0,worst lecturer ive ever had. dropped because i couldnt stay awake
6006,3212,1.5,3.0,Told me to my face that I should drop out of my program.

6012,2026644,5.0,5.0,"Mary Middleton is willing to work with you to help you get better. The big picture and large examples are hard to follow; however, she is really passionate and she wants everyone to succeed."
6013,2026644,4.0,5.0,"Middleton is very nice, very helpful, and extremely accessible outside of class. Unfortunately she wasn't the best at conveying the big picture of her material."
6014,68757,5.0,1.0,"McDonald is a very nice professor who, at least in this German course, was requiring attendance and participation via zoom and that's all. It's an easy A, and I recommend him."
6015,68757,5.0,3.0,Professor McDonald's class was interesting! You read King Arthur stories and he lectures about topics from them. You read parts of a story and articles related to the story. Every week you write a summary about two of the articles. There are two content quizzes (it's like a midterm and final). You write two papers too.
6016,68757,5.0,1.0,"Although the class was on Knights and Ladies in the Middle Ages, we did little in class on the subject. Rather, we had a guest speaker come in each week and talk about their college experiences which was really cool! No homework for this COLA made this class fun and interesting to go to without having to worry about grades. Recommended!"
6017,68757,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors I have ever had.
6018,68757,4.5,3.0,Herr Mac is tons of fun and really helpful DANKE! :D
6019,68757,2.5,3.0,This was a pretty easy class and the homework was short and simple. We pretty much just learned and practiced grammar for homework and then did a work sheet on it in class. We watched 2 movies and wrote a paper before every test. The only problem was that the teacher cannot speak german as well as I think a language teacher should.
6020,68757,5.0,1.0,Don't know German&#63; Who cares!&#63; Take this class and you will afterwards. Great Prof. This man is the only human that makes grammar fun!
6021,68757,4.0,3.0,"He's insane, but fun. Class was not very structured though, which definitely hindered my ability to learn (or relearn in my case).  You get a break during class and are let out early (for TR at least)."
6022,68757,4.5,2.0,"This man is the first and thus far only professor that i feel has truly reached his hand out and really try and want to help his students.  He may be the best teacher on grounds, you cant help but love the guy, and you will have to try not to learn something, to boot. Take any class you can with him"
6023,68757,3.0,3.0,"Sorry, I'm the only one so far with this opinion, but I did not care for Professor McDonald at all. His grading on essays seemed to be arbitrary and capricious. I started off doing very well and without any change in effort on my part, my grades slid. He wasn't overly friendly-can't recommend him!"
6024,68757,4.5,4.0,"He is very crazy, but in a good way.  (It will wake you up in the morning.)  He helps you when you need it and encourages questions and participation.  I found his tests to be very difficult, but occasionally they were open notes.  I can't promise that will always be the case though."
6025,68757,5.0,1.0,"Always a good time in class Definitely recommend Herr Mac to anyone. He makes you wonder, and you may not know what to think the first day, but you wont be disappointed by the end of the term."
6026,68757,5.0,3.0,"TAKE THIS CLASS AND EVERY OTHER CLASS WITH HERR MAC. he is crazy, entertaining and the best."
6027,68757,5.0,1.0,"Herr Mac is the best!  Seriously, he is so personable and just a genuinely NICE professor.  TAKE HIS CLASSES.  He rocks.  You will not be disappointed."
6028,68757,4.0,2.0,a great course for anyone even remotely interested in languages; a great prof who really knows his stuff and can pinpoint any difficulties you are having
6029,68757,5.0,2.0,"Very enthusiastic, great prof. Can teach anyone german. Won't be disappointed."
6030,68757,5.0,1.0,I took his Honor and Honor Codes class and it was awesome!
6031,68757,4.0,4.0,"He's a very enthusiastic teacher, makes even German grammar fun"
6032,68759,5.0,3.0,He's incredible. Would take again.
6033,68759,5.0,3.0,"I took this class my first semester and loved it. There are just two 3-page papers and two take-home closed-book exams (pretty much short essays which you're allowed to type). Professor Connolly loves what he teaches and brings a lot of depth to discussion. It's a lot of reading, but a pretty easy A/A- if you do read!"
6034,68759,4.5,2.0,"Professor Connolly is one of my favorite professors at UVA. This was my second class with him, I loved the first one so much, I had to take another. He is extremely passionate about the subject and makes Russian literature (which can be a little dark and dry) come to life in his lectures. Papers aren't hard if you attend lectures."
6035,68759,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic"
6036,68759,5.0,2.0,AmazingggggG!
6037,68759,5.0,2.0,"Connolly is hilarious, energetic and extremely knowledgable. Although he doesn't take attendance, he goes over important themes and info from the books in detail in lecture so going definitely helps on the exams. His class was my favorite last semester--I wish he could teach all my classes!"
6038,68759,5.0,3.0,"Lots of reading, but worthwhile. Connolly is super smart and an excellent lecturer. He's very passionate about what he does, and it's contagious! Great class, a painless way to learn Russian Literature."
6039,68759,4.5,4.0,Knows what he teaches.
6040,68759,5.0,4.0,So helpful. One of the nicest people I know. OVERWHELMINGLY reminds me of Shaggy from Scooby Doo.   Take any of his classes
6041,68759,5.0,1.0,No Comments
6042,68759,5.0,3.0,"awesome teacher -- so into it! he knows his stuff, and makes it interesting. very willing to listen to anyone's interpretations, answer questions in and outside of class. very funny and nice and charasmatic. i learned a great deal in this class."
6043,68759,5.0,4.0,"Awesome lectures, interesting teacher. A lot of reading, but not that hard of a class."
6044,68759,5.0,4.0,"His lectures are very clear and he makes some good insights, a definite A++!"
6045,1600669,5.0,4.0,"This professor is a rare specialist.  I learned more than anticipated about a very broad subject area.  I hope the University will offer Native American Studies courses.  The readings were challenging as they were written by anthropologists, archeologists, novelists, and others from various disciplines.  I heartily recommend the film &quot;Reel Injuns.&quot;"
6046,1600669,5.0,3.0,"This class and professor was great! Although not the easiest, you can get a good grade if you work at it. The readings were varied and interesting, and Wood brought in speakers and utilized media well. It is a great holistic course as we addressed history, archeology, culture, and current issues. Eye-opening and very worthwhile."
6047,1600669,5.0,3.0,"Prof Wood did a great job teaching North American Indians. I wanted something interesting and different to take 4th year and this turned out to be an awesome class. Prof Wood was always prepared with informative lectures. Tests were not too hard, and there was opportunity for significant extra credit if you happened to mess up. Take it!!"
6048,1600669,1.0,2.0,"Was not very knowledgeable, most lectures were taken directly from wikipedia. Her slides were walls of text that she quickly read through and changed. I attended class but there was no point as these slides could just be downloaded. Taught lots of contradicting material w/o addressing contradictions. This class was a waste of time with this prof."
6049,1633440,4.5,2.0,"The class was not very hard overall, especially if you put the time and effort into studying for tests. Definitely utilize office hours! He holds several a week and provides a lot of information that he does not specify in class. He gives out two homework assignments a week; the written one is hard unless you ask questions at office hours."
6050,2559144,4.0,2.0,"Professor Reid is excellent at using composition assignments to build on concepts explored in lectures. Additionally, her feedback is always helpful and really thoughtful. Exams are not at all difficult and so long as you do the assigned listening and set up your notecard for the exam they're quite easy. Assignments are a fair bit of work but fun."
6051,830634,3.0,4.0,"He's pretty funny and engaging. Also, very knowledgeable, but hesitant to give you all the answers since the lab is all about teaching yourself and learning from experience. It's overwhelming at first, but the class becomes enjoyable after the first few weeks."
6052,830634,4.0,2.0,"I really thought Laufer was a good professor.  I had mixed feelings about him throughout the semester, but he was an effective teacher, and if you put in the effort, it paid off.  He tries to make class as entertaining as possible and succeeds 50% of the time, but it's Thermodynamics.  Overall, one of the better professors I have had."
6053,830634,4.0,4.0,"Laufer is an excellent teacher. This past Spring 07, he did this grading system where a substantial part of your grade (~50% or something like that) was based on a weekly quizzes which were very doable if you read and listened in class. Homeworks were sometimes tough, but the TA sessions were helpful."
6054,830634,4.5,3.0,"He is helarious, and interested in his students well being.  Will not curve the class, so study for the tests.  Beware, don't use the solutions manual. He caught several people in honor offenses b/c a couple of the solutions are wrong! I loved him and got an A on both the midterm and final because I went to class and did not use a solutions manual."
6055,830634,3.5,5.0,Well...you have no choice you have to take it with Laufer.  He is absolutely adorable and he's fun to listen to in class.  Sometimes he rambles so its hard to follow...oh and you'll fail your first test.  But don't worry I'm sure it all works out in the end.  Over all its a pretty interesting class
6056,830634,2.0,5.0,sadly you have no choice...except...get out of mech/aero while you still can
6057,1068202,3.0,4.0,"Carolyn cares about her students, is exceptionally well organized, an expert at the art of teaching AP Language and Composition, is consistently prepared for class, provides several resources for her students, and is well dedicated. Only criticism is she needs to be less judgemental. Everyone in the class grew as an English student by years end."
6058,1068202,2.5,4.0,"In the beginning of the year, she seems crazy strict and organized. However, over time you realize she can be a pretty funny person as well. She assigns a good amount of homework and writing, but as long as you do it she likes you. She does choose favorite however, so make sure you are on her good side or she will make your year terrible."
6059,1068202,1.5,5.0,Eh she will destroy u and call your family if you are late to class. And better get ur work ready or a pop quiz.
6060,1068202,3.5,4.0,She is hard to get a handle on at first.  DON'T EVER BE LATE! She has a weird thing about being on time.  She likes it when you talk to her.  Life is so much easier if you just meet with her and get to know what she wants.  Give her what she wants and the class is easy.  A ton of writing required though for an ENWR level class...watch out.
6061,1068202,1.0,5.0,"She attacks you as a person instead of your writing. The rare times she does attack your writing, its only negative feedback, and she doesnt explain how to fix it. She also lowers your grade if she doesnt agree with your claim. She belittles the class, and holds everyone to unachievable standards."
6062,994476,1.0,3.0,"I had the displeasure of working with Jane Boatner in ENWR 1508. It was possibly the worst experience of my UVa education. She's disorganized, boring, and standoffish. Moreover, she relies too heavily on email to make important announcements related to class policies, expectations, and assignments."
6063,994476,4.0,1.0,"quite easy class, someone said she is boring, well, the class is not interesting, but easy grade and she focuses on your writing a lot. she is nice"
6064,994476,2.0,2.0,"Extremely boring class. First, I think this course is tedious in nature since it heavily focus on writing skill (ENWR 105 was far more interesting). Second, Ms. Boater is a fairly nice person, but unfortunately not a great teacher. The only good thing was that I didn't have to put much effort, so it was a pretty sweet 4 credit course."
6065,994476,2.5,4.0,"very nice but boring, and i just feel an urgent necessity to go to rest my eyes.can never get enough and eventhough lets you repeat essays and fix them she can give you a worse grade"
6066,1199283,4.0,3.0,Professor Akhtar is a solid choice for Ethical Values at Georgetown University. You have to participate at least once a class to get good grade. She gives you plenty of time to participate. Pick a good group at the beginning of the semester because most of the grade is based on a group project. One final which is fair. She has great knowledge.
6067,1199283,2.0,1.0,"Her class is a joke, would not recommend unless u want to waste 150 mins a week, take someone else there are a lot of better options."
6068,1199283,5.0,2.0,Professor Akhtar is the kindest woman and cares so deeply about the experience students are having in her class. She makes class extremely engaging and readings are interesting. The courseload is light but make sure you pick a good project group because the group project has three parts and constitutes almost all of your grade.
6069,1199283,5.0,3.0,"Sahar is so knowledgable in her field, and a wonderful human bring to boot."
6070,1199283,4.5,1.0,Very nice professor and good readings. Not a hard class but rewarding. I think the class would also depend on how engaging the class discussions are. Participate and you'l have fun. Get her to show more animal vids! :)
6071,1297588,5.0,2.0,"This class was fantastic. Walt taught me how to look at globalization through so many different lenses. This class is a great mix of academic readings and creative pieces, such as films and novels. It's really discussion based, and Walt loves talking to students and is one of the most enthusiastic and caring teachers I've ever had. Take this class!"
6072,1297588,5.0,2.0,Great T.A.! Super enthusiastic and really helped make a class filled with boring lectures better. TAKE ANYTHING YOU CAN WITH WALT! You won't regret it
6073,1297588,5.0,1.0,"If the name Walt doesn't make you feel poetic already, after taking his class even the biggest poetry skeptic will appreciate poetry. He makes himself available to help whenever you need him. His comments on papers really helped improve my writing skills. Also, he is adorable! Take anything you can with Walt!"
6074,1297588,5.0,1.0,"Walt is so energetic and it's clear he adores his subject.  He was very enthusiastic and made us excited to come.  He is very helpful if you have an emergency and gives extensions.  He is a hard paper grader.  Very light assignment load compared to other ENLT classes.  I hate poetry, but he helped me appreciate it.  TAKE THIS CLASS!"
6075,1297588,5.0,1.0,"I loved his class, he's so much fun! Take any of his classes and i'm sure you'll love it!"
6076,2616501,4.0,4.0,"Super nice professor! She was a great teacher and presented the material clearly. The tests grades were padded with homework, participation, and extra credit grades and she drops the lowest quiz grades. Not flexible with grades."
6077,2616501,5.0,3.0,Great Prof
6078,2616502,5.0,3.0,Prof Nobles was incredibly knowledgable and always offered great feedback and advice on papers. She is also incredibly accessible outside of class (via text!) and always answers any questions/concerns have promptly. I enjoyed this course more than I thought I would (lol) and it definitely helped me polish my writing skills.
6079,2280636,5.0,4.0,"I got my lowest college exam grade (42) on first test, but went to office hours and doubled my score on the next. SHE WILL HELP YOU! Everyone says the class is ridiculously hard, but not with office hours. She is incredibly sweet, genuinely cares, and that class prepared me more than any other I've taken for the MCAT. Thanks Dorothy!!"
6080,2280636,1.0,5.0,"Schafer is notorious for good reason. Her lectures are difficult to follow and frequently runs slides out of order, very quickly, or not at all. Her exams are unreasonably difficult and rely disproportionately on details, and her questions policy intentionally discourages questions during exams. Take this in the chem department at all costs."
6081,1297600,5.0,3.0,"Swahili 101 and 102, taught by Ann Githinji, were marvelous.  She is a spectacular teacher and keeps her students involved through interesting assignments.  These courses are challenging enough to be interesting, but not frustrating.  I am so glad I took these classes.I cannot recommend them enough!"
6082,928965,5.0,4.0,"He knows what he's talking about and is very approachable inside and outside of class. He covers stuff that's difficult, but if you ask questions etc. he'll clarify."
6083,928965,1.5,5.0,"All I need to say is this: at the end of the semester, not a soul applauded Mr. Stern. He is undoubtedly the worst professor and the worst class I've had at UVa. Stern just seems to like solving problems with math that most of his students can't do, and it has no relation to the real world. You will learn nothing. Do not take this class."
6084,928965,4.0,5.0,"This is a hard class, but the curve at the end is not that bad.  Professor Stern can be a little intimidating, but he knows what he's talking about.  Take this class from him if you actually want to learn the subject."
6085,928965,2.0,5.0,"Expect large amount of work, unfair grading, he doesn't seem to enjoy teaching undergrads. Knowledgable professor but not a good teacher."
6086,928965,2.5,5.0,No Comments
6087,2002125,1.0,4.0,"He was an alright teacher. He seemed very unapproachable, but if you ask for extra help, he will try his best. But when teaching the material, he was moving a little too fast for most of us. "
6088,2002125,5.0,4.0,"Took him at U of Richmond. He takes the time to make sure every question is thoroughly answered no matter how dumb they are(and trust me, he had his fair share). He works by a 6-point scale and includes +s and -s so it's difficult to get an A, but is super flexible with due dates. Make sure you buy the books or you're sure to fail. Tough, but great"
6089,1739984,4.0,3.0,"As much as I like Prof Mark, his mode of teaching was much too slow for me. Also, he taught Grasshopper and Vray but he didn't teach us the logic of the programs as much as he told us, &quot;now click that button, now click this button, etc&quot;. His other classes are popular, though, I think...."
6090,1739984,5.0,3.0,"Best Professor at UVa. He doesnt waste a single moment of class by actually focusing on teaching, which is rare in a creation/technical field at a large university, yet hes very patient and willing help until all the students understand. Hes also pretty hilarious."
6091,1739984,4.5,2.0,"Earl Mark is a GREAT professor! He is very helpful and approachable.  In class he can get a little boring in lectures, but tells a funny corny joke from time to time.  You don't really have to go to lectures, the discussions are all you need to help you complete the assignments."
6092,1838287,4.5,3.0,"She's quirky, very helpful, and easy to talk to.  It can be an easy A if you actually do the work and get help.  This was the most I've enjoyed taking a Spanish class since freshman year of high school. "
6093,1838287,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING TA! She's super fashionable, so so witty, and her classroom activities are the best. You won't ever feel like sleeping in her class. Lots of outside work, but it's like that in all 2010 classes. She has a clear accent and always explains questions without humiliating students. I learned a ton from her, and hope to continue in Spanish!"
6094,2731215,1.0,4.0,"Zhao lectures about the importance of a growth mindset yet approaches her class with a fixed one. She claims she never makes mistakes when grading, discourages us from approaching her, and is unclear in her expectations. The material is easy, but she writes her tests so students do poorly because &quot;OB is a hard subject to master&quot; in her own opinion"
6095,2731215,2.0,3.0,"Professor Zhao thinks way too highly of herself and has the arrogance to claim she makes no mistakes. Her class is boring, redundant, and doesn't teach anything going significantly beyond common sense. Her class is just another annoying psychology class optimized to reduce the professor's effort as much as possible."
6096,937174,3.0,4.0,"SO MUCH READING. Took this for my non-western and I really wish I'd taken something else. She is really passionate, though."
6097,937174,1.0,3.0,Attacks students in front of the class.
6098,937174,4.0,3.0,This is a good course overall and I highly recommend it for those interested in understanding pre and post independence India/Pakistan. It also gives context and insight into current issues and they history behind them.
6099,937174,5.0,3.0,"This is a great class if you want to get to understand the intricacies of modern India. Prof. Nair is extremely knowledgeable and since she has lived and worked in India, she brings a lot of real-world knowledge into the classroom."
6100,937174,4.5,1.0,I thought she had a mastery on India and its neighbors. The course gave me amazing perspective of the subcontinent and it has helped me understand the significance of the region and its importance to the world. I will take another course with her soon. 
6101,937174,4.5,3.0,I am enjoying this class and look forward to taking more of Nair's classes in the future.
6102,937174,4.0,3.0,Recommended for all social science and business majors looking to understand South Asia.
6103,937174,4.0,2.0,Good overview of the Indian sub-continent's history and politics. Highly recommended.
6104,937174,4.5,3.0,"I enjoyed this course. For a rewarding experience, be prepared to work hard and engage with Prof. Nair."
6105,937174,1.5,4.0,"It is obvious that Professor Nair is a very intelligent woman. However, she seems to be lacking in social skills, and offers no help if students seek it."
6106,937174,4.5,3.0,An insightful course. Highly recommended for those who want an insight into the modern South Asian sphere.
6107,937174,4.5,3.0,I enjoyed this class. Prof. Nair has a good understanding of her subject and makes the class interesting. I recommend it.
6108,937174,1.0,4.0,I would not suggest taking this class without prior knowledge. Need excellent writing skills. Excessive amounts of reading and lectures are difficult to follow.
6109,937174,5.0,3.0,Outstanding! I learned a lot from this class. I am enlightened.
6110,937174,3.5,4.0,"This class is great if you do the work consistently. The readings are extensive, lecture is crammed with valuable info, and Prof. Nair does expect a lot. It's definitely a challenging course but also the most rewarding. You learn how to be a good college student: don't write everything down on slides, read consistently and be active in class."
6111,937174,1.5,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Seriously she's impossible and doesn't explain anything - she expects so much prior knowledge that it's impossible to do well unless you already know the map of India and most of the concepts she discusses. She's really hard to understand also. I think it was mostly her, rather than the class - material was OK."
6112,937174,1.0,4.0,"A lot of these comments suggest that this class is an easy A, when it no longer is. Neeti has gotten stricter with her grading style, and doesn't realize that in order for the class to do well she needs to stop packing so much material on a single slide and explain concepts in a succinct manner.Only take this class, if your ok with a B or B+"
6113,937174,1.5,5.0,"Such a shame, the class not too bad as a lecture, but Prof. Nair shows a severe lack of understanding when it comes to grading. History majors: Avoid this class!"
6114,937174,4.0,3.0,A great Lecturer with great insights.
6115,937174,4.5,4.0,"Great class overall, I learned a lot. Prof Nair has the unique ability of provoking thought and discussion in class. Highly recommended."
6116,937174,5.0,2.0,"Unlike others in her field, Prof. Nair is a great teacher. She makes her class interesting, and takes a lot of effort to explain the concepts. Look forward to more of her classes."
6117,937174,4.0,1.0,"Easy class, but most of all, EXTREMELY intriguing content. She turned this History major from American to definitely focusing on South Asia for the remainder of college."
6118,937174,4.5,2.0,Great lectures! She makes the material interesting and reiterates key points.
6119,937174,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Nair really knows her stuff! It's fascinating to listen to her recount stories. Don't be intimidated by all of the foreign names, they start to make sense, and she's very helpful at office hours. Her slides are wordy and it can be hard to keep up when taking notes. She will emphasize what's important, so just pay attention and you'll do well."
6120,937174,4.0,2.0,"She is really nice and really knows her stuff, but her lectures are really boring and hard to follow. Each of her slides have either 300 words o a map that is impossible to read, and she doesnt post the slides. The only pluses are she is a pretty easy grader and simple attendence is 15% of the grade, you don't have to pay attention."
6121,937174,4.0,2.0,"She definitely knows her stuff, though at times the she loses the direction of her lectures.  However, she's very nice and really wants the student to understand the Indian subcontinent and will spend extra time in class to make a particular issue clearer.  The online readings can be very dense but she had us read a book on Cricket, which was cool."
6122,937174,5.0,2.0,"Great lecturer who leads small discussions smoothly and energetically. The readings are often dense so class is a perfect opportunity to come, share whatever thoughts you had, on whatever you COULD understand, and to go from there.  Papers and discussion memos are wide open to indepedent analysis, there is no one right answer.  Highly recommended."
6123,937174,4.0,3.0,Interesting class. Professor Nair is an awesome lecturer; highly worthwhile because she provides some interesting insights.
6124,2239712,5.0,3.0,"10/10 recommend this class regardless if you are in Curry or not. Professor Resch comes to lecture every day ready to engage students and teach passionately. He makes a real effort to learn each students' name and engage them. The tests are typical UVa, but there is enough other grades to ease the pain. TAKE THIS COURSE"
6125,601323,5.0,2.0,"I don't know what these people below me are talking about. Professor Schenone is the BEST! Her class really isn't that difficult, but you do have to make an effort. She's great -- my favorite professor at UVA!"
6126,601323,5.0,3.0,"Excellent professor!!! Incredibly fair and helpful. She breaks down complex concepts in ways that are easy to follow and understand, and her lectures are really enjoyable! Quizzes and tests aren't too difficult as long as you do the homework. I think her class is pretty fun. Take her! You won't regret it!"
6127,601323,2.0,5.0,"Horrible teacher.  She is very unsympathetic, picks favorites, you NEVER know what is going to be on her quizzes.  She's rude and unsympathetic in person.  She says there will be a certain curve and then suddenly changes it.  I have gotten all As and A-s in college, but this was my first B-. Take Smith's class instead!"
6128,601323,4.5,1.0,"I dont know what happened between last year and this year, but Prof. Schenone is amazing!  She explains things extremely well and her quizzes/tests are very easy.  People wanted to avoid her class at the beginning of the semester, but people in the other classes now wish they took her section.  One of the most enjoyable classes I've taken at UVA"
6129,601323,1.0,5.0,She seems like a nice person. She's just a very confusing teacher.
6130,601323,1.0,5.0,Simply Terrible!
6131,601323,1.0,5.0,possibly the hardest professor to understand and the exams are literally impossible
6132,601323,1.0,5.0,"Carola Schenone is hands down the WORST professor I have ever had. She freaking taught us futures and forwards backwards! At the end of the semester she more or less made up grades--- in fact, there was a petition that at least 50 of her students signed. I cannot believe they kept her for another semester. You will hate life and her Irish accent..."
6133,601323,1.0,5.0,"AWFUL exams, very unsympathetic."
6134,601323,2.0,4.0,"Not very helpful, almost never had office hours and not very accomodating."
6135,1944813,5.0,3.0,"ANTH 2280 and Prof. Scherz are AMAZING. Tests are very fair, TAs are super knowledgeable and approachable, lectures are engaging (and always recorded), and I learned so much. A decent amount of reading, but you can get away with skipping an article or two as long as you go to lecture and discussion. Highly, highly, recommend Prof. Scherz."
6136,1944813,5.0,3.0,"I looked forward to every class, extremely approachable."
6137,1944813,4.0,3.0,"Professor Scherz is awesome! Even if anthropology is not your favorite subject (like me), her lecture style is fantastic and she does a great job of making it interesting. She's really funny, and is not out to trick you on test questions. As long as you keep up with the readings somewhat and pay attention in class, the tests are fine. She is great!"
6138,1944813,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Scherz is respectful, humble, and encourages discussion not just about course material but also about the school community. Engaging, fun lectures, no text, articleschapters on Collab. Was a stress-free but thought-provoking course with attendance, 3 online quizzes, and 3 short take-home essays. "
6139,1944813,5.0,3.0,"Professor Scherz is incredible. I took her class in the fall and am now taking another one of her classes this spring. She is really, really wonderful. She caters to students' needs, has accessible office hours, and loves to just chat about what your interests are. She genuinely cares about her students. PLEASE TAKE!"
6140,1944813,4.5,3.0,"I loved this class. Scherz is clearly incredibly knowledgeable of everything covered and she is passionate about spreading ideas and encouraging students to think about things critically. She is there for her students, open and receptive to feedback, and a joy to go  meet with! "
6141,1944813,5.0,2.0,Professor Scherz is a great! Her class is very straight-forward and easy especially if you do her readings.  Her readings do get long at times but discussion classes can definitely save you if you don't read.  She loves to interact with her class and she is very approachable. 
6142,2837741,2.0,2.0,"It's an easy class, but very painfully boring. I took Writing about Digital Media expecting to be able to create cool online forms of writing, but our first paper was literally writing about why an essay is considered an essay. It's an easy enough ENWR, but so brutally boring. She waits in silence for people to answer her questions and no one does."
6143,1395956,5.0,2.0,"Intro to eastern religions: Great professor with a lot of knowledge on the subject. He was approachable and very friendly. Good films and readings. Easy midterm/final. The most stress was from the paper (which is on a flexible topic) and rapid fire discussion section. The TA Jed Verity, is fabulous. I really enjoyed this class."
6144,1395956,4.5,4.0,He's really passionate about the subject and goes out of his way to help students.  His extra help sessions before exams were so helpful. GREAT teacher.
6145,945398,4.0,2.0,Very experienced in research and will share his opinions readily. Class format invites creativity and cooperation. Doesn't like giving bad grades
6146,945398,4.0,2.0,"Keller is a great professor, and the class was nice. It was a good change from other Bio classes here. He gives you the freedom to do what you want, but is also very helpful when needed. Def. would recommend."
6147,945398,1.5,3.0,A nice guy but he gave the class absolutely zero structure. No grades were given until the final grade so an idea of how one was doing in the class was impossible.
6148,945398,5.0,1.0,No Comments
6149,838909,3.0,5.0,She grades your papers all at the end of the semester so you don't know how you are faring in the class. The classes were boring at times. The workshops were helpful and her comments were nice but she's REALLY strict at grading. I remember she told us she once downgraded an A essay to a C cuz of 1 mistake. The anarchy theme can get really tedious.
6150,838909,2.0,4.0,"As was said before, she believes she is better than you. Doesnt take the time to answer your emails, won't say goodbye back to you, and offers little positive criticism. I always felt like she took joy in demeaning everyone. Not a nice person, not interesting and not good at what she does anyways."
6151,838909,3.5,3.0,"Irritating; has a holier-than-thou attitude and is passive-aggressively condescending.  Classes were pretty boring.  Not terrible--she's relatively nice, and is fair in grading, but I recommend avoiding her if possible."
6152,838909,3.0,3.0,i had no contact with her outside of class as it was something i sought to minimize; i found her difficult to be around.  needless to say i dreaded the recitation.
6153,838909,1.0,5.0,She is brutal in grading papers1!! Don't take her!!!
6154,838909,1.5,3.0,"horrible, horrible o most horrible...avoid her at all cost..."
6155,838909,3.0,1.0,"She was pretty boring, but most ENWRs are. Still, she could have at least tried to make it interesting. Shes nice enough and the class is really freakin easy. Take it for the A"
6156,3327,2.5,2.0,"Bonvillian seems like a great guy, however lectures were very boring. He rambles every class, so sit in the front if you don't want to space out. Exams are easy, and all the questions come from lecture. There are past exams on Collab as well, and he reuses some of the questions. Easy, but boring. "
6157,3327,3.0,1.0,"His lectures were pretty interesting, but he had a tendency to ramble and we didn't end up finishing all of the course material.  There was a lot of reading, but a lot of the test questions came from the book, he did put up old exams on Collab which was really helpful.  Overall, good professor, good class"
6158,3327,5.0,1.0,"By the end of the semester, I never wanted to hear about deaf people or sign language ever again. Since that's his specialty, he ties it into every single topic. The articles were really interesting, and the tests were pretty easy. He was a nice guy, although he said, ""Don't write that down!"" after every joke he told, which got old."
6159,3327,4.5,2.0,"JohnBon is sweet and jovial. He's very attentive to the success of his (many) students and wants to get to know them. He is world-renowned in his field and absolutely brilliant. I learned so much, even though he rambles just a bit."
6160,3327,3.5,2.0,"Lectures can be very very boring. Exams are very easy, he posts previous exams and they're all very similar"
6161,3327,3.0,3.0,"how to get an A: read the textbook. Even if you have to skim through it, read. Everything on the test comes straight from the textbook. I say about 80% is from textbook and 20% from lecture. He posts old exams. Do all of them and get the feel of what are the topics that he covers in his exam."
6162,3327,5.0,1.0,"I love Prof. Bonvillian. He is a gregarious ol'man with so much energy, that at times he seems a bit scattered, but give him a chance Yes, it is sometimes challenging to follow him, but even when he talks about something non related to the lecture, you still end up learning useful information.He has decades of experience I truly enjoyed his class."
6163,3327,2.5,4.0,"He rambles so much, like it's kind of ridiculous. I mean the material was interesting to start with, but as the semester drug on.. Yea it got terrible"
6164,3327,2.0,3.0,"Bonvillian is well-meaning, but his lectures are rambling and barely relevant to the material you will be tested on. There is a LOT of reading and test questions are very specific, sometimes down to one random, insignificant detail. However, he does post old tests online and he has review sections, which are helpful. Overall not the best."
6165,3327,2.0,4.0,"Tends to ramble on a lot and very hard to pay attention to.  Tests are nothing like practice tests and tend to be confusing.  Take only if you tend to go to office hours, extra study sessions, and truly examin the book, even though most tests are on lecture."
6166,3327,2.0,2.0,Don't take this class. I was super interested in psych and child psych but Bonvillian killed it for me. this class was boring and I  didn't get much out of it. I disliked lecture and the TA's were unhelpful. Stay away from this one.
6167,3327,4.5,3.0,"John Bon is a jolly old man. His lectures may seem boring to the tired-in-the-afternoon college student, but they are interesting if you attempt to keep your mind awake. He has practice tests which help a lot and his tests are pretty average. You have to have read the textbook, reader, and all class notes well if you want to do well on the them."
6168,3327,1.0,1.0,"Avoid at all costs. He wastes most of the class with barely relevant personal anecdotes. Doesn't even gloss over material from texts in lectures, but tests on minute details from the texts. If you want to learn anything you will have to 100% teach yourself out of the book."
6169,3327,3.0,5.0,"Bonvillian is nice and extremely intelligent. However, it can be really easy to zone out in class because he has no powerpoints (only outlines). He often goes off topic so it's difficult to take notes on what's important. You really have to pay attention to do well on his tests; he has questions from the books as well. Received a B in the class."
6170,3327,1.5,4.0,Do not take intro with Bonvillian. His entire lecture is him rambling about random things that come into his mind and then he tests you on the textbook chapters. Terrible class.
6171,3327,4.0,2.0,"Bonvillian's lectures can be a bit all over the place sometimes, but he has a lot of good stories. I wish his class was a bit more structured with concrete material instead of all stories. It's hard to tell what's important."
6172,3327,4.5,1.0,"While his lectures can be dull, he is a very sweet and helpful man. He is always available and eager to accommodate you. The tests are mostly lecture based and he gives you previous tests for practice. They help a lot. The tests are easy and it is definitely worth taking the class. Not the most interesting but easy."
6173,3327,2.5,2.0,"Material was interesting, except he focuses mainly on his interest in psychology. Very approachable, friendly man. Just study the old exams, and you'll do fine."
6174,3327,4.0,3.0,"He is a very nice man who wants to make it interesting, but he does come off to be a little quirky.  Once you get used to him, it's a decent class.  Not my favorite but not too hard either."
6175,3327,3.0,2.0,Extremely boring! Babbles and goes off on random tangent but the class was not difficult. Reading the book is necessary if you want to do well. I would prefer him over other psyc 101 teachers because he is the easiest. However some of his stories are hilarious and he laughs at his own jokes...
6176,3327,3.0,2.0,"Will easily bore you into a stupor; that being said, he's pretty well-renowned in his field and knows quite a few famous psychologists. Reading in this class is entirely up to you; if you do it, it's fairly intense, but as long as you go to lecture, it's not necessary. Focus on the supplemental readings, if anything. Tests aren't too bad."
6177,3327,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed this class. It could be a bit boring at times but overall it was fairly interesting. It was't too hard and after hearing some friends complain about their psyc 101, I think Bonvillian is the easiest professor of this course. He's also a very sweet and quarky guy and makes the class interesting with his stories."
6178,3327,2.5,4.0,BORING
6179,3327,3.0,3.0,"Bon-V is a little quirky, but he knows what he's talking about. Lectures can be long, but most test questions come from them. He has some interesting stories and provides previous tests to study with. He's also pretty approachable."
6180,3327,3.0,2.0,"Not exactly impressed with this guy, despite his efforts to woo us with his famous friends and acquaintances. Take this class from Nosek; Bonvillian is a truly nice guy but is a terrible lecturer. I made myself go to class and never even cracked open the textbook, did the supplemental readings, and got a B+. Not very hard, but not very interesting."
6181,3327,3.5,3.0,John Bon-- not the most interesting guy.  He's actually quite dull and I found myself really wanting to skip that class. Some days it wasn't that bad. We saw some informative videos.  Some comical ones. The class wasn't my favorite psychology class but you're sure to get a decent grade. Take NOSEK he's a better psych 101 teacher-- so i've heard!!
6182,3327,2.5,4.0,Pretty bad professor. He rambles on all class about anecdotes of his and never really finishes his lectures.  Test material is twisted information meant to confuse your knowledge.  I learned alot about psychology but did terribly in the class just because of Bonvillian's tests and final.  Being a nice guy doesn't make up for being a bad professor.
6183,3327,4.5,3.0,"Fantastic teacher. Lectures sometimes run a little long, but if you are at all interested in the subject its not too bad. Bonvillian tries very hard to make his class interesting and it shows. Heavy textbook use. Very nice guy. Highly highly reccommend this class."
6184,3327,3.0,3.0,"His lectures are entertaining and fun to go to. There isn't much homework for the class unless you want to be devoted to the readings. The exams weren't difficult as long as you studied the previous exams he posted online. Overall, it is an OK class."
6185,3327,1.0,2.0,"Lectures are painful.  The whole grade is three tests. Go to the optional review and read those powerpoints, don't waste time reading the book.  Also look at previous semester's tests."
6186,3327,1.0,5.0,terrible
6187,3327,5.0,2.0,Extremely good professor
6188,3327,3.5,1.0,I didn't go to lectures. I didn't even read the book. I only studied his previous tests and got an A for the class. REALLY easy class.
6189,3327,4.0,1.0,It's easy to get an A. I bombed the final and got a B+. It's easy and he's really nice and funny! Great intro Psyc class!
6190,3327,5.0,1.0,A great man with a limitless knowledge of psychology.
6191,3327,1.0,1.0,the most boring man i have ever listened to in my entire life. the TA's review sessions were so much more helpful and informative. so much reading to do but none of it truly relevant to the lecture or his tests. extremely easy tests. but EXTREMELY BORING
6192,3327,4.0,2.0,"Sometimes boring.  Reading the book helps but isn't necessary, and it's a LOT of reading!"
6193,3327,3.0,2.0,"Bonvillian is such a great guy. You can tell he loves what he does, and that he knows his stuff. His lectures weren't always the most interesting, and he tends to talk a lot about his research interests and other famous psychologists he knows, but the classes weren't dreadful. Make sure you read the book (well-written) and take the practice tests."
6194,3327,4.0,1.0,"Bonvillian teaches a good class, but tends to ramble lending to confusing notes sometimes. Reading the book is not mandatory however recommended. The tests are easy as long as you pay attention and read the book."
6195,3327,4.0,2.0,He's very kind. His lectures&#63; sometimes boring- let's just say most of the time.. but you have to attend lectures - that's where test questions come from.. Reading&#63;  a LOT! but just skim or read chapter summaries... Tests&#63; easy - most important: look at old tests (most of the questions come from there)
6196,3327,5.0,2.0,Bonvillian is a great professor!  He can be hilarious at times and he is just really enthusiastic all in all.  And yea if you study old tests you will do great!
6197,3327,5.0,3.0,"LOVE HIM! He's now my major advisor, and he's still one of the best professors I've ever had. His tests aren't that hard if you pay attention and look over your notes, look at the book but you don't have to. Look at old tests! they are important. He gets off topic sometimes but mostly just a wonderful teacher. very enthusiastic"
6198,3327,4.0,2.0,"The thing I love about Bonvillian is that when he knows the material he's covering is boring, he will repeat the important parts, so that if you miss something you can still catch it.  He is at times hilarious, though some days the class is very boring. Psyc is what I think college should be like: attempt to understand and you will understand."
6199,3327,5.0,2.0,"LOVE him.  I call him Jon Bon!  I would sit in the front row just to talk to him before class began.  Class CAN get a little long after a while, but the test are a breeze (even though it covers so much material). If you miss class...just get the notes from someone and do the readings.  STUDY THE OLD TESTS.  Overall a great class"
6200,3327,2.5,2.0,"USE THE OLD TESTS. I made study sheets using all the information on them and NEVER went to class (seriously)...and I got an A in the class. Old tests are key. Pretty boring lecturer, but super sweet guy. He's supposedly very respected in his field. Decent class."
6201,3327,2.5,3.0,This professors lectures mostly involved him getting off topic or talking about all the famous psychologists he knew.  Tests can be tricky because he adds random little questions from the readings.
6202,3327,4.0,2.0,"Bonvillian is a great guy, you know he wants to try and keep you interested. Some lectures were fun and insightful, some bored me to tears. Midterms were easy, final was kinda hard. I actually recommend reading the book, but don't sweat it if you don't keep up - skim it before the tests and you should be fine. Don't bother going to review sessions."
6203,3327,3.5,1.0,"Bonvillian is at his prime is a small discussion class, where he can ramble about every single researcher friend of his and people are amused. Such a sweet man and a true expert and pioneer in his field. Ask him a question and you get his life story. He is more interested in the subject than assigning work or grades, which works out well for all!"
6204,3327,3.5,2.0,"Bonvillian's a nice guy who knows a lot about psychology, but his lectures are boring and he name drops a lot, which is pretty annoying.  The tests are easy enough if you study, but expect to fall asleep in lecture."
6205,3327,2.0,2.0,"Lectures suck, don't take this class."
6206,3327,2.0,4.0,"good luck trying to follow his lectures. and i love how he doesn't even follow his own outlines. i'm a psych major so i love psychology, but i seriously freaking hated this class. Bonvillian seems like a cool guy, but he sucks at lecturing"
6207,3327,2.5,4.0,he is not a very good lecturer but the material is very interesting and you dont have many grades so you must read and keep up! he does ramble a lot of its hard to follow him :)
6208,3327,2.5,3.0,"He's a very nice man but he just doesn't know how to lecture. He was all over the place and easily lost your interest. Just read the textbook and study a lot and you will do fine, just don't expect to be interested in the lectures or him just rambling on in class."
6209,3327,5.0,3.0,He's such a cute ole' man. He's got a tremendous amount of knowledge it blows my mind. Cute little jokes during class and plenty of interesting anecdotes...
6210,3327,1.5,3.0,"Useless class.....lectures might not even exist as all you get to do in them is sleep, there is a ridiculous amount of material to read and tests cover basically none of it. Comments below say he's a nice man, who cares, I'd rather have an **** whose good to listen to and who's lectures don't suck. Waste of time."
6211,3327,4.0,3.0,"He goes off in incredible tangents talking about other psychologists he knows. Lectures are, as already mentioned, boring. What he covers in class is in the reading material which is substantial. Also, the test covers only a small portion of the reading material."
6212,3327,2.0,2.0,"This topic fascinates me, I was so excited about this class and I came out so disappointed.  He's nice enough, although a bit creepy, but his lectures are terrible - he goes into detail about random things - and SO boring.  I never went, read some and got an A, but I definitely feel like the class was a waste of my time.  I don't remember anything."
6213,3327,4.5,2.0,"Lectures are soooo boring..he handwrites outlines on an overhead so there's no visual to keep you interested. He's a really nice man and cares about students, but loves to hear himself talk/brag about the psychologists he knows. Just read the book and attend most lectures, and you'll be fine. Go to office hours and he'll help you with anything if n"
6214,3327,4.0,1.0,"nice man but lecture is incredibly boring - he always goes off into tangents about random psychologists. but really, it doesnt matter because you dont need to go at all. i stopped going after the first month and still got an a on both tests. the book is pretty straightforward and if you do the reading, youll get an a."
6215,3327,2.5,2.0,HORRIBLE TEACHER...lectures are so boring and just personal stories with him and all of the psychologists ever known to man. class is fairly easy but lecture is torturing
6216,3327,2.0,4.0,Confusing and goes off topic a lot. Beats child language to death in any of both of his classes!!
6217,3327,3.5,4.0,Very strange man....but nice. He knows a lot about the material and knows everyone that has had anything to do with child psyc in the past 50 years. the class is rather boring and he has a tendency to stray from his outline. Just read the textbook and you should be fine.
6218,3327,1.0,4.0,No info given--just stories about who he knows.
6219,3327,3.0,3.0,"lil weird guy,but very nice and sown-to-earth. His lectures r bit confusing and very boring. Almost every thing is straight out of the book. Cares alot about his students. Easy good grade if you read and listen to his lecture"
6220,3327,4.5,2.0,"kinda boring, goes off topic, but easy and an overall nice guy"
6221,3327,5.0,1.0,"Reminds me of santa claus too! He's a nice old man with a knack for making boring topics interesting. He was around when just about everything in we've talked was being researced, and has a story to tell about it.  Easy class, I've never read and have A-"
6222,3327,4.0,2.0,"Bonvillian is a really nice, down-to-earth guy who cares about his students.  Child Psych was a very informative and worthwhile class, and while the class lacked excitement, he was very knowledgable and the class was worth it.  An Easy B, if not a B+."
6223,3327,3.0,3.0,slightly confusing
6224,3327,4.5,3.0,Knows his stuff

6231,3327,5.0,2.0,I was very glad to have him instructing this class and highly recommend it
6232,1699073,4.0,1.0,"Loncke is one of these cool older profs at UVa who just does his thing and if you're into his thing he's happy to share. His exams are not hard at all, so I wouldn't have gone to lecture if it weren't for iClicker points because they get a little boring, but he's a sweet guy and makes them as funny as he can. He likes learning students' names."
6233,1699073,3.5,3.0,"Professor Loncke is a nice and approachable person. Class was easy and chill, though kind of boring to me."
6234,1699073,4.5,4.0,"Prof Loncke is so helpful and excited about speech science, it makes this ridiculous 3-hour long class bearable because he is such a great professor.  The midterm and final are moderately easy if you study the powerpoints and come to class."
6235,2723087,3.0,3.0,"Professor Dave comes across as nice, at first, but she is extremely unaccommodating, grades very harshly, and makes no exceptions to rules, regardless of the circumstances. She is way too hard on students and can be very condescending at times. I signed up for her class, hoping she'd be a helpful professor, but unfortunately, that wasn't the case"
6236,1223953,2.5,4.0,"Pr R is a very knowledgeable man in the realm of econometrics but a poor teacher. The textbook, a poor choice given the other textbooks out there, will become your guide to making it through this course. Pr R uses advanced concepts in lecture which are always followed by 'is everyone familiar with this notation' and a crowd of empty faces."
6237,1223953,4.5,4.0,"The material can be tricky; you'd do well to take this the semester following STAT 212. But Dr. Reshef, if a bit overconfident in the class at times, is extremely knowledgeable and extremely helpful. You should definitely consider taking this course if you're interested in financial econ, and Dr. Reshef is enthusiastic about it."
6238,961813,4.5,1.0,He's super funny and knows alot
6239,961813,5.0,3.0,Weimer is the best. Take PL. You know you want to.
6240,961813,4.5,4.0,"This class was fun because the TAs were awesome and I made some friends so we could all suffer the time commitment together. This class definitely sucked up my time and the tests were not easy, but Weimer rewards you with a good grade in return for selling your soul to him for the semester."
6241,961813,5.0,4.0,"The class is quite challenging and time consuming, since it's only an into level class. But Wes is absolutely a fabulous professor! He is patient, knowledgeable, humorous, and energetic all the time! He makes this class much more interesting. I recommend taking it if Wes is teaching, but be prepared for a large amount of work outside class."
6242,961813,1.5,5.0,"Wes is really nice, knowledgeable, and entertaining. But if you aren't looking to pursue CS and want to keep any semblance of a social life, do NOT take CS150. It's a ridiculous amount of work and very difficult to the non-CS minded student."
6243,961813,3.0,4.0,"Wes comes off as a fun professor at first.  But then you realize that anyone with a bag of candy and some jeopardy questions could teach this class.  It's obvious that he knows his stuff, but he's lousy at conveying that knowledge to others.  People with prior CS experience find this class easy, all others find it hilariously incomprehensible."
6244,961813,4.0,3.0,Prof.Weimer is a great professor and you will come out learning a  great deal from his class - not just about computer science but about everything in general (esp from his trivia questions). I would definitely recommend this class.
6245,961813,5.0,5.0,Excellent teacher and a challenging class.  The grading is pretty forgiving in the end though.
6246,961813,4.5,2.0,He's a very caring teacher and willing to go as far as it takes for you to understand the material.
6247,961813,5.0,3.0,"There's no way I can fit in 350 characters how great it was to have Wes as an instructor, so I'll just say this: He got me into grad school.  Some notes on the class: * Watch out for HW 5, and set reasonable sub-goals for the project. Don't overreach. * Focus on your project, and complete it in the following order: bibliography, writing, coding"
6248,961813,5.0,5.0,"Wes is an outstanding teacher. Excellent lecturer, extremely knowledgeable, extremely helpful, and very off the wall. But the class is no joke, only hardcore CS majors need apply."
6249,1363223,4.5,1.0,He's a really nice guy who's genuinely interested in philosophy. Always in a good mood and welcomed all viewpoints. Just be conscious during the discussion and you'll be fine
6250,1363223,5.0,1.0,"He teaches with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye. The subject matter feels exciting as he teaches. In small classes, he opens up the floor for debate and discussion, doing a good job of facilitating debate. He depicts ideas often through pictures and is quite an accomplished artist. Very open and approachable. I highly recommend him."
6251,44316,1.0,4.0,"Just a dreadful course. If you were to suck all the enthusiasm and joy out of the study of media, you would be left with this. The course is so ""by the book"" that it hurts. If I wanted to learn in such a manner, I would read a dictionary. No spirit, just an absurd number of pages shoved in your face with a bill at the end of the semester. Terrible."
6252,44316,3.0,3.0,"Spend as much time as possible on papers, because it is a grade that you have more control over. The midterm and final are graded very harshly.  She will state not to cite from the text too much, but she really wants you too. Lectures are boring!"
6253,44316,3.5,2.0,"She's very excited about the subject and about what the students have to offer. Make sure to participate- it was a bigger part of the grade and determined more harshly than I had expected. Do the readings, be specific, and use examples in your papers."
6254,44316,4.0,2.0,"I had a great time in this class, and learned a lot! The long lectures (at 2.5 hours every Thursday) could get a little grueling, but overall, a worthwhile course and a good teacher!"
6255,44316,4.5,4.0,"Aniko is very personable and willing to help out her students. She is very passionate and informed about the material she covers; to consider herbiased is completely missing the point. Overall, one of the best experiences I've had at UVa, and I'd definitely recommend taking a class with her if you are interested in film or television studies."
6256,44316,4.0,3.0,"She is very interested in what she is teaching, which shows in her lectures. I enjoyed the discussions and learned a lot. She is rather flighty, but that's just part of her charm! Take the course if you want to learn about the Media. If you just want an easy class, then don't take it."
6257,44316,1.0,5.0,Very unpleasant class.  Doesn't seem to know how to teach.
6258,44316,1.0,4.0,unfortunate looking. pure propaganda. uninteresting and unintelligible. ta's are complete idiots. struggles with technology. overall - horrible.
6259,44316,3.0,2.0,Way too bias. Basically a propaganda class.
6260,44316,3.5,2.0,"She gets a bad rep for her rambling against the media status quo and sometimes flightiness, but she is very helpful if you take the time to seek her out and very nice if she feels like you're trying your best."
6261,44316,4.5,4.0,"Very interesting. is a stickler about classroom distractions, but she knows her material."
6262,44316,1.0,3.0,No Comments
6263,44316,1.0,4.0,She's terrible.  Stay away.  Pure biased propaganda...she cant even get her clips to work half the time.  Learn how to use a VCR woman.  She tells you what to think and doesnt respond well to critism.  Neither do the TA's.  Just stay away if you can.
6264,44316,3.0,3.0,Pretty good. Sometimes I felt she was not willing to help if needed.
6265,44316,5.0,2.0,She is wonderful--and really nice & helpful.
6266,44316,1.0,5.0,don't take any classes with her if you can help it.

6268,707869,5.0,2.0,Tristan's lectures are very clear and interesting. He is also very funny and engaging. The class itself is pretty easy if you attend lectures and do the readings.
6269,707869,5.0,2.0,"SOC 3559: Masculinity. Fantastic professor! I had a small class with him and he is genuinely invested in the students' progress. All papers and exams allow you to demonstrate what you learned rather than taking hit/miss mult choice. He is funny, engaging with the class, and compiles interesting materials and lectures. Take him before he's famous!"
6270,707869,4.0,3.0,"He's really nice, really funny and keeps you interested in lecture. His class isn't too difficult, just make sure you actually come to lecture."
6271,707869,4.5,3.0,"Gender and Sexuality is an awesome class. Tristan is a great teacher, really nice and fun"
6272,707869,4.5,4.0,Awesome class!!! I am a SWAG Major and he completely satisfied my want for material that is relevant for majors and non majors.He is such a great professor and person. Be prepared for lots of reading and papers but the papers are on AWESOME topics!!!! &lt;3 Tristan!!!
6273,707869,4.5,4.0,I took this class with no prior SWAG background and while the material was challenging I did enjoy the concepts that I learned and the way in which I can now view issues in a different light.
6274,707869,5.0,4.0,Amazing class! Everyone should take anything he teaches!
6275,707869,3.0,5.0,"Take his class!  He is brilliant and really funny.  He is a great teacher and brings a lot of interesting ideas to class.  He is a bit of a tough grader, but your learn a lot from him.  Take him - You will enjoy going to class with Tristan!"
6276,707869,5.0,2.0,"Tristan is a really great TA. He is engaging and knowledgeable in section. Fair grader. Discussion is really interactive and fun (if you do the reading, which you will want to do because it's interesting). I really learned a lot and highly recommend taking a class with Tristan."
6277,707869,5.0,4.0,Tristan is a great teacher! He always made discussions fun and interesting. TAKE THIS CLASS!
6278,707869,5.0,3.0,"He is a GREAT TEACHER! If you don't understand the course he takes the time out of his day to help you explain what you need to know. I advise one to read all the readings he assigns..thats the most important thing about the course. He is funny, loves what he does, which makes the course even more interesting!"
6279,707869,4.5,4.0,"He's so enthusiastic about his topic and you can tell he wants everyone else to love it as much as he does.  A lot of what you take away depends on how much effort you put in, but if you pay attention and do the readings, you'll not only learn a lot, but begin to question all those things you'd taken for granted."
6280,707869,4.5,2.0,"He is such a great teacher--very enthusiastic, funny, loves the subject. He made class a lot of fun and is a fair and reasonable teacher. Some great readings too! I would definitely recommend him"
6281,707869,5.0,3.0,Tristan is one of the best TAs available.  He made SWAG so much fun--he always makes you interested and excited even if you don't want to be.  He is so knowledgeable but never comes across as pedantic.  DEFINITELY get in his discussion section for SWAG 210!!!!
6282,707869,3.0,5.0,i've had much better professors. he is funny and interesting but i can't really say i've learned a lot
6283,707869,4.0,2.0,Tristan is so awesome!!! He's so funny. Discussion is fun but you also learn a lot. The best TA I've had! :)
6284,707869,5.0,4.0,"Great guy, great class"
6285,707869,5.0,3.0,Trisatn was the best TA I've ever had at UVA.  His looks are no match for his intelligence.  I learned more from him than most professors at UVA!
6286,707869,4.5,2.0,"awesome TA; very funny, although sometimes a little over the top; always looking to help out and explain topics the professor doesn't cover; grades fairly"
6287,2526497,1.0,3.0,"Danielle Hopkins is frankly the worst professor I have EVER had. She may be a nice person, but she should NOT teach in ANY capacity. The class seems cool at first, until you realize that every lecture is redundant. Financial Inclusion is a contested topic, but her role in the industry makes her one-sided and dismissive. I learned literally nothing."
6288,2026798,2.0,3.0,"This was her first time teaching so hopefully she will improve but everyone had a pretty negative view of her.  She is very confusing and doesn't teach to the book.  If you take her class, make sure you seek her after class (but beware she is never on time to office hours) because she will like you more.  SPAN 1060 is a very time consuming. "
6289,462142,1.0,3.0,"This professor is supposed to be an expert, but he seemed more petty than anything. He appeared to be satisfied if he thought he had managed to dismiss you or your questions. He had much greater respect for men than women. If you enjoy being treated with basic decency, do not register for any of his courses."
6290,462142,5.0,4.0,"For any student of Spanish interested primarily in language or literature it is important to note that Professor Padr&oacute;n is a respected academic in Transatlantic and Transpacific Studies which combine the methodologies of history, philosophy, and literature. If you lack an interdisciplinary background his class will be tough but very rewarding."
6291,462142,1.0,5.0,worst professor i have ever  had. do not take any classes with him. unfair grader and extremely unhelpful during office hours. will give you feedback and  recommendations and then grade you negatively for following those recommendations. he is excited about the topics he teaches but not worth taking any class taught by him at all.
6292,462142,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor-- brilliant, funny, and so passionate!"
6293,462142,5.0,3.0,"Really good professor. Makes everything interesting. He is incredibly smart and easy to relate to. Overall, Ricardo is an awesome teacher."
6294,462142,5.0,4.0,Ricardo Padron is one of the University's best professors - he brings the best to each class and his students respond with much of their best thinking. It is one of the only classes at UVa that is &quot;hard and rewarding.&quot;. Also an outstanding academic and genuinely good human. The University is lucky to have this talented and hard-working professor.
6295,462142,4.5,3.0,"wonderful teacher. very passionate about literature and knows his subject well. he's also just a hilarious person, and makes this small class very inviting. i was intimidated as a first year in this class, but sr. padron is very clear and lets the class guide discussion so i wasn't too intimidated to participate"
6296,462142,5.0,4.0,"He is very passionate about his subject, despite having taught the same short stories many, many times. He really wants you to understand the nuances of the text. 330 is required to take upper-lvel spanish classes, but he makes it fun. definitely try to get him!"
6297,462142,5.0,3.0,He's a fantastic professor.  He's very engaging and always has time for students in office hours.  He seems to genuinely want kids to learn and his class objectives are very clear.  Take him for any class possible.
6298,462142,5.0,3.0,"A great teacher.  He's obviously really into what he's doing, but doesn't overburden students with his enthusiasm. The class isn't the most interesting in the world, and there's not a lot of motivation to do the reading, but even without it, you'll be fine so long as you pay attention in lecture."

6301,462142,5.0,4.0,"A top-notch professor: he knows the subject well and obviously likes teaching; he cares about students and takes the time to answer questions or explain concepts clearly; his lectures are interesting and informative; and he grades fairly, though you have to work for a good grade. Highly recommended!"
6302,503107,5.0,3.0,"She is wonderful. I have never had such a devoted and passionate professor. She truly cares about her students, LOVES feedback about her teaching and how effective it is or isn't, and enjoys the subjects she teaches!"
6303,503107,5.0,3.0,"She is wonderful. I have never had such a devoted and passionate professor. She truly cares about her students, LOVES feedback about her teaching and how effective it is or isn't, and enjoys the subjects she teaches. "
6304,503107,4.0,3.0,"Barnett is one of the most structured teachers ever!  She is always trying new approaches to the class... Caveat:  She gives a lot of work, however if you bomb one assignment your other grades could make up for it.  You get 2 chances for each redaction and then averages final grade!! SUper nice and helpful!!"
6305,503107,5.0,3.0,"Mme Barnett is such a competent professor, it's almost supernatural.  She's also equally personable.  Take it from someone who had her as as the major advisor."
6306,503107,5.0,5.0,Absolutely an AMAZING professor. She is one of the best professors I've ever had at the UVA. It is a LOT of work. But the exam is a paper which is absolutely wonderful. She is so helpful inside and outside of class as well and makes a comfortable environment in which to have a discussion.
6307,503107,4.5,4.0,"She's an excellent resource in and out of class.  She gives a lot of work, but she actually cares about helping you succeed.  Definitely recommended to any french student."
6308,1445190,5.0,4.0,"I was more stressed with this class than w/ higher level ones early on. If you are looking for an easy intro class, find another section. She makes you work. But the material is really interesting, you gain a perspective on what is going on. If you work, you'll do well. Many options for participation. Interesting perspective, v open, v helpful"
6309,1445190,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic prof but if u don't prep, u will not be happy. Not her fault! Says it clearly on syllabus, 5 hrs needed. Assigned work not more than my other classes but you have to process it, can't bluff yr way thro. Her take on politics is phenomenal--never heard such angle. Also:amazing feedback and editing guidelines! Really kind & funny in off hrs"
6310,1445190,2.0,4.0,"Professor B, is very nice but can be condescending and passive aggressive. She has upped her reading expectations and assigns 5 hours of reading every day. As a student taking a full load, it is very difficult to do her readings with my other classes. As that said, I do as much of the readings that I can and have been passing with a B or higher"
6311,1445190,5.0,4.0,I too don't understand why people are complaining about Prof. B. &nbsp;Shes one of the best teachers I've had at GW and one of 2 that did not make people feel bad about expressing different political opinions. She was so critical of both liberals and conservatives that neither side would feel awkward talking. You just have to work! And you learn!
6312,1445190,3.0,4.0,"Very knowledgeable. Tests aren't nearly as hard as she makes them seem. Readings are VITAL to success in the course, make sure to have solid examples from each. Comes off as a bit condescending, but also quite humorous and engaging. You can tell she's passionate about the subject"
6313,1445190,4.0,4.0,"Professor Boucoyannis came off as very intimidating, but I really warmed up to her. Participation can make or break your grade, and the readings are absolutely mandatory. Compared to upper-level classes, the work level is NOT too much. If you prepare for the tests properly and engage in class, you will be fine, as she WANTS you to do well."
6314,1445190,4.0,4.0,"Her tests are very difficult and she assigns a lot of reading. Her lectures only cover the readings, rarely will you learn something new in class. Even so, I would take this class again because she is very knowledgeable and can offer feedback or explain ideas very thoroughly, and is happy to do so for anything, as long as you show that you read."
6315,1445190,5.0,4.0,"People are too harsh on Prof B. Like OBVIOUSLY you have to read in college. You can't complain about her assigning work. I'm not exaggerating when I say she's the most intelligent person I've ever met. You will have to work put it pays off as your politics knowledge will SKYROCKET. She's made me fall in love with learning. Prof B, thank you SO much"
6316,1445190,5.0,4.0,"I really don't understand all the complaints about readings. You go to college to work and learn. Oh my gosh, there is homework?! The textbook selected is easy to comprehend and she helps guide you through the more challenging reads. Every assigned reading is a very thoughtful choice which I appreciate. She doesn't fill the Syllabus with busywork."
6317,1445190,2.0,4.0,After taking this course I have become completely disinterested in politics. Expects students to do every reading and to have extensive knowledge on all of the readings. She is really knowledgable on the course material but like all poli sci professors is really pretentious. You'll have to do a LOT of reading.
6318,1445190,4.0,3.0,"People on RMP are unfairly complaining about professor B. Her class is not easy because of the required readings and her midterm/final are based entirely on the readings which aren't hard to read but they're sometimes long, but if you do the work you'll succeed easily. she's extremely nice as well and has a very unique sense of humor."
6319,1445190,4.0,5.0,"Prof B is very intelligent and you learn a lot, but the amount &amp; quality of work was far too much for an intro class. SYou read 50-pg, original texts + textbook every lecture, and expect hard tests with harsh grading. One 1000-pg paper, but that too is very specific--she expects no fluff whatsoever. It's good if you're interested, but not an easy A"
6320,1445190,2.0,4.0,She is one of the most intelligent professors I have had and I learned a lot from her class. This is why I didnt want to give her a bad rating because I did learn a lot from her class but her amount of concern over her RMP rating and making people feel bad for voicing their honest opinions on this site was unprofessional and unfair.
6321,1445190,2.0,4.0,"While knowledgable, Prof. Boucoyannis is more concerned with her ratemyprofessor score than anything else. The coercive tone in her emails about her score reflect an unprofessionalism that shouldnt be ok. Knows politics though."
6322,1445190,5.0,4.0,"Professor Boucoyannis is a great professor! She may come off as condescending at first, but if you get to know her she is very approachable and helpful. Make sure you do the readings, because she will ask you to take examples from the readings on exams. One midterm, one final and a short 1000 word paper."
6323,1445190,4.0,4.0,"Her class may seem intimidating at first, but she gives everything you need in order to do well. Of course, you have to work for it, but this allows you to actually learn the material. Office hours are only available online, but she makes up for it by being very flexible and responsive. Overall, a wonderful teacher and a valuable class."
6324,1445190,4.0,3.0,"She can be condescending at times, but she is a great professor who is clearly knowledgeable about her field. I also appreciated the unique perspective she had on certain issues/topics. Her lectures can be repetitive if you have done the readings, but they serve to reinforce the readings, which helps for the exams. Grading criteria is clear."
6325,1445190,5.0,3.0,"Excellent professor! She assigns a lot of reading but then goes over it in her lectures, so I didn't read too much of it. One of the smartest people I've ever met, and she really tries to help you do as well as you can. 100% recommend to anyone interested in comparative politics"
6326,1445190,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Buocoyannis is a really great professor who is well versed in the field of comparative politics. She may be strict with the rules for some assignments, but if you follow the directions you should be fine. Exams are taken online which I prefer. I would recommend taking her class, she is a very good professor with a good sense of humor."
6327,1445190,4.0,5.0,"It's really difficult for an introtoo difficult in my opinion. Prof B is very intelligent and it really shows through her lecture. She does care about her students seeing as though she very accessible at all hours and recorded her lectures when she was sick. I would say her lectures are very dense and fast, and the readings are difficult to read."
6328,1445190,5.0,4.0,You're going to work in this class but you're going to learn a lot as well. Professor B is clearly at the top of her field and incredibly smart. This is not a professor that's going to give you a fluff A but worth it anyway from the things you learn. Very much appreciate that she does not interject any political bias into her teaching.
6329,1445190,5.0,5.0,"Prof B. is insanely smart and makes lectures so interesting. The readings, the tests, and the paper will really challenge you, but it's worth it. She can be a bit snappy and intimidating, but if you show interest she is kind and helpful. Best class I've taken at GW. Learned more than I ever expected to in an intro course."
6330,1445190,1.0,4.0,Very disrespectful and rude to students. Sends out way to many emails
6331,1445190,5.0,4.0,Take her class. She's very intelligent (for an intro course!) and often goes above and beyond and really makes you think. Never a boring lecture. Responsive to emails too! You also learn a bit about interesting European history :)
6332,1445190,5.0,4.0,"I really loved her class at GW. I'm not a poli sci major and she scared me a bit in the beginning, but she turned out to be super nice and not too harsh at all. I was rly worried before taking both tests and I did better than expected on both of them. As long as you attend class and look like you're making some effort to stay engaged you're good."
6333,1445190,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Boucoyannis is one of the most interesting, intelligent professors you'll have. She makes lectures interesting, relevant, witty, and engaging. You MUST study for the exams, as they are based on memorizing all the scholarship you'll read in class. pay attention, take good notes, and you'll have a great semester. Difficult intro course."
6334,1445190,4.0,4.0,"Professor B is a solid choice for intro to comparative. She cares about the readings and participation. You are graded on a midterm, a final, participation, and a short (1000 word) paper. Her lectures are interesting and she's pretty funny. She does take attendance, and she does not post her slides, so take notes."
6335,1445190,3.0,4.0,"Really smart, but lectures kind of get repetitive in nature. LOTS OF READING AND TESTS/ESSAY REFLECT THE READINGS. She's obviously so well respected and well qualified for teaching but makes you wonder why she's teaching just the intro courses (also why is she expecting sm from these freshmen in the intro course)"
6336,1445190,4.0,3.0,"She is intimidating at first because she is so smart, but if you get to know her she will warm up to you. The exams aren't as bad as you would expect them to be, and the paper is short and she is very open to helping you with it. Her lectures are very interesting too."
6337,1445190,4.0,2.0,"I LOVED intro to comp poli. She seems scary and intimidating at first, but Prof. B. is really nice, and truly cares about students' learning. Papers and exams are easy, and she appreciates people who speak in class and ask for help before turning in papers. I never did the readings, but she never noticed and loved me. I would def take her again."
6338,1445190,5.0,2.0,"Deb is a gem. She talks tough, especially at the beginning of the semester, but this gives way to her real goofball personality as time passes. Her pet peeves are students who don't do the readings and students who don't speak up in class. You'll also need to take lots of notes, since she doesn't make her lecture slides available until the end."
6339,1445190,5.0,4.0,:)
6340,1445190,5.0,4.0,"She is amazing! At first she can be a little intimidating but she is so intelligent, kind and understanding, and she is super funny and keeps lectures interesting! Truly an amazing women. Makes students feel comfortable and wants us to succeed, always available if you ask for help. I hope I can take her class again some day."
6341,1445190,5.0,4.0,"She's an absolutely brilliant, provocative professor. You'll realize how valuable taking a class with her was after you've finished it, because she connects so much evidence into new bold ideas. She's intimidating at first, but welcoming and witty once you get to know her. Heavy reading, but extra rewarding. Great moderator for seminar discussions."
6342,1445190,3.5,3.0,"Basically you'll be granted the ability to explain all civilizations that ever were and will be; I never finish all the reading but you can survive by thorough note-taking and in-class discussion. Boucoyannis is a lil intimidating at first, though worldly, witty, and down to earth as you get to know her (tbh her sarcasm is hot)."
6343,1445190,2.0,5.0,Extremely hard class. If you're not interested in medieval politics do not take this class. She makes herself available but she's too smart to understand your questions.
6344,1445190,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. She's very demanding, expecting her students to do 100% of readings. If you find the material interesting though, it's completely worth the work taking her class. She's approachable and pretty friendly."
6345,511302,3.5,3.0,I had Mr. King as a TA for The Literature of the South with Professor Greeson and I really liked him. He's a very nice man and he gave good feedback on papers. I met with him to get help with one and he was very willing to give advice. Discussion sections were sometimes a little awkward and there was pressure to speak but overall very good!
6346,511302,4.5,4.0,"The grade is king of tough. I spent the most time on the class this semester, and finally got the lowest grade among all my courses. Anyway, I think I've learned a lot in this class. At first I had great problems writing a paper, but now I feel it's fine for me to write one. It's hard, lots of writing assignments, but you can learn something in it."
6347,511302,5.0,2.0,"Probably the only english teacher I ever had that will truly give you the grade you deserve on the papers.  No more, no less.  Listen to how to actually construct the paper.  Many were unpleasantly surprised when they got their first papers back with less than mediocre grades.  But I'm glad to say, he really knows what he's doing."
6348,511302,1.5,4.0,"So I read the previous post and chose this guy for my ta this past semester. Bad idea -- this guy means well, he really does, but class is unorganized, tough grader, and when give little no feeback when you ask him about your grade or help. Stay away. Far away. This guy has a busy life and seems so scattered. ALL the time.."
6349,511302,5.0,1.0,"Easy class Understanding teacher Gives good feedback for essays Class lacks substance and readings are pointless Participation points is a negative and waking up for the class at 8am was also a negative, but it was all worth it for a good teacher that grades easily."
6350,503112,2.0,4.0,"Professor Galloway is extremely enthusiastic, but his lectures are not at all enjoyable and are so difficult to follow along with. You would often find yourself quite literally falling asleep in his lectures. The exams did not at all reflect the difficulty of seriousness of the lectures. Complete waste of a semester."
6351,503112,2.0,4.0,"The entire class is graded by tests, with the exception of two tiny (but helpful!) homework assignments that essentially have no effect on your grade. He is a kind professor, and doesn't ask a lot for work, but (at least on zoom) he isn't an effective at teaching the material. Jim, if you're reading this, make homework a larger part of the class."
6352,503112,4.0,4.0,"Professor Galloway is great. He includes cartoons in his lectures, and he tells great stories. The material in the class is pretty dense. If you are like me and hate chemistry, I would not recommend this class. I found it difficult because I do not have a passion for env. science. If you do, I think this class will be enjoyable for you."
6353,503112,5.0,3.0,"He is the best! The class covered a lot and it was a lot of memorizing, but I barely studied at all and got a B+, so I think if you try this class is an easy A. He's so funny. He brought candy to our class so many times, and dressed up like a gorilla for halloween. One of my favorite classes."
6354,503112,4.5,4.0,"Professor Galloway is a very nice, engaging professor.  The course material was overall very interesting.  The tests are surprisingly difficult.  Extra credit is offered, but consists of either a 20 page paper or a project with a 10 page paper.  "
6355,503112,4.0,4.0,"Galloway was the nicest professor I had all semester.  He loves what he teaches and is always willing to help, no matter the question. Do not plan to skip classes, you will need those notes. The textbook is useless and exams are a lot harder than what you would expect from the lectures. "
6356,503112,4.0,3.0,"Professor Galloway is a nice man and his lectures are interesting. However, this is not an easy 'A' class as some students think its going to be. It really helps to go to the exam review sessions (as he usually writes the exam following them) and even better is if you to AP EVSC or Intro EVSC before this class. "
6357,503112,4.0,3.0,"Galloway genuinely wants his students to do well. Take advantage of office hours as he is approachable and willing to help. While the exams may be challenging, there is a curve at the end of the semester and other opportunities to make up for a poor exam grade. Overall, an interesting class taught by a very sweet professor."
6358,503112,5.0,3.0,"Pretty inspiring teacher. All of the material is presented in class, so it's not one you ever want to miss, but there's no reading required. Tests are all short answer. Galloway knows what he's talking about and he's a pretty enthusiastic guy. He's awkward at times, but pretty hilarious at others. This class inspired me to be an EVSC major. 9/10"
6359,503112,3.5,2.0,"Galloway is the nicest guy, but the course material is pretty boring. I love how passionate he is about the material, but his PPTs are a lot of repetitive graphs, and his tests are actually pretty challenging. Only take this class if you have a real interest in learning about resources and the environment -- it's a lot about the nitrogen cycle."
6360,503112,3.0,4.0,"Galloway is a charming old man who wants to know his students and is clearly very intelligent/well-known; however, he's not exactly born to teach. His powerpoints consist of mainly graphs and charts, the book is not ever used. The exams are pretty hard when compared to how easy the homework is. Overall, the exams are too hard for how/what he taught"
6361,503112,4.0,4.0,"Attendance is not necessary but you will not be able to do well on the tests without notes from those classes! Reading the book is almost pointless, just listen and be ready to study!! Mr. Galloway was an amazing teacher and I hope to have him again.  Always makes you laugh and takes time before and after class to entertain his students"
6362,503112,4.5,2.0,"Awesome teacher, great class, great guy.  I really enjoyed this class. it might be hard for someone who is not familiar with  environmental sciences though."
6363,503112,4.5,4.0,"This class is pretty interesting...Prof. Galloway is funny and engaging. The exams are somewhat difficult, but overall it's worth it."
6364,503112,5.0,3.0,"A very nice man - kind, sweet, funny - which makes class very enjoyable.  If he taught other classes I'd take them just to have him as a teacher again.  If you have the opportunity to get into one of his classes do it!!"
6365,503112,4.0,2.0,"this guy is awesome! he dressed up as a giant gorilla on halloween... enough said. tests don't come from the book- they come from lecture, but you have to take good notes because his powerpoints are mostly graphs and aren't too helpful when studying. tests were hard, but he was very helpful in terms of meeting outside of class."
6366,503112,5.0,4.0,One of my favorite teachers. The class itself is relaxed and requires little outside work. the exams however are extremely difficult and are all short answer Qs. he often will give you points back on your exam if you meet with him. i would definately suggest taking this class if you have any interest in the environment
6367,503112,4.5,4.0,"Very nice guy who clearly knows a lot about the subject. The tests are pretty hard, but if you are willing to put forth some effort in studying you should be okay."
6368,503112,5.0,3.0,AWESOME
6369,503112,4.0,4.0,"Interesting class, however the tests and the 15 page paper are pretty much ridic."
6370,503112,4.0,3.0,"Pretty funny, and can be an interesting class. Tests can be kinda hard, and the 15 page paper is a little ridiculous"
6371,503112,5.0,3.0,"He is the most helpful professor i have ever met! whenever i had a question he would answer it, easy to make appointments with and easy to get in touch with thru email. hes very funny and makes you want to go to lecture. you feel like ur missing out when you dont go. the book is very understandable. the tests are fair and the finals straightforward"
6372,503112,2.0,4.0,"Classes are interesting, tests are ridiculously hard."
6373,503112,4.5,3.0,He's great - lectures are interesting and he's enthusiastic about teaching.  Tests are a little harder than you might think but he's very helpful during office hours and in review sessions.  It's important to go to lecture and also do the readings since he bases the exams on both.
6374,503112,5.0,3.0,No Comments
6375,503112,5.0,4.0,"Very enthusiastic, sweet and humourous.  Tests are hard though."
6376,503112,4.0,3.0,"Good lecture for people trying to get basic science credits out of the way.  He's fun and engaging.  Tests are not as easy as you may think, but the class won't kill you."
6377,634184,5.0,1.0,"I have never experienced anything like Alan's class. The format is repetitive in the best possible way. There is a rhythm and cadence to how the classes flow week to week. Aside from the mechanics of the class, I have never had a professor who cares as much as Alan. The camaraderie he fosters in clas is unreal. I can't recommend Alan highly enough."
6378,634184,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Rasmussen is passionate about the criminal justice system. He really wants to help his parolee/probationers; he's very serious about his job. Can tell he is a lifetime advocate for prevention, treatment, and education. Great to have such caring individual who is devoted to his field of work. This spills into the classroom w/  enthusiasm."
6379,634184,4.0,1.0,"Professor Rasmussen has a wealth of experience as a former probation officer, and is very passionate about not just criminal justice but helping people. Class lectures were interesting and thought provoking. Group discussion, debate and a final paper are what you will be graded on. There were two books assigned as well, but I hardly ever read them."
6380,634184,5.0,2.0,Alan is my favorite professor at UVA. He is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about criminal justice. He related all course work to actual real-world examples.  GREAT CLASS!
6381,634184,5.0,2.0,"Alan is probably my all time favorite professor! He brings a passion, energy, and enthusiasm to the classroom that I have found to be unparalleled. He fosters an interactive classroom environment that is enjoyable and even had me looking forward to class. I rated his easiness high because he was so helpful and approachable."
6382,634184,5.0,3.0,Really great individual...you will benefit from talking with Alan.
6383,634184,5.0,3.0,"Makes class interesting, informative and interactive.  Makes you think about issues.  There is alot of interesting class discussion."
6384,634184,5.0,2.0,"Fun and thought-provoking class. Alan is a wonderful professor, great at examining both sides of controversial issues equally, very outgoing, friendly & accessible, really knows his stuff. Returned paper/project grades within 1 day. Class discussions are animated, and he incorporates guest speakers and different types of media into class."
6385,1428808,4.5,2.0,"He?s dorky and always willing to help. His lectures are a little boring at times, but when he talks about his personal experiences, it's engaging and humorous. Attend all lectures and read all assigned texts and you?ll do fine. Overall, you?d be lucky to have him and Christie (TA); they are great human beings. I received an A-."
6386,1428808,2.0,4.0,"Ronis is a new teacher and you can tell. He goes into tangents, but he's alright overall. He got mad that too many people missed class during midterm season and started giving pop quizzes, pretty lame and high school-ish. If you're not into Buddhism or eastern studies, class can be pretty boring!"
6387,1428808,4.5,1.0,One of the best professors I've had at UVa and this is my last semester. So nice and approachable. Keeps class very interesting with anecdotes about time he has spent among Buddhists. Reading load is light and he encourages questions. Class is a pleasure to go to and the material is always interesting and thought provoking.
6388,191819,5.0,4.0,"Definitely a lot of reading and hard work, but very interesting lectures and coursework."
6389,191819,5.0,2.0,"Hands-down the best prof ever. I'm not a history major, but this class was close to convincing me to switch. Lendon is the best lecturer you'll ever have, and you can tell that he cares so much about teaching. (Also a hilarious man.) My TA was awesome and I always felt prepared for exams (essays and IDs). GO TO LECTURE or you won't pass!!!"
6390,191819,5.0,3.0,Great person who cares about students. He is really open and funny during class. Great lecturer and easy class overall
6391,191819,5.0,4.0,"A seriously great professor with a true passion for what he's lecturing. The class is very difficult and as a first-year I felt ill-prepared. Had to work my ass off, but I think that overall it was worth it."
6392,191819,5.0,4.0,Lendon is a great professor and lecturer. Definitely requires a lot of work but you will find that his class is rewarding.
6393,191819,4.0,5.0,"Lendon is one of the best professors I've ever had: he's extremely knowledgeable, has a great sense of humor, and, indeed, makes you work for your grade.  If you are up for the challenge, I would definitely recommend taking one of his courses.  You are guaranteed to learn a lot about the subject.  Overall, he's a great professor."
6394,191819,4.5,4.0,"Brilliant man, seriously knows his stuff. He's really funny and easy to listen to, the lectures are very interesting. BUT this class A LOT of reading and the tests are very detail oriented and difficult"
6395,191819,4.0,4.0,"Not the easiest class (there's a lot of reading and a lot of it is dull), but it's definitely doable if you put in the time. Lendon is an incredible lecturer. He's crazy and entertaining as all hell. I'm not a history major but I'm very glad I took this class."
6396,191819,5.0,1.0,"Take it! In the lectures Prof. Lendon narrates the events in a very funny way with his own understandings. The discussions (with pop quizs) are all about readings (200 pages per week) Grading standard is made very clear. My TA is Nicholas and his discussions are great! It's not just bubbling, you actually learn! And he's not a hard grader!"
6397,191819,4.5,4.0,"Good professor, a lot of reading but the lecture is a good supplement to most of it. Attendance to lecture is not mandatory but go. Discussion is required, quizzes are important but don't stress over them. Lendon is a great lecturer but eccentric. I am a chem major picked the class as a lesser of 2 evils but it turned out to be almost enjoyable."
6398,191819,4.5,3.0,"Awesome and very interesting class, but not easy"
6399,191819,5.0,5.0,"One of the harder classes you can take, nevertheless, it's quite rewarding.  If you don't do the reading, you're going to have a bad time.  And there is a LOT of reading."
6400,191819,5.0,4.0,"Lendon is very quirky but very interesting. There was A LOT of reading, to the point that I just gave up halfway through the semester. I barely did any of the readings but I went to class and memorized the IDs and ended up with a B. I would recommend taking a class with Lendon purely to witness his lecturing abilities- they are that good."
6401,191819,3.5,4.0,"Pretty difficult class. Lendon is a wonderful lecturer, and provides students with a general overview of the material. However, you must do the reading in order to provide the in depth answers expected on the exams. Also, be sure to have the ID terms memorized prior to each weekly discussion section as pop quizzes are given randomly."
6402,191819,4.0,3.0,"Although he initially comes off as eccentric and a bit scary, This guy really grows on you. His Ancient Greece class is very in depth, but he lectures in a way that makes everything so much easier to understand. There is a fair amount of reading, but its pretty good stuff if you are into ancient history."
6403,191819,5.0,3.0,"Lendon is literally the best teacher I've had at UVA.  He makes the class really interesting with his passion and obvious knowledge of the things he's teaching us.  The tests aren't that hard, but if you don't do any of the readings, prepare yourself to get a bad grade.  Read and know the IDs and you're good for at least a B."
6404,191819,4.5,4.0,"For all the work done outside of class, going to lecture every week makes the day.  He's funny and grasps your attention.  Papers are tough and reading is necessary.  FOr the IDs, if you read they shouldn't be too bad but Lendon expects a lot on them."
6405,191819,5.0,5.0,"Lendon is very smart and teaches an excellent class.  You will learn a great deal, but it does require reading.  Do the reading, however, because it is worth your time, and you cannot do well in the class without investing time and effort in the texts and discussions."
6406,191819,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Lendon is the most dynamic lecturer at the University.  Roman history is already pretty interesting, but Lendon is also able to make it funny and exciting.  His anecdotes at the beginning of class are second to none.  The work load is heavy, however, and his exams are a bit tough.  Make sure you read every weak and do your term IDs."
6407,191819,5.0,5.0,Amazingly difficult yet amazingly interesting.
6408,191819,4.0,2.0,Great Lecture
6409,191819,5.0,5.0,"Hard, hard, hard, hard class. Great, great, great, great professor. If you spend all four years at UVa and don't take one of his classes, you cheated yourself."
6410,191819,4.0,5.0,"Very hard class, lecture is incredible but exams are difficult and extensive"
6411,191819,4.5,5.0,"Lendon's lectures are incredible. He talks like he's on stage at all times, and always wraps up in dramatic fashion. The class is ridiculously difficult, but if you can handle the work, it's a great class."
6412,191819,4.5,5.0,"Excellent lecturer, lectures are very entertaining.  Class is pretty difficult though.  Lots of IDs that have to be memorized.  I still recommend the class, if you do the work you'll be fine. It won't kill your gpa."
6413,191819,5.0,4.0,"Best professor I've ever had.  His tests are really specific, yes, but if you study hard they're really not a problem.  Make sure you keep up with the ID's-- that's key.  Lots of reading, but it's definitely possible to get by just skimming some of it.  Lendon knows his stuff and he's hilarious... he makes you WANT to go to lecture."
6414,191819,5.0,5.0,Awesome teacher. Going to class is actually fun with him. Absolutely Hilarious. Really hard though. On the exam the IDs were about as specific and insignificant as possible to make it even harder.
6415,191819,5.0,5.0,best ever
6416,191819,4.5,4.0,Best lecturer I've ever had and the best at the university.  Very funny and entertaining. Hard class though.
6417,191819,4.5,5.0,Best professor I've ever had.  Hardest class I've ever had.
6418,191819,4.5,5.0,"best lecturer ever, very excited about the use of elephants in ancient warfare, however, the most difficult class in terms of work and work, but fulfilling, you also run around on the lawn with pvc pipes, simulating phalanxes"
6419,191819,4.0,4.0,"Lendon is a great professor, however the class is not easy, do the reading and go to lecture and you should be ok.  Lendon's lectures were worth the extra work."
6420,191819,5.0,5.0,"Best lecturer at the university, hands down, worth the effort for the class"
6421,191819,4.5,4.0,"Great class, but a lot of work.  Probably the most dynamic, interesting lecturer I've ever seen."
6422,191819,4.5,4.0,"You guys at UVA are very lucky to have Lendon.  I took all his classes back when he taught at MIT, and every year I mourn that we lost him."
6423,191819,4.5,5.0,Hotter than he is easy...

6425,191819,5.0,3.0,"The course material is fascinating, and Lendon is the best lecturer I've ever had.  He is extremely animated, running around the room, slamming his fist down on his desk, occasionally swearing for emphasis.  This is the best class I have ever taken."
6426,191819,3.5,5.0,No Comments
6427,1125707,1.5,4.0,The class seemed to be a completely different curriculum than the other 1060 classes. Margarita was very rude to me and if you do not look at her the entire time in class she will spaz. She spazzed on me for not constantly looking at her. The class was very unorganized and she was quite confusing. I don't recommend you take her.
6428,1125707,1.5,4.0,"restricts any english speaking in class whatsoever, and as a result - since none of us are fluent - important information about assignments is miscommunicated regularly and it hurts your grade. She does not foster love for the language as her assignments feel more like a burden with her strict regulations rather than a positive learning experience"
6429,1125707,2.0,5.0,"Margarita is a nice lady, if she likes you. She can be very condescending. She gives out WAY too much work, and expects you to do too much every day. She is anal. Her tests are too hard. DO NOT TAKE HER. It is totally not worth how much work you have to put in. Hating my life because I took it."
6430,1125707,3.5,5.0,"She can be unclear, difficult, and disorganized, but she is really dedicated.  She always responds in detail to your emails.  If you go talk to her, she will like you and be very lenient.  Just try to see where she's coming from (wanting near perfection in writing) and you will do well."
6431,1125707,3.0,4.0,"She's really nice (if she likes you), but she sends a ridiculous amount of e-mails correcting what she said in class, which is already confusing. I'd recommend talking to her outside of class a lot on your own; she gives you a LOT of slack if you're on her good side. My Spanish improved, but I'm not sure if it was worth the daily frustration."
6432,1125707,2.0,5.0,Margarita is insane. She assigns copious amounts of work which she requires do be done in a far too meticulous format. She is hard to comprehend in class and unapproachable afterward. I was miserable in this class all year. Try your best not to get on her bad side because she basically grades you on how much she likes you. TAKE SPAN 311 WITH A DIFF
6433,1125707,1.5,5.0,"Far to difficult, for no apparent reason.  More work than other professor for this course.  Does have genuine interest in the language, but her disorganization, inane amounts of work, difficult tests, and strict adherence to her syllabus make the class difficult.  I won't take another class with her, and don't recommend her classes."
6434,1125707,2.5,5.0,"Margarita is a great person, but a difficult professor.  My Spanish defintely improved in her class.  However, she is disorganized, making constant changes to her syllabus, which she expects you to strictly adhere to.    Missing class is not recommended: if you're sick she requires a doctor's note and an hour long meeting with her. TAKE AT OWN RISK"
6435,1125707,2.0,5.0,Hard for no reason.Really really anal about everything- we have notebook checks... must be extremely prepared for class..would never take her class ever again.
6436,1125707,2.0,4.0,"We all like Margarita, but be ready for 3 hours of HW and 3-4 emails a day with corrections to what she said. incredibly, she still corrects 5+ pages of HW each night in detail. Assignments are generally disorganized and confusing.  You even have notebook checks. I found the class pretty chaotic."
6437,1125707,2.0,4.0,"Unclear and hard to figure out.  I thought the class was a lot harder than it needed to be and she gives a lot more work than other teachers who teach this class.  Does have a genuine interest in her students, though, and I do like her as a person.  I wouldn't take another one of her classes again."
6438,1125707,4.0,3.0,"Fun teacher, and extremely approachable if you're having problems. Participation in class is imperative; as long as you have a good attitude and show a good amount of effort she'll be lenient. She's an easy grader for the most part, though the class is (obviously) in Spanish and it's sometimes hard to figure out what you're supposed to be doing."
6439,2411856,5.0,2.0,"I have Jue now, and I LOVE her. She is so great at leading discussion--I leave class every day still thinking about the material! I'm not a Religious Studies major, but she makes the material super clear--I'm actually considering becoming a minor because I love this class so much."
6440,2411856,5.0,2.0,"Jue is great. There are some reading that I didn't do all of, but she explains the ideas really well in class. She is also really passionate and knowledgeable about the subject."
6441,355664,5.0,3.0,"Professor Patterson is an absolutely incredible professor.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Now with that being said, if you are looking for an easy A he is not the teacher for you but most still received an A.  He worked as hard as he had to, to ensure that we became better writers.  He is my favorite teacher at UVA."
6442,355664,4.5,1.0,"This guys knows what he is talking about, if you are in the class for an easy A, forget it! The work is extra hard but nothing comes for free, the responses I got on my papers were harsh nonetheless encouraging, plus he was very helpful during his office hours!I don't understand why people make harsh comments about him, he was absolutely wonderful!"
6443,355664,2.0,3.0,"Very, very funny guy.  Seems to know his stuff, but is not entirely helpful as discussion does not really have much order or direction. Not an exceptionally easy grader, I have a B/B- but am grateful for it; I knew my grasp on the material was poor- PT is not an easy subject regardless of who is teaching. Take James but not for an easy A."
6444,355664,2.0,4.0,"Worst TA I've ever had at UVA.  I read his ratings beforehand and figured they were just written by whiny first-years who just didn't know how to write.  I was wrong.  James is pompous and arrogant, and that shows up in the comments he makes on papers and the way he teaches the class.  Avoid him at all costs."
6445,355664,3.5,4.0,Grades pretty harshly and makes mean comments on papers.  Also wanders off in discussion section and is funny at times.
6446,355664,3.0,2.0,"If you sign up for James, you better be prepared to read and teach yourself from the book because maybe 5 minutes each discussion was dedicated to somewhat relevant topics.  Funny funny guy and I definitely would take another discussion with him, but doesn't teach a lot which is important because Sabato doesn't really teach either.  Somewhat harsh."

6449,355664,2.5,4.0,"harsh grader, makes mean comments on your papers, makes ****ed jokes in discussion. not worth it."

6453,355664,4.5,2.0,"Hilarious TA. Makes a lot of jokes during discussions(some of them kind of ****ed), but definately knows his stuff and helped Sabato write the book. If you can get this guy for a TA, do it, you won't regret it."
6454,1715537,4.0,3.0,"I took this class because I wanted to take a college Chem class without jumping into gen Chem. Professor Szaflarski is a really accessible instructor. She always makes time for her students, and she made this daunting subject seem less scary. Plus she allows corrections on exams for a few extra points :)"
6455,1715537,1.5,3.0,"I asked her for help and she was very flustered as if she had a million other things to do before she could answer a quick question. I asked her to clarify something from my notes AFTER asking my friends and she told me to ""ask my neighbors"" and then didn't help me. She'll say something in class that's opposite of what the book says, just confusing"
6456,1715537,1.0,2.0,"this class is like high school all over again. You have busy work, and the professor will give hw whenever she feels like it. Have to attend class, because there is not a clear syllabus. This class may be easy, but highly recommend taking other wonderful courses at UVA if you want to gain knowledge."
6457,1715537,1.5,4.0,"I do not recommend this class. Yes, the materials we learn is easy, but exams are hard, b.c. she wants specific answers. Beware of surprises. She does not have the course outlined, so you don't know what to expect. This course takes away so much of your time! It's really ridiculous how the professor tells you to do this and that over the email."
6458,1338712,5.0,3.0,Blanche is a wonderful person who really helped me enjoy Latin. It's true! Class went really fast because she's very fun!
6459,1166685,3.5,1.0,"Easy class. Forget the readings but make sure to go to lecture, tests are straight from the notes he uses to teach. Mostly bearable... sometimes quite annoying teacher. Expect a heavy leftist tilt, and don't question it. This guy was totally his generation's super-hippie, and he doesn't like opening the floor for ideas disagreeing with his own."
6460,1166685,3.0,2.0,He was pretty funny sometimes. You didn't have to do the readings for the tests. He put the slides online but some material came from lecture.
6461,1166685,3.0,3.0,"Readings are all over the place, but its more the subject than the prof - no text on subject. Lectures are interesting and pretty clear individually - but seemed sometimes disconnected to each other."
6462,44385,1.0,1.0,"Politics Prof. Lawrie Balfour cosigned the opinion that ""a simple mention of Jefferson is enough to undo progress"" as it relates to race and higher education.  Yet, another SJW disguised as a professor. Please resign from UVA."
6463,44385,1.0,3.0,"Indoctrination 101.  Tried to tell us that Jefferson has no place at the university he founded.  Clearly unable to understand people are complex and that we can appreciate what he did for us all without endorsing every aspect of his life.  But she keeps taking the paycheck, no surprise there."
6464,44385,2.0,4.0,"HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. Course is interesting, readings good, but this Professor is so ANAL if she doesn't like you. She also borders on creepy. Avoid her classes. Really the worst polisci professor i have taken thus far as a politics major. AWFUL! her essay questions make no sense and her grading system is really subjective. Refuses all extensions!"
6465,44385,5.0,2.0,"Loved this class! The lectures were clear, structured, and interesting. The class went at a nice pace. We had 3 short papers and a final exam, which wasn't hard at all. She made it very easy to take notes and pay attention."
6466,44385,5.0,3.0,"If you go to class, you will do well.  Pretty much everything on the exams and everything you need for papers she will go over in class.  Also, very willing to help at office hours."
6467,44385,5.0,4.0,"Very interesting lectures, very helpful.  If you go to class and take notes, papers are very easy to write."
6468,44385,4.5,4.0,"Very interesting selection of readings. I felt that she gave a diverse amount of writers so that one got a comprehensive view of political theory. If you speak to your TA regularly and take a pro-active approach to essays ( I did essay outlines, first paras) you can get As. Don't slack off on readings."
6469,44385,4.0,3.0,"The first half of the class was easier to grasp than the second half. She does her best in lectures to clarify the readings. The readings are not bad, but you should be prepared to read actively and dilligently to understand the material. She is always up to discuss the readings during office hours. getting a helpful TA is also important to pass."
6470,44385,2.0,4.0,"Boring.  Not a true intro course.  On the last day of class before the final she asked a sample exam question which she said was &quot;easy.&quot;  No one could answer it.  Avoid her class, but if you must take it, avoid the TA James Patterson at all costs.  Worst TA at UVA by far."
6471,44385,3.5,3.0,"Really interesting material and she is always very prepared and clear in lecture.  The grading is pretty hard though, but a very interesting class-especially if you are interested in politics."
6472,44385,5.0,3.0,"African-American Political Theory. Maybe Balfour isn't great at the intro class, but she rocks her knowledge base in this class. Well versed, and teh work is interesting and not overwhelming."
6473,44385,1.5,5.0,"AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!  The reading material is interesting stuff, but nothing you can't just read on your own; lectures are boring, but above all the TA's are HORRIFIC.  They do not grade whether you can write a good theory essay; they grade on the exact words/points they've got on their sheet.  I was disgusted and wish i had withdrawn."
6474,44385,3.5,3.0,&quot;This class isn't 101 because it's easy-there's just no prereqs.  Last semester there were 4 As.&quot;  That scared the crap out of me... but guess what&#63;! I got an A!  So advice: lecutre is interesting- just ignore the liberal overtures- so go (55% of class is exams taken straight from lecture) Write cogent papers and say cogent things & you'll be good!
6475,44385,1.0,5.0,"WORST CLASS EVER! AVOID IT! Lecture was so boring hardly anybody came. And the TA's are boring and grade the essays RIDICUOUSLY hard. The average grade on the essays was like a C-/D+. Also Balfour is SO liberal and pushes her own agenda. Obsessed with the civil rights movement, which is pretty much all you read about. Don't take the class!"
6476,44385,1.0,4.0,horrible TA's and they all follow her anal grading scale
6477,44385,3.0,4.0,"Balfour is a nice lady but she is super liberal. She relies way to much on the outlines she puts up, this is probably because she has difficulty giving a lecture for 50 minutes so she uses the outline to jump around. As others have said your TA is really the important thing because they do all your grading. Papers are graded hard, test are easy."
6478,44385,2.5,3.0,"The content is fun for people who enjoy political theory, but getting a good TA is essential. If you value your GPA, I suggest you stay away from this course.  Getting a bad TA, like I did, leads to frustrating paper/test grades with no comments to back them up.  I would not recommend this course."
6479,44385,3.5,3.0,"Getting a good TA is crucial in this class, but the final exam was unbelievably easy! If you work decently hard you will do well -- as long as your TA is a good grader. Going to lecture was really important because she packed a ton of info into them."
6480,44385,1.5,5.0,"Balfour's class was a shocking, disturbing disappointment.  Her lectures were sickeningly convoluted to the degree I could not find a feasible essay topic.  The writing was extravagant: for some, it qualified as a second writing requirement.  I would not recommend this class to my worst enemy."
6481,44385,2.5,3.0,"Balfour has a great attitude.  She is open to different ideas, even if she disagrees, and cares enough to know all of her students' names.  Unfortunately, she is not always clear.  She is a brillant thinker-not always able to structure her classes to show"
6482,44385,2.0,3.0,"Balfour was inconsistent in her grading decisions, and was not able to express her thoughts clearly in lecture."
6483,44385,3.0,4.0,"Too broad, does not make material very interesting"
6484,44385,4.0,3.0,"Professor Balfour is great professor.  She's not as fabulous as say Mr. Elzinga, Mr. Sabato, or Mr. Coppock, but she's definately good.  However, she's extremely liberal, but is fairly good job keeping the liberalism to a minimum excpet for a few classes."
6485,44385,4.0,3.0,"The papers are graded pretty hard, but the class is interesting and Balfour is a good lecturer-though fast at times."
6486,44385,5.0,3.0,"Hard grader, but awesome classes and material."
6487,44385,3.0,3.0,Talked too fast to take legit notes.  Good TA is key.
6488,44385,2.5,4.0,"Early readings hard, good TA is important"

6494,44389,5.0,4.0,"Honestly, I learned so much in this class. The grading criteria was fair and clear, and the feedback was always useful. Allen Lynch is a gem, and he actually presents a different, but knowledgable perspective. I felt lucky to learn from him. His lectures, while at times rambles on zoom, were always worth attending."
6495,44389,5.0,3.0,"He is an amazing man. If you love Russian politics, you will love him. A lot of Reading, and he does expect students to do them. He is very approachable, you can show up at his office hour and talk to him about the subject, and he welcomes you. I went to all of his OH and learned so much. He is somewhat slow with responding emails."
6496,44389,4.0,4.0,"Amazingly smart professor. However, if you do better with clearly defined lectures then don't take his class. His powerpoints don't add anything and so it can be difficult to take notes. His papers are largely graded by TA's who i'm not sure attended the lectures, so that was annoying too. Very knowledgable but tough class to pay attention in."
6497,44389,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Lynch is amazing. During lecture he is animated, interesting, and super knowledgeable about the topics he's teaching. Grading criteria is clear and even has some extra credit built in if you do poorly on a paper. I honestly felt lucky to learn from him based off all the experience and knowledge he has."
6498,44389,5.0,4.0,He is one of the best. An absolute can't miss.
6499,44389,4.5,4.0,"Lynch is the man! He's an expert in Russian politics and relations, and his lectures are very informative and interesting. He assigns a ton of reading which usually is somewhat interesting, but it is a pain to keep up. His exams were all essays which is cool, but he expects a lot from his students. He is very approachable and friendly."
6500,44389,4.5,4.0,"Great class for those with interest in Russia/Eastern Europe. Overly heavy reading load, but if you mostly stay on top of it you'll be fine for the exams, which are essay-based and graded fairly. Lynch's lectures, despite rare dry spots, are engaging and informative. He knows his stuff and throws in good anecdotes. Overall, dude's a complete boss."
6501,44389,5.0,4.0,"This class was such a breath of fresh air. He's an animated and humorous lecturer, and you never leave the classroom feeling dissatisfied. Two 1,500 word papers, two extra credit papers, final paper of 2,000 words. He expects original and thoughtful analysis, but his lectures/readings give you the tools you need. Would take a class by him again!"
6502,44389,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Lynch is clearly very invigorated by International Relations. The resulting excitement in his lectures, combined with his astounding degree of knowledge, makes classes highly enjoyable and something I have definitely missed. Still, he expects you to work hard, attend class, and read all materials. In short, sign up if you can."
6503,44389,5.0,4.0,"He was a fantastic teacher, always had interesting lectures and stories.  You do  have to work for the class because he is a hard grader but very fair if you follow up and learn from his comments.  Russians politics is absolutely fascinating and essential for  a foreign affairs major."
6504,44389,4.5,4.0,"Amazing class, amazing professor, and very interesting material. By taking this class you gain valuable knowledge about Russian foreign policy and US-Russian relations. For the most part, UVA lacks experts on Russia and the former Soviet Union region, however, it's a blessing that the Politics department has someone like Lynch."
6505,44389,4.0,3.0,"Great lecturer. Knows a lot about Russian and has great stories. Tests are essay based and not bad. Tons of reading, but he highlights the main points in lecture."
6506,44389,3.5,3.0,One of my best classes ever. But   I had to work for it!
6507,44389,4.0,3.0,Knowledgeable and helpful.
6508,44389,2.5,3.0,"Too arrogant - he is an expert in his own right, but fails to acknowledge contrasting views.  I would never take him for another class."
6509,44389,5.0,4.0,Brilliant professor.  Lectures are fast-paced but well worth the effort.  A must-take for anyone interested in Russian Politics.
6510,44389,5.0,3.0,"A terrific teacher, one of my best classes. Ever."
6511,44389,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Lynch is an amazing lecturer.  Be forewarned--he has a rapid-fire lecturing style (take notes quickly!).  He is knowledgeable about numerous aspects of American and international politics, very accessible outside of class, and ready to help out his students anyway he can."
6512,44389,4.5,2.0,"deserved standing ovation at the last class.  he teaches so comprehensively and draws in stuff from every source.  This class alone can teach you most everything you need to know for american politics and IR.  I had his class on 9/11/01 (the day), and his predictions are still coming true today."
6513,44389,4.0,3.0,He may be full of himself; but with good reason.  He's extremely smart and an awesome lecturer.  Very good course.
6514,44389,1.0,5.0,"Professor is very full of himself, not at all available outside of class for real help and seldom responsive to emails. Also, he talks bad about other members of the UVa political science department."
6515,44389,5.0,1.0,Allen rocks!go Irish! ura tovarishchi!
6516,44389,5.0,2.0,No Comments
6517,44389,2.5,3.0,"Rather full of himself, should be teaching econ not politics"
6518,388454,3.0,4.0,"European Social History (1890-1980):  He genuinely cares about the subject matter, but this course is ALL LECTURE and INCREDIBLY BORING. Virtually no class participation, yet attendance is mandatory if you want to pass. He's also a HARD GRADER!  DON'T BUY THE BOOKS, he either hands out the articles you need to read or posts them online."
6519,388454,3.5,3.0,The person below is mistaken. I hold to my previous comment. He will talk right over you.
6520,388454,4.0,2.0,"This class can drag on a bit, but overall it's pretty interesting.  He needs to rethink how he holds &quot;discussion&quot; in class.  I disagree with previous reviewer about him &quot;steamrolling&quot; over any comments all comments.  His papers/exams ask seemingly vague questions but he's looking for something specific, so be aware."
6521,388454,3.0,2.0,"Continuing the previous rating: he also talks about sex/birth control a LOT. I'm not a prude or anything, but I really did get sick of him going on and on about exactly what people used to do in their bedrooms. Of course it was a valid area of social history to talk about, but my goodness. It got old. Also, on plenty of occasions, very awkward..."
6522,388454,3.0,2.0,"A pretty nice guy but boring. As. Anything. He reads straight from his notes and when he does ask for questions/comments, he'll steamroll over anything you'll say before you finish talking; it's pretty rude actually. He is a fair grader, though, and you don't have to read all that carefully to get his points. Material was sometimes interesting."
6523,388454,3.0,3.0,"A good class, but not at all what I expected. 40 person class based around discussion of about 125 pages of reading per class, so about 250/week. The subject matter is interesting, and you pick up plenty of cool stuff from reading you can use to disgust your friends."
6524,388454,3.0,3.0,"On the positive he is very interested in this topic, nd if you memorize his agenda and repeat it bavck on paper/exam, you'll do fine. He never makes anyone lok stupid during clas even when people make stupid comments. On negative, I hte saying this, but the man is very boring. His lectures are hard to sit through and will make you sleepy."
6525,388454,5.0,1.0,"I understand the part about the Uh's, BUT, History of Sexuality is awesome.  There is a lot of reading but you learn just about everything you ever (and never) wanted to know about sexuality in Western culture.  Prof. rarely lectures in this class and when he does it's not so bad.  Seems to be a topic he really likes to talk about.  Plus many of the readings are really funny.  Puritans and farm animals, Why Lincoln was bisexual, Victorian age swingers, many of which are primary documents.  all should take"
6526,388454,2.0,4.0,Very boring lecturer.  Too ideological.  Need a good TA.
6527,388454,2.5,3.0,Do not take this class unless you absolutely HAVE to.  Lots of reading and the most boring professor I've had at UVA.  If you a professor staring at his notes and not moving the entire time about abstract concepts and big reading loads then this is the class for you.
6528,388454,3.0,3.0,"Most boring man on earth.  He continuously shifts his weight back and forth between his feet and &quot;um&quot; is every 4th word.  He reads his lectures verbatim from his notes, and doesn't engage his class at all.  Also assigns an insane amount of reading for an entry level class."
6529,388454,3.0,3.0,"He gives out a substantial amount of reading for the papers, but he's a fair grader. The tests aren't too hard, and he gives you prep questions. His lectures are too formal though, as if he's reading his own article on the topic."
6530,388454,3.5,3.0,"The readings are fair, though the readings for the paper are long. He knows what he's talking about, but his lectures are a little too formal and stylized. Like he's reading his own essay. The tests aren't too bad, and he's a fair grader."
6531,388454,4.5,3.0,"Such a sweet little old man.  He's a little boring but pretty easy to follow.  Very understanding when you have problems.  Oh, and don't be shocked if he is lecturing on France and starts talking about sex, other than that he's pretty normal."
6532,609644,5.0,3.0,"Great professor and advisor.  The textbook he co-authored is probably one of the most useful I had in grad school; I stil use it today.  Very approachable, understanding, but reminds you about consequences of your decisions as a consulted analyst.  Highly recommend."
6533,609644,5.0,1.0,"Awesome! Highly recommended even if you never thought of being interested in engineering. The class should be re-named Creative Problem Solving and offered for all students. Case Studies and team appproach mirror real work in science, business, goverment, and pretty much anything that involves working with other people on large projects."
6534,609644,4.0,3.0,"Pretty intense guy, but his half of the class was probably the most interesting stuff I've done in the E-school so far."
6535,2125168,5.0,3.0,"You don't need to work hard if you attend his lectures. We had about 35 students in our class, but only about 10 would ever show up, I being one of the 25 that rarely showed up. He makes sure that the class understands the material, though, which is a big perk of signing up for his class. Not hard to get an A, but you can't slack off and expect it."
6536,2125168,4.0,4.0,"Professor Do is a great professor who has optional attendance. However, not attending may make you fail and only a small majority of my class attended lectures."
6537,1961329,4.0,3.0,"This class was really interesting and the instructor was very knowledgeable on the topic. Most of her readings are articles posted on collab and, compared to other courses at UVA, they are pretty manageable. She is very nice and wants to get to know you, stop by her office hours. You will learn a lot about art, history, religion, and archaeology."
6538,2256241,2.0,4.0,professor manson is extremely nice and her lectures are pretty engaging but her tests are so convoluted and not super based on class material which is extremely frustrating for a student. I for one studied for her tests extremely hard and knew her lectures better than anything and still received C's on the exams due to the poor question selection.
6539,2256241,2.0,4.0,"Professor Manson seems nice, but she focuses many of her lectures on examples from her research and on things she is interested in. Her tests are very difficult, every question is trying to trip you up. I studied an immense amount for these exams and still felt unprepared. Read the textbook and go to lecture."
6540,2256241,4.0,4.0,"This class was nice because lectures had info on the slides, but you need to work to study for tests. There was a lot of weird wording that was confusing on exams that had to go back and be fixed. But if you can learn the lectures well you'll be fine."
6541,2256241,2.0,5.0,"Manson is kind of the worst. She has an obsession with plants and that's basically all you learn about. There are like a thousand vocabulary words you will need to know regarding plants and other things. Topics are super dense and impossible to remember. Tests are insane. Lectures put you to sleep unless you, like her, have a plant fetish."
6542,2256241,2.0,4.0,"Honestly, what she tests you on isn't explicitly what's in her lecture. Cool professor though."
6543,2256241,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Manson lectures like a storyteller, which connects the content of each lecture into an engaging, coherent takeaway. Her enthusiasm for biology is contagious. She cares about her students understanding the topic more than she values busy work or unnecessarily hard grades. 2200 was hard, but this upper level class is easy and fun!"
6544,2256241,3.0,4.0,"Manson gives a pretty good lecture and puts words on her slides, which is appreciated. Never went to her office hours since I didn't think it would be worth it, but overall pretty decent professor."
6545,2256241,5.0,3.0,"I took population ecology with her and loved it! It seems that people are kind of 50/50 about her when she's teaching intro bio, but I would definitely recommend her for upper level bio classes. When she's teaching about things she loves, she's super engaging and friendly and takes the time to make sure you understand tougher concepts."
6546,2256241,1.0,4.0,Professor Manson is very bad professor who does not seem to care about the success of her students. Her lectures are unclear and she does not take the time to answer questions. I often read the textbook prior to class and prepared heavily for tests yet the questions were often confusing and unclear in how they were written.
6547,2256241,4.0,3.0,"I thought Prof. Manson was about on par with Kittlesen (the other intro bio professor) in terms of test difficulty but her lectures were easier to follow. This class is about as much based on memorization as it is on application, so Quizlet is your friend. If you keep up with the (admittedly heavy) readings the class is fairly straightforward."
6548,2256241,2.0,4.0,"Not the best prof. Record her lectures and take notes very carefully. Know everything she says in class in detail to the bare bone. I kid you not, there were questions on her exam that I thought she introduced in class &quot;just for fun&quot;. Since the exams are filled with ambiguous questions, going to exam review afterwards can sometimes earn pts back."
6549,2256241,5.0,4.0,"She is easily one of the best professors I have ever had. She genuinely cares that students do well; office hours are extremely helpful and she gives credit where credit is due. Not everybody likes the focus of her class, but it prepares you extremely well for upper-level courses. Test-heavy grades, but you learn so much."
6550,2256241,2.0,4.0,"Despite her haphazard passion for BIOL 2200, Manson fails at engaging students. Her class is extremely plant focused, speeding through the human anatomy, and swooning over her love for all plants. Nonetheless, her style and Canadian butchering of English words is bearable if you're a good test taker. Tests are 80%."
6551,2256241,5.0,4.0,"She is an amazing professor and is so excited when she teacher Biology. She is funny most of the time, and always makes the lectures interesting. She is a real gem. She is always available to talk and is the best Biology teacher I had here at UVA."
6552,2649465,4.0,4.0,"Even though the lecturing was online, Prof Stains did a good job answering all student questions and explaining content well. Very clear lectures and posts lectures and slides after classes. In my opinion, she and Kevin Welch are the best Chem 1410 professors to take. I would take her or Welch over Lisa M if given the choice."
6553,2649465,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Stains is easily the best chemistry professor for intro chem, she explains the material in-depth when the textbook doesn't make any sense. The class is pretty bad (tons of groupwork and a terrible textbook) but she makes it bearable. Always available to answer questions and legitimately one of the nicest professors I've ever had! Pick her &lt;3"
6554,2649465,5.0,3.0,Stains is the newest professor in the Chemistry department at UVA so not many people know about her. She is by far the best professor in the department. I took CHEM1410 during COVID and had to watch lectures from every Chem professor (new prof each week) so I basically had all of them. Stains is a great teacher and even better person. Choose her!!!
6555,249218,5.0,1.0,Very good professor. Easy to understand and high quality education. Has over 40 years of experience - he's been teaching for two times longer than some of you have been alive! Think about it!
6556,249218,1.0,4.0,"Professor Herbst is a smart man, and he wants to make sure you know that."
6557,249218,1.0,5.0,"I am not the only one who hates this man's teaching. Everyone I have spoken to is terrified of failing this class, and he is NOT AT ALL afraid to fail people. His expectations are wholly unrealistic. His lectures make no sense, and he's cocky and unhelpful. Do everything in your power to avoid his class, even overloading later. DO IT, DEAR GOD."
6558,249218,1.0,5.0,"In class, he runs through incomprehensible and messy proofs. At home, the homework has nothing to do with what was done in class. Wayward and difficult to understand. Makes many errors during class, expects you to have an great understanding already of the class that he's supposed to be teaching, so he is completely unhelpful when asked for help."
6559,249218,4.0,2.0,The test was much easier than the homeworks which I always appreciate.

6561,249218,1.0,1.0,"&quot;A unique sense of humor made him bearable. A lot of derivations and conceptual ideas instead of straightforward problems. Exams were always easier than pratice problems. Always available for office hours.&quot;                                               ---Thank you for your objective contribution, Prof herbst."
6562,249218,1.0,5.0,"He stunk for e-school, simple as that. He didn't explain anything or help me at all."
6563,249218,5.0,2.0,Way better than Thomas who I had for 132.  Herbst explains problems in class so you can do the homework and tests.  Notice only the engineers are complaining...maybe he's better for the college version of the class.
6564,249218,1.5,5.0,Comes to class with just his sunglasses and a piece of chalk.  Impossible to follow in class.  Everything he wrote on the board was pretty useless.  A lot of students dropped the class.  Unfortunately I tried to stick it out and ended up withdrawing...
6565,249218,1.5,4.0,AWFUL!  Spends majority of class time trying to convince you he's a math god.  BEWARE!
6566,249218,1.0,5.0,"the worst professor i've ever had...he has terrible methods of delivery, and merely regurgitates the conceptual ideas from the book that you wouldn't read anyway...oh, and his bizarre mannerisms only detract from his rating"
6567,249218,1.5,5.0,"This the worst class I have ever taken. Professor Herbst is by far the worst teacher that I've had in the math department, since he can't teach. The other person that gave him a good rating is totally lying. My only advice is to not take his class."
6568,249218,3.5,3.0,A unique sense of humor made him bearable.  A lot of derivations and conceptual ideas instead of straightforward problems.  Exams were always easier than pratice problems.  Always available for office hours.
6569,249218,1.5,5.0,"I liked calculus until taking 212 with this professor.  He only cares about a few select students, leaving the rest of us to struggle.  This class hurt my gpa more than any other e-school course.  Try to find another professor!"
6570,249218,1.0,4.0,He doesn't prepare lectures and just wings it in class.  He doesn't want to help you succeed.  The tests are killers.  Avoid this teacher unless you don't plan on learning anything.
6571,249218,1.0,4.0,"terrible teacher, uses a lot hand motions when talking about 3-D objects, which are helpless. i don't go class anymore because of his teaching method"
6572,372102,5.0,3.0,"My advice would be to read the textbook, but use the slides he gives in lecture to pick and choose what information you can expect to see on exams. Learn the diagrams and be able to explain functionality. Kopeny is a really sweet professor who wants you to learn, so definitely seek him out for office hours. I might just take 3420 to have him again!"
6573,372102,1.0,4.0,"The lecture and exams on lecture material in this class aren't too bad. Lectures can make material seem worse than it actually is, just read the book. But the lab for the class is certifiably awful. It counts for 40% of the grade and is just a 3 hours long cram session where your TA will just sit back and watch. By far the worst lab I've ever taken"
6574,372102,1.0,4.0,"If you're taking this class, be prepared for terrible/hard to understand lectures. Also, be ready to make your textbook your Bible because you have to know every little detail about every page of that book; the tests are very specific. I was disappointed in this course because I was looking forward to the material but it was not delivered well."
6575,372102,3.0,4.0,"I seemed to really struggle in Kopeny's class, but many of my friends did well. GET THE TEXTBOOK!! I found labs to be super easy, but I also took anatomy in high school. You really need to spend time studying for the exams because they're application and interpretation based. Office hours are really helpful and he does care to help you understand."
6576,372102,2.5,3.0,"Really nice guy. In lecture he is quite bland, he tries really hard to not read off the slides but then actually just pauses a lot and reads them directly anyway.  I went to every lecture to keep my mind in the subject but I only studied  the book. If you understand what everything on each page means & how they connect, you'll do well on the test."
6577,372102,4.5,3.0,"Kopeny is a really nice, sweet professor. Sure, his lectures aren't the most interesting, but they help clarify textbook stuff. Also, the textbook is your best friend in this class."
6578,372102,4.5,1.0,"Professor Kopeny seemed boring at first, but it turned out to be one of my favorite classes! Go to office hours cause he kind of pokes at what's going to be on the exams, also it's really helpful in general. If you take lab, then it'll parallel with the lecture material. Don't judge a book by its cover - trust me, this is better than 2010."
6579,372102,3.5,3.0,"Though he isn't the most interesting person, he is there for you if you have questions. The labs that you participate in are actually more fun that BIOL 2030. It's a good class, not a burden. I learned a lot."
6580,372102,3.5,3.0,"I fell asleep mostly every day in this class. You don't really have to show up, all you have to do is read the textbook. The lectures do help though. It also helps to go to office hours and ask questions."
6581,372102,4.0,2.0,The other reviews of Kopeny are pretty harsh.  He's a very nice guy who really does want you to understand the material.  His lectures and exams are straight from the book so if you read attending lecture is not always essential and vice versa.  He also provides practice exams before each test which are very helpful for assessing your preparedness.
6582,372102,3.5,3.0,The other reviews of Kopeny are way to harsh. He's a really nice guy and will definitely take the time to answer any questions you have if you go to his office hours. He does reads off the slides in his lecture but tries to make them interesting. He also definitely puts a lot of time into his slides which are really helpful for studying.
6583,372102,2.5,3.0,"He's a terrible lecturer: speaks slowly, repeats mostly what's on the slides, and not engaging at all. Nice guy though. Tests are mostly based on textbook materials, so reading the text is mandatory."
6584,372102,1.0,3.0,Terrible teacher.  butchers the material.  leave class with less understanding than came in with
6585,372102,1.5,2.0,"Although he may have a grasp on the material himself, he is in no way capable of explaining it to a class of 300 + students. Doesn't put time into  lectures that would promote a greater understanding of in-depth knowledge. Instead, essentially reads from a powerpoint without connecting important ideas or drawing important general conclusions"
6586,372102,1.0,4.0,"Kopeny is irrelevant, boring, and terrible at communicating information.  His lab lecture is nigh useless, with him frequently pausing and turning his back to his students in order to figure out whether he forgot to read anything off the powerpoint.  If it weren't for the scale I would've given Kopeny a 0 for usefulness."
6587,372102,1.0,4.0,"A lab should be focused on improving microscopy and guided exploration skills while developing a further passion for the field of science. This lab course does neither of these as the investigations are random, unorganized, and filled with meaningless knowledge. Unhelpful and not a good course to further develop biological understanding"
6588,372102,1.0,4.0,"Terrible class and terrible teacher. To anyone with a passion for learning or a desire to pursue the sciences, I recommend finding a way out of this lab course. The work done in the lab is irrelevant to the ""tests"" given, the material is unorganized and poorly taught. Spent more time reorganizing his lectures than learning"
6589,372102,1.0,3.0,"Had him for lecture, then lab. Lecture was dry, teaches straight out of the book. Taking lab now; he makes you buy an expensive lab manual (THAT YOU DO NOT USE) then makes you print out the worksheets you turn in (again, the MANDATORY LAB MANUAL you BUY you do NOT USE. Instead, you have to print out the stuff you turn in.)"
6590,372102,4.0,2.0,"At first glance, Kopeny is boring because he is monotone  during his lectures. However, if you get to know him, he's genuinely nice. His tests are fair & his slides are pretty comprehensive in terms of what to get out of the textbook readings. Clickers are required but he stops using them eventually. Gives out readings, most are optional though."
6591,372102,3.5,4.0,"For BIOL 340, lab quizzes are worth the most of your grade so it's important you do well on them (however, questions can be difficult and really specific). Labs are fun; Kopeny even brought his hawk in! Lectures are often hard to follow. Dr. Kopeny is very enthusiastic when he speaks and is willing to help if you need it. Received a B-."
6592,372102,1.5,4.0,Lectures&#63; Pointless and BORING. Pre-lab reading&#63; Somewhat pointless. Focus on the random facts the TAs toss at you during lab and you'll pass the quizzes. As for the professor himself.. he's really pushy in emails and at times even rude. Definitely not the nicest person.
6593,372102,2.5,3.0,"Although Kopeny really cares about the success of his students and his exams are mostly about memorization, his lectures are very unclear. He tends to repeat himself when saying something, and then saying something that was opposite of his original statement. I had a hard time in this class this summer because of his uncertainty about what he said."
6594,372102,3.0,4.0,"I enjoyed BIOL 204 much more than BIOL 203. At pre-lab lecture, Kopeny provides you w/a lot of useful information that you need for that week's lab. Lab quizzes are difficult but completion of the worksheets are valued the same. TA I had was Kilkenny. Received a B+ in the class."
6595,372102,2.0,3.0,"Same as with the lecture portion of the class, but even more pointless.  Puts way too much weight on the pre-lab quizzes (of which you're at the mercy of the TAs) which don't really measure your preparedness.  Cram before each lab session and hope you get quizzed on the random facts you happen to memorize, because that's this class in a nutshell."
6596,372102,2.0,2.0,"Wow.  One of the worst lecturers I've had at UVA (even for a 500 person lecture like intro bio).  Seemingly incapable of maintaining a constant stream of thought, lectures are pointless except for the extra credit clicker questions.  Show up for that, do sudoku/crossword/watch DVDs in the meantime, study the day before each exam and still get a A."
6597,372102,2.0,5.0,"I'd try to say something more uplifting, but I really can't. Lectures are basically what's said in the text, just less clear, and exams are more incomprehensible than the lectures. Perhaps the one upside is that you're forced to suffer through the material here, which you'll have to do for the MCAT anyway. Overall a step down from 201."
6598,372102,2.0,4.0,Ugh.  I'm sorry if you have to take this class as a requirement.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have to take it.  He makes you learn so much on your own that it is basically two classes worth of material in one semester.
6599,372102,1.5,4.0,"Overall, a very intelligent professor who could not teach.  He leaves most of the material up to you, is unorganized, and the tests are extremely hard with nit-picky details."
6600,372102,2.0,3.0,"&quot;I don't have to teach this, you'll have to read about it on your own&quot; is the phrase I've heard most this semester. He usually posts about 35 slides per day and gets through, oh, about 20. All in all, unorganized, unhelpful and quite the boring lecturer. If the subject matter wasn't so easy it would be an unbearable course."
6601,372102,1.5,5.0,"BIOL 203 overally covers the evolution of organisms. The materials are boring compared to BIOL 201, and too many boring memorization. And his tests include considerate deep synthesis questions a lot. His tests are about 50-57 questions whici is painful. His lecture with slides were not organized at all."
6602,372102,3.0,4.0,"The subject matter really isn't that hard. He just asks very tricky questions. Test averages are in the mid 70's. He rambles in class about unimportant things. He picks the most random things to put on the test, too. If you did well in BIO 201, don't think you'll do well here. He's a completely different teacher. Watch out."
6603,372102,2.0,4.0,"different teaching style from Kittlesen. If you did well in Biol 201, don't take it for granted that you will do well in BIOL 202 also."
6604,372102,3.0,4.0,"Tests are tricky and very detailed. Pay attention to every word he said even if he seems to go through it casually. Read the book in its entirety and pay attention to details, even though he said &quot;I don't really want you to memorize this or that&quot;. Memorization is important! TA (Dexter)is helpful. Go ask him if you need help"
6605,372102,2.5,4.0,"Adores the sound of his own voice. I went to his office hours 3 days in a row, and he had no recollection of who I was or what we had talked about. Pathetic. Though he is passionate about the subject, he does not care AT ALL about students. If you can bear it, he focuses on lecture material  for exams, so go to class."
6606,372102,1.0,5.0,Terrible lecturer. Extremely unorganized and uncaring about his students. His powerpoints are impossible to understand during class and are a pain to look at for 20 minutes while he rambles on about some incomprehensable point. Expects you to get everything he says the first time he says it. My least favorite teacher at The University
6607,372102,2.0,5.0,"Lectures were hard to follow and the powerpoint slides did not pinpoint the important material.  IMHO, Kittlesen is the better lecturer."
6608,372102,1.0,5.0,absolutely horrible. terrible teacher. doesnt know how to teach so he just rambles on and on. should just use the book but he feels like he is too good for it. only half the class goes to lecture because he confuses more than helps.
6609,372102,3.5,3.0,"He speaks too fast during lectures, his slides are not very organized. listen carefully to what he says in class for the exam. overall: average teacher"
6610,372102,5.0,4.0,"Very good teacher! Very thorough, which was fantastic, and nicely energetic! A pleasure to go to lectures even though I'm not so keen on the material!"
6611,372102,5.0,3.0,Dr. Kopeny was awesome! He was my advisor and he was so passionate about his subject and was just a pleasant person to be around.
6612,372102,2.0,1.0,"This guy loves the sound of his own voice.  this class was so easy, but I hated waking up for an 8 am lab lecture.  I hated even more having to listen to him.  His lectures are disorganized and he lectures poorly."
6613,372102,2.5,2.0,1 word - BORING. he can NEVER stop talking and often overruns...only able to go through half his powerpoint slides everytime due to his longwinded-ness. very unclear and you can see a good number of people arriving 5 minutes before class ends everytime just for the clicker question. tests are not as hard as 201. the book'll be your best friend.
6614,372102,1.5,3.0,"This guy needs to reevaluate his whole life.  His lectures are way too detailed and boring, 3/4 of the class is asleep or on their laptops.  I got an A in this class but i'm still bitter that he wasted my thursday mornings for nothing.Checks attendence with iclicker so u have to go for 5% of grade.  He messed up the grades last semester."
6615,372102,4.5,3.0,"He is a great guy and wants to help his students a lot. His tests are midline difficulty. Tends to be repetitive in his lectures, and can be borning. He TAKES ATTENDANCE with iclickers. Very detailed and helpful powerpoint slides."
6616,372102,2.5,3.0,Nice guy but not a good lecturer. He tends to ramble and lectures are very scattered. Often late to class.
6617,372102,4.0,3.0,i LOVE Dr. Kopeny.  One of the few professors i've met who actually care about how the student is doing in the class and is ALWAYS willing to offer help in any way whatsoever....Go to office hours.   Exams are ok if you prepare accordingly!!
6618,372102,2.5,3.0,kinda scattered
6619,372102,2.0,4.0,"Not the greatest speaker in the world...I usually fell asleep in lecture. Tests were not too bad if you studied well enough. He seemed really nice, but I found the content of his class boring."
6620,372102,4.0,3.0,"Know his power point slides front to back, even the small details-this is where he gets most of his test questions."
6621,372102,1.5,3.0,"random lecturer, extremely unclear"
6622,372102,5.0,1.0,"I took vertebrates with Dr. K and he's amazingly cool- the man has a hawk!  That class was great and I learned so much during that semester.  For intro bio lab, he did his best to make the class fair for everyone, and as long as you did your work and studied the slides, the test ought to have been easy. Bottom line- Dr. K is cool!"
6623,372102,3.0,3.0,this man doesn't teach. he simply reads badly written slides. have fun
6624,372102,4.0,2.0,going to lecture is pointless because he reads directly from the slides and then posts them on toolkit afterwards.  just read the chapters and look over the slides and the tests are easy
6625,372102,3.0,2.0,"Kopeny needs to learn how to teach intro bio from Kittleson.  Slides are incredibly wordy, and exams have very poorly worded test questions.  Class isn't hard, just frustrating because the lectures are so boring."
6626,372102,4.0,4.0,"Kopeny is a teacher with a tremendous sense of passion for the study of LIFE!  Take good notes during lectures, read the book....and attend on a regular basis.  Random attendance checks are a guarantee....."
6627,372102,1.5,5.0,"never have i felt so defeated after taking a test-- the tests didn't test lecture knowledge, there were obscure and ridiculous questions. i hated this class with a passion. kopeny needs to take it down a notch on the caffeine, then maybe his lectures would be more coherent."
6628,372102,1.5,4.0,ridiculous tests. wordy slides. have to read the book to even think about getting above a 50 on the exam.
6629,372102,1.5,4.0,"Frankly, avoiding this class is worth forgoing a career in medicine.  okay maybe it wasn't that bad, but it was horrifically boring and the tests were completely ridiculous.  he tested obscure, useless knowledge.  don't bother going to lecture, just go to review once or twice and read the slides."
6630,372102,1.5,2.0,Just reads his slides so the lecture isnt worth attending.  Also terrible at responding to e-mail.  Accused an entire class of 400 of cheating and wont appologize.
6631,372102,2.5,4.0,"he's an alright guy, really shows he's into the material. however his lectures are boring, i soon decided to never pay attention because all he does is read off of the slides and nothing more. tests are alright, the difficulty comes from your competetive students, not the test. curves to a high B-"
6632,372102,2.0,3.0,"Very bad at lecturing, reads off his overwhelmingly wordy slides (which he desperately need to proofread), very anal exams (I could care less what specific arms on a squid are called; they're all tentacles to me)"
6633,372102,3.0,3.0,"Good guy, but as for his biology expertice............"
6634,372102,2.0,3.0,"CANNOT give a lecture worth attending. Reads off his 500 word slides, which do NOT help. Uses lots of pictures from the book. Exams are badly worded, making them very tricky, and they need revision (too many typos). TA is much better.. Did well in 201 but struggling in 202, even tho I study more..."
6635,372102,2.5,3.0,"The guy needs to take a course in &quot;public speaking&quot; and &quot;Lecturing&quot;. He can't give a lecture. He reads of off slides (50 in one .ppt file) full of text while studdering -- that is all, no examples or full explanations of concepts. The tests are full of tricky questions. (Nice guy in person tho)"
6636,372102,4.0,3.0,"nice guy, hard class.  His lectures are hard to follow as well... slides are completely full but don't need to know a lot of what's on them.  TA was a better lecturer.  He stutters a lot and doesn't sound like he really prepared, even though he knows the material."
6637,372102,2.0,1.0,No Comments
6638,372102,4.0,3.0,"not a terribly difficult class, keep up with the readings... hyper little guy, moves around a lot, probably from all the coffee he drinks, which by the way, don't sit in the front row or you'll smell his coffee breath through the whole class... yuck! random attendance checks so beware"
6639,372102,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Kopeny is sooo sooo nice and the material he teaches is really interesting, but the course is also very hard!  I reccomend keeping up with the reading if you can, because he goes fast in lecture."
6640,372102,5.0,3.0,I love Dr. Kopeny! He is the best science teacher I have ever had! And he is soo nice!!!!
6641,372102,5.0,4.0,"I graduated from UVA several years ago and Dr. Kopeny was by far one of the best professors I had in biology. His classes were challenging but your hard work will pay off.  He is very approachable, so if you have questions don't be afraid to talk to him."
6642,445839,3.0,4.0,"I took EVSC 1000 with Professor Davis. It's an intro level class, but his tests are incredibly specific and often include hard-to-read diagrams and confusingly-worded questions. Seems like a nice guy, but his lectures are very dry and his PowerPoints are almost entirely image-based so if you miss something, good luck going back and finding it."
6643,445839,2.0,5.0,"While Professor Davis is a funny and good guy, his lectures are not very clear to the understanding of the class. While this is a 1000 level course it is much harder that I ever expected. He makes himself available outside of class, but his lectures just are not clear. He does not give enough analysis of the topic in which he is speaking on."
6644,445839,4.5,1.0,Davis is one of the funniest professors I've ever had. On top of that he really knows his stuff and cares deeply about the subject. Four tests and you drop the lowest. No textbook required. No final exam. If you're in need of a science credit take this class!
6645,445839,2.5,5.0,Lots of math. Hard tests. Prof. Davis is cool but no extra credit. Not an easy A or B... throws out a lot of equations in lecture but doesn't really explain how to use them or when to use them.
6646,445839,5.0,4.0,Bob Davis is awesome! I love weather!
6647,445839,4.0,2.0,He's a really funny and helpful teacher. I would say he's one of my favorites at UVA and his class is not that hard. I definitely recommend him and I plan to take his 3300 level class.
6648,445839,2.0,5.0,"Not recommended if you're not planning on being an Enviro major. I was planning on taking an easy science class and was told this would do it, but the tests are terribly designed and shamefully unfair. Tests make up all of your grade, so bad test scores can't be offset. He's a nice guy, yes, but not helpful to your GPA, not even in office hours."
6649,445839,5.0,3.0,Davis is funny and enthusiastic. My favorite professor at UVa.
6650,445839,4.0,5.0,"Davis is a peppy, nice guy, but his tests are very difficult. Questions tend to be on things he only briefly mentions. Pay attention, and definitely go to class. definitely get the text book... but I wouldn't take the class over. too difficult to a non science major!"
6651,445839,3.0,5.0,"If you need a science math requirement, DO NOT take this class expecting it to be easy. Davis is an easy going guy, but his tests are ridiculously picky and unless you memorize the textbook and his lectures, you will not do as well as you think...he also goes very fast when he lectures, so only take it if you truly have to"
6652,445839,5.0,1.0,"Relatively easy class; I didn't bother getting the textbook and still did well. Going to class helps, and if anything, the bad jokes help you remember some lectures. It's easier for those who have some minimal weather background or understanding."
6653,445839,3.5,4.0,"If you heard this was an easy class, you heard wrong. You get into class and find Davis to be an awesome guy with enthusiasm. You think you understand everything. Then you get the test and that view is forever distorted. His tests are extremely difficult and if you don't pay superb attention and study a lot, you won't do well. I'd avoid it..."
6654,445839,5.0,4.0,Davis is great.  He really loves his job and is such a fun and entertaining teacher.  The material is difficult in this class. Tests are reasonable if you attend every class and put time into studying. Taking EVSC150 before this class is very helpful but not needed. Overall he is a great professor and makes the class worth the work.
6655,445839,4.0,5.0,"HUGE discrepancy between lectures and tests. He lectures in a way that is extremely easy to understand (aka at a high school level), then throws an upper level college exam at you. very very nice guy, and office hours are helpful, but this discrepancy is huge. also, he curves very, very little...to a B-, if that."
6656,445839,3.0,5.0,"Be forewarned, this class is not as easy as everyone says!"
6657,445839,4.5,3.0,"This has been my favorite class so far at UVA. Professor Davis is an extremely engaging lecturer, and doesn't leave anything unexplained. Highly recommended, and it's not too hard if you study and go to lecture."
6658,445839,4.5,2.0,"He's a cool guy. Pretty dorky. Cracks LAME jokes, but you have to laugh. Class is rather helpful. And pretty easy. You don't need to buy the textbook if you just go to class. Tests are all MC, 40 questions. Not too hard. They're curved too."
6659,445839,5.0,4.0,Must be the best teacher ever because he made one of the most difficult subjects seem relatively easy.  This class would have been hell without him as the teacher.
6660,445839,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic teacher, one of the best I've ever had.  Very interesting lectures, knows how to reach people who may not even be interested in the subject.  You don't even need the textbook, just take good notes."
6661,445839,4.5,2.0,"Great guy, don't need the book at all. Just go to class and study from the lecture slides (which he posts) and your notes and you will be fine. Very interesting class and would highly recommend. Pretty funny too."
6662,445839,5.0,1.0,"The best professor I've had so far at UVA.  I would recommend that you take this class if you have an interest in weather.  If not, the material may be too tedious.  As a lecturer, he is passionate, and he is very helpful after class and during office hours."
6663,445839,4.5,3.0,Great class - really interesting. Bob would always help if needed
6664,445839,4.0,1.0,"Don't buy the textbook!!!! Pretty straightforward class, if you like your midterm grades, you can skip the rest of the lectures and the final... only be afraid of the math if you're very bad at math."
6665,445839,4.5,3.0,"Davis is very excited about the weather and a pretty interesting speaker.  Class is based only on lectures and as was said before, he likes to put tricky nitpicky questions on his tests.  Class contains a fair bit of math, but nothing too difficult.  If you are interested in the weather, he's your man."
6666,445839,5.0,1.0,"He tried his hand at teaching a base-level E-school class, and I feel he succeeded.  Very knowledgeable, clear lecturer, and a good guy; not to mention how easy the class was."
6667,445839,5.0,3.0,"He makes the material very easy to understand during class. You don't have to do any reading as long as you go to the class and review your notes. He is very personable and funny, as well. I highly recommend his classes."
6668,445839,4.5,4.0,"Perhaps the most intelligent EVSC professor at UVA. (Why are most of them so stupid&#63;)  His class is difficult, but he really explains the material well and has a passion for weather.  The textbook is optional, but do not miss lecture."
6669,445839,4.0,3.0,"Oh Bob Davis.  He is nice, tries a little to hard.  Everything is based on the lectures so it's pretty important to go, he doesn't put them online.  The tests are tricky as hell.  If you are into the weather you will like him, he is enthusiastic."
6670,2338193,1.0,5.0,"Epstein teaches like she doesn't know the material. Rather, she doesn't really teach just throws a bunch of info at you and expects you to memorize it all then expects you to apply it. She also seems like an elitist, only interested in the top performers. Not willing to help those who are struggling. Doesn't care if you pass or fail."
6671,904594,4.5,3.0,She is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6672,904594,4.5,4.0,very helpful and knowledgeable. def helpful when you have questions and really wants to hear what the students think about the class and materials. really cares about students outside of class too.
6673,904594,4.0,4.0,"No book, texts online- hard, range from classic poems to news articles to archaic stories, no common theme- unpredictable.  Lots of discussion, participation expected, will call on randomly. Good exposure to new, needed formal vocabulary, makes you use in essays. Also understands personal problems interfere with class/work, feel free to tell her."
6674,2198931,5.0,1.0,Great professor. I would definitely take one of his classes again. He's pretty cute too!
6675,1830297,4.5,4.0,"I took PHYS 1610 with him, which is for physics majors. The class is naturally hard, and so yes it was still difficult with Group, but he's really nice and helpful. He's not necessarily a great teacher, but he's pretty good."
6676,1830297,4.5,3.0,"very nice, also helpful"
6677,470425,4.5,2.0,"He's super cute and makes jokes in class. He explains concepts very clearly and is very straightforward on lectures. He tells you exactly what you need to know for exams. If you do all the suggested problems, the tests should be straightforward and fair. 3 midterms and 1 final. Joe, the TA, is extremely helpful too. Take it with Marshall!"
6678,470425,4.5,4.0,Great professor! His lectures are very straight forward. Very accessible with office hours both for Marshall and our TA. Exams are tough.
6679,470425,4.0,4.0,"Good teacher, though going to class isn't really necessary.  I suggest doing the practice problems if you want to do well on the exam."
6680,470425,5.0,3.0,"Marshall is an amazing professor. He gives tons of examples in class for every equation and explains everything with great clarity. Orgo is a hard class but Marshall's tests are straightforward and fair. Do the problems he recommends from the book, they will help a lot on the tests. He stops for questions & is very knowledgeable about his subject."
6681,470425,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor. Very helpful if you go to office hours. Just study the textbook problems, and the exams are okay.."
6682,470425,5.0,5.0,so sexy. great lecture. really nice to look at.
6683,470425,5.0,3.0,"This man is the best. The class is hard, its ORGO after all, but he does his best to make it clear. Tests are hard and few, but they are fair and some problems do come directly from HW problems. He has a passion for orgo and if you actualy pay attention you can develop one to."
6684,470425,3.0,4.0,"He is a decent lecturer and always throws in random corny jokes so if you are paying attention the class is not all that bad.  He takes questions straight from the hw for the exams so DO THE ASSIGNED PROBLEMS!!!!  However, BEWARE: He does NOT prepare you for the MCATs like the other professors do. He is more about memorizing and not understanding.."
6685,470425,4.0,3.0,"Good lecturer. Learning organic chemistry is like learning the alphabet, you have to learn the language before you can read the great thinkers. He makes the basics as painless as possible."
6686,470425,4.5,4.0,He is an amazing lecturer. He seems to be really interested in his field. He is also more caring about teaching than failing people.
6687,470425,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Marshall's lectures are very clear.  Tests are tough, but straightforward, and you can get partial credit.  As far as organic chemistry goes, you're not going to find anyone who can make it much more interesting than Marshall does."
6688,470425,5.0,3.0,Great guy. Defntly better than the other org teachers. Tests are hard but not too tricky. You just have to know the material very well. No multiple choice so you can get partial credit (big plus!)
6689,470425,3.5,4.0,"he's really nice and pretty humorous, but his teaching style is rather unclear and it is hard to follow what he is talking about sometimes."
6690,470425,4.0,3.0,great personality but not very clear on teaching
6691,2461097,1.0,4.0,He is an excellent teacher but worst of the worst grader as an Instructor. He will work you so much from the beginning to the end of the semester. Haven't done all he asked for as an obedient student and meet all the criteria. He will still give you an horrible grade. He torch inappropriately too.
6692,2461097,5.0,5.0,"He's the best professor anybody in architecture will ever have, no exaggeration. He's brilliant, knows a precedent for any situation, has his own practice (and is Spanish) so he is very knowledgeable in construction techniques. Luis is chill, easy to talk to, extraordinarily helpful in desk crits and reviews. Also has phenomenal graphic skills."
6693,503218,2.5,5.0,"I read the other comments thinking the class wouldn't be that bad, but I was wrong. DO NOT TAKE IT. He puts so much worthless information into his powerpoints that you have no idea what is important and he uses unnecessary jargon constantly. 1st midterm was easy, but he managed to kill my entire class in the 2nd midterm after the course drop date."
6694,503218,4.0,3.0,"Definitely don't buy the book, like others said.  His tests are not hard, they cover exactly what he goes over in lecture.  Can be a little dry, but still take it if you're interested in botany."
6695,503218,2.0,5.0,"Warning: STAY AWAY. I took this class cause it looked cool and seemed an easy way to knock out 3 credits for a major/minor. Its not. First, timko is a molecular biologist, not a botanist, and teaches alot of physiology and terminology, and little botany. Second, his notes are so convoluted you dont know what he is going to ask on tests. Bad Class."
6696,503218,3.0,3.0,"Not a bad class. I came in not wanting to be there, but my interest level increased after the first couple weeks. The lectures were okay (esp. Knowlton as a guest lecturer) and the tests were a little difficult but fair. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. All of his questions come straight from the notes and lectures."
6697,503218,3.5,4.0,"I love Timko. There's a ton of material, and if you're not interested, it will probably seem dry. Otherwise, lab's aren't bad and he takes the class on field trips. Tests aren't bad, just a little picky. There's no need to even buy the book, but definitely go to class. It's pretty low stress. Timko is good clean fun!"
6698,503218,5.0,3.0,"Yeah, he talks a lot and uses a lot of terms, but he always defines them. if you study, the tests are really basic...take it if you're interested. you'll learn a lot."
6699,503218,2.5,4.0,Everything was on the slides---which were very confusing.  Goes in to too much detail.
6700,503218,3.0,3.0,"I thought botany would be cool to take, but I was wrong. He just sorta rambles and talks like you should know what is going on, but most people in the class don't. If you're good at bio though, he makes perfect sense."
6701,503218,2.0,3.0,"His lectures are VERY detailed, almost too many details. His tests ask for all that detail too, so they're hard. Mult. Choice, short answer, essay tests. Labs are fine. Nice guy. Yawn."
6702,1969591,5.0,3.0,The best professor I have ever had. She cares more about her students than anything else. Take her classes... all of them!!
6703,2362808,5.0,3.0,She is pretty much the best TA I have ever had at UA.
6704,2362808,5.0,3.0,"Sajedeh was an absolutely PHENOMENAL TEACHER! She not only cares so much, she teaches so well! So young and a graduate student but puts in so much extra time for us and it makes a difference. It means the world to me how much she cares and how well she teaches."
6705,2362808,5.0,2.0,Sajedeh is hilarious
6706,839140,5.0,1.0,Professor Mahoney is one of the best teachers I ever had. She has a talent for making complex concepts easy to understand and easy to remember. Her classes are memorable. The way she explains legal  concepts stays with you years after the class.
6707,839140,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Mahoney is an exellent, clear lecturer. She follows the issues raised by the readings and explains the issues well. She is accessible outside of class and very friendly. She is one of my favorite professors, and I recommend taking her classes if you can."
6708,2420197,5.0,3.0,She had the best transition during the quarantine period out of all my professors. She is extremely accommodating and very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject she teaches. It really resonated with me. I have learned so much about writing in the course of a few months.
6709,2420197,5.0,2.0,"Emily is the best teacher I have had so far! She cares deeply about her students and the material she teaches. She is interesting, smart, and funny, and provides very helpful feedback. Emily is an all-around wonderful teacher and person, and I would highly recommend her to anyone."
6710,2420197,5.0,2.0,Emily is AMAZING. She is really passionate about what she teaches. She made a mandatory writing class a pleasure to be a part of. I was able to become a better writer with her class.
6711,2420197,5.0,3.0,"Emily has been one of the best professors I've had thus far. She cares so deeply about her students and this empathy translates well into the classroom. Emily always encourages her students to do their very best. I truly learned a lot from her class, and I can easily say she made me into a better writer. Take her classes if you get the chance!"
6712,2420197,5.0,2.0,"Emily is the most influential educator I have known. Her class was insightful, introspective, and explorative. The poetic tale that she weaved was entirely original and riveting; its not just Whitman and Eliot, but a collection of unique voices that all have something important to say about the human condition. Whatever she is teaching, take it."
6713,2420197,5.0,3.0,"I had never taken a creative writing class before nor had I ever written poetry, but none of that mattered when it came to this class because Ms. Lawson is such a great professor. She truly cares about all her students, she loves the material, and you can tell that she really enjoys teaching. I loved this class."
6714,2420197,5.0,3.0,Amazing class! Lawson encourages creativity but not at the expense of insight. She introduces you to poetry in a really unique way--you won't be reading a who's who of the Poets Hall of Fame!
6715,2420197,5.0,3.0,"The world needs more teachers like Emily! She is incredibly thoughtful, considerate, and open minded. She really worked to understand each student as an individual and created a warm, collaborative, welcoming classroom environment."
6716,1797604,5.0,4.0,Professor Douglas is a life changing professor! He helps you open doors you didn't even know existed. He makes you work for the grade but makes it a journey worth taking. 10/10 recommended
6717,1797604,4.0,4.0,Great Class!!
6718,1797604,5.0,3.0,"Doug Muir is highly engaging, intelligent, and an excellent lecturer. He works hard for his students and always relates concepts back to his own experiences with the many companies he has built."
6719,1797604,5.0,4.0,"Great guy, fair and honest"
6720,1797604,1.5,1.0,"How does UVA associate themselves with this man. He has lawsuits all over the place. Most all of his businesses have failed. Got an A, but a waste of my tuition. I guess UVA does not do background checks on professors. Sad that I found this info out, after I paid for the class. Look him up on the internet and you will see the facts. He's a con man!"
6721,1797604,4.0,2.0,Muir has the respect of the class despite being (more than a bit) arrogant. He's pretty cool and really knows what he's doing. The class was a lot of work for an STS class and structured as one big group project. The upside is if you do the work you will get an A and there were no tests. Worth taking if you are willing to do the work!
6722,1797604,5.0,2.0,"Professor Muir is a great lecturer! I learned practical, useful skills that I can use when I start my own business in the future.  Be sure to participate in class."
6723,1797604,1.5,3.0,"Muir's lectures have lots of mistakes and his homework assignments are unclear. He grades on participation in an 80 person class and claims that he is going to cold call on people but, he just calls on the same four or five kids every class. His quizzes are easy because they are straight memorizing but we don't learn anything because of that."
6724,1797604,3.5,1.0,"The class is easy if you follow the syllabus, but if you want to learn tangible skills you need to take on the book learning by yourself. "
6725,1797604,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Muir is very honest and applies real world problems/situations when teaching the class. Overall, I'd say he was one of the best professors I had at UVA. "
6726,1797604,4.5,3.0,"Professor Muir is an excellent teacher, he is extremely helpful and clear. You MUST however attend all clases. Attendance IS mandatory and if you don't participate you will not pass. Overall, great class. "
6727,1797604,4.0,1.0,"Professor Muir is a serial entrepreneur who will tell you many stories of his experiences as an entrepreneur. The class is very easy if you do the assignments they way he says, and participate in class. "
6728,1797604,5.0,1.0,Very cool guy. Fun lectures.
6729,1797604,5.0,2.0,"You sort of have to figure out how to take his quizzes/tests and how to do the homework the way he likes it, but you'll never learn more in a class."
6730,1797604,5.0,1.0,"Take this class (if you can get in), it fills up super fast for a reason!! He's an awesome professor, and you will NOT regret taking his class. What's more is that he really cares about his students and wants everyone to do well. Probably the most qualified person to teach about entrepreneurship on grounds :)"
6731,1797604,4.5,1.0,This professor is awesome!!! :) Take this class!!! I learned so much (probably the most interesting class I've taken here yet). He brings his real-world experience into the classroom all the time.
6732,1797604,4.5,1.0,Love this professor! This is definitely a class to take if you're interested in business and startups. He brings his real -world experience to the classroom which is great. Probably one of the best classes I've taken here yet.
6733,1797604,4.0,2.0,"IF YOU WANT TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR OR EVEN AN INTRAPRENEUR(AN ENTREPRENEUR INSIDE A LARGE COMPANY) YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS. THIS IS A GREAT CLASS TO LEARN HOW TO COME UP WITH A START-UP COMPANY IDEA, RESEARCH IF IT IS A VIABLE IDEA, AND HOW TO PRESENT TO INVESTORS."
6734,1797604,5.0,2.0,Great teacher!
6735,1797604,4.5,2.0,"Worked with Doug- very helpful, knowledgable, and readily available when help is needed. Definitely kept it an interesting class and is super engaging. Moderate reading but interesting case studies given. Always brings his real-world experience into the classroom."
6736,1797604,4.5,1.0,"Great class, easy grading, and great professor. Professor Muir is an experienced entrepreneur and a great resource to students. Class is always entertaining and he takes student feedback into account and make subsequent changes to the class."
6737,1633772,1.0,5.0,Gives too much hw and is bad at explaining math
6738,1633772,3.0,3.0,"She's nice and very eager to help, but a bit awkward at times. The lectures are bit too focused on theorems and I think they could be explained in much shorter ways (plus her handwriting is hard to read sometimes). She did make a large effort to be available after class though..."
6739,1633772,1.0,4.0,"Having already learned about most of the topics in the class, I felt extremely bad who came into Calculus fresh. She explained everything through definitions, never in plain language, and failed to make anything comprehensible. She's just an awkward math major that should never be teaching students."
6740,1633772,1.0,3.0,She is very boring and is not very helpful when you have questions. I would suggest avoiding her class.
6741,650738,5.0,2.0,Ryan was passionate about his subject and made the class fun.   He has a strong grasp of the concepts and teaches them in an understandable way.
6742,650738,5.0,3.0,I LOVE PROFESSOR NELSON! He's so fun and makes it interesting and fun to come to class
6743,650738,4.5,2.0,Brilliant teacher and a brilliant class. He is very funny and teaches you everything that you need to know. I would really recommend having him as a professor. He is also very reswponsive to emails (responds within 20minutes usually.) Excellent teacher!
6744,650738,5.0,4.0,first rate prof!
6745,650738,4.5,2.0,"He's awesome, and he's one of the reasons that Block one is the best in the comm school."
6746,650738,5.0,3.0,No Comments
6747,650738,1.5,5.0,"Doesn't ever read the assignments you turn in for grades.  Arbitrarily sets grade cut offs.  When you go see him to question his grading system, he tells you that you didn't talk enough about points that were never asked to be discussed in the actual assignment."
6748,650738,3.5,3.0,"Nice guy, does a good job of making IT interesting."
6749,650740,4.5,4.0,"Professor Baglioni was inviting, warm, and a wonderful professor!"
6750,650740,4.5,2.0,It's not hard to do well in his class if you do the reading and pay attention. If you still don't get it he is very willing to help you anytime. The subjects not the most interesting but at least we have a professor who is interested in us.
6751,650740,3.5,2.0,"The lecture is not well constructed and hard to follow...very confusing..and unclear. However, he is really helpful one-on-one during his office hours and definitely cares about his students."
6752,650740,4.0,2.0,He really cares about his students and makes sure that you understand the material. Annotated labs are really helpful when doing the homework. If you had stat 212 or a previous stat class then most of it just review anyways. I enjoyed his class and it's not too hard!
6753,650740,3.5,4.0,"Prof Baglioni is a very nice guy. I had him for ICE last year. I very frusterated first semester. People gave him some terrible reviews and he really changed second semester. He was very helpful and he truly cared about students' success. QA overall is somewhat boring to teach, for the subject he did a great job"
6754,650740,4.0,2.0,"Baglioni is a great guy.  He really cares about making his students satisfied with his teaching methods and tries his best to make QA worthwhile.  It's tough to convince when the subject is so boring, but he does a pretty good job considering.  I like that he lightens up the mood in class with sports/politics/pics of his dogs, etc."
6755,650740,1.0,4.0,"He sucks.  Worst teacher I have ever had.  Tries to be nice, but I could care less about your dog or Maryland"
6756,650740,1.0,2.0,"One of the worst teachers I've ever had.  I feel like somebody should hand out supplement packets after all of his classes to cover all the topics he got wrong.  He doesn't know statistics at all, his lectures are unclear and he will waste your time.  For example during class he'll regularly show pictures of his dogs.  Is that supposed to be funny&#63;"
6757,650740,3.0,2.0,"QA professor for block 3 and 4... funny funny guy, really helpful 1 on 1 but unclear in lecture. Theres only so much you can really do with QA though.   *Tini Time* :)"
6758,650740,1.5,1.0,Funny guy.  Horrible teacher.  If you're comfortable with stats he'll be easy.
6759,650740,4.0,2.0,"ONE OF THE COOLEST GUYS EVER... he teaches QA, and its still a great class... if you take anyone other than Baglioni, you are insane."
6760,2477561,4.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed taking this class with Prof. Chatterjee. Yes, the lectures in Physics 2 can be very information heavy but Dr. Chatterjee is very accessible outside of class and is very devoted to making sure his students understand concepts both within and outside of class."
6761,1928702,2.0,5.0,"Worst class I have ever taken. Took it to see if I was interested in business and instead will despise business with a burning passion. The class consists of Kemp just lecturing every single class. You could honestly never go to class and learn the same thing: absolutely nothing. The entire class is based off of 3 exams (33%, 33%, and 34%)DONTTAKE"
6762,1928702,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kemp is honestly one of the nicest people I've ever met. He genuinely cares about the students and wants all of them to pass with a good grade. The tests are very straightforward but contain a lot of content, study and go to class and you'll do great. Mr. Kemp is a really great professor and I certainly want to take another class of his."
6763,1928702,3.0,4.0,"Class is strictly memorization. Don't take it unless you need it for comm school, Kemp is nice and funny but his lectures are random, you'll have to get everything for the tests form the textbook, which he wrote, and it has so many typos."
6764,1928702,2.0,3.0,"Do not take this class unless you intend on being pre-comm. I hated it. Most of what he says in lecture is irrelevant, but he has about 5 minutes of ""takeaways"" each class, and you have to memorize those takeaways for the exams. This class doesn't have much to do with understanding - it's literally all about memorizing his textbook (which he wrote)"
6765,1928702,3.0,2.0,"Easy B+A-.  Tough to get an A. Kemp's lectures are kind of long and boring (and repetitive if you read the chapters).  Many of the terms are weirdly defined, and you have to know his specific definitions for them.  The GAs do most of the grading, so make sure that you contact your GA to ask specifically what heshe is expecting on each assignment."
6766,1928702,5.0,2.0,Bob Kemp's class is always entertaining because he uses lots of interesting personal stories in his lectures. Definitely knows what he's talking about in the business world and gives students current events to connect lectures to the real world. Tests aren't that hard. Lots of study tools and practice quizzes are available. 
6767,1928702,4.5,2.0,Pretty straight forward class. It's kind of tough to get an A because you need a 95%. An A- or B+ are easily achievable if you put some work in.
6768,364045,4.5,5.0,"Great teacher, but extremely intimidating. Best advice is to get to know him one-on-one (after which he tends to go easier on you) and work really hard. His 100 and 300 level classes are difficult, but his dialect class is really laid back, especially for him. Also, take note of his hilarious expressions, idioms, and syntax."
6769,364045,2.0,5.0,"He was by far the worst teacher I had at UVA. I've heard he's great in Arabic 101 but I had him for 301 (I was a transfer) and because of him, I withdrew. He's childishly mean and needs to be reminded that he doesn't rule the world. He's probably a great teacher if he doesn't decide to treat you like scum."
6770,364045,5.0,2.0,best professor
6771,364045,4.0,4.0,Do not take this class if you are not willing to put in the work!
6772,364045,5.0,1.0,Really nice out of the classroom but sort of intimidating in the class. He likes to call on people and put them on the spot - but overall the class is not that difficult and you will learn arabic!
6773,364045,4.5,4.0,"He's a fun teacher, but the class is hard because Arabic is a hard language. Only take it if you plan to truly stay on top of the material. Do all your homework, it really helps your grade and prepare for the tests and quizzes. He likes students who are dedicated and really put in an effort. And he makes the class pretty interesting."
6774,364045,5.0,3.0,"Put the work in. Very harsh to people who aren't on top of the material, but it's usually when we've heard it 5 times already. Difficult to memorize vocab with different characters. COME TO CLASS. He says things in that droning voice so you will repeat them how he's saying it. I'm in 201 now, and Arabic is not for the easily intimidated."
6775,364045,4.5,4.0,"I've taken French and Arabic here and abroad and this is by far the best language teacher I've ever had.  He can be intimidating, especially if you get on his bad side by showing that you don't take the class seriously.  Work really hard in first year Arabic.  It will pay off"
6776,364045,4.5,2.0,"Sawaie is fun and interesting. He can be intimidating, but as long as you don't come to class unprepared, or at least pay attention and don't look like a ****bag he goes pretty easy on you, and he is awesome if he likes you."
6777,364045,2.0,4.0,"Sawaie's a complex guy. Whats bad:He's nuts about public humiliation and is totally intimidating in office hrs.He wrote the only grammar textbook for the class is full of typos(every page conspicuously says &quot;rough draft&quot;)which makes learning one of the hardest languages even harder.Whats good:he's funny as hell,and public humiliation is funto watch"
6778,364045,3.0,3.0,"Get on his good side, he likes people who are enthusiastic.  If you put in the work, you'll get a good grade."
6779,364045,2.5,3.0,"Expect to work very hard and come to lecture prepared. Can be funny and easy going, but most of the time he is intimidating, inacessible, and downright mean. Will rip you to shreds in class if you can't answer when he calls on you. He does make snide cutting remarks. He teaches well, but a lot of people dread his classes."
6780,364045,2.0,4.0,"Get on his good side early. If he likes you and you keep up with the work, you'll have fun. However, if you fumble in class or don't do well, he'll tear you apart in front of the class. Really catty and insulting to students who have trouble with the subject. He can be really impatient and mean but an OK teacher to students he likes."
6781,364045,4.0,3.0,"Totally awesome teacher. Very clear, and easy to understand. He moves a good speed for those who have no experience in Arabic. Hes also really understanding about exam times and will give you a break or reschedule with no questions asked. I definitely recommend Sawaie, as long as you can make yourself come to class every day"
6782,364045,5.0,3.0,Very open to spending one-on-one time to address individual difficulties- his sense of humor will keep you on your toes.
6783,364045,3.0,1.0,"Sawaie is the meanest professor at UVA. Even though I got an A in the class, i couldn't wait for the class to be over. He is not approachable and every time I went to see him in his office, I had to wait in front of the door for like 1 minute bc i was so afraid to go in.Anyhow, be prepared bf going to class bc he will call on everyone."
6784,364045,3.5,4.0,"Arabic 102 is WAY harder than 101, but the class follows the same format and with work decent grades arent impossible to come by. Expect to fail the vocab quizzes...he doesnt tell you whats on them. GO TO CLASS and be prepared- he loves to put you on the spot. Time flies in his class. Recommended."
6785,364045,4.5,4.0,"Sawaie is excellent. He's a native Jordanian, but his accent is very slight and he's easy to understand. He does a good job in breaking down Arabic to its basics. Be prepared to work, this is not a slacker's class. If you do, you'll be well rewarded with a solid base in Arabic grammar."
6786,364045,5.0,3.0,"awesome professor, really clarifies everything he teaches. makes himself accessible to students and is very easy to deal with. but the class itself does get difficult later on."
6787,364045,4.5,4.0,"I love this professor, he knows what he's talking about and cares about all of his students.  He also makes a fairly difficult language easy to understand."
6788,364045,5.0,2.0,No Comments
6789,364045,5.0,3.0,"Sawaie is great, in a class of 80 he cares about each individual's progress"
6790,2346522,4.0,3.0,"Her notes are a bit messy, but she cares about her students a lot. She always makes sure everyone understands the concepts before moving on. If you complete the midterms and study for a bit, you can probably do pretty well on midterms, but the final is a bit challenging. Overall, good experience taking class with her."
6791,2346522,1.0,5.0,"This class is only 3 credits, but professor Li gives us so much homework every week. The way she teaches is so hard to understand, and her notes are not good enough for us to do a lot of the problems on the worksheets. I always to have to learn from outside materials. I really don't recommend people taking Linear Algebra with her."
6792,2346522,2.0,5.0,"Do not take this class. The grading is extremely harsh. She turns simple questions into complex problems that only makes the class more confusing. For reference, I had an A+ in BC and received a 5 on the BC exam. She is also very condescending in her replies to student questions."
6793,2346522,5.0,4.0,"Professor Li is by far my favorite professor that I've ever had. I had her for both APMA 1110 &amp; APMA 2120. The lectures are detailed and full of in-depth practice problems that are mirrored in the worksheets and exams. The exams reflect similar problems to the worksheets, so my best tip is to understand the worksheets to help study for the exams!!"
6794,2346522,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely love professor Li. I've taken multiple APMA courses taught by her and I really appreciate the stye in which she teaches (prints out notes for the class, goes through examples in class) and she really cares that you learn and do well in the class."
6795,2346522,5.0,3.0,"Great professor who actually cares if you learn. Almost daily office hours, always willing to take time to explain. Has a noticeable accent, but still very understandable and will make sure you understand whatever you had a question about before you leave."
6796,2346522,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Li is a amazing professor who really cares about you. Her lectures were well prepared and very clear. APMA 1110 is a tough course, but with Prof. Li as a professor is less stressful."
6797,306716,4.0,3.0,"Had him for Intro Psyc during Covid. Tests were open-note, and multiple choice/fill in the blank. If you paid attention in lecture &amp; took some notes (didn't have to be extensive), you would do well. He recommended the textbook, but his tests were based on lecture. He drops the lowest exam score. Makes lecture not boring. Pretty good experience."
6798,306716,4.0,3.0,I really enjoyed this class w/ Dodson! He made all of the topics very interesting and seems to really care about the material he's teaching and helping students understand it more and develop and passion for it. He was also always open to questions. The only bummer is that the only grades you get are exams but he does drop the lowest.
6799,306716,5.0,3.0,"Chad Dodson is a great professor. Not only does he know his stuff, but he is truly excited about. Every lecture he had such energy and excitement for the material and it even translated over zoom. He is willing to meet outside class and explain things and his office hours are great study tools. The course is based off his lecture though."
6800,306716,5.0,3.0,professor dodson really cares about what he teaches and that inspired me to try hard in the class and major in psychology
6801,306716,5.0,2.0,"Dodson was one of my favorite teacher of all time! His lectures were easy to follow thanks to his powerpoints. He is the reason I am pursuing psychology. Definitely take notes in the class as the tests (all multiple choice) come directly from it. Overall, very funny and passionate guy."
6802,306716,2.0,4.0,"Good luck. Tests are unnecessarily difficult, to even read his questions how he intended to ask them is a chore. Cryptic exams, seems to just be there so he can do his research."
6803,306716,5.0,3.0,"LOVE Chad Dodson! If you are going to take intro to psych definitely take it with Dodson! I found his lectures really interesting, and he uses examples and videos in class that help you remember. There is no outside work except studying for the tests which can have some tricky questions but overall I did well!"
6804,306716,5.0,3.0,"I adore Chad. Attendance in his class is not mandatory, but his lectures are so  interesting that I always wanted to go. He plays videos in class that are not linked to the PowerPoints he puts on collab, and sometimes he put questions from them on the tests. His tests are all multiple choice, but they can be very tricky. Don't buy the textbook."
6805,306716,3.0,4.0,"Class requires attendance and attention. It's important to stay on top of studying for each exam (use notecards). He also mentions that you shouldn't look at the powerpoint before class, but don't listen to this and make your notes prior to class. Be ready to study. The information is EXTREMELY interesting and you'll be amazing by how you apply it."
6806,306716,3.5,5.0,"Hardest intro psych professor at UVA. I went to every class, read the textbook, took notes, studied for days for the exams and still couldn't get above an 82. I know I learned more than friends who had other professors but my grade doesn't show it."
6807,306716,3.0,4.0,"I thought that I was doing everything right for this class. I took notes on the book chapters, went to every lecture and the optional reviews before exams, stayed up late studying, and still did not do well in this class. Not worth taking unless its required for your major. Don't bother going to lectures - he literally just reads off a powerpoint."
6808,306716,3.5,2.0,"Dodson is really enthusiastic about Psychology, and it really shows in his lectures.  The class itself is really easy though and the exams are all based on his powerpoint slides.  Reading the book is not necessary.  Some of his exam questions can be tricky, but most are straight forward as long as you memorize his powerpoint slides."
6809,306716,4.5,3.0,"Material is easy, but you have to be able to applyrecognize concepts in situation-based examples on his exams. Everything is based on his lecture slides, and don't read the book unless you want to be confused.  For the course grade, the lowest of four midterm scores is dropped and averaged with the final exam score. He's a pretty cool guy."
6810,306716,3.5,3.0,Absolutely amazing professor who's really enthusiastic and passionate about what he's talking about. Love how he makes anything interesting and interactive. 
6811,306716,1.0,5.0,you will like this class at first..don't let him fool you.
6812,306716,2.5,5.0,"The tests are extremely difficult. I took AP Psychology in high school and got an A, and now I am getting 65s on every single exam. I study the lectures, make flashcards, read the book..and i still get extremely low grades on his tests. His office hours are not helpful. He is passionate in class, but it's not worth it."
6813,306716,1.0,5.0,"This class and its professor were terrible. Beware! Read the textbook, skip class; he posts lectures on Collab. Exams are multiple choice but difficult! Know everything. Labs are fun! Don't take this class unless you have to."
6814,306716,2.5,5.0,"The tests were extremely unclear and complicated. No matter how much I studied, I would never do well. I did not know a single person that got an A and there was no curve."
6815,306716,4.5,3.0,"It's a relatively easy psych class - Dodson is a great lecturer, though he tends to be a bit redundant. Attendance isn't mandatory, but it's recommended because he goes over most content orally and provides cool videos. Tests a wordy and tricky, but not too awful. I honestly didn't crack open the textbook at all and I managed a B in the class."
6816,306716,4.0,3.0,"Dodson is an interesting lecturer. Attendance isn't mandatory because he posts the slides online. He does show cool videos which are helpful. Tests aren't bad, but lots of the questions are tricky so it's easy to slip up. If you study the slides HARD and read the textbook you should be good. Can be confusing for some people, so put the work in."
6817,306716,3.5,3.0,"This was one of my favorite classes, but ironically, one of my not so hot grades.  Classes were very interesting, and I learned a lot! However, test questions were meant to trip you up-- which is very, very disappointing if you work your butt off, and all he does is throw a curve ball."
6818,306716,5.0,3.0,"Overall, Dodson was extremely clear in all of his lectures. The content was very interesting & he made it less tedious by including videos and exercises (concepts that would be tested on his exams). If you just review the ppts often (instead of all at once by cramming), then you can get at least a B+ ! He's very approachable, too!"
6819,306716,2.5,4.0,"He was entertaining in the class, but you don't actually need to attend. All he did was read the power point to you. The tests are much harder than you think they would be(a lot of it coming from the book). I wouldn't recommend it to someone just trying to fulfill a requirement, try a slightly higher ranked class(they're actually easier)."
6820,306716,3.5,2.0,"Most information can be gotten from his powerpoints, but he does show videos and talk about specifics in class. The chapters also have some of the test information. It's not a hard class, people just expect it to be ridiculously easy since it's 1010."
6821,306716,2.0,5.0,I love AP Psych in high school so this class was a total let down.  He is soooo boring.  The tests have little to do with what you actually learned as you struggled to stay awake.  He's just phoning it in and is there for the check.
6822,306716,5.0,2.0,"Contrary to what the people before me said, Dodson was a great professor. Lectures were interesting, and if you want to do well in class then go and PAY ATTENTION! Slides are most helpful when studying, but the textbook is good too. I agree that it probably isn't necessary. Every exam had a few tricky questions, but I still managed to get A's."
6823,306716,3.0,5.0,"He's a decent enough guy...but I agree with the poster below who I assume is in the class currently w/ me...I study his power points down to the last detail...and still barely manage C's. His tests are just ridiculously hard, I don't know how one could manage an A. He will make questions vague and give answers that are vague. Just be straight forwa"
6824,306716,3.5,4.0,"I don't know if he changed his teaching styles or what this year...but none of that is true! I've poured myself over ppts and still do badly. Plus he told us he DOES NOT curve ever. Over half the class scores below 75 on tests. In my opinion, his lectures are SO boring; everyone is falling asleep."
6825,306716,5.0,2.0,"Don't buy the book and go to class. Study the notes the night before the tests. He curves up a grade (A- to A, B+ to A- etc). This class is TOTALLY worth it, lots of practical info and interesting. Don't take 1010 with anyone else, he's the easiest and best"
6826,306716,4.0,1.0,"i had no interest in psychology before taking the class, but Dodson really made the material interesting. Reading the textbook is not necessary and most test materials come straight from lecture powerpoints. Plus he posts up the powerpoints on collab, which was nice. You do need to study for the tests, but not bad compared to other UVA classes."
6827,306716,5.0,3.0,"Dodson's test come straight from the powerpoints in lectures.  If you memorize them, you will do just fine.  The class isn't hard and Dodson makes the lectures very entertaining and informative. I enjoyed it!"
6828,306716,5.0,3.0,dodson really knows his stuff. his lectures are long but they're definitely interesting especially the videos he shows. attendance isn't necessary since everything he says is in the power points which he puts up on collab. tests ask really specific questions so read your textbook.
6829,306716,5.0,3.0,"Very knowledgeable and works hard to create an intimate setting out of a class of 300+ students. Lecture is key because the notes he posts online make more sense in context. Don't buy the text book, you will never use it. He suggests reading only the parts that overlap with the slides. However, the tests are very challenging."
6830,306716,3.5,3.0,Interesting guy
6831,306716,4.5,3.0,Really interesting class. Straightforward lectures.  Some test questions can be pretty tricky. you really do learn a lot and Dodson's enthusiasm is very helpful.
6832,306716,4.5,1.0,"Dodson is the perfect teacher! Lectures are crystal clear, and he shows great videos every class. Taking notes is unnecessary, as all powerpoints are posted. The book is great, but not crucial for most tests. I don't know why anyone says his tests were hard - they are very straightforward and from the powerpoints . Take 101 with Dodson!"
6833,306716,5.0,4.0,Great guy! Really enjoyable. I would recommend going to class b/c the videos are crucial to the tests. Test are tricky though...
6834,306716,4.5,3.0,tests are tricky but it's not bad.
6835,306716,3.5,5.0,"His class is very science-oriented for a basic Pysch class. One test was entirely questions about the workings of specific parts of the brain, in detail. I have heard upperclass Pysch majors call this class the hardest they have taken for their major. Most people I knew did pretty terribly."
6836,306716,4.0,3.0,"His lectures are really interesting. He reads right off of the slides which is helpful when you study. I did not read out of the book at first, but I find it helpful!"
6837,306716,4.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher that really keeps the class interesting.  The tests are really difficult though, and the grading curve doesn't help any.  Overall a fun teacher to have, but don't expect the class to be easy."
6838,306716,4.5,2.0,Great teacher.  Unfortunately I heard he might be leaving UVA.  I hope not.
6839,306716,4.5,2.0,"Keeps it pretty clear with his slide shows, reading in the book isn't too much.  Only bad thing is the curve is high school style, whoever gets the highest score in the class becomes 100%, and of course there's always someone who gets ~perfect.  Top score in ours was 207/210, so we got  a 3 point curve.  Otherwise, a good class to take for an intro"
6840,306716,4.5,2.0,"There are four 50-question multiple choice tests and a comprehensive final exam (one test gets dropped). The lecture is pretty interesting because he shows cool videos, note taking is not necessary and only read the parts of the book that relate to the power point slides (which he posts on toolkit). Overall, easy class"
6841,306716,3.5,3.0,"I had trouble paying attention in class. His lectures were okay, but he reads straight from the powerpoints and can get boring. The demonstrations and videos were cool though. Some of the questions on his tests weren't in the powerpoint and were picky, so I guess you should skim the book."
6842,306716,4.5,1.0,"Exactly what the person before me said.  Crystal-clear - exams are taken straight from the powerpoints.  I stopped taking notes and just went to class to see the discussion and videos.  Great professor: passionate and organized, every class was on the correct date and all material was covered perfectly.  Very interetesting"
6843,306716,4.5,1.0,I spent about 5 hours per test the night before skimming the book and looking over his lecture slides after not taking notes in class.  Everything he says is very clearcut and well organized.  I thought the material was easy as long as you pay attention in lecture because he goes over all of it.  The best part is dropping 1 of the 4 tests!
6844,306716,4.5,4.0,"Pretty cool and interesting lectures, definitely not boring. Class isn't as easy as most people say, the multiple choice tests are tricky."
6845,306716,3.5,5.0,"Lot harder than I expected.  Tests are quite challenging, not the cream-puff class I expected"
6846,306716,4.0,3.0,I really liked this class. It was interesting and he used many demonstrations that were pretty mind blowing. He's a wonderful guy and the test aren't too bad if you study his lectures and the concepts presented in lecture.
6847,306716,5.0,2.0,"Dodson was awesome. He made class lots of fun and intriguing and used volunteers occasionally to demonstrate ideas. Everything we needed to know was on the powerpoints, but I never skipped a class. Highly recommended."
6848,306716,4.0,3.0,"Professor Dodson is a really interesting teacher.  I really enjoyed lectures and he always made them exciting and hands-on even though it was lecture style.  Reading is probably helpful, but usually everything on the test is covered in lecture.  He puts all the slides on toolkit so you don't have to go to lecture, but lecture isn't boring."
6849,306716,5.0,2.0,"Amazing lecturer.  I really enjoyed his class.  Very helpful during office hours (highly recommend going to them, even just to say hi.)  I found that I had such a difficult time trying to get an A in the class, though.  (4 exams, 1 final)"
6850,306716,5.0,2.0,"DODSON WAS AMAZING! the best UVA professor by far.  He's hillarious, helpful, and always ends classes around 20 minutes early.  Go see him during his office hours, he's always interested in engaging with the students.  Definitely recommend him for Psych 101."
6851,306716,3.5,3.0,"slideshows are on toolkit.  lectures are fun, especially with the videos and sometimes he gets the whole lecture room involved (300+ kids).  CLEARLY knows material.  drops lower test grade.  take this class if you're in psychology in general, if you like a specific thing.. TAKE THAT because there is a LOT of material.  READ TExT!"
6852,306716,4.0,3.0,"It's a lecture class so do the reading!! He let's you drop one test grade of four and the final is worth 25% of the final grade (but it's not optional). He shows great videos, so you should come to class just for them, and the slides are up on toolkit. Some topics are fun, some boring: this is an intro class, what did you expect&#63;"
6853,306716,4.0,2.0,I love Chad. He is the best.
6854,306716,4.5,3.0,"Professor Dodson is great!  His lectures are really interesting, he shows videoclips, and does a lot of interactive experiments/activities.  Definitely take this class with him!"
6855,306716,3.5,2.0,Dodson was funny and seemed like he really enjoyed teaching.  But I found few of his lectures to be that interesting--that might just be me.  I recommend taking a psyc class that is based on specific subject matter (rather than intro).
6856,306716,4.5,2.0,just read the book and u do fine in this class. by the end of the semester i didnt need to go to lecrure anymore cuz all the info is in the book.
6857,306716,4.0,2.0,Class was pretty easy if you read his slides with the book.  It was good for a large lecture class.
6858,306716,4.0,2.0,"So much fun! Video at every lecture. let out 15 min early, tests kind of hard because you have to analyze situations, but if you study you're ok. learn a lot about a variety of psych's, so if you want to learn a specific psychology this isn't for you. it gives a taste of all teh psychology classes."
6859,306716,4.5,3.0,"He's funny and the lectures are very interesting. The tests are KINDA hard but if you study your fine. The questions are very methaphorical, you have to be able to apply the knowledge, not just memorize definitions. But i recommend the class."
6860,306716,4.5,1.0,"easy class. funny guy, interesting lectures. dont waste money on the book.everythini s on the slides online."
6861,306716,4.5,1.0,"good class for eschool, interesting lectures. i didnt even bother buying a book because his slides alone got me through the tests. he's a really nice guy and if you get a chance to take his psyc101 with him, do it."
6862,306716,4.5,2.0,He makes lectures fun with tons of videos and you always get out of class early.  He goes through his power points very quickly but he posts them so its ok.  Tests are king of diffucult with tiny details - he does bases information that corelates in the book and class - so need to read and know what is gone over in class and is in the book.
6863,306716,5.0,1.0,"Super easy. Never went to class(over slept),never did reading (laziness). His slides alone saved me.He is a really soft spoken professor-kind of a push over actually.For the few lectures I went to he is very nice. btw,his daughter is the smartest kid I never know-psych professors sure know how to educate their kid. I'll try tomarry a psych major."
6864,306716,1.0,5.0,"WTF&#63;!  This guy was horrible.  You don't learn anything in class b/c he just rapidly reads off about 50-60 slides for that day, and his tests contain questions about minute details from the reading.  One of the worst classes I've taken here."
6865,306716,4.5,2.0,"cool guy, interesting classes...the videos are fun.  Tests were harder than I expected, but the averages were never very high.  Worth taking, especially for e-schoolers who need a BS class"
6866,306716,4.5,1.0,"He is genuinely interested in making lectures interested and clear so that you will do well on the tests.  If you want to skip class though, the tests are right out of the book and its still easy to do well if you do the reading.  I love the videos he shows in class, and you'll always get out early."

6868,306716,5.0,1.0,"Great class! Crystal clear lectures, interesting powerpoint presentations, grasping media sources and a nice, kind, amazing professor. If you are a Wahoo, this is a must to take! Absolutely fabulous!"
6869,306716,3.0,3.0,"soooooo boring, I could hardly keep my eyes open.  he takes too much time on, granted, fun multimedia presentations but it really detracts from learning the stuff to be tested on."
6870,306716,5.0,2.0,"Really clear, funny lectures, and is definitely aware that his class isn't the ONLY course his students are taking."
6871,306716,5.0,1.0,"i only went to his class to see his video clips, they were great. And he is amusing to watch, like a cute little kid, when he lectures. And I did skip alot, but it was ok... i still understood everything cuz his slides were pretty clear."
6872,306716,5.0,1.0,"Great, interesting class.  Great lectures- they are all powerpoint presentations with frequent video clips.  He even puts the powerpoint slides on toolkit so you don't have to take notes in class."
6873,306716,5.0,2.0,"his class is really fun, he shows a lot of interesting film clips, and his slides for powerpoint are on toolkit. good class"

6876,863776,4.5,4.0,prof dennis is one of the best professors at uva..really cares about his students and does a great job teaching difficult concepts...accessible outside of the classroom...loves to make tests tricky though but is fair with curving grades..highly recommended!!
6877,1830432,3.5,3.0,"Teaching English in Secondary Schools: We covered a lot of material in just one semester. She uses a variety of instructional methods: whole-group discussion, small group work, lecture, video, literature circles, and other engaging activities that teachers would use in the classroom. She is open to feedback and wants her students to learn."
6878,1068592,4.5,3.0,Clearly defined expectations for Proseminar. Pay attention to the instructions and you will be fine.  There is a lot of material  to cover so pace yourself so you dont get behind.  Very helpful feedback throughout course.
6879,1068592,5.0,1.0,"Great Prof! One of the best UVA has to offer. Stop reading this and enroll in his class. Trust me, its well worth it."
6880,1068592,5.0,3.0,Great Professor! Very fair and have much respect for.
6881,1068592,4.5,3.0,A fun and involving way to look at organizational behavior.  He returns assignments quickly and is very down to earth.  An helpful and approachable professor.
6882,790071,1.0,3.0,Did not prepare for lectures and homework solutions were a joke. Didn't seem to take students seriously.
6883,790071,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor ever! He is arrogant, mean-spirited, and unreasonable. Worked the class to death in homework with unreasonable timetables. Made the subject matter more difficult than needed. Stay away from his classes, esp. if you are a working professional going to school part time. Normally A+ students barely passed this class!! Worthless!!!!!"
6884,790071,5.0,4.0,"Very engaging and very smart guy. One of the best profs I had at UVA. He may intimidate or seem unapproachable to some point because he cuts to the chase and is blunt, but once you accept that he is very easy to talk to in and out of class and very helpful. Class was challenging in a good way. Different teaching style from most."
6885,790071,3.5,3.0,"Very knowledgeable about subject matter. Lectures are fairly engaging, and quizzes are very reasonable. Don't expect to get any assignments back. Not very approachable, but once you go to his office, very helpful. Overall interesting class and not as hard as others."
6886,740919,2.0,2.0,"He's a very nice person, but his lectures are long-winded and confusing, and his class is not very well organized. He does not stick to the syllabus and often gives assignments orally without any written follow-up, so the grading criteria are very unclear. If you take intro to poetry, DON'T buy the textbooks. I didn't gain much from the class."
6887,740919,3.0,4.0,"Jost is a very tough cookies. He makes you work for your grades. His lectures are very boring and sometimes unclear. participating in class is huge; for it causes him to favor you at times. He is a cool guy, but can be very arrogant and stubborn at times."
6888,740919,2.0,3.0,"I thought Jost was a good choice at first. He seemed interested in me and helping me to excel in the class. After a while I realized he just loves to hear himself talk. He tends to reject any ideas that students may have unless they are very similar to his. Nice guy, but mediocre lecturer. If you write well, you'll be ok."
6889,740919,1.0,4.0,"I have no problem with teachers who make you argue your point if it goes against their own. However, he just flat out rejects any ideas that do not go along with his own without even allowing you to explain it. Normally, I enjoy discussion style classes and contributing to them but I think I will keep my mouth shut from now on."
6890,740919,1.5,5.0,"His lectures tend to drone on and on. If you're an English major, he'll be easier for you. If you have no clue what you're doing, take another professor."
6891,740919,2.0,4.0,"Lectures are confusing, discussion saves your grade. "
6892,740919,2.5,3.0,"Assigns a ton of reading. His lectures are abstract and often not connected to the papers he assigns. He made some interesting points, but he also goes on long-winded tangents of philosophicalanalytical musings. Not a great lecturer, but a very nicegenial man in person; he loves it when students come to office hours. A good TA helps a lot."
6893,740919,2.0,2.0,"Jost is a really nice guy, but he has no idea how to give a lecture. He rambled for an hour and a half about nothing remotely important. Attendance is not needed whatsoever, just figure out when the papers are due and show up to turn them in. An easy class if you are a good writer."
6894,740919,5.0,3.0,Without a doubt one of the best professors I've had at this school. Genuinely cares for his students. Actively tries to encourage them thinking in new perspectives. Uses lots of humor and everyday events to get his greater philosophical points across. The best.
6895,740919,1.5,4.0,"Worst professor I've ever had, and I'm not exaggerating.  He speaks just to hear his own voice, has no idea what the word compassion means, and is ultimately not as smart as he thinks he is.  DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM."
6896,740919,3.0,4.0,He thinks Frost is a god and will do anything just to sit in class and hear himself talk.
6897,740919,2.0,3.0,"This man is absolutely ridiculous.  NEVER EVER EVER take a class with him.  He is a longwinded speaker and thinks the students are all idiots and seriously called himself &quot;a genius.&quot;  He is very self-absorbed and he doesn't give helpful criticism on your papers at all.  If you're looking for a good, fun class, this is definitely not for you."
6898,740919,3.0,3.0,He is too intelligent for the good of the students
6899,740919,2.0,2.0,"Jost is a longwinded speaker who turns discussions into lecures. If you're seeking an interactive seminar where you can share your ideas freely, I'd advise taking something else. On the other hand, despite his self-absorbtion, he occasionally provides very insightful commentary, you just have to suffer through a couple of hours."
6900,740919,3.0,3.0,"Jost teaches you a lot and he brings in good guest speakers, but it's more work than the avg USEM and discussions can seem like they last forever. If you're looking for an easy 2 credits, I would suggest a lighter USem."
6901,740919,3.0,3.0,I took the first year seminar &quot;Reading Robert Frost Anew&quot; with him. I definitely learned a lot of things about Frost and it was enjoyable to read his poetry but I wouldn't recommend the seminar b/c Professor Jost likes to hear himself talk way too much! He also made us write too many essays for a seminar and our class discussions weren't very good.
6902,2395712,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Mazurek was great, although I struggled because the class was test heavy and I don't excel at tests. He's been teaching for a long time, so he isn't so suceptible to feedback, but his experience means his lectures are refined and he knows how to connect. He made me feel important in a room of 300, so I would definitely take again."
6903,2395712,4.0,4.0,very nice person to talk to - downside is that the textbook is extremely long and he expects you to remember every little detail from both the lecture and book; honestly seems like he picks questions he knows we'll have a hard time with/didn't write down. an excessive amount of material for an intro class &amp; lecture materials not accessible.
6904,2395712,4.0,4.0,"A lot of reviews are outdated. His tests are no longer open note. Even if you do the readings and pay attention in lecture, the tests can be a little difficult. There is no extra cushioning to your grade -- it is based on four tests. The lowest test is dropped though. Quizlet is your bff. Lots of testing on subjects not covered in class."
6905,2395712,2.0,3.0,"He focuses on a few things in lectures he will expect you to know on exams, but he tests you on things on the book he doesn't cover in class."
6906,2395712,5.0,3.0,"Prof Mazurek has sincerely been my favorite professor at UVA so far. His lectures are so interesting, and any questions asked during are met with well thought out, fascinating answers. He's also hilarious without making cheesy jokes that some professors try to use. The tests are sort of hard, but a few days of studying can keep you in a good spot."
6907,2395712,5.0,3.0,"I've never loved a professor like I love Christopher Mazurek. Not only is he an amazing lecturer, but his blue eyes are genuinely my favorite thing to look at. I. would take any class with this man. 10/10 would recommend."
6908,2395712,5.0,3.0,"Who doesn't love Mazurek? Class was asynchronous and a wonderful introduction into Psych research. Chris is a great lecturer and makes the curriculum fun. This course and PSYC2410 are mutually exclusive requirements for a Psych major, but I took them both, and I recommend others do too."
6909,2395712,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Mazurek was SO funny during his lectures. You mostly teach yourself from the textbook, but exams were open note. He seems very nice, and I would 100% recommend taking this class with him."
6910,2395712,4.0,3.0,"Even though it was online, he made mini-lectures that were super entertaining. I loved the course honestly. There is a lot of reading and understanding on our own, especially since it is online, but it was pretty easy. He was super caring and entertaining in the lectures. Tests were open notes. You should def take it."
6911,2395712,5.0,3.0,"Mazurek is one of my favorite professors at UVA. You can tell he really cares about what he's teaching and he's always willing to help. You can tell that he truly cares and wants you to succeed. As long as you do the readings and attend his lectures, the exams are easy. I definitely recommend taking a class with him!"
6912,2395712,4.0,3.0,"Great lectures and easy readings, but I thought that the tests were not as straightforward as the class material. Tests were not always the easiest, but there are enough of them to give you a chance to redeem yourself and fix your grade. Such a cool person and gives fun lectures, I was never bored watching his lectures."
6913,2395712,5.0,3.0,"I love the energy he brought to lectures. If you pay attention to everything and DO THE READING, you will succeed."
6914,2395712,2.0,5.0,"Grading system was too harsh for the pandemic. Not enough support given for passing the course, if having trouble with focusing/other problems. Failing one test guaranteed the failure of the course. No lecture videos, not enough information given about chapters."
6915,2395712,4.0,2.0,Some of the material can be pretty boring but Mazurek tries his best to make it interesting. Biggest piece of advice for this class is to do the (pretty easy) readings. His tests covered material that he didn't present on and was briefly mentioned in the textbook. He'll also include things that were lecture exclusive so check his powerpoints.
6916,2395712,4.0,3.0,"Attendance is &quot;optional&quot; but most of the test has questions that are specific to what he says in class. He brings a lot of energy, so the class is never boring. I took him twice because I liked his energy so much and from the 1st semester to the 2nd I went from a B to a B+. The textbook is not optional - it is needed for the class."
6917,2395712,5.0,2.0,"He's new to UVA and I loved his classes. Although some topics were quite boring, he managed to make them approachable and even funny! The exams are not difficult if you have read the readings AND been in class. Overall, I would totally recommend his classes!"
6918,2395712,5.0,3.0,The most work you have to do is reading the textbook but its only about 20 pages of easy reading.
6919,2395712,5.0,1.0,He's new to UVA and I really appreciated being able to take Intro Psych with Mazurek. He's really caring and is always super ready to discuss any of the topics. He'll happily give you in depth answers to help you better understand if you're ever confused. I'm purposefully taking a second class with him!
6920,1273442,4.5,1.0,He is nice and beautiful artist hmself
6921,1273442,5.0,1.0,Great class
6922,1273442,5.0,1.0,Good
6923,126565,4.5,5.0,"Be prepared to devote A LOT of time and work to this class. Instead of learning in a traditional classroom setting, you will actually design and build a functional prototype. Make sure to participate as often as possible for the few times you are in class. There WILL be times when you will want to give up, but overall, this class will be worth it."
6924,126565,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Guilford is a mixed bag. He is organized in lectures and does well to make material interesting, but is completely unapproachable out of class. Meeting with him to discuss grades is worthless, even if he is at fault. He left our modules &quot;up to us&quot; to complete but then took massive amounts of points off if done in a correct but different manner."
6925,126565,5.0,3.0,"He is def. one of the best professors at UVa. He puts all his slides as well as lecture recordings online. Still, many people go to class b.c he makes the topic very interesting. He cares alot about his students. I highly recommend this course!"
6926,126565,5.0,3.0,awesome guy. his tests are a little hard and specific but he does everything in his power to help. he puts everything online and even tape records his lectures. definitely take him. i love dr. bill!
6927,126565,5.0,3.0,"I can sum him up in 3 words: clear, concise and curious. Good relationships with students and has a brilliant mind.  Gorgeous too, in fact."
6928,126565,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Bill rocks.  He's super organized, funny, and generally a cool guy.  He cares about what he teaches, but he doesn't baby his students.  Chances are you'll like the class"
6929,126565,4.5,3.0,"I love his baby blue eyes!  I think I drooled over him every class!  But an awesome professor, wish I could have him again!"
6930,126565,5.0,3.0,No Comments
6931,126565,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bill is the best!  Even if you are new to biology, the thorough, clear lectures will teach you everything.  He even records the lectures and posts them online for later review."
6932,126565,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professor in UVa.  Actually, he won best teaching award, too.  His tests are a bit hard, but he cares about his students and is willing to help out if any of his students is not doing well. He understands what students thnik and feel."
6933,962157,1.0,4.0,What made me uncomfortable was that he taught nothing at class. All the material we need to use was already posted on moodle and all he did was repeat it.
6934,962157,2.0,3.0,"He's a nice guy. You have to go to class because he takes attendance (5%) and there are frequent iClicker quizzes (15%), but all of class is just him telling you how to do stuff in Excel. The lectures are online, so you can watch them whenever you want. There is a lot of homework, but most of the grade is a group project which is pretty difficult."
6935,962157,1.0,4.0,You will get as much knowledge in 3 minutes of Christopher Otrok's class as you will in two complete lectures from Wayne-Roy Gayle. It is possible that the lack of quality in Wayne-Roy Gayle's lectures could make the Honorable Colin Powell embarrassed to be Jamaican.
6936,962157,1.5,5.0,"Wayne is never clear in his lectures, he gives pop-quizes using IClickers most classes based on a 60-90 minute online lecture and 30+ pages of the textbook where each question is worth 0.55% of your final grade & the group project is so vague you could find out with one week left you have to redo half the assignment. Avoid this class at all costs."
6937,962157,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely the WORST professor at UMass and this is not an exaggeration. He doesn't teach anything in class, the online lecture are ridiculously confusing, there's ""IRAT"" at the beginning of every class (doesn't matter to him if you understand the topic or not). If it is at all possible to take some other course instead of this one, do that!"
6938,962157,1.0,5.0,"Hated every second of this miserable experience, avoid at all costs."
6939,962157,3.0,2.0,funniest professor ive ever had 
6940,962157,1.0,3.0,Wayne was one of the worst professors I have ever had.  He fails to help you when you need to schedule something with him.  He does not teach anything in class and the group project was a bunch of BS where he barely made a guideline for you and no grading criteria.  
6941,962157,2.0,4.0,If you don't like group assignments- DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. 40% of your grade is based on it. 20% is based on online homework. 20% on tests.... the rest is split up between participation and quizzes (that you take at the beginning of EVERY class) He doesn't teach in class- all online lectures. He's funny- but class kinda sucks. 
6942,962157,3.0,3.0,Wayne is a good guy. Funny and relaxed. The TAs are your best friends in this class. Everybody fails the final (only 15%) and the group project is where it really counts (30%). If you go to the TA help hours in the library this will make or break you on the online course load- or just ask somebody ;)
6943,962157,1.0,5.0,"The most unprofessional, incompetent professor I have ever had. There is a major group project worth about a third of the grade and there are no directions given. The professor has no idea what the group project is. The online lectures are poor, disorganized, and difficult to understand. The problems were so hard that the TAs often couldn't do them"
6944,962157,1.0,5.0,Even the TAs struggled with many of the problems. Wayne told a student that this was the worst batch of students that he's ever had- Most students are eager to learn and are paying for it. If we are all frustrated and doing poorly then as a statistics professor he should have recognized that there is something wrong with his teaching style. 
6945,962157,1.0,5.0,He is the worst professor I ever met in UMASS. He taught nothing in class .
6946,962157,1.0,5.0,The absolute worst class I've ever taken. It meets once a week for unhelpful group work and the rest is online lectures that are extremely unorganized and useless. I've taken classes with an online lecture component before but this class was beyond awful.
6947,962157,1.0,5.0,"Worst class i have ever taken. Class was disorganized, confusing and a complete waste of my time. Instead of helping when you didnt understand something, Wayne would get mad at the class. I am a senior at UMass Amherst and this is the worst class I have taken in my entire college career. UMass should be ashamed they are letting this guy teach. "
6948,962157,1.5,5.0,so much work and learned absolutely nothing. worst math class i have ever taken
6949,962157,1.0,5.0,"Does not teach anything. This is a ""TBL"" or team-based learning class that only meets once a week. All other work and learning is expected to do at home from the bookslides, or meeting up with your team members. I would not take this class again."
6950,962157,2.0,4.0,"Nice, funny, and soft-spoken. But he does not help you learn and his instruction are obscure. Do not take this class unless you like group projects!"
6951,962157,2.0,3.0,Do not take this class. Although there are no tests it is all group work and you don't learn anything. Wayne is funny but doesn't teach anything. Biggest waste of a class ever. 
6952,962157,4.5,5.0,"Fantastic professor. Very funny despite the difficult and technical nature of the material. Always able to explain everything very clearly and will explain it over and over until everyone understands it. Midterm was difficult, final much easier. Curve was extremely generous."
6953,962157,4.5,5.0,"Great teacher, hard class."
6954,962157,4.5,5.0,"Lectures are always funny even with very tedious/technical material.  Office hours are incredibly helpful.  Best ECON professor I have had so far, but be prepared to work hard."
6955,962157,4.5,3.0,"This teacher was awesome and funny! He is really hard but as long as you study you will be fine. Don't be discouraged by the first test, it is the hardest one. DO the practice tests because his tests are just a twist of the practice. ones. He curves very well."
6956,962157,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher, very enjoyable class. Difficult class; but if you come to class and do the homework the midterms are not too bad. Gayle is hilarious and has the ability to keep students interested in material being presented. Strongly recommend taking this class with this prof."
6957,962157,3.0,1.0,"This class was super easy. Lecture material was boring but he was hillarious. Tests were the spitting image of the practice midterms. I don't know what everyone else is talking about, maybe he changed his ways&#63;"
6958,962157,1.0,5.0,"extremely hard to do well in this class.  seems as if he makes it impossible on purpose, condescending to students."
6959,962157,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I've had at the University. Spends countless time deriving complex equations that there are no need for. Varian textbook is abstract and unhelpful. Don't even bother going to office hours. TAs were astonished by his difficulty. TA Nate Hoover saved us from this class.
6960,962157,2.0,5.0,This class is VERY HARD.  His presentations are very hard to read and understand.  His test are based off the homework yet are HARD.  I strongly suggest finding a different teacher for this class.
6961,659055,5.0,3.0,"Amazing prof. He's hilarious, an institution on Lorca, unparalleled in his field, &has a wicked sense of humour. If you are not willing to do the work, or if you enjoy the kind of prof that will let you keep talking when you clearly have nothing to say/don't know what you're on about - Andy's not for you. Otherwise, you will learn a lot &enjoy it."
6962,659055,4.0,4.0,"Anderson has high expectations - got his BA, MA, and PhD from Oxford, and assumes you've thoroughly investigated difficult vocab, etymologies, historical events that come up in readings. That being said, he's incredibly knowledgable - his expertise on Lorca is unparalleled. Be ready to actually work at home with the texts, and on the papers."
6963,659055,1.5,5.0,hands down WORST prof/class ive taken. will laugh in ur face. impossible grader. chastises students & shoots down every idea/thought they have. makes u feel stupid/inadequate. UNCLEAR a/b his expectations but gives u bad grades no matter what. lectures will put u to sleep (but hell get in ur face & yell so dont fall asleep). should be fired asap!!
6964,659055,5.0,5.0,"He has a well organized and knowledgable approach that places much of the job of  learning where it belongs, on the studnets. He is a master of his material and you can learn a ton from him IF you are willing to work. Fair grader too."
6965,659055,4.0,4.0,"Andy A is too intelligent for his students well-being, but he does break down novels like its his job. i actually enjoy his class.  it takes a minute to get used to, but well worth it."
6966,659055,2.0,3.0,It was like riding a merry-go-round with the horse detached.
6967,659055,2.5,3.0,"This guy had a chance to design and teach a class in his specialty- modern poetry- and he totally blew it. Most funerals are more fun than Spanish 715... Andy A. is boring and tired, tired and boring, and then he somehow still manages to run out of steam. Stoicism and tedium are for the courtroom, not for poetry."
6968,659055,4.0,2.0,"Great &quot;feel good&quot; class. Nice guy, very helpful and willing to work with students outside of class. Really enjoy his lectures."
6969,1093238,4.5,4.0,"Dr Marotta is one of my all-time favorite teachers. He demands a great deal from his students, but absolutely gives back more than he demands. He is one of five teachers I would take ANY course they offered. Do yourself a favor, take the challenge, you will be glad you did."
6970,1093238,5.0,4.0,"The most transformational professor I have had the pleasure of encountering. Kenny is not only a gifted writer in his own right, but a supremely sensitive critic. His dedication  to his students is obvious from the enormous amount of time and thought he gives to every class, every piece of feedback and every interaction with a student. A god!"
6971,1093238,3.5,2.0,"Very helpful if you want to become a better writer, not always sure what he is asking for in assignment when it is first given to the class, but he will help on a one to one basis, very willing to spend time to help"
6972,585341,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Miller's Tibetan is amazing, and her instruction very clear.  She is so careful you can't possibly fall through the cracks.  The amount of time she spent on grading translations and providing constructive advise boggles the mind.  Her first-hand knowledge of Tibetan language and religion is vast, and she is dedicated to her subject."
6973,585341,2.0,3.0,"lectured straight from the power points, no deviance at all...not a great class, whole grade is based on multiple choice though you do get to drop one test. this is for prof. miller the psyc. teacher, though, it may not be the same one."
6974,585341,1.0,2.0,very boring course! she reads directly from the notes and sometimes she used to read things that I had no idea what she was even talking about. not very approachable either..but if you go to lecture and do the assigned readings and attend discussion you will be fine. just dont forget to bring a pillow to lecture.
6975,585341,2.0,2.0,"The professor was probably the worst professor I've ever had. I was genuinely interested in the class before taking it, and now, I'm not.  Her voice is very monotonous and she reads directly from her notes. Not fun at all.  I would not recommend this professor."
6976,585341,3.0,2.0,"Ehhhh... she's Ok.  She is getting better, though I think there are a lot of interestnig things to cover in these religions that she doesn't even touch on.  Pretty easy though if you either read or go to lecture, and discussion, while mandatory, is a joke.  Overall average."
6977,585341,3.0,3.0,oh my gosh- mere words cannot do justice to the hell on earth that is this class. the woman will not stray from her script- even her jokes are scripted! she lectures in the most monotone voice i've ever experienced and her lectures make an interesting subject boring. i hope she improves.
6978,585341,1.0,2.0,"she'd new so might get better, but is by far the worst teacher I've had at UVA. Unbelievably boring in lecture, doesn't cover much materials and reads straight from her notes while showing lost of movies because she runs out of stuff to talk about. She tries to put too much on the tests fo 50 min."
6979,585341,3.0,2.0,"She's new.  Was horrible at the beginning, but has improved at least 10 times since then."
6980,585344,1.0,5.0,"Incredibly disorganized, inconsistent, and stubborn."
6981,585344,2.0,3.0,"Lectures with recycled slides from over a decade ago. Not always updated for the material being discussed, he will read straight from the slide until he remembers the point he was tying to make. Constantly repeats himself to make a simple point. Assigns papers with conflicting guidance (verbal advice vs. the prompt). Huge pushover for undergrads."
6982,585344,2.0,4.0,"He is a nice guy, but his lectures are completely disorganized and didn't contribute much to the class. His PowerPoints were often outdated and had irrelevant information. His grading was relatively harsh, without good feedback, and he did not adhere well to the course schedule. I found most of the readings interesting, but would not take it again."
6983,585344,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Lefkowitz is an overall okay professor, but his lectures seem to drag on during the entire class, sometimes into the next class if he gets sidetracked, which isn't too hard. Pretty harsh with the first few papers, since he doesn't always specify what he wants you to write about, but he falls behind after the third or fourth week."
6984,585344,2.0,4.0,"One pager due every Friday. The prompt can be given as late as Wednesday, and for the essay, you must watch a full-length movie (sometimes a movie + show). The first essays are graded harshly, and then he quickly gets behind on grading (even with the TA's help). By the end of the semester, he was four weeks behind. Problematic since essays  50%"
6985,585344,1.5,3.0,Prof. Lefkowitz seems like a nice guy but his lectures are so disorganized and hard to follow. He uses the same powerpoints from year to year and sometimes doesn't even know what his own slides mean. I didn't like any of the readings and didn't gain any insight from taking this class.
6986,585344,2.5,3.0,"I enjoyed the class, but it wasn't easy. Many of the concepts were over my head and sometimes Lefkowitz couldn't explain them very well. I did enjoy the material. The extra movie screening every week was pretty annoying though. Didn't expect that, but overall, learned a lot, but you have to do a lot of work."
6987,585344,1.5,4.0,"Although the material is pretty interesting, Lefkowitz will ruin this course for you. He is unorganized, hard to listen to, and impossible to follow. Gives attendance quizzes and there's a film every week. Don't include your own opinions in papers unless you want an extremely bad grade. Although I like anthropology, I don't recommend this class."
6988,585344,4.5,3.0,"The class is interesting, although Lefkowitz is probably a bit too fuzzy on the film studies end of things to really be teaching so much of it, but when he gets into linguistics it's a really good, thought-provoking class.  Some of the readings are dense, but the papers aren't very hard."
6989,585344,2.5,3.0,for teaching a film and language course he sure doesn't know much about film or language.  on the plus side he admits to this fact often.  strange.
6990,585344,2.0,3.0,"He's generally interesting and I like the topics but he's disorganized and generally only has his opinion or no opinion. I wouldn't recommend his classes. He's really bad about getting papers back and although helpful in office hours, it's only assuming he's there and it doesn't make up for the class."
6991,585344,1.0,3.0,"at start of the sem I really like this class but it went downhill fast. Prof unorganized, late and pushed all our due dates back until the end of the sem.The last 2 weeks of school we submitted about %60 of our grade, also has prob w/ grading papers.  One page &quot;easy&quot; papers not always so amazing what he would call &quot;not a summary&quot;, terrible readings"
6992,585344,1.5,5.0,"He's interesting in lectures, but quite possibly the least understanding professor I have ever had. We came to him with concerns over an unclear project and he all but shot us down and told us to deal withit ourselves. He structures his classes and assignments poorly and then punishes the students for being confused. Not a good experience."
6993,585344,1.0,4.0,"Without question, this is the worst class I have taken in my entire academic career. I owe much of that label to the absolutely awful performance by Lefkowitz and his co-teacher. Lectures were disorganized, to put it mildly, and wandered mostly in the realm of esoteric linguistics. Put simply, this is an awful class."
6994,585344,1.0,4.0,"Disorganization at its height! Slow to return any work turned in, most of our grade came from papers and exams turned in during the last 2 weeks of class, and his lectures become disjointed throughout the semester.  The class had potential but fell apart.   Definitely wouldn't recommend."
6995,585344,1.0,3.0,"More a conspiracy theorist than a professor.  He has a personal agenda that he wants to preach, so he warps the facts and ignores the truth to get it across.  As long as you write in agreement with him, the class is easy, but if you want an interesting class I would avoid him.  He's very disrespectful and patronizing in office hours as well."
6996,585344,1.0,4.0,"Late to class, and always disorganized! It was VERY frustrating to have him as a professor.  We didn't get the study guide for our Tuesday exam until Sunday at 11pm!  The lectures and the topics have little connection.  Avoid."
6997,585344,2.0,2.0,"He is ridiculously disorganized and is a really slow grader.  Most of his lectures are just ridiculous, and he makes random connections that don't make any sense.  Some of the movies you watch are pretty good, and the Repsonse Papers are really easy.  Not a hard class, but not as interesting as the name makes it seem."
6998,585344,4.0,2.0,"some of the readings are really dense, and lecture doesn't clear it up too well.. but none of the assignments/tests are extremely challenging, if you've taken a linguistics class already, it'll be a piece of cake"
6999,585344,4.0,2.0,No Comments
7000,585344,4.0,2.0,"He's very disorganized; deadlines tend to be malleable and sometimes aren't given at all, reading sometimes come late in the semester. Nonetheless, he knows what he's doing and is very nice. Assigns mostly long-ish papers and daily responses to the reading."
7001,585344,5.0,1.0,"I liked him a lot.  I would recomend this class.The readings are a bit dry,but he livens class up with entertaining discussions.Worst part about the class is some of analysis of the readings he makes seems to be out a little out of left field and therefore hard to understand, but not impossible."
7002,585344,4.5,3.0,"Makes everyone in his class want to be a Middle Eastern Studies major.Scholar, amazing linguist, witty and engaging.You HAVE to go to class to get the material but will want to anyway.If you read/pay attention/understand tests are not bad (mostly takehome)."
7003,585344,4.5,2.0,He is a great professor who know a alot about what he is teaching.  He's a good teacher and I would take any class that he is offering
7004,585344,4.5,2.0,one of best teachers at uva...a real scholar...easy tests that are mostly take home
7005,1617540,1.0,1.0,"This professor is too politically correct. Reading powerpoint all the time, with so many discussions posts and 40 times 120 words ins account big project at the end of the term. TOO MUCH WORK to do. Run, if you really want to learn anything."
7006,1617540,3.0,2.0,"TOO. MUCH. BUSY WORK. Julide is constantly giving students movies to watch and pointless articles to read, and they don't contribute anything to the class or the lectures. The class is very easy and it would be hard to fail, but I feel like she gives the busy work to make up for her lack of skill."
7007,1617540,5.0,4.0,"Jülide is a phenomenal Italian teacher. When I'm early for class and overhear the stuff another class is doing, I feel so privileged to not have any other teacher. Jülide only speaks in Italian, which makes it difficult sometimes. But she prepares you more than you could even imagine. I'd take this class ten times over!"
7008,1191559,5.0,4.0,"Propp was an amazing sign language professor who was very patient and understanding; however, he was very strict when grading (but gave a lot of feedback). The test were usually pretty tough and weighed a lot on your grade. Overall, he was a great professor and was helpful during the Covid times."
7009,1191559,4.0,4.0,"Propp is a good professor but he is a very tough grader and gives some feedback. During the Covid era he has been easy to work with but it is a lot of work outside of class. He signed a little fast when we first started, which was a little difficult to follow."
7010,1191559,5.0,4.0,"Greg has been so fun! So nice, clear about what he expects, and assignments are interesting but definitely challenging. Fast paced class, quizzes somewhat often, lots of info. Really encouraging, fun activities, helps you absorb the language simply. Online but made it work so well! SAVs and LL's are frequent but simple if you study and watch videos"
7011,1191559,5.0,3.0,"Greg is an awesome professor. All of the comments say that he signs too fast, I thought it was manageable. The voice-off policy starts to feel natural after a while. You don't just learn about the language; you also learn about Deaf culture, which is very interesting. I highly recommend this class, but I also recommend the ASL Program in general."
7012,1191559,4.0,3.0,"I took ASL in high school, but didn't test out, so the class is pretty easy for me.  But beware, the tests are hard even for experienced signers.  He signs really fast and doesn't repeat.  Not too much homework.  Don't be intimidated by the voice off thing, he's really good at explaining things.  Go to some of the Deaf events, he'll like you more."
7013,1191559,4.5,3.0,"Greg is an absolutely AWESOME professor..one of the best I've ever had. He has a great sense of humor, which makes class fun. There is a ""voice off"" policy..but don't let it scare you. He explains everything as long as you raise your hand. Tests can be tricky, but they aren't bad if you prepare! I highly recommend Greg and this class!"
7014,1191559,3.0,4.0,He is a hard professor to work with especially with the finger spelling and the quizzes. I strongly suggest looking for someone else.
7015,1191559,3.5,3.0,"He's a good teacher. Class time is cool,it's about the same for all ASL teachers. The biggest difference: TESTS. His are too fast and he makes it HARD to get an A on a test. If you aren't good at ASL,it's harder."
7016,1191559,5.0,3.0,"Great professor! The class is hard, but he is willing to help you as much as he can. You will have plenty of homework though he doesn't check it. I would recommend him over the others, his finger-spelling may be quicker than Roco's but the fact that he can talk to you after class makes up for it."
7017,1191559,4.0,2.0,"I had Greg for 101 and 102 and I think he's a great teacher. I've heard he's better than Rocco, but not as good at CK. I would take him again though because I thought he graded fairly and he was willing to help all of his students"
7018,2567823,5.0,4.0,Dr. Ozment was a bright spot during these tough times with Covid. Her J-term class was super interesting and enjoyable. She gave amazing lectures and the class was great.
7019,2567823,5.0,2.0,"She put on a great advising course! During COVID, I appreciated her efforts to have us conduct a hybrid learning structure, since it was my only in-person class. She makes the topic very interesting and you definitely learn a lot about music videos!"
7020,2567823,5.0,2.0,This was the most fun class I have taken at UVA so far. Dean Ozment is so nice and approachable and you can talk to her about anything. There were quite a few group projects but they were all fun things like making an informercial. We did a lot of field trips and hands on learning in the classroom
7021,2567824,1.0,2.0,Useless lectures and useless office hours made for an incredibly enlightening semester with good ol Charlie :):):):)
7022,2567824,5.0,4.0,"Prof Machan was so fun. He did a lot of crazy in class demonstrations and had funny extra credit questions. Test review days are hawaiin shirt days and if you show up wearing one you get candy. some of the stuff on the test won't be in the review slides, so make sure to study the review slides , practice tests, &amp; TA review"
7023,536209,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Reiner was an absolutely AMAZING professor. There were never any surprises regarding when quizzes were, what they covered- and likewise with exams. He knew what he was lecturing about and provided VERY thorough and informative powerpoints. He really cared and was always available and enthusiast to answer questions, and answered emails quickly."
7024,536209,1.0,5.0,Horrible at life. His children know more psychology then he does.
7025,536209,5.0,2.0,Class with Cedar was lots of fun.  I recommend him highly.
7026,536209,4.5,4.0,"He's fabulous!  He knows his stuff, he somehow makes it fun, he let us leave class early almost every day...and he's adorable!"
7027,536209,5.0,3.0,No Comments
7028,536209,5.0,3.0,man he's HOTT
7029,536209,5.0,1.0,"really cool guy, laid back, buys donuts for his students"
7030,2109076,5.0,2.0,"The class was very interesting, and Professor Cameron was a great lecturer. The grading being 3 non-cumulative take home tests was convenient. It is definitely a step-up from PHIL 2420 difficulty-wise, although in my opinion it was less work/homework than it. If you're interested in logic or like mathematical thinking, I highly recommend!"
7031,2109076,5.0,3.0,"He is an amazing professor! He is clearly passionate about the topic, and despite it being an 8am class, it was my favorite of the semester. He makes the lectures funny but also explains even the more difficult topics in a simple way. The tests are pretty difficult but very manageable if you do the work. I'm taking him again next semester!"
7032,2109076,5.0,3.0,"I really loved this class. Professor Cameron gets really into his lectures, which make them a lot more interesting. I barely knew what philosophy was before this class, and now I am planning on minoring in it."
7033,2109076,5.0,3.0,He is a great professor who explains complex well and is always able to further clarify points. Attending class is preferable but he provides detailed notes of his lectures online. Going to class is worth the time though since he goes through examples of more complicated proofs which help when doing the weekly discussion questions.
7034,2109076,5.0,3.0,Fantastic professor! Had him for Ontological Themes as well. He is extraordinarily talented at explaining very complex things in a simple and understandable way. One of my favorite philosophy professors.
7035,2109076,5.0,3.0,"I liked him.  He was very clear in class.  If you went to class, you'd be fine."
7036,2567828,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Rolf is extremely knowledgeable and charismatic. He makes fun prep videos for you to watch before class to understand concepts and then goes into more detail during lecture. There are 2-3 homework assignments and 1 quiz per week, but your grade is weighted heavily in the 2 midterms and a final. Exams are difficult, so be ready to work hard."
7037,2567828,5.0,5.0,Prof Rolf is one of the most personable and charismatic profs you will ever meet. He does not teach the way i'm used to- someone just lecturing at you while writing examples on the board. you really have to do the pre class video/web assign problems or you will not know what is happening in class. go to office hours as much as possible!!
7038,2715299,5.0,1.0,"Wished I paid more attention and took notes during his lectures cus they were actually very interesting. Genuinely nice guy and knows the topic he's teaching and teaches it well too. Also, go to his dog therapy hours because his two black labs are the cutest mfs I've seen, and it's properly therapeutic too."
7039,2715299,5.0,2.0,"Financial Lives: Interesting lectures, great class discussions, and thought-provoking assignments. Get an A if you show up to class and make somewhat of an effort to participate. The homework for the whole quarter was two short (interesting) readings and finishing a debate that wasn't finished in class. Would take another class from him if I could."
7040,1175204,5.0,2.0,"I took Modern American Authors (bonus: 2nd writing requirement), and it was really interesting. Readings were short stories and poems, and you can definitely tell which ones he's passionate about. He's so nice and understand, and he's really open to different interpretations of the texts. Has interesting ideas for class discussions and assignments"
7041,1175204,4.5,1.0,loved the first semester hopefully the next one will be just as good
7042,85672,4.0,2.0,"Prof Kelly was an engaging speaker and I liked his lectures a lot, but you absolutely have to read the textbook - this class has a lot of reading quizzes, and he often took questions directly from the book. Overall, great class that I'd recommend to anyone (even if the topic doesn't seem that interesting to you at first)"
7043,85672,4.0,4.0,"Professor Kelly gave good and engaging lectures, and was pretty funny. He spent a lot of time focusing on topics which were particularly confusing, which made the whole class easier to understand. Tests were extremely difficult, however."
7044,85672,4.0,3.0,"Professor Kelly is a great teacher. It's a tough course, but he made me enjoy it and want to continue in material science. If you're looking for a Science II elective, MSE 2090 with Kelly is a great choice."
7045,85672,5.0,2.0,"He's a solid lecturer--not great, but not bad.  He's definitely the best MSE2090 professor (all sections had the same tests, and his section almost always scored the highest).  Also, he podcasts all his lectures, which is super helpful if you miss a class."
7046,85672,3.5,5.0,"Extremely difficult, need to put in a lot of work, tests are curved which help, material is not as interesting as you'd think, Kelly is a good professor teaching a boring subject. There are much better classes out there"
7047,85672,4.0,5.0,"Don't let reviews misguide you--this is NOT an easy class. Homeworks are difficult and take a few hours to complete (1 a week). You have to know every detail to do well on the multiple choice section of exams, and you must be very fast at the word problems in order to finish. Kelly is a pretty good lecturer, although the material is very boring."
7048,85672,4.5,3.0,"Good prof, pretty funny guy, but I agree he's not God. You'll get bored unless you REALLY pay attention to him. Helpful in office hours, always very good at emailing you when something comes up. ALways puts powerpoints online, so dont try to write down all the stuff in the powerpoint - write down what he's saying in class."
7049,85672,2.0,5.0,"I found this course incredibly difficult for a intro course. material deals with atoms and chemistry. prof is okay, but not God like some people say he is. he's got a napoleon complex and is pretty arrogant. lectures are filled with piles of knowledge that I couldn't always follow -I zoned out a lot and heavily relied on the book, which was okay."
7050,85672,5.0,2.0,"Kelly does a great job. He's entertaining in a subject that should be boring. He explains things very well and will gladly take time before, after, and sometimes even during lecture to explain things you don't understand. his review sessions before the exams are VERY helpful. He's just a nice guy with a GREAT sense of humor. Makes MSE easy and fun."
7051,85672,5.0,4.0,"This class is easy.... to get a B in. Maybe it was just a weird semester, but the grading scale sucked. I finished well above the average on every assignment. I finished with an 89% and got a B+. If you call that a curve. Nobody got an A on the first test. One person got an A- on the second test. I find it hard to believe anybody actually got an A."
7052,85672,5.0,3.0,"I walked into this class not expecting much.  It was the elective that looked the least painful.  However, I'm now finishing this class pretty happy I took it.  Kelly is a great teacher.  Somehow he makes a really boring topic pretty interesting in lectures.  He's very knowledgeable and can answer even the most obscure questions."
7053,85672,5.0,2.0,Professor Kelly is one of the best teachers I have had here.  His lectures were clear and I was able to use his lecture notes as a substitute for reading the book.  Also he is very helpful and understanding with regards to homework.
7054,85672,5.0,4.0,"Kelly's lectures are really interesting, unlike some e-school professors.  He's really helpful, like with understanding what you did wrong on tests and hw and stuff..I did well in that class partly I think because he knew how hard I was trying and that I actually did know the stuff, even when I didn't do so hot on tests"
7055,85672,5.0,1.0,yo this is the easiest MSE 209 professor there is. no quizzes just HW and 3 Tests. i bought the MSE solutions online for less than $5 so technically i bought 20% of my grade and then i quess on everything because I didn't study at all and i ended up with a 70 as my final grade so i got 50% for guessing. so if you study you can do better than that.
7056,85672,4.5,3.0,hes better than any of the other MSE209 teachers
7057,85672,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher, he's much better than the other MSE professors!"
7058,85672,4.0,3.0,"Personally, I liked the class.  Yeah, some of the rules were a bit arbitrary (don't write on both sides of your homework papers, for example), but I certainly didn't the the homework was as hard as some of the other people here seem to think.  I got an A in the class no problem."
7059,85672,4.5,3.0,"Yes, the classs was hard, but I found him to be a very good professor. He is interesting and a great guy.  Don't be afraid of taking the class simply b/c one day a week you actually have to put forth a little effort.  The material is not very difficult at all."
7060,85672,1.0,5.0,"homework is really hard.you have to go to TA sessions to be able to do it.grading is absolutely ridiculous.you will be penalized 5 marks for writing on both sides of the paper and 2 marks for not putting answers in boxes.&#63;&#63;also,he doesn't cover much stuff in class.don't take his class"
7061,85672,3.0,3.0,No Comments
7062,85672,2.5,3.0,"R. Kelly is a rough guy, because he grades VERY arbitrarily and you never know what he will grade based on, regardless of what he says. He has a number of bawdy jokes about crushing **** and his ex-wife that make you wish he had a real sense of humor."

7065,806576,3.0,5.0,"The class had to really work with her about the workload. It gets ridiculous, so often we have to let her know when we can't keep up. She is nice and open to feedback which is good, but she isn't clear on grading whatsoever. I feel like she overestimates our retention of material. Don't take unless you really love Japanese; but tbh I'm burned out."
7066,806576,3.0,5.0,This class gets really intense in the higher levels as well! Beware this class!!! It's extremely time-consuming and difficult. If you are not 100% serious about Japanese do not take this class. Take something easier and save your GPA. Memorize the vocabulary VERBATIM. Go to her office hours every chance you. She is very nice!
7067,806576,4.0,4.0,"Sato Sensei is very respective and caring. Although her class is tough and you have to work very hard to fully master Japanese, you will indeed learn more than you expected. try to be friend with her and she will give you basically everything advice you want. Sometimes the workload might be too much, but it's never impossible to be accomplished."
7068,806576,5.0,3.0,"She sincerely care about all her students and tries to set up the class so that we're all close with each other. Expect to speak a lot (you get graded on your participation), but it's fun to interact in Japanese with your classmates. There is, however, a bit of a harsh grading scale. Prepare to practice daily and work on time consuming projects."
7069,806576,5.0,5.0,"Sato-sensei is amazing. We came in knowing very little or nothing about the Japanese language and at the end of the semester, she had us write paragraphs using all 3 of the alphabet systems. We sat back and realized how much we had learned. So much work, but so worth it. Often I would think, why am I taking this class&#63;&#63; But I loved it all. :)"
7070,806576,5.0,5.0,"Best teacher I ever had. Hardest class I've ever taken. She has no idea how long her homework takes her students to complete it (hours and hours and hours). If you don't really, really love Japanese, this course isn't for you."
7071,806576,5.0,4.0,I had Sato-sensei since my first-year Japanese. And now she's teaching 200-level. This is a must-take course if you are interested in learning Japanese. The only thing needs to be aware of - you need to make sure you have enough time(&gt;10 hrs/week)to devote in this class since Sato-sensei always keeps a high standard.
7072,806576,5.0,4.0,"She's one of the best professors I've been taught by.  She's a bit (actually, very) scary at first, but once you give her a chance, you'll see she's a sweetheart.  She's readily available in her office hours and, of the four Japanese professors I had, I'd say she was the one I learned the most with.  Cheers for Sato sensei!"
7073,806576,4.5,4.0,Satou-sensei is simply AMAZING. She is scary and harsh. You won't get an excused absence from her except when you get hospitalized. Her teaching method is really effective and she is basically in her office all the time. Don't be afraid to make mistakes or ask questions. You'll find that you love her and this class so much!
7074,806576,4.5,3.0,This class takes up more than half of your time every day. BUT Sato Sensee is amazing. I learnt SO MUCH from this class since it is so intense. It's a lot of fun doing the skits too. She doesn't have much sympathy and can be VERY harsh (she tends to favor certain students) so make sure she likes you!
7075,806576,5.0,5.0,"Sato sensei is simply AMAZING. She's had years of teaching experience and she's just a great teacher, in fact she's in her office all the time-not really but you got the idea. UVa has the best Japanese language program on the east coast. Any wahoo intrested in learning Japanese should totally take the advantage."
7076,806576,5.0,1.0,She's the best language teacher I've ever had. She knows how to teach an introductory level language course very well. You will learn a lot in this class.
7077,806576,3.5,3.0,"Participation is important in the class. Don't afraid to make mistakes, if you speak up, you will get the grade. she is a little bit scary in the class but really nice and helpful during her office hour. Fun class but required hard work!"
7078,806576,5.0,2.0,"Sato sensei is awesome.  She looks very serious when expressionless, but her smiles are warm and brilliant.  This class requires a lot of work.  However, as long as you try hard, you'll succeed.  The skits are always hilarious!"
7079,806576,4.0,4.0,"Personally, I found her *very* intimidating at first, but she sincerely wants to help you learn.  There is at *least* 1.5 hours of outside work a day if you want to be prepared.  A very structured schedule, which helps.  My most challenging class by far, but I enjoy it a lot and find it very interesting, which makes it worth the effort."
7080,806576,4.5,3.0,"Sato-sensei teaches very well, but is a little scary. The class takes a lot of work, 10+ hours a week, but it is worthwhile. As long as you do the homework and participate in class, you'll get a pretty good grade."
7081,806576,4.0,4.0,"Follows a strick and thorough schedule, so you must make sure not to fall behind.  You will learn a lot of material, but this leads to a greater amount of outside class studying than other language classes might.  Be sure to do all work and review every day.  Don't let Sato Sensei scare you, she truly wants to help you learn."
7082,806576,4.0,4.0,"Strict and exact. However, she's also a very effective teacher who'll make sure that you'll grasp the material. The drills in class are very fast-paced. One should definitely at least review the material for the day before each class. This is a demanding class; be prepared to work for your grades."
7083,806576,4.0,3.0,"Very fast paced class, lots of worksheets and outside class studying and work. However, very good teacher, very willing to meet with students if necessary. Enjoyable and efficient teacher, if just a little scary at times."
7084,806576,3.5,4.0,"Fast-paced, though well-structured.  Expect plenty of work outside of class.  Helpful in a one-on-one setting."
7085,298675,1.0,4.0,"I don't remember the class number, but out of all of my Classics courses, this was by far the most boring.  The classes weren't well prepared and lacked overall direction.  This course sapped all the fun out of Latin/History for me."
7086,298675,4.0,2.0,"Very interesting class. She knows what she's talking about, and she's nice. But, there's a lot of readings. The class is also disorganized. Still, it's a great class to fulfill humanities requirement!"
7087,298675,5.0,3.0,"She's interesting and fun.  Even if you've never been exposed to the Classics, she'll make you love it."
7088,298675,4.0,2.0,"Definitly knows her stuff. Probably would be easy if you have any interest in latin, but if you dont you can still manage by just cramming for tests."
7089,298675,5.0,1.0,"She was very intelligent and sweet. Obviously knew what she was talking about and really tried to share her enthusiasm with the students. Take a class with her, especially one in litterature/poetry."
7090,298675,5.0,1.0,I enjoyed the class. The pace was just right and I thought Prof. Myers did a great job teaching. She definately knows her stuff.
7091,298675,1.0,2.0,"I was so excited to take the Women/Gender class. Turns out Myers is a TERRIBLE teacher. She doesn't like it when people disagree with her in class (but doesn't mind it in your papers). She has absolutely no personality and no sense of humor. I learned absolutely nothing from this class, which is a crying shame."
7092,298675,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful, but you do have to write down everything she says and read it over later in order to get what the lecture was about.  Overall though she is a great teacher and if you need help, she'll always help."
7093,298675,1.0,2.0,"Ms. Myers is no doubt knowledgable, but her classes have no direction.  Were it not for the title of each lecture on the syllabus I would not have known what the topic was.  Many random tangents, and not fun ones.  I found her teaching style very boring.  I will avoid her like the plague in future."
7094,298675,2.5,3.0,"Ugh, I really dislike this course. I hate attending lectures and never do the reading, there's just too much of it. But I hate history overall, so don't let that deter you. I'm still pulling a C+/B- in the class, so it's not like it's a hard course, if you're interested in Greece, it would be good."
7095,298675,1.0,1.0,Myers says over a score of times every class &quot;we'll talk about this later&quot; but she never does. Her lectures have no modicum of structure. But her class is quite easy with alot of reading.
7096,298675,5.0,3.0,Class was not hard but required a lot of memorization; Myers is helpful and definitely knows her stuff but she is not overly approachable.
7097,298675,4.0,3.0,The class has a butt load of reading. But she is humorour at times and very good at giving lectures. I recomment the class because its quite interesting.
7098,298675,3.0,3.0,"She is reasonably nice. She definately knows that she has a PhD and comes off as a little arrogant. She really knows her Latin well, and can answer almost anything about Romans. Feminist- ask her about Roman Women, wears no makeup, keeps hair pulled tight"
7099,2535092,5.0,3.0,"Prof Cary is the best!! all-around awesome person and amazing instructor w/ funny and inspirational personal anecdotes about her time as a presidential speech writer. Brought in a ton of amazing guest speakers (both from the right and left), and goes out of her way to be bipartisan. Really cares for students. Deserves all the accolades."
7100,2535092,5.0,3.0,Professor Cary is by far my favorite professor Ive had at UVA. I took PLAP 4500: Speechwriting with her in the Fall of 2019 and she made every class unique and useful. Her knowledge on speechwriting is unmatched and the guest speakers she brought in were very esteemed. She is an absolute delight and very passionate about helping her students grow.
7101,2494153,1.0,5.0,AWFUL!!! He is such an awkward person who is only a Professor probably because he couldn't get another job and all UVA cares about is prestige. His class is the most uninteresting class I've ever taken and he does not help the case. It sucks that he is the only one who teaches a course that is mandatory for Bio majors bc he truly sucks. 
7102,2494153,5.0,3.0,"Gives very thorough lectures, and he is genuinely interested in everything he teaches. Lectures typically well done with a slideshow to follow along. Few homework assignments, so most of the grades come from exams (do require thought, but they aren&#39;t impossible). The exams are at home and open note. Overall great guy. Definitely a doable class."
7103,2494153,5.0,3.0,"Dont buy the textbook, you wont need to read it. Go to class and pay attention. You will get 1 point added to your course grade for attendance (measured by iClicker). Cox teaches first half, Brodie teaches second half. Cox is an okay lecturer and has straightforward exams. Brodie is a good lecturer but has hard, very ambiguous exams. No homework."
7104,2494153,3.0,4.0,"Cox's exams are easier to follow than Brodie's, but you still need to study for them quite a bit to do well. The books aren't necessary if you go to lecture. The TA was nice enough but less than helpful in discussion. Extra credit for missing &lt; 4 lectures is a nice gesture but 1.5 points out of 400 doesn't actually mean much."
7105,1101513,5.0,4.0,"Great, great professor. Knows his stuff (and it's quite a lot) and will challenge you in discussion to show what you've got. Don't be scared!"
7106,1101513,4.0,2.0,Professor McGann deserves a pepper.  He's a great dude and very approachable.
7107,1101513,4.5,3.0,No Comments
7108,536266,3.5,2.0,"Shaw is a fantastic professor. He really cares about what he's teaching and is hilarious in a 'cute old man' kind of way. He breaks out into english, especially for main points that he wants to make sure that everyone gets. My favorite is that he name drops some Latin American writer every chance he gets. (True story, Borges got him this job.)"
7109,536266,5.0,3.0,Wonderful class. Shaw is one of the best professors I had at UVA and one of the most respected scholars in the field. Plus he's hilarious
7110,536266,3.0,2.0,"I don't care how easy he grades. It was the most boring class I've taken at UVA. He talked at us everyday for 1 hr 15 min in british spanish and broke into english a lot. no chance for discussion, just lecture. I WANT MY SEMESTER BACK."
7111,536266,5.0,3.0,"An ld fashioned, smart, nice, interesting professor...really interested in what he is teacing...that kind of professor that almost does not exist anymore...Take advantage while you can...."
7112,536266,5.0,4.0,"Shaw is the tops, the Mona Lisa, the Tower of Pisa!"
7113,536266,5.0,2.0,"Shaw is awesome, he totally knows his stuff when it comes to LA literature. And he tells great stories. Definitely recommend this class."
7114,536266,5.0,2.0,"very approachable, he knows his stuff especially about borges.  I would take other classes with him.  the class was worth the time and it was easy to do well, you just have to do the assignments.  outside of class, he's an awesome guy too, really funny."
7115,536266,5.0,3.0,"Always available for chats and kind as ever. Great and inspiring teacher. If you ever need a pep talk, Shaw is the man."
7116,388823,3.0,4.0,"Fowler really isn't a bad teacher. He's not the best at being very clear when fielding questions during class, but his slides are quite helpful and his British accent and quirkiness make class a little fun!"
7117,388823,2.0,4.0,Physics is very challenging with Fowler.  Assumes that most of the class is a &quot;review of high school&quot;  Is willing to help you.  Be prepared to teach yourself most of the material because you probably won't get it in lecture. Homework is IMPOSSIBLE.  Tests are also very hard with class averages in the 60's.
7118,388823,3.5,1.0,I don't know why he's rated so low. He's a hilarious and stereotypically absent-minded professor. Plus his class is really easy (I don't know why people really need all this clarification). The most important thing to do in his class is just not take him too seriously and always look to the book for answers.
7119,388823,2.5,3.0,"Not the best professor, but he was at least entertaining so you don't have to worry about falling asleep. At first i didnt do so great but i learned how to study for his tests and they weren't that bad"
7120,388823,1.5,5.0,"Let me supplement the other negative arguments with something he did during our final.  In a class of a couple hundred students, after about five students left early he refused to clarify anymore exam questions because &quot;it is not fair to those who have left early.&quot;  Like the other intro physics professors, absolutely abysmal."
7121,388823,1.0,5.0,"Hilarious for the simple fact he has no common sense. He fails at everything he tries to do - most importantly his teaching. Shouldn't be teaching beginner physics. If you get stuck with him, take it at a community college. It would be twice as beneficial. As stated previously, all he does is derive the most basic formulas in the book."
7122,388823,2.0,5.0,"He is a nice guy, but he IS NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. I just go to lecture because the iclickers are worth a lot of my grade. He just derives formulas the entire class (which we can find in the book), and doesnt work out any examples, so we are not prepared for the tests EVER."
7123,388823,1.0,5.0,this is the worst professor i have ever had in my entire life. Why did they even hire him&#63;
7124,388823,2.0,4.0,"Do not take this class unless you can attend office hours.  The homework is the majority of your grade and it was a struggle for me every week.  For those of you who, like me, are trying to get credit for physics without actually having to endure physics, resist!  It's not worth it."
7125,388823,1.0,5.0,"This calss is impossible. Homework is impossible, clicker questions are made to trick you, concepts are not explained clearly in class. The man is a genius, but he can't explain anything to us non-PHd students"
7126,388823,4.0,3.0,homework is very difficult and extensive but he will give you all the answers in office hours.  you know exactly what will be on the 2 exams (which makes it easy) but you must be VERY SPECIFIC because he is a hard grader.  should go to class for clickers but he puts everything online so you don't have to pay any attention.. its boring but nice guy
7127,388823,3.0,1.0,"I should have just bought a copy of sakurai, it's the same as his notes but without the bad british puns"
7128,388823,4.0,2.0,"This is the most fun I have ever had in a class as an undergraduate.  Prof. Fowler has a great sense of humor and makes physics about as interesting and appealing to non-physics majors as it can be.  This is basically a History of Physics course, but definitely worth taking."
7129,388823,4.5,2.0,"He's a really nice guy, he wants to help his students learn, so go to office hours, he practically gives you the answers to the homework.  His tests come straight from his lecture."
7130,388823,5.0,2.0,"Great guy, witty and intelligent. Homework is more challenging than the exams. If you go to class and pay attention, it's an easy A. Very interesting material. If you do in fact listen in his lectures, he sets eveything up nicely and explains everything in detail"
7131,388823,1.0,5.0,"professor is brilliant, probably one of the smartest men at UVA and overqualified to teach this material.  he is completely unable to convey it to his audience of non-science majors.  the course is harder than it sounds and grades do not reflect what you put into it.  expect confusion and frustratio"
7132,388823,3.0,3.0,"The homework and the tests are challenging.  His lectures are interesting, as his &quot;attempts&quot; at demos, but they can be confusing.  I still got a lot out of them however. Go to office hours for help on the homework."
7133,388823,3.5,3.0,"He seems like a really great guy.  He tries to liven up physics lectures with experiments.  Unfortunately, his lectures were still over my head and probably over the heads of much of the class.  I learned a lot, but mostly research, not lectures."
7134,388823,2.0,4.0,"He expects you to know stuff that you may or may not have any business knowing, and instead of straightening out any confusion he just gets frustrated.  I hope I don't have him for a more confusing topic like quantum...."
7135,1445592,3.0,4.0,"He's a TA, and a good one.  He works hard when the students won't.  The one lecture he gave was good.  He reminds me of Jim Broadbent's portrayal of Professor Slughorn."
7136,1945312,4.0,3.0,Very nice and a fun class 
7137,2477807,5.0,3.0,Absolutely great professor! Always looked forward to his lectures and I learned a lot through his assignments. Loved his class and hope to take more with him in the future!
7138,2477807,3.0,1.0,"Professor Dill is nice and enthusiastic about CS, but his classes are somewhat bare-bones. Often times, you can get the same information he brings to lectures from texts and slides. People who prefer hands-on learning will likely do better by reading through the texts and practicing the examples. Nevertheless, his classes are easy and digestible."
7139,2477807,3.0,2.0,"Craig Dill is well-meaning, but is simply not a good professor. There is absolutely no point in going to lecture because you won't learn anything and his voice puts you to sleep. There are many much better professors in the CS department so please take one of them instead."
7140,1584884,4.5,3.0,"One of the greatest professors I've ever had. Looks like he's been teaching grad courses only  but if he teaches undergraduate economics anytime in the future, it should not be missed. Great presentation of the materials. Excellent communication during and after class, extremely helpful homeworks and old exams. Thumbs up."
7141,1076981,4.0,2.0,"Professor Durand is funny.  She is very into teaching and tries to do a lot of different exercises in class to help you learn.  She really cares about her students and really wants you to learn.  Tests about every 8 days, an essay, and presentation (department standards not hers).  Need to study but can get an A"
7142,1076981,5.0,1.0,"I had her for Ital 101/102, and Signora Durand is the greatest teacher ever!! So sweet, and she really wants everyone to do well in the class. I mean, she really did her best to prepare everyone for the every assignment, and cares about the students. Truthfully, I would change up my schedule however I needed to in order to keep taking her class."
7143,1076981,4.5,4.0,"Durand is so helpful. She has her office hours @ the West Range Cafe which is cool. She cares about you doing well and will aid you in any way possible. She brings us food when we have big exams and teaches us songs! :D I am not the best at languages so I have to try harder, but most people don't seem to have a problem with the course."
7144,1273591,4.5,3.0,Professor Gerber is a knowledgeable and helpful Professor and this made APMA 5070 easier for me. The HWs and semester project weren't too bad and the key was going to office hours after trying the HWs. Professor Gerber cleared things up a lot and was always willing to help her students out when they came to office hours.
7145,1273591,1.5,3.0,knows the math but gets such stage fright that its almost useless to even listen...i will say she tries though
7146,1273591,5.0,2.0,"She is actually a great, helpful professor. I took Numerical Methods with her.  The course description necessitates that you have prior programming experience and you should, otherwise you will struggle. She's really helpful, and her notes / lectures are fairly clear. HW follows from notes and textbook. Exams are very fair. You will enjoy her class"
7147,1273591,2.0,4.0,No Comments
7148,380665,5.0,3.0,"Professor Reed is one of the best professor I've had at UVa. Although his assigned readings are quite hefty, his lectures are super interesting. If you pay attention a lot in lecture, you can get away with only skimming the readings. Tests and essays are alright if you've been paying attention in lecture and discussion section."
7149,380665,4.0,4.0,"Great, Interesting Lectures. Notes are a must. The tests were graded fairly strictly. The TA you have matters a lot."
7150,380665,3.0,4.0,"Professor Reed seems like a nice guy, but lectures are very dry and boring. Uses a lot of complicated definitions and goes fast, making note taking difficult and stressful. Tests/papers graded harshly by TAs with little feedback. The entire class is based on 3 assignment. Dont take just for nonwestern perspective requirement."
7151,380665,5.0,3.0,No contest the best professor I've had in my life. I looked forward to lecture every single week. He made history come alive.
7152,380665,5.0,2.0,"Best prof. I've ever seen in UVA. Very easygoing, very accessible outside class. Must take his class!"
7153,380665,5.0,3.0,Greatest history professor ever!!!!! Love the way he taught the material and definitely have a deep understanding of Chinese history!
7154,380665,4.5,3.0,"Took Mod China, he is an absolutely engaging lecturer -my favorite professor of the semester. The TAs do all the grading and grade midterms harshly (tip: include dates and the sig/big ideas for maximum points). Th professor definitely knows his material (organized lectures). However they simply skim the surface and reading is essential -& lot of it"
7155,380665,5.0,1.0,Took American history since civil war with prof Reed in Beijing this summer. A great lecturer. Learned a lot.
7156,380665,5.0,2.0,"This guy is an awesome professor. Lectures are organized, clear, and interesting. If you have any interest in modern China, or even if you don't but think you should, take this class!!"
7157,380665,4.0,3.0,"Lecture outline is written on the board, but the lectures are often dry and later in the year a little unorganized. For the first half of the semester, will randomly call on people to make them pronounce a Chinese name. Bring his beautiful dog to class occasionally. Overall, fairly interesting material. Helps if you know about socialism."
7158,380665,5.0,4.0,I HEART PROFESSOR REED!!!!!!!
7159,380665,3.5,3.0,"Engaging lecturer. Didn't know how interested I was in Chinese modern history; definitely captivated my attention. Manageable reading even if you have loads of other work. I'm a science major with little room in schedule, and this was an excellent elective!"
7160,380665,4.0,3.0,"He is a great lecturer who articulates very well and definitely knows the material inside-out. However, I have to warn you about the TAs - Zhao Han in particular is very strict and will not give you the grades you want [the downside is that he tends to focus on being philosophical rather than discussing real history]. This class was worth it though"
7161,380665,3.5,3.0,"He reads too much from his notes during the lecture and is very repetitive with cliche explanations about how &quot;history is more complicated than a monolithic representation&quot; blah blah blah. Also, not enough time devoted to contemporary China, just one or two lectures. Not missing much by missing lecture."
7162,380665,5.0,2.0,"Sensational! His lectures are very well organized, easy to follow, and very interesting, like he's telling a story. Take notes on your computer because you want to write everything he says down (average 4 pg, 1-space 12 pt on a day!) but if you write it all down, you don't need to read the book - although the book is pretty good. Highly recommended"
7163,380665,5.0,3.0,"One of the sleeper best classes at this University.  Even if you aren't interested in Chinese History, its hard nto to be captivated by this class.  Professor Reed is an amazing lecturer and very interesting."
7164,380665,5.0,3.0,"This class was absolutely fascinating.  Reed's lectures, even at 9 am, are captivating.  If you have even a passing interest in the subject, seriously, TAKE THIS CLASS."
7165,380665,5.0,5.0,Exceptional
7166,380665,5.0,3.0,"Prof Reed is awesome! He is very organized and every lecture of his was interesting. As a science major I could write down everything he said, which for me, was very impressive. =)If you give enough effort to this class you can def get a B or above. Even if you're not a history major, like me, you should try to his class just because he is awesome."
7167,380665,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Reed is a great lecturer, in fact I liked him so much that I took him twice.  If you go to lecture and take good ntoes, you should get at least a B.  He is also very accomodating."
7168,380665,5.0,3.0,"dynamic speaker, easy to get in contact with, invites questions, awesome class!"
7169,380665,3.5,4.0,Interesting professor with a lively personality.  Is an animated professor who is open to questions throughout the lecture and is passionate and very knowledgable about Chinese history. - 2 midterms/1 final that are ID/essay and one 8-10 page paper
7170,405245,5.0,1.0,FREAKING LOVED LARKIN MURPHY. HE'S HILARIOUS. 
7171,405245,5.0,2.0,"Incredibly awesome professor.  Really nice, always funny and actually a very fair grader.  Only took French for the requirement but he made it great. Can rephrase questions endlessly until someone figures out what he's asking which is nice."
7172,405245,4.5,4.0,"Hilarious guy...always keeps everyone laughing and smiling. He speaks French very, very well, and he's great at teaching it too! I really enjoyed the class - far more than I ever thought I'd enjoy learning another language!"
7173,405245,4.0,2.0,"Awesome professor! Makes the class interesting and tries to keep you smiling no matter how crappy your day is going.  If you pay attention in class, participate and study then you will be fine."
7174,405245,3.5,3.0,"he seems crazy and totally out there, but you will have so much fun in his class...he definitely cracks jokes with his students/keeps the atmosphere really light. be prepared for some****ty grades though on compositions/tests. if you go to class/participate, you'll do well in the end though"
7175,405245,5.0,1.0,"Great guy. I hate French but had to fill my requirement; I had Murphy for both 201 and 202.  He grades compositions and tests EXTREMELY hard, but don't worry if your test and composition grades are HORRIBLE--I was prepared for a final grade of a low C but he gave me a B. Awesome!!! :)"
7176,405245,2.5,3.0,Hes interesting.  But alot of times doesn't come to class because he has a hangover or a bad day.  If you don't like a teacher who thinks its funny to crack jokes on his students... this is not the class for you.
7177,405245,4.5,3.0,"Strict grader of compositions and tests, but he's more than willing to help in his office hours and any other time available, and is always helpful.  Also, he provides some much, MUCH needed humor to the French department, and I think he's the most enthusiastic teacher they have..very sorely missed."
7178,405245,5.0,1.0,"absolutely awesome professor, best since i've been at the university and it's been two years now.  very understanding and down to earth, but also intelligent and willing to help anytime."
7179,249598,5.0,1.0,He is cool
7180,249598,2.5,4.0,"The lectures are just a bunch of pictures from his trips and little is actually on the quizzes. He doesn't let anyone use phones or laptops, and he doesn't upload grades. If you get a question partially right, he won't give partial credit if you're not a favorite. He makes you buy his boring textbook and is the most boring professor I have had."
7181,249598,5.0,2.0,"Friendliest professor I have ever had. Brought candy for class on several occasions. Made the subject (archaeology of American southwest) very, very interesting as well. Tests can be a little tricky, but they are graded fairly and are generally not too difficult."
7182,249598,5.0,2.0,wonderful Professor. He is very knowledgeable and as a result you  learn a lot from him
7183,249598,5.0,4.0,Wonderful Professor.  You can go into class not knowing or caring about archaeology and leave wanting to do it forever!  You may feel lost at times but in the end you will be amazed at how much you've learned.  Professor Plog is also very approachable so you shouldn't have any problems.
7184,249598,2.0,4.0,He doesn't give back assignments in a timely manner-you have no idea what you grade is.Did not inform you if you got to take the final exam as take home until a week before it was scheduled- too bad if you had other obligations!watched too many movies. Repeats himself and does not spend enough time on new material that we will actually be tested on
7185,249598,4.5,1.0,"lectures can be monotonous, but the prof. loves the topic and it shows.. projects and tests pretty easy, and the material is interesting.. go to class and you're set"
7186,249598,2.5,5.0,"Was intimidating in a small class environment.  Learned a lot, but was totally stressed and spent ridiculous hours studying for class and still felt unprepared.  Most stressful/benificial class at UVA."
7187,249598,5.0,3.0,great teacher. keeps things interesting. tests and projects pretty straight forward. cares about his students and always in a good mood.
7188,249598,5.0,5.0,Great Teacher
7189,323334,3.5,4.0,"I think Prof. is a reasonably good teacher, although a little scatterbrained, on her own, however current textbook is rather questionable. The test//HW questions she writes are often better than those from the book; all are hard but the book's are generally very confusing. Be prepared for long calc deriv. that have little to do with the material"
7190,323334,4.0,3.0,She is a very good teacher and seems to genuinely care about her students.  She is very approachable and willing to help if you’re having a hard time in class.
7191,323334,5.0,3.0,Good teacher and babetastic.
7192,323334,2.0,5.0,"Wow, how can someone make such an interesting subject so crappy.  Well could someone ask professor Ford that one for me.  This lady did nothing but teach nonsense and make stuff up in lecture.  OMG, she has to be one of the worse teachers I have ever had in my life!"
7193,323334,5.0,4.0,Amazing math professor; she did a really good job of making ordinary differential equations understandable.
7194,323334,5.0,3.0,Keeps class interesting; genuine interest in students
7195,2084626,3.0,3.0,"She's a nice person but the grading was waay more intense and nit picky than any other professor I've ever had. I totally deserved the grade on my first paper because in retrospect it was trash, but she gave me all compliments and no critiques on my second yet I still got a B?? Plus she gives a final which I thought was annoying for a lit class"
7196,2084626,4.0,3.0,"I loved Lara. She's hilarious and relevant, and she really respects everyone's opinions. She definitely a fair grader, not an easy grader. Some of the grades she gave me I didn't like, but in retrospect, I definitely deserved the grades. I appreciate that she calls you out on your bull, and she is ALWAYS willing to talk."
7197,601876,5.0,4.0,Prof. Lewis is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Absolutely superb at leading discussion. Makes dry texts come alive. Take any class with him you can!
7198,601876,5.0,4.0,"Professor Lewis is brilliant. We have a 35 person class, but he always makes the discussion fast-paced, engaging and interesting--and he's hilarious. It's actually fun to go to his class, and I'm not even really interested in Victorian literature. If you're still debating about taking his course, then think no more: You should sign up."
7199,601876,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, excellent constructive criticism for papers. This man will open your mind and change the way you think. And while his feedback on papers is impessive, it takes a long time for the papers to come back."
7200,601876,5.0,4.0,"best teacher maybe ever. energetic, fun, makes everything interesting. opens your eyes and makes you want to come to class forever!!"
7201,601876,4.5,3.0,"Tough grader, but nice guy and good class atmosphere"
7202,601876,5.0,3.0,"This man is witty,helpful,insightful, extremely intelligent, gives great constructive feedback on papers, and knows how to teach, which is rare for some TAs. He inspired me to be an English major before I even took an upper level class with a professor."
7203,601876,5.0,2.0,Amazing. One of the best teachers I have ever had. I never dream of skipping his class - I worry I will miss one of his hilarious witticisms. I highly suggest any class with him. He is absolutely darling.
7204,601876,5.0,3.0,"I have hated english forever! After taking Michael's class, it made me really enjoy it. He is a tough grader but you learn a lot!"
7205,601876,5.0,2.0,"Michael Lewis is just about as good as it gets.  He's a really approachable teacher that skillfully directs discussions to be productive and interesting.  ENWR could have been such a downer, but Micahel made it one of my favorite classes."
7206,601876,5.0,2.0,"Michael is an amazing teacher! He's humorous and fair, I took his identity politics class, and although my conservative views differed from many of my classmates, I was always given a fair opportunity to speak. Michael helped our class bond through his energy and obvious passion for what he's teaching. Take any class with him that you can!!"
7207,601876,4.5,2.0,"Michael's class is really fun, I always looked forward to it.  Michael grades paper fairly and is very helpful."
7208,601876,4.5,2.0,"I loved having Michael as a teacher.  His class was fun, and I acutally looked forward to it.  The class wasn't too demanding, but he does grade the papers kind of hard.  Anyway, take him if you can!  He's great."
7209,601876,5.0,3.0,"BEST class ever. if you get him for enwr, take it! he taught me how to write and is so energetic and fun. our class bonded together oddly and instantly, and michael had alot to do with it :)"
7210,1822495,4.5,3.0,Prof. Climer brought enthusiasm to what is often a prereq class. 
7211,1822495,5.0,3.0,Hidden gem of the Spanish department. Very nice and very clear in her lectures. Spanish curriculums don't have much flexibility but she does her best to make sure you have an opportunity to get an A.
7212,331551,5.0,4.0,"Professor Krentz was one of my favorite professors! His lessons are thoughtfully planned and he cares about and engages with his students. I took disability in literature with him and liked it so much I signed up for his American lit class the following semester. Take anything he teaches! And yes, he has an adorable personality and is so kind."
7213,331551,3.0,3.0,"If you're an ASL minor at UVA you'll find yourself taking one of CK's classes. What they don't warn you is how much of an English class these are rather than ASL classes. The grading is very specific, so missing even one thing can hurt you. CK is a cool person, but not a very lenient professor and sometimes lacks social cues. keep it professional!"
7214,331551,3.5,3.0,"Enthusiastic about the material and genuinely interested in his students' development and in-class comments. Useful feedback on papers; while Krentz's grading is fair, it's worth noting that he tends to be a bit meticulous."
7215,331551,2.5,4.0,"This was the worst English class I have taken at the University. While the literature was great, he provided no useful extra information to enhance a student's initial evaluation. His grading was unfair because he had a grader so nothing was consistent. He didn't want analysis, he wanted you to tell him the &quot;themes&quot; he had noted in class."
7216,331551,5.0,3.0,"I think he is the best professor i've ever had. he is so passionate about deaf culture and society so it shows when he teaches. AND he's so adorable, you can't not like the class! :)"
7217,331551,4.0,2.0,This was such a great class. I took this course to fulfill my foreign language requirements and he made signing easy although it really isn't.  He made you realize that there really is a DEAF culture out there. Always looked forward to this class.
7218,331551,3.5,2.0,No Comments
7219,1814308,2.0,3.0,Learn a lot in class
7220,1814308,5.0,1.0,"This is my third class with Pace (Ecology, Limnology, Ecosystem Ecology). He is an awesome professor! His classes are easy (he posts slides online), but you learn a lot. He is very helpful with projects and papers that are due."
7221,2649895,4.0,4.0,"Grading is really clear. She drops the lowest grade out of all categories: active learning, knowledge checks, tests. There's also a mediation assignment to replace a test grade. Her lectures are all online. Active learning is fun. Unclear what you need to know for the test - ascpets of textbook in it. Don't worry - if you study you can get an A!"
7222,2649895,4.0,4.0,Great professor. Grading and expectations were very clear. Exams were based mostly on lectures with a few additional details from the textbook. Attendance was not mandatory when I took the class during covid season.
7223,2649895,3.0,4.0,Professor Clabough seems like a really nice person but her lectures were unorganized and the material did not always agree with the associated textbook readings. TA's were no help at all either.
7224,2649895,4.0,4.0,"Clabough is a cool professor. The material is super interesting. Her exams are ridiculously hard. Not open book or open notes, but if they were it would still be really hard. The reading is a bit tough as well. I still recommend the course just because of the material alone. She's not a bad teacher at all, but the tests averaged at about 75%"
7225,2649895,3.0,3.0,"I had her for neural basis during covid. all tests were closed book. I think the class in general is hard, but the way she explains things can be really confusing. material is not intuitive to me and I often had zero clue what I was expected to know. tests are the only grades we get, and no study guide or clarification on what we need to know"
7226,2649895,5.0,3.0,"I had Prof Clabough for a lab class during covid, and thought she did a great job transitioning the class to an online format. Asynchronous lectures, open-note quizzes, and lab papers on easy-to-understand experiments. I wish the class didn't have to be online because normally you get to do cool stuff like dissect brains. Nice &amp; smart professor."
7227,454442,5.0,3.0,Professor Milani was an amazing teacher. I learned a lot about different culture issues and real world problems that were often overlooked by the media. Overall she was a great professor who had very engaging and thought out lectures with brilliant guest.
7228,454442,2.0,4.0,nice person but too harsh a grader for a 2 credit engagement course
7229,454442,1.0,3.0,"Milani is a nice lady in the appearance, however her classes are really boring. We basically talked about the same subject over and over at her class."
7230,454442,1.0,3.0,I took a class with her for the second time and I highly regret it. Milani doesnt like for anyone to disagree with what she thinks. She also Isnt a fair grader. Her grades highly depends on how much she likes you.
7231,454442,1.0,4.0,Mialni finds her own ideas brilliant and doesn't like for any student to disagree with what she thinks. She also assigned many books for purchase which were never used in the class.
7232,454442,5.0,3.0,THE GREATEST PROFESSOR IN THE LAND!! but seriously-- this class was incredible. milani has a lot of interdisciplinary expertise to bring to classes aside from being literally the top of her field in forough farrokhzad. count on profound insights and interesting observations from her every class. easily one of the top 3 classes i've taken at UVa.
7233,454442,5.0,2.0,"She is inspiring, intelligent, classy, clear assignments, interesting readings, and she would do anything to help anyone. She is a true scholar and it really shows. She was definitely meant for teaching. I never met someone who didn't like her or enjoy her class."
7234,454442,5.0,2.0,I had Prof. Milani as part of Semester at Sea. What an inspiration! Everyone absolutely loved her and her classes. I am so lucky to have gotten to know her. Even if you aren't in women's studies... you MUST take a class with her!
7235,454442,4.5,2.0,"She is incredibly intelligent, helpful, and caring.  She let's you redo any paper or test if you don't like your grade.  Take a class with her before you graduate"
7236,454442,5.0,2.0,Professor Milani is my favorite teacher at UVA.  Aside from being the smartest person I know she is so welcoming and willing to help.  You can write anything over againuntil you actually like the grade.  Take anything with her
7237,454442,5.0,2.0,"Milani is amazing.  My favorite professor at UVA, by far.  An amazing class that truly changed the way I thought."
7238,454442,5.0,1.0,"Professor Milani is wonderful and she is extremely intelligent. If you are blessed with the opportunity to take her class, take it!! Very nice grader, too!!!"
7239,216875,4.5,2.0,"Mme. Bargach is AMAZING! She is very open minded, always willing to help, passionate about the material she teaches and incredibly resourceful. She does have fairly high standards  though. She has taught in France, so it is a very authentic experience to take her class."
7240,216875,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors at the University of Virginia. Period. And one of the most intelligent, compassionate human beings anywhere. Take her class, go to Morocco with her, get to know her in any way you can -- you won't regret it."
7241,216875,5.0,2.0,"One of the best French teachers I have had. Extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. It was a complete joy to go to class every day. As long as you have a solid understanding of French, you will be fine!"
7242,216875,1.0,5.0,She needs to learn english
7243,216875,3.0,5.0,"If you already have quite a bit of knowledge in French, this class can be very interesting and you'll learn alot. Otherwise, like me who only started learning french in college, this class can be a torture... be ready to do dense readings. On the bright side though, her french is absolutely beautiful and after all I got B so it was ok."
7244,216875,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE BARGACH! She is a wonderful teacher! Class was not very hard - and the end of term exam is an essay. It's helpful if you like speaking french, since the class is small. Expect to re-correct your essays and read at times boring stuff! But overall she's AMAZING!"
7245,216875,1.0,5.0,Dense reading
7246,216875,4.5,3.0,I am obsessed! She is so knowledgable since she grew up in Maroc and France and has so many interesting stories to tell! Her accent is beautiful and it's fascinating to listen to her opinions and experiences. She is genuinely kind and interested in the lives of her students and is willing to work with you if you need help. Highly recommended!
7247,216875,5.0,3.0,"One of the best teachers in the French Department. I would reccomend you take any class you possibly can with her. She's tough, but you are garanteed to have a positive experience if you put in the work. Doesn't have a degree in French because she's Moroccan and grew up speaking french. Masters of Political Science though"
7248,216875,4.0,3.0,"Very good lecturer and engaging speaker.  One of my fave French professors.  Quite a bit of writing, but that's the name of the course!  Use her office hours to get help on papers.  Definitely helped develop my writing skills.  Overall, a worthwhile course."
7249,216875,5.0,3.0,"A kind hearted and intelligent woman!!!  I will keep on taking every single class she offers.....she is very understanding, and the subject matters are always engaging in all of her classes."
7250,216875,5.0,2.0,"mme bargach was so awesome- i've taken two classes with her at this point - also 332 - and she has continued to be one of the nicest, most genuinely warm professors i've ever had. she was definitely always prepared for class, and though we'd get a little sidetracked, we learned even when we weren't taking the material straight from the textbook."
7251,216875,5.0,2.0,freakin awesome class and prof!
7252,216875,2.5,3.0,"Definitely knows her stuff about French literature. However, this makes her a pretty hard grader, though maybe some may say &quot;fair.&quot; She is also not very good at explaining the texts. Be prepared to be intimidated in class when she speaks to you in extremely rapid French and expects you to do the same."
7253,216875,1.0,5.0,"Worst instructor I have ever taken - it seems like she is making up the material as she goes along. She does not even have a degree in French. Take a real professor, not some lecturer"
7254,216875,1.0,5.0,"Worst instructor I have ever taken - it seems like she is making up the material as she goes along.  She does not even have a degree in French.  Take a real professor, not some lecturer"
7255,216875,4.0,3.0,"She is a great teacher, and loves it when students come to her office hours. She makes the readings very interesting, and is a fair (as in not easy) grader. She doesnt assign too much work (though I think we wrote longer papers than other 332 classes). I will probably take another class with her, as she is truly a great prof."
7256,216875,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher. I will take as many classes as I can with her. Vast knowledge of literature, culture, and history."
7257,216875,5.0,1.0,"only french prof whose french i can understand; very very nice and grades pretty easy, just show effort.  extremely helpful and enthusiastic in lectures, though sometimes slow and unorganized.  this is one of the classes where you just show up for."
7258,216875,4.5,2.0,"She is absolutely charming, very open and friendly, immensely knowledgeable and considerate. The material is mostly excellent, and the workload is just about perfect."
7259,216875,5.0,3.0,"She's an incredible resource willing to help those who will put in the effort she will.  She DOES speak English, don't take a foreign language if you're going to be enough of an ass to demand English from everyone.  Go with her to Morocco."
7260,216875,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher. I recommend her to every French student. She has a great knowledge of both literature, culture and history. Take as many classes as you can with her."
7261,216875,5.0,3.0,"I did not at all want to take this class, but I am thrilled that I did.  She makes difficult reading easily accessible and comprehensible.  She's charismatic and excellent at involving the class.  All around, an interesting person and a truly inspiring teacher."
7262,216875,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher... Take any class you can with her! Made the subject of French literature extremely interesting, which motivated me to become a French major. This class has improved my knowledge of French dramatically."
7263,216875,4.0,2.0,"I ended up really enjoying this class.  Although it was frequently unclear precisely what the hw was, she was very available.  She grades very fairly, is friendly and willing to help, and doesn't assign too much work."
7264,216875,5.0,1.0,No Comments
7265,216875,5.0,3.0,"She's a great prof, and we had some awesome discussions in her class.  She can be controversial, but she never denies other people's opinions, and she grades very fairly."
7266,216875,4.0,2.0,"She has a great knowledge of French literature, and her passion for the subject is evident during class. She makes great reading selections, and not only helps her students comprehend the literature, but also aids them with their grammar."
7267,216875,5.0,1.0,"Sooo amazing! A real plus for the french dept. Super kind, incredibly helpful, and just all around fascinating. Take her class with confidence!"
7268,216875,3.5,3.0,No Comments
7269,216875,4.5,3.0,"such a great teacher.  she really wants to help her students do well, and she's always available for office hours if you make the effort.  i would definitely take another class with her."
7270,216875,3.5,3.0,"I think she is a good professor, it's a 300-level foreign language class; it is not supposed to be easy.  I want to take her class again."
7271,216875,1.0,5.0,assignments are long and tedious.  she doesn not care about her students.
7272,216875,3.5,4.0,"Mme. Bargach is incredibly friendly and answers any e-mail questions, helpful esp. when you have no way of speaking after class. the course is interesting but some of the analyzing is abstract...a bit hard to know what the homework is, but she is nice"
7273,216875,1.5,5.0,"gives out good grades if she likes you and does not know much about french lit, do yourself a favor and take this class from a real prof."
7274,216875,3.5,3.0,"Mme Bargach is really nice and what she says in class is very interesting. It is unclear how she gives out participation grades since she lectures most of the time and askes really hard questions and no one ever says anything. Overall, a very good class!"
7275,216875,1.0,5.0,One of UVA's worst.  Avoid at all costs.  I learn nothing in the class.
7276,216875,4.5,2.0,"By FREN 332, you SHOULDN'T be speaking English in the classroom.  If you don't understand French, that's your own fault.  Mme. Bargach is brilliant and can add so much to your understand of the historical and social contexts of the stuff you read."
7277,216875,1.5,4.0,"I hate this class, take claire lyu instead and save yourself a lot of reading and needless work"
7278,216875,1.0,4.0,"horrible teacher, i don't understand a thing this woman says, refuses to speak english and doesn't what she is talking about, always late"
7279,216875,4.5,2.0,"i don't know why so many people don't like her...i thought she was great.  i did the reading for the course 5 minutes before class (small reading assignments!)  at least she's a native french speaker. i got an A with little effort, does not grade too hard"
7280,216875,1.5,5.0,"doesn't know any english, you won't learn anything, stay away"
7281,216875,1.0,4.0,"she doesn't speak english, she picks one favorite and everyone else gets bad grades, no one can understand her, never in office hours, bad teacher"
7282,2576174,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, great to have Indigenous voices."
7283,2576174,5.0,2.0,The negative review made me hesitant to take the class but I look forward to it every week! There are few short papers and weekly discussion posts. She also gives us a 24 hours grace period for any assignment. She really engages us in her curriculum to make sure we are learning about things that interests us!
7284,2576174,1.0,1.0,"The least understanding professor Ive ever had, which is especially prudent considering shes an anthro prof :/"
7285,2215733,5.0,4.0,"Mme. Groff was awesome. She was my French 1010 teacher and was nothing but kind and supportive throughout the whole semester. She definitely makes you work for your grade, there was tons of homework, but really she just wanted you to learn the material. She is my favorite language teacher I've had yet. She tries her best to make class fun."
7286,2215733,4.0,4.0,"Mme Groff speaks in French for most of class from the start. This can be overwhelming at first but is actually very helpful. She is very kind and patient and really helps the learning process. As long as you consistently study vocab and work hard in this class you will do well, and maybe even enjoy some of the fun writing assignments and projects."
7287,1486646,4.0,3.0,"One of the preeminent scholars on Ancient Philosophy, this guy knows his stuff."
7288,479048,5.0,4.0,"Truly one of the best professors in the Econ Department. He cares so much about his students and the topic of the course. While the math in the course can be quite difficult, Ciliberto does his best to ensure that the tests are fair and reasonable for the material learned. Highly recommend."
7289,479048,5.0,3.0,Hands down one of the best professors I have ever had. Do not get your Econ major at UVa without taking a class with Prof. Ciliberto!
7290,479048,5.0,3.0,He's a great teacher- so focused on his students and making sure we understand. His excitement about the material shows. I strongly recommend taking your econ classes with cilliberto.
7291,479048,2.5,4.0,"I can't attest to others, but consensus among Economics students seems to place Ciliberto as the best for this course. Mandatory attendance and use of the Socratic method can be annoying, but overall he is a great professor who genuinely cares about his students. Attending office hours and doing practice problems is generally enough to do well."
7292,479048,3.5,5.0,It is a difficult class that involves considerable amount of mathematical equations and problem solving. The midterm and the final exams were very difficult so try to master the concepts and the techniques. The professor is a nice man who loves the material. Be prepared to work hard for this class if you would like to get a good grade.
7293,479048,3.0,5.0,"Hard but interesting, Econ 301 with Ciliberto presents a real challenge to those expecting to breeze through a few more econ classes after 201 and 202. Expects 100% participation and attention in his fast paced lectures. Sometimes hard to follow and take notes at the same time. The tests are near impossible to the average student, the curve helps."
7294,479048,2.0,5.0,"Good lord. This man is easily the worst teacher I have ever had. His lectures are totally incomprehensible. He talks too quickly, expects us all to know the material before he says it. Wastes time watching us struggle plugging in random equations. This class was truly a joke. Do not take this class even if you dominated 201 and 202"
7295,479048,4.0,4.0,good teacher if you listen and come to class
7296,479048,5.0,3.0,"He might be one of my favorite professors at UVA.  All his lectures are very well laid out, he writes everything on the board, and he likes to remind you what &quot;the big picture&quot; is.  His Socratic method isn't half as intimidating as it sounds, and really engages you in the material. He's very friendly, and as far as exams go the curve's pretty nice."
7297,479048,4.5,4.0,"His Italian accent is not bad at all after the first day. He uses the socratic method to stimulate his students' thinking. Exams are pretty hard, but there is a massive curve. I personally did the average on the midterms, but I rocked the final and ended up with an A-. Please go to his office hours if you don't do well on the midterms. He is friend"
7298,479048,3.5,4.0,"Funny man. Approachable during office hours. However, his TAs teach better than him. Your screwed either way, because he is still the best ECON 301 professor UVA has."
7299,479048,1.0,4.0,"He is almost impossible to understand, and visting him in office hours is a complete waste of time. He tells you that he is dissapointed that you got wrong answers, but does not offer in help in preparing you to do better.  He does offer a curve, but I would avoid him.  If he focusses more on teaching and less on learning names, he would be alright"
7300,479048,3.0,5.0,"Don't be fooled, this course is not easy.  They call it the &quot;weedout course&quot; for a reason.  Don't expect much help from the TAs.  Ciliberto can be difficult to understand due to thick Italian accent.  Oh, be prepared cause he teaches via the Socratic method.  Good luck!"
7301,479048,4.5,2.0,"math based...fairly easy, not much time required"
7302,479048,4.0,3.0,"Very kind man. Easy to understand, writes notes of board. Tests can be hard but many questions are directly from homework and book."
7303,479048,5.0,3.0,thought he was great. tough class but he's a really nice guy and i like his teaching style. i recommend him
7304,479048,5.0,3.0,"Very understanding and always willing to talk with students and answer questions until he's sure they understand.  The accent is never a problem in communication.  Fair tests, easy homework."
7305,479048,3.0,5.0,horrible...horrible...his exams are killing  my GPA. he's not friendly to international students even thought he is from Italy..his homework is pretty easy but exams are not that easy.
7306,479048,4.5,3.0,"he's a genuinely nice person. his accent take a couple classes to get used to, but his grading is fair and he's always willing to help"
7307,479048,3.0,5.0,"horrible. if he was to be discussing this material with a colleague, the material would be covered in the same manner.  There is no teaching involved. Hope you can learn from the text cause classes are worthless. You spend more time trying to get to the deduction he made. By the time you do, you are lost with that he's talking about."
7308,479048,3.5,2.0,"Clear lectures, relatively easy exams."
7309,479048,4.5,3.0,"Always willing to help, writes all notes on board, goes over many practice problems, has an accent but easy to understand and get used to, tests are long and sometimes difficult but curve is huge, very nice, interesting professor"
7310,479048,4.0,2.0,Best teacher in economics department! Very friendly. Only an ignorant person wouldn't be able to understand his accent.
7311,479048,5.0,3.0,"Federico was such a nice professor.  It is a hard class because it is a hard subject.  But, Federico is very generous with a curve, and mostly everyone who comes to class where do well.  I recommend Federico."

7313,479048,2.5,5.0,Terrible.  Extremely hard to understand b/c of thick Italian accent.  Does nothing but problems on the board that you can learn much easier in the book.  Take the other teacher.
7314,479048,4.5,3.0,"he is more than willing to help you, know you, teach you; classes are easy to follow and well organized; he always has positive energy; HARd tests but curved by percentile -90% of grade depends on exams though"
7315,479048,5.0,3.0,"awesome! i love this man...he was very clear and wrote down everything you needed on the board. he also tries to relate all concepts to every day life...and ALWAYS willing to help. Tests were hard, and long, but there is a massive curve. the average is a b+!"
7316,2608970,5.0,1.0,She is so nice and teaches an easy engagement and is very passionate about what she teaches
7317,2608970,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Mikkelson is very nice, like extremely nice, and I wish I had her in a real class. Like all Engagements courses, this one's really easy, but you probably won't want to blow it off because Prof. Mikkelson is clearly trying hard to make it engaging. My advice would be to take one of her real classes, but this is a good choice for EE."
7318,2608970,5.0,2.0,"Jane Mikkelson was truly the highlight of my semester. Not only is she incredibly well versed and lead the best discussions, she truly cares for her students and sees the light in each one. If you have the opportunity to take her class, do it ASAP!"
7319,2625358,5.0,2.0,Great professor and knows his stuff. Willing to stay after to answer questions as well. Wish he taught upper-level classes though.
7320,2625358,2.0,3.0,"This class was about 70% math and 30% astronomy facts. Did not expect the amount of math that was required, and we were expected to have some experience but it's an intro course without prereqs. The homework takes forever to complete, and the tests are 10 questions each (mostly math equations). Cool material, but more demanding than I expected."
7321,200532,3.5,2.0,"In terms of getting a perspective on American culture, it was a great class. The beginning of the semester is a bit dry, but if you put enough in you can do well. I got an A+! but then again, I had a good TA"
7322,200532,4.0,1.0,"Its true that Bond mainly lectures from his prepared notes, but his personal insight is life changing. The class is the definition of an enrichment course, he is not trying to test your history knowledge of facts/figures, he just wants you to think about the movement and the world we live in. Don't be afraid by the amount of reading."
7323,200532,3.5,1.0,"I enjoyed this class overall, but Prof. Bond should really try to engage the students more instead of reading straight from his prepared lecture.  May as well be learning it from someone who wasn't part of the movement.  But it's still a good class, and the readings are very good."
7324,200532,5.0,3.0,"Intelligent, approachable, a good speaker. He knows his stuff because he's lived it."
7325,200532,3.0,3.0,"Lectures are very boring.  However, the textbook and reading materials are fascinating and are the only things you need to get through the class.  If you're literate, you can do well in this course; simply read the text and formulate good papers -- go to office hours of your TA!  Talking to Bond outside of class is more rewarding than in class."
7326,200532,4.0,3.0,"The History of the Civil Rights Movement is definitely a worthwhile course. There is A TON of reading, and as a first year I found it quite intimidating. I strongly recommend speed reading the books. I got an A on the final just with that. The papers are decent. I got a B+ on the 1st and an A- on the last. Participation in discussion is key too."
7327,200532,3.5,2.0,"Lectures are boring, as Professor Bond simply reads from his notes.  However, his anecdotes about the Civil Rights Movement are fascinating, and his sense of humor is obvious when you speak to him outside of class.  Every now and then, lectures will include songs, movies or activities, and this helps to break the monotony.  Bond is a primary source"
7328,200532,3.5,4.0,"lectures are a bit dry, but the class is completely worth it. there is a lot of outside work, but not all of it is necessary. and he is great when he stops reading his notes and tells a personal story, or dances to music!"
7329,200532,2.0,3.0,"Don't take this class.  I hated it.  He is an awful lecturer, reading straight from his notes and keeping his head down basically the whole class.  Because he was part of the movement, I thought that it would be interesting to at least be around him and absorb him as a person, but he almost never related his own experiences.  And TOO MUCH reading!"
7330,200532,1.0,1.0,"Terrible. Mas Terrible.  He's a great speaker.  Heinous lecturer.  There is no recognition of why one event connects to another; only through the acknowledgements of the TA.  I hope he doesn't teach.  It's great that he was a part of the Struggle, but his recollection is nothing more than that; no analysis."
7331,200532,2.5,4.0,"Yeah, kind of disappointed by his lectures... he simply reads aloud notes that he prepared at least 10 years ago and hasn't changed much since it appears. A LOT of course depends on the TA because there are 3 grades (2 papers, and a final). This makes it tough as you have no idea what the final will be like until you take it. i'd recommend"
7332,200532,2.0,3.0,"Bond is a fast lecturer which makes it impossible to take notes. Instead of bringing in his own stories and engaging the class, he reads straight from a notebook and barely lifts his eyes to this class. Coursework includes: Two papers, discussion and a final. Picking the right T.A. here is essential: stay away from Nesbit and Jacobs. Class= boring"
7333,200532,3.5,2.0,"Julian Bond is a really nice guy... never tried to go to his office hours, but i heard sometimes he isnt there at all ( just what i heard)... but he is funny, and I had a good TA ( easy grader and knowledgeable about the philosophy involved with the movement)... I didnt read a single page, papers, midterm, and final are easy... i got a B"
7334,200532,2.5,3.0,The ammount of reading required is ridiculous. He reads off of notebooks. Seems like an incredible person but this did not shine through at all.
7335,200532,2.5,3.0,"Bond, lectures entirely too fast it is impossible to take notes. 2 papers, discussion and a final. Class was over rated as a must take at UVA. I disagree with this notion class was bearable."
7336,200532,3.5,2.0,This class is interesting and not very hard.
7337,200532,4.5,2.0,"Excellent seminar, excellent storyteller and really gives a new perspective on the 60s and on civil rights.  At times the 2+ hours in seminar do tend to drag on, but thats just because you're used to 50 minute classes.  Bond really is excited about what he talks about, and is excited to hear what you think...so take this class."
7338,200532,4.0,3.0,"super experience to be with Julian Bond.  He is not just talking about history, he lived it..."
7339,200532,1.0,4.0,Not a good teacher... distorts information to conform to his own political views.  Deviates from reading straight from his notes only to go on tired rants.
7340,200532,5.0,1.0,"Absolutely loved this class. Prof. Bond is such an interesting man, and you can really get to know him well, since the USEM is so small. A lot of times, the discussion would just become like &quot;Story Time with Julian Bond,&quot; and I thoroughly enjoyed his random anecdotes. Spring 2006 will be his last semester at UVA, so if you can, take this class NOW!"
7341,200532,2.0,2.0,"lectures are filled with good stories, but he reads them straight from a piece of paper so they lack emotion. he does give bias information but who can blame him&#63; the class is definitely not hard if you have an organized TA--that's really what it comes down to. it's also not the must-take most people say it is."
7342,200532,4.0,3.0,Worth taking for the fascinating lectures.
7343,200532,4.0,4.0,"Interesting lectures, but it really all depends on your TA. Don't have to take notes on lecture, he goes into real detail that you aren't asked to remember.  A really fun class."
7344,200532,4.5,2.0,Great teacher.  He knows the stuff from first hand experience so it's hard to deny his facts.  Some say he's I bias I just say he's speaking from expereience and knows what hes talking about.
7345,200532,5.0,3.0,"AWESOME. Amazing lecturer. There is no better professory on this topic. He talks fast, but it is largely the details, if you sit back and enjoy, but get the larger picture, you'll have a truely memorable expirence."
7346,200532,1.0,5.0,"Extremely biased, overrated, and dry.  Lectures were incredibly vague, could not make out material.  Avoid at all costs."
7347,200532,2.0,2.0,The MOST overrated class at UVa by far. The entire lecture he just reads straight from his notes that seem like they haven't changed a WORD in years. Completely dry and dull; just one fact after another and yes it is also SO biased and one-sided. Not recommended.
7348,200532,4.5,1.0,"GREAT guy, easy class.  Spoke really fast, but it's ok because the final doesn't include every little detail.  Great class ::thumbs up::"
7349,200532,3.5,3.0,Great teacher...couldbe clearer
7350,200532,5.0,4.0,"(above course number might be wrong, the class was history of the civil rights movement) very informative, good firsthand information, a powerful speaker and a great professor"
7351,200532,4.0,1.0,"Great lecturer with real expererience, not just some idiot who read a few books. 2 papers and a final. Watch the movies if you want, they are helpful but not necessary."
7352,200532,3.0,1.0,Great class.  Expert in the topic.  Funny and interesting lecturer.  Talks too fast to take notes but he knows how to pick good TAs.  Easy papers and easy final.
7353,200532,1.0,5.0,Biased ****! Very unfair... luckily the TAs grade everything!
7354,200532,3.0,2.0,"Horribly biased, speaks to fast to take notes, luckily TA grades easy. A maybe take"
7355,200532,4.5,2.0,"Julian bond is an expert on the Civil Rights movement with personal experience with it, and a great primary source. He is a great speaker, although but occasionally you could tell he clearly has a liberl politcal bias. Two papers (graded by TA) and final."
7356,200532,4.0,2.0,"I made the worst grade I ever made in undergraduate in his class, but I never learned more in my life.  The man is an incredible lecturer, and an American hero.  His class was the only thing that really made my C-ville experience seem worthwhile."
7357,200532,2.5,2.0,"If you like watching movies, ie. 1 documentary over a period of a semester, take this class."
7358,200532,3.5,3.0,Chairman of the NAACP. Learn about the civil rights movement from one of its leaders-Awesome! Difficulty of course really depends on TA.
7359,200535,5.0,2.0,The best teacher ever
7360,200535,5.0,2.0,Murphy was a great professor and I really enjoyed ASTRO 1210!!! It was not too difficult and I felt like I learned a lot. He is obviously very passionate about the topic which led to an engaging lecture. I liked how the class was set up and it is evident he wants you to succeed. I definitely recommend this class to future students.
7361,200535,3.0,4.0,"Murphy eats, sleeps and breathes astronomy and expects you to do the same. If you took this bc you're &quot;not a math and science&quot; person, and need to fulfill an easy requirement, this is not the class for you. Extremely lecture heavy and a ridiculous amount of information to learn. Thank god for participation/homework, bc tests and quizzes are hard."
7362,200535,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Murphy is a really nice guy and good lecturer. He loves the subject. This class is way more difficult than I expected because the quizzes are very specific and challenging. The homework is pretty easy however, and he offers in class questions as a way to bump up your grade. Pretty easy to get a B, but challenging to get an A."
7363,200535,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic course! I took ASTR1210 and ASTR3450 with him, and he was great both times! 3450 Mission to Mars is writing heavy, so beware of that going in, but it's a really fun course. Murphy is a great lecturer. He loves the topics and gets really invested, and if you have him online he has really cute cats. 10/10 would recommend."
7364,200535,5.0,1.0,"I took Mission to Mars the 1st semester it was offered. Murphy is a pretty good lecturer &amp; his lectures were pretty engaging. The homeworks were very simple a&amp;easy, same for the tests. Unfortunately, however, this course didn't have much Mars-related content and was more just about space travel in general. Mars was only really looked at in detail"
7365,200535,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Murphy is a must-take. While the class is a challenge, and you will have to put the time in to understand the concepts, you will be better for it. He is inspirational and a fantastic source of advice and information."
7366,200535,4.0,3.0,"Professor Murphy is a great teacher who makes sure that you learn a lot without the lectures being too overbearingly boring. Be warned, though: the quizzes can err a little bit on the difficult side, so make sure that you take good notes."
7367,200535,5.0,3.0,"Professor Murphy is an amazing professor. He enjoys what he does, and makes the material interesting. I have absolutely no complaints about him. However, the class is harder than it should be. The quizzes are pretty difficult and almost impossible to study for. Getting a B is pretty easy, but the quizzes are brutal."
7368,200535,5.0,3.0,He is awesome and makes the lectures super cool!
7369,200535,4.0,3.0,"Such a nice guy and very passionate about the subject, if you need a science credit and you're a conscience major I would 100% this class with Murphy. Very interesting and I had no previous knowledge "
7370,200535,4.0,3.0,I took astronomy because I wanted an easier science course than biology or chemistry.  Its not too bad if you read the textbook and attend lectures however the quizzes are very tough.  Ask for help and go to office hours if you need to. He is very helpful and better in one-on-one teaching scenario than a 400 person lecture.
7371,200535,4.0,3.0,"He's extremely knowledgeable and passionate about his subject.  The lectures are fantastic, even for non-Astronomy majors.  He's extremely helpful, and has tremendous clarity in lectures.  His quizzes tend to be hard, but taking the class is definitely worth it; it's been a very eye-opening experience."
7372,200535,5.0,2.0,"If you want to take a class with someone who is very passionate about their field, ASTR 1210 with Edward Murphy is the one to take. Wonderful, engaging lectures, and interesting material, I'm very glad to have taken this class. There is weekly homework that goes along with the readings. The exams are challenging, but not bad if you study well. "
7373,200535,5.0,2.0,Professor Murphy is clear and straightforward giving lectures with a good sense of humor. I'm actually doing an astronomy minor inspired by his enthusiasm for astronomy and teaching 
7374,200535,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Murphy is great! If you want to learn about Astronomy, learn it form him. He is clear, entertaining, and fair. Assignments are helpful towards studying for the tests and as long as you went to lecture and read the textbooks the tests are not too bad! "
7375,200535,4.0,2.0,"Lectures are good at explaining things, but if you want to do well you need to read and take notes on the chapters, which are long.  The stuff you learn in general is pretty interesting (even though the book is dry), but don't take this class as a GPA booster.  If you put in the work you can get an A, but you can't just show up and do well."
7376,200535,1.0,5.0,"He wastes time in lecture going on about astronomical events he found exciting rather than covering important material. Also, he makes most of his quizzes based on material covered the exact class before the quiz instead of quizzing students on the material leading up to the lecture right before the quiz. "
7377,200535,4.5,3.0,I highly recommend Professor Murphy.  He is very approachable and helpful.  I struggled in this course and he was always willing to take extra time to explain and review concepts with me.  His lectures are very interesting and he strives to make sure his students understand the material.
7378,200535,3.5,4.0,"Murphy's ""quizzes"" are very challenging. If you're looking for an easy A or an easy math/science requirement, this is not it, although you do pick up some interesting astronomy tidbits along the way. Put in the work by reading the chapters, and you will probably do well. Test questions often come right from Mastering Astronomy."
7379,200535,4.0,3.0,"This class isn't too bad, but I didn't particularly like the class size. Murphy is a really enthusiastic teacher. I didn't know astro was actually going to be so much work. The tests are actually pretty hard, but if you're super excited about astro, then take it with Murphy."
7380,200535,4.0,4.0,"Murphy is a great guy and is extremely passionate about astronomy, however this is not an easy class by any means. I took it thinking that it would help my GPA, but it's actually lowering it. If you are interested in the subject and willing to put in the effort, take this. However, you need to try very hard to do well on the tests."
7381,200535,3.5,3.0,"Murphy is a really nice guy and is adorably dweeby about astronomy, but the actual material is really boring. The online quizzes help a lot when studying for tests, but this class is not an easy A -- you have to put in a lot of work to do well."
7382,200535,4.5,4.0,"You have to study to do well and you have to know the textbook very well. There are probably 3-4 relatively easy math questions on each test, if you understand the equations. Other questions come from the ""Study Area"" from Mastering Astronomy. Murphy is a cool teacher and really knowledgable. Just study! (I expect to receive an A/A- in the course)"
7383,200535,4.0,2.0,"Don't be deceived, you will not be learning about aliens. This class is not difficult, and is kind of interesting. The tests are from material in the book and a few online readings. If you like astronomy, this is a good class."
7384,200535,3.5,2.0,"This class is not as interesting as it sounds - be careful!!! It's not difficult, but it's quite boring. Murphy isn't unpleasant - actually seems like a pretty nice guy! If astro is your thing, go for it."
7385,200535,1.0,5.0,"Dont take this class, its like a vocab class with astronomy terms"
7386,200535,3.0,2.0,"Lectures are long and cover lots of interesting material. It's hard to take notes because he goes through slides quickly. Online homework is most helpful when studying for quizzes, which are 40-50 multiple choice questions. Final is in same format, but longer. Murphy is smart, but this class was a bit more math/physics than I anticipated."
7387,200535,5.0,3.0,"He's a great teacher, I came into the class with a pretty good interest in Astronomy and am now looking at becoming an Astrophysics major.  Tests are tricky but it is because there are parts that are actually application instead of regurgitation."
7388,200535,4.0,2.0,Murphy's a great teacher! He's really passionate about what he teaches and the class is pretty interesting.
7389,200535,5.0,1.0,Prof Murphy is engaging and helpful.  He had us work on our presentational skills while teaching us about a really interesting subject.  He will now be by academic advisor for my stay at UVA.  I highly recommend taking a COLA by him if he offers again
7390,200535,4.0,2.0,"Murphy is a cool guy. He knows what he's talking about and covers everything you need to know in lectures. I stopped reading the chapters because as long as you pay attention in class, you will do well on the quizzes. On quizzes he expects you to be able to apply the material, not just know the facts. Kind of boring, but not very hard."
7391,200535,3.5,5.0,"Class seems very easy during the first couple weeks, then you take your first quiz and you realize that you made a mistake signing up for ASTR 1210. Do not take this class. The quizzes are ridiculous (much harder and more in depth than lecture/homework) and lecture is painful to sit through. Don't take this"
7392,200535,5.0,4.0,Probably one of the best Professors I have had at UVA. I Originally took the class because I needed science credits. However I now am very interested in astronomy and wish I had taken more classes as an undergrad.
7393,200535,3.5,5.0,"If you are not naturally apt in Math/Sci, avoid this class at all costs. He makes the material seem a lot easier than it does on the quizzes. The class average for the three quizzes was always in the D-C range(around 109/150)."
7394,200535,4.5,1.0,Great class! Murphy is a very enthusiastic teacher who really cares about this subject. His 121 and 124 classes are pretty easy (if you attend class) and are very worthwhile.  The tests require studying but if you go to class you won't have to study much. Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in astronomy.
7395,200535,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, makes the lectures very interesting and you can tell he really cares about his students.  He would send out emails to the class letting us know of interesting astronomical events.  Because he's very enthusiastic about his subject, it makes the class very enjoyable.  It's not that hard either."
7396,200535,4.5,2.0,"He's amazing! Don't take astronomy unless you can get him! His tests are pretty hard, but nothing you can't get through and they do take the whole 50 (plus some). Do the labs early because weather can be awful! You do use your textbook some for the online homework but not much."
7397,200535,4.5,5.0,You need to study a whole lot for his tests. 50 minutes isn't enough to fully complete his test.
7398,200535,4.5,2.0,He is awesome!
7399,200535,5.0,1.0,"This guy's name is Eddie Murphy.  He's also a very good teacher, his explanations are easily understood and he repeats everything that's important.  Very enthusiastic too"
7400,200535,5.0,2.0,"Lectures are good because he demonstrates everything and repeats things for emphasis. He'll also keep you updated on space news. His tests may seem harder than lecture, but its only because they are not fact regurgitations. Study applications of the stuff you learn, and you will be fine!"
7401,200535,3.5,3.0,"Mr. Murphy is a decent teacher.  However he doesn't do well in presenting the material in the way that he tests you.  The lectures are mostly easy to understand and then the test comes and everything is much more complicated than any lecture made it out to seem.  By the end of the semester, I dreaded going to this class."
7402,200535,4.0,3.0,"Do not waste your money on the book, you will not crack it once. Murphy is a nice guy with a good sense of humor. Probably need some general interest in astronomy to enjoy his class though; he can make the concepts interesting but can't make you care. Not an easy A, but study for the tests and do the labs early and it's attainable."
7403,200535,4.0,2.0,Decent teacher but could work on delivery of material
7404,200535,5.0,2.0,"This guy rocks! period. You can definitely tell how much he cares about his students and how he wants them to learn. Once, I couldn't study for an exam because of a rehearsal I had had the night before; I explained everything to him and he let me take it on another day. Tests are ok, you only have to pay attention to the class and you'll do fine."
7405,200535,4.0,4.0,great class!  fun and interesting.  Prof Murphy is awesome.
7406,200535,4.5,4.0,Murphy makes astronomy interesting. It's a great class but the tests are more difficult than I expected. Go to class because the book is a waste of time and money.
7407,200535,5.0,2.0,"A truly great professor that is extremely passionate about the subject and teaching.  Going to class and just paying attention is easier than reading the book, as he is very easy to follow and posts his slides online.  Tests were more challenging than I expected, but not terrible: just make sure you really understand the broad concepts."
7408,200535,4.5,4.0,"Professor Murphy was extremely helpful and cared about his students, legit. He brought in some neon tubes one day. He doesn't overuse the laser pointer.  His tests are pretty hard.  Don't bother reading the textbook, just study the slides.  You have to go to class towards the end of the semester as his slides turn into all pictures.  Other than tha"
7409,200535,5.0,3.0,"Murphy is fair, fun, and extremely helpful.  Go to class; he makes it as interesting as possible and it will be worth your while when it's test time.  Probably the best Astronomy professor you can get."
7410,200535,4.5,2.0,"very very good.  really enjoyed the class, very clear, tests were clear and comprehensible.  but study!  it may seem basic but can be detailed.  i greatly enjoyed this class."
7411,200535,4.5,2.0,"interesting class, fair professor, fair grading"
7412,200535,4.0,3.0,"Excellent lecturer and his class was really interesting, but don't underestimate the difficulty an astronomy class can have. His quizzes were really difficult b/c it combined different things that you learned from the class. Highly recommend taking him but make sure you study your stuff.  (3 quizes, 1 final)"
7413,200535,5.0,1.0,Ed Murphy absolutely rocks. He is the coolest man of all time. HIGHLY recommended- you will learn so much from him. Great guy.
7414,200535,5.0,2.0,"Murphy is my favorite professor!  knowledgable, funny, interesting, passionate about the subject!  Don't bother reading (tests are straight from lectures).  I loved this class!"
7415,200535,4.5,2.0,"Great professor with a lot of knowledge and passion for astronomy. Class is more conceptual than mathematical, which can be good depending on what kind of learner you are. Only bad thing is he posts old, irrelevant lectures online, so you really have to go class and take notes. If you attend most of the time you'll be fine."
7416,200535,4.5,2.0,"Best teacher for astronomy, lectures are clear and contain everything needed for the test.  You don't need to buy the textbook for this class.  The class is a little more math based than you might expect.  Overall the class is interesting and you will enjoy Murphey's passion for the subject."
7417,200535,4.5,2.0,"An interesting class. In retrospect, I shouldn't have picked this class (as a non-science person) just for an &quot;easy&quot; class to fulfill my math/sci requirement. tests were not easy. You can tell Murphy knows what he's talking about and he's really interested in what he teaches."
7418,200535,3.5,4.0,this class sucked hardcore. it was really boring & I studied my butt off and did terribly. I'm definitely in the minority though. just beware this class isn't a gut for EVERYONE. murphy was mediocre.
7419,200535,4.5,1.0,"Go to class and stay awake, which is hard but gets easier, and you'll be fine.  Tests all from lecture notes.  Probably will NOT do well if u don't go to class and instead read textbook and online slides."
7420,200535,4.0,2.0,"he was fine, i wasn't interested in the course, but some of his lectures were really cool. the quizzes aren't anything to worry about and the other grades help out."
7421,200535,4.0,4.0,"as a non-science person i thought these tests were really hard but it was still worth taking this course to finish my math/science requirement.  as far as i can tell, he's the best astron. professor...he actually makes this stuff bareable"
7422,200535,4.5,1.0,"The class is really boring but Murphy's very passionate about it so that helps some. If you need to fill a science requirement, definitely take it."
7423,200535,4.5,3.0,Murphy is a good lecturer - very clear powerpoints with all the info you need spelled out. Tests right off the lectures and classroom excercises - study those. Very enthusiastic about his subject and involved in cutting-edge research.
7424,200535,5.0,2.0,"Prof Murphy is wonderful! He's funny and really wants you to do well in his class. He tries hard to make the subject interesting and relevant and goes out of his way to be helpful. The tests can be a little tricky, but not bad. Highly recommended!"
7425,200535,4.0,2.0,"Basically all you have to do is go to class, stay awake during lecture, and briefly review the slides and classroom exercises for tests.  Reading textbook not necessary so long as u go to class."
7426,200535,5.0,2.0,"Extremely knowledgable, good lecturer and interesting material. Pay attention to discussions and review slides online and the class is no problem. I like the updates on current astronomical findings, makes everything more relevant to today. Very nice guy, really tall like everyone says."
7427,200535,5.0,2.0,"He is very enthusiastic about the course and presents the material in a clear manner.  The tests are mildly difficult, but if you attend class and do the classroom exercises it's good.  I am definitely taking his ASTR121 course next semester."
7428,200535,4.5,2.0,"I really enjoyed Murphy's class. He does talk fast; pay attention in class and it's not bad. The quizzes were more difficult than I expected, but not totally ridiculous; sometimes it seems the multiple choice are worth too much. Wants to see his students do well and offers extra credit if needed"
7429,200535,5.0,2.0,"Murphy rules. There are alot of freebie points, but the tests (atleast the last two) are not total pushovers. Subject is very interesting and Murphy is enthusiastic. Don't let the fact that is a giant or that he has power of this mysterious &quot;DARK ENERGY&quot; scare you away."
7430,200535,5.0,2.0,"Overall good.  Gives many chances for easy points, provided you just do the activities.  Approachable, interesting lectures."
7431,200535,4.0,3.0,"he is a good teacher.  lectures can be a bit dry sometimes.  first quiz is easy, but the next two are harder."
7432,200535,4.0,3.0,Class is harder than I expected going into it
7433,200535,5.0,2.0,"Extremely knowledgeable, good lecturer, good humor, and his class is not difficult and quite enjoyable.  Recommended."
7434,200535,5.0,2.0,Mr. Murphy is the MAN. His lecture slides are online.  His quizzes are not bad if you pay attention in class.  Makes class interesting.  He is so freaking tall. He wants his students to do well. Explains things clearly.  Even gives extra credit if the class in general is not doing so well.
7435,200535,5.0,2.0,"Cares a lot about his students and does a great job presenting the material clearly.  One of the two best professors I had in 6+ years of college.  A pretty easy grade as long as you read/go to class.  Also, he's 700 feet tall."
7436,200535,5.0,3.0,Great Job!  Really knows his information and is able to relate it well to those of us who are not rocket scientists!
7437,200535,5.0,3.0,very nice man who tries really hard and obviously cares a lot about his students. perhaps not the most stimulating class but a good choice for humanities majors looking to fulfill requirements.
7438,200535,3.0,5.0,"He is a nice guy and makes an effort to help, but I thought his teaching style was mediocre.  His lecture slides have lots of irrelevant material that makes it confusing when reviewing them, and he talks way too fast to take notes."
7439,200535,5.0,1.0,Very good professor that teaches a very clear and interesting class.
7440,200535,5.0,1.0,you're my boy ed
7441,200535,5.0,2.0,Ed's the man.
7442,200535,5.0,2.0,"Tests entirely from the lectures, and mostly the classroom exercises. Classroom exercises not only help keep you awake, but the tests are partially taken from them. Very clear lectures and not that hard of a class as long as you actually go."
7443,200535,5.0,3.0,"Really dedicated teacher.  Definately harder tests than Tolbert, but likely a better teacher who is very engaging and truly cares about his students.  He encouraged students to write reviews of him online."
7444,1929062,5.0,3.0,I took his introduction to stochastic processes class. He taught it very well considering that it was not only a complicated topic but also an introduction class. Him being accessible outside of class definitely helped. Probably one of the most interesting class I  took.
7445,1929062,5.0,4.0,"I took his Financial Mathematics and I enjoyed it. I definitely learned a lot in the lecture. I always stick around after class to discuss the material with him, and he is always available outside of classes if you need extra help!"
7446,1929062,5.0,4.0,"Mavi's classes were very enjoyable! I took two upper-level math courses with him. The classes were hard since the material itself was tough, but Mavi is fair and caring. If you put in the time and effort into going to his office hours and getting help on homework and material covered in class, you'll be fine! He's very helpful and knowledgeable."
7447,1929062,4.0,4.0,"Professor Mavi was an overall solid professor - took two upper-level classes with him, and although the material was difficult, lectures were easy to follow and homework / projects really hammered home the concepts. Seemed to make himself available outside of class frequently."
7448,1929062,1.5,3.0,"Not a very clear lecturer, will often get caught explaining concepts as if the students have as much knowledge and background as he does. Two tests in the semester; both  were very long. Assignments are easy, but you never see them again so you really have no idea how you're doing until the midterm grade comes back. Don't take 3340 with Mavi"
7449,1929062,1.0,4.0,"So far he has been by far the worst professor I've had at UVa for many reasons. He is very unorganized, he shows up to class consistently 5 minutes late, and has very unclear and generally bad lectures. The resources he posts online aren't helpful as his ""homework solutions"" don't actually show how to do the problem and leave more than half out."
7450,388967,5.0,4.0,"Professor Botchwey is totally approachable and helps us problem solve - lots of critical questions, discussion and (most helpful) summary of 'take homes'. This is not a class where you veg out on facebook - you actually learn!"
7451,388967,5.0,3.0,"helpful professor, friendly. As long as you do your work in her class you will pass. approchable teacher."
7452,388967,1.0,3.0,"very disorganized, little help, bad lectures, no discussion"
7453,388967,4.5,3.0,Innovative and creative professor.  Also very approachable.
7454,2281321,1.0,4.0,This in-class component of the course is awesome: can't say the same about the labs. They take 4-5 hours ish per week and while not necessarily difficult graders are EXTREMELY nitpicky over just anything and everything and the labs ARE TEDIOUS. Submit in a word doc instead of a pdf: -25%. You didn't phrase something exactly how she likes: pray.  
7455,2281321,1.0,4.0,"This class has an insane amount of work. For a one credit class, I spend more time on this class than any other class. Many things that are learned in the class can simply be searched on Google, and the questions on each quiz are extremely redundant. If you are a first semester engineering students taking this class, I pray for you."
7456,2281321,5.0,1.0,Fabulous teacher! I loved the online work and the homework that came along with it. I was really pushed to my limits and i dont regret any of the work! I recommended this class to all my friends in chess club!
7457,2281321,1.0,5.0,"I think I can summarize the voice of everyone on this. Reimers makes mistakes frequently and doesn't handle admitting or correcting them well. Her research on teaching middle school girls explains her manner of speech - it's belittling. Quote of semester, &quot;I taught this wrong, then wrote this graded quiz question, so remember that when answering.&quot;"
7458,2281321,1.0,5.0,If you are going to take this class. DON'T. Save yourself the headache of having Ann Reimers try to teach you dynamics. She does not understand the course content and you will go crazy following her thought process. She learns course content as she teaches it but still insists that she understands it to the point of teaching concepts incorrectly.
7459,2281321,1.0,4.0,"Apparently Reimers' idea of teaching is making you watch hours of decade-old online tutorials. You don't get to skip the things you already know either because she will have quiz questions that essentially ask 'what did the person say at 1'33&quot; of the video?'. I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone but then it's a requirement. So, good luck."
7460,2281321,1.0,4.0,"Honestly, this class shouldn't be taught this way. If there was a lecture, then it would be 10x better. Directions in the assignments can be unclear and very confusing at times. Assignments use materials that are irrelevant."
7461,2281321,1.0,5.0,Absolute trash
7462,2281321,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely terrible... The homework assignments are completely absurd. The concepts you're supposed to learn are somewhat useful, but the way it's forced on you ensures that you won't remember anything useful."
7463,2281321,1.0,4.0,"Extremely sassy in emails, especially when you ask her for help. She is also very disorganized and will change the assignment about 3 times every week between when the assignment was released and due. Don't expect to understand the assignments either, they are almost always above the level of a first semester college student."
7464,2281321,2.0,4.0,"This class is decent for figuring out matlab and excel I guess. I also commend professor Reimers for coming up with the assignments from scratch as it's probably not easy. However, the amount of time I need to spend on these assignments is ridiculous for a 1 credit course. She says they take about 3 hours each, but be prepared to work for 6+."
7465,2281321,1.0,5.0,This class literally has me in tears of laughing at the amount of stupid assignments we are given. Don't bother doing the assignment until the last 36 hours of the week because she'll change the assignment just about every other day. This class is a waste of time and you learn nothing useful or helpful for later engineering classes.
7466,2281321,1.0,5.0,"This class has been the bane of my existence. It is supposed to be a one credit class focused on how to become proficient in Excel and Matlab, however, I find myself spending more time in this class than any other. There is extensive prior knowledge necessary to succeed in this class that is far over the heads of the students. Must be restructured"
7467,2281321,2.0,4.0,"She is a good person and is helpful when you come to her, but the class she runs is extremely unorganized. It started off very easy, but is slowly becoming more and more confusing. Even though this class is only one credit, it's the class I probably have the most work in and spend the most time on. The help sessions run by the TAs are not helpful."
7468,2281321,1.0,5.0,"This class has been an absolute disaster. Students in this class are in their first semester of college. Yet they are expected to have knowledge of linear algebra, advanced material science topics, complex electrical circuits, etc. The instuctions are terrible, and the class is all online and needs good instructions for success to even be possible."
7469,2281321,1.0,5.0,"The assignments are hard to follow, and this class is only assignments (no lectures/labs). They're explained poorly, and can't seem to follow any particular pattern. One second you're doing linear algebra, the next material science. The TAs are often not helpful, as they are not shown the assignment before we are, so they're just as confused."
7470,2281321,1.0,4.0,"This class focuses on teaching MATLAB and Excell, but it fails on every level to do so. As a one credit hour class, the assignments take 6+ hours on average and sometimes 10+ and require outside knowledge for classes likely not taken yet, such as Kirchhoff's Voltage Law. This class is busywork, and the material could be learned better from YouTube."
7471,413551,1.5,4.0,"Hate this class! A lot of other students in the class thought it was easy, but I just couldn't grasp the concepts. He has his own theories about history like he says volunteers not slaves built the pyramids. It was awful. The TA helped..."
7472,413551,3.0,2.0,"This class was easy but very confusing because of the way he teaches and views history. Daily THPs were a pain and some people never got the hang of them. Map quiz every week so you have to go to discussions. Reading the textbook helps, but really only for the map quizzes. No exam, only 2 short papers and 1 long one at the end of the semester."
7473,413551,4.5,3.0,Amazing professor. Anyone interested in either Africa or history should take this class. Totally changes how you view history.
7474,413551,4.5,3.0,Tremendous professor (HIAF 201). Took the class 2nd year and it totally revolutionized the way I think about history and how I write about it. One of the best classes you can take. Wow!
7475,413551,4.5,2.0,"HIAF 201 and also HIAF 341. He's awesome. Knows his stuff. A little hard at first but once you get his drift, you'll enjoy the class. Super approachable. By far the best classes I've taken at UVA and by far, I mean by faaaaaar, the best professor the school has"
7476,413551,3.5,3.0,"Be ready for a completely new way of thinking about history.  This class took some getting used to, but it makes a better writer and thinker.  Miller is very nice and helpful but the lectures can be difficult to grasp if you don't take good notes.  You pretty much have to go to every class to do well.  I would recommend this class."
7477,413551,2.5,2.0,"I was tricked by the positive comments on this site. sure, he's a nice guy, but that doesn't make a good teacher. You can get away with not doing all of the reading, but it is not worth sitting thru class to get an easy-ish grade. Go take something else with a teacher who gives more organized lectures. Also, there are summaries to write every class"
7478,413551,4.0,4.0,"THE MAN. I repeat: Joseph Miller is The Man. I came into the class as a student from Ghana, expecting to be correcting some professor about his view of African History. I found myself questioning weather the history I'd learnt  was worthwhile at all!!! You will be stretched beyond your wildest imagination , if only because he goes off topic."
7479,413551,4.5,5.0,"Joseph Miller is a great professor who will teach you to approach history in an entirely different manner, and also force to write more clearly and concisely.  You will learn a ton in his class, but give it time.  It took me a while before I understood his historiography and writing, but it was very much worthwhile.  Some extraordinary reading here"
7480,413551,4.0,2.0,"Best class I've ever taken at UVA. By far the most intellectually stimulating; changed the way I view history and historical stereotypes forever. Mr. Miller is amazing!! Only advice is to make sure you take notes on the readings, it will help!"
7481,413551,5.0,2.0,"not for everyone, this class rocked my world.  loved miller.  recommend office hours..."
7482,413551,1.5,3.0,"No clear outline for any of his lectures. His &quot;plan&quot; was to get to class and go off on as many tangents as possible. Daily &quot;take-home&quot; points were giant pain in the ass. Once thought his phone was vibrating, but later declared it as the &quot;excitement in his pants&quot;. wtf&#63; avoid this class."
7483,413551,2.5,2.0,"While it was clear Prof. Miller was knowledgable and intelligent, he often had trouble articulating his point and communicating with his students. His class often alternated between being challenging and extremely elementary. Not too hard, though."
7484,413551,4.5,3.0,Miller is a wonderful professor and one of UVA's most distinguished faculty.  His class forever changed the way i think of history.  He is a GENIOUS.  He LOVES undergrads and will talk to you outside of class for hours!
7485,2412402,3.0,4.0,Prof. Schauss was okay. Very monotone lectures that didn't really help you learn. You ended up mostly teaching yourself from the book. Office hours were somewhat helpful.
7486,2412402,4.0,4.0,"Schauss is a good lecturer. He can sometimes move too quickly, but learning from him is all in all an enjoyable experience."
7487,2633591,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING class. Learned how to write creatively and felt like I was seen as a writer, and challenged in all the right ways. Super caring and wants you to improve as a writer. DIY was a super interesting topic and let everyone write about their own personal passions. If you show you want to learn/improve and writing reflects effort, easy A and so fun"
7488,2633591,4.0,2.0,barely any hw besides 3 essays and in class discussions are super chill
7489,2633591,5.0,2.0,Michelle is the sweetest professor ever. I took ENWR with her and she cares so deeply for all of her students and really wants to see us succeed! She is absolutely the best.
7490,2633591,5.0,3.0,"Michelle is my favorite! My ENWR theme was DIY, and she's the most caring, sweet, friendly professor ever. Gives feedback on every post, so willing to answer/talk outside of class time for thorough genuine help. I wish I could have her every semester she's a gem. Let's you be creative, content &gt;technique. Good grading, sane # of papers. A joy!"
7491,1494907,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher. Native French speaker that doesn't know English so her classes are all in French, but it really helps with your understanding of the language and she is easy to understand. Smoking hot too. Tests aren't difficult if you study, and she is very lenient with turn in dates. Loved this class."
7492,2297730,5.0,2.0,"Prof Flood did a great job presenting the history of work and capitalism then giving us applicable lessons for our job search. You get the anthropology side of things for a short lecture, then learn skills like resume building and interviewing. Participation is key but everything is useful for real life. A very enjoyable professor and fair grader."
7493,331658,3.0,3.0,Professor is clearly very passionate about her subject and I found many of the readings quite interesting. The readings are super hefty though and she does tend to ramble a lot in lecture. Make sure you have a good TA otherwise the labs can get pretty complicated (there aren't many though)
7494,331658,3.5,2.0,The class is easy but the lectures are BORING!! This class is dry and uninteresting. I would not recommend it unless you have to take it. There are so many other classes at UVa that are more interesting and still get you an easy A if that's what you're looking for. 
7495,331658,3.5,4.0,"She rambles on a fair amount in lecture, DO THE READINGS. I cannot stress this enough. Class is fairly challenging if you do not, and I speak from experience."
7496,331658,4.0,3.0,Prof very passionate and knowledgeable about subject. You must must must do the readings and study your notes for the exams. Recommend
7497,331658,4.5,2.0,Interesting topic and professor who loves what she teaches and knows what she is talking about but kind of boring which makes the lectures kind of tough.
7498,331658,4.0,3.0,"Nice prof. The class wasn't bad, kinda boring though.  She's not the best lecturer and I feel like the class could have been a lot more interesting.  The tests are very detail oriented.  Know the textbook and the bolded vocab terms really well. That's where a lot of the test questions come from."
7499,331658,3.5,3.0,laviolette knows her stuff and it's obvious that she enjoys what she's teaching. it's important to do the readings and go over her power points. the tests ask really specific questions which make them tough but she tries really hard to give you as many points as she can. discussion sections are the saving grace for this class.
7500,331658,4.5,2.0,"she's a really nice lady! she usually teaches anthro archeology classes, but i had her for a usem. it was on modern africa through film, so we watched an african movie every week and read a chapter and then wrote an essay about it. it was very fascinating because i am interested in africa. it's very possible to get an A if you just do the work."
7501,331658,2.5,1.0,LaViolette is very friendly and talkative. She is interested in her students and she cares a lot about Africa.  She spent time doing anthropological work in Africa and refers to that frequently.  She does not grade harshly.  Sometimes she rambles off topic.
7502,331658,4.5,4.0,"Fantastic woman. Obviously knows/cares a lot. If archaeology is not your thing, maybe you won't enjoy it. But if you read the books and come to class you'll definitely do well. I was really sick the night before the first midterm and she told me to not even think about it til i was better, and let me do it 3 days later no prob. Lovely woman."
7503,331658,5.0,2.0,"She is very clear in explaining terminology and how it is applied so technically you will get what you need out of taking this class from her.  Her personal work shown confused and bored some b/c it didn't get connected to what we read.  Otherwise, she is understanding and helps you.  Don't expect her to coddle you though. Overall a good teacher."
7504,331658,4.0,2.0,Should be an easy A if you do the readings thoroughly. She follows the class syllabus very well and you will know what she is talking about if you did your readings.
7505,331658,5.0,2.0,I really like her class!  Her teachign style is pretty simple and easy to follow.  Make sure you do the readings because a third of the exam needs them.  Her grading is fair and she makes sure the students are focused on the important things.  She brought in slideshows a couple times to show her own personal work in Africe to give us a beter sense of what the field is like.
7506,331658,5.0,3.0,"Interesting teacher who cares about her subject and makes it interesting.  Helps if you area already interested, as it can get a little technical.  Really cool as a prof and a person.  Some people say she can be a bit harsh, but it's more that she's fair, which is good."
7507,331658,5.0,3.0,"so awesome, she's excited about what she teaches and is great to talk to after class"
7508,331658,4.0,3.0,"I enjoyed the class but tests were far too long -- she expected tons of in depth material on all short answers -- attending lecture is a must, reading the book is beneficial but not nearly as much as good lecture notes  -- just write more than necessary on the tests and you should be okay"
7509,331658,4.0,3.0,"She's a nice enough lady, but her classes are a little dry. not too hard though."
7510,331658,4.5,1.0,"very easy, go to class and take the hints she clearly gives you.  If you read the book and go to lecture there is no reason why you shouldn't get an A.  She is very understanding, when I broke my wrist before an exam, she gave it to me take home so i coul"
7511,331658,4.5,1.0,"I found the lectures interesting. She knows her stuff, and is always helpful."
7512,331658,1.5,4.0,"Sarcastic, boring, unclear, and a know-it-all in the WORST way.  GET OUT of her class if you still have the chance!"
7513,331658,1.0,4.0,Mean and not understanding
7514,1847185,5.0,3.0,Great guy! Super helpful and really cares about his students. Would take another class by him any day.
7515,1847185,5.0,2.0,Jacob really cares about his students and about his subject. He's very enthusiastic and a genuine guy. He tells you straight up what to expect on graded assignments and is lax about some assignments that the department overall is strict about. He's great and makes Italian pretty easy to learn!
7516,1847185,5.0,3.0,"Nice guy, very positive energy."
7517,2060186,4.5,1.0,"Easy class, very great, nice, and helpful professor."
7518,307103,4.0,4.0,"Took me half a semester to warm up to her, but she genuinely cares about her students. There is so much reading for an introductory seminar, and it's super dry but do not skip it. Professor Wong WILL call on every student in a small class. She's definitely not for everyone, but as long as you put in the effort you'll do well."
7519,307103,4.0,4.0,"There is quite a bit of reading required for this class. If you don't read, you absolutely will be at a disadvantage. Professor Wong is direct and straightfoward with expectations and will help you if you ask and know what you're talking/asking about. A lot of the responsibility for learning in this class falls on you. You have to work for it."
7520,307103,1.0,2.0,"She can be antagonistic to students. Thinks she's clear on her criteria, but there's so much she doesn't specify. Troublesome to ask questions. Interrupts participation and presentations constantly. The readings were the only part somewhat worth the course, and even then, it's not worth it."
7521,307103,2.0,4.0,"absolutely terrible class and terrible teacher and should be avoided at all costs. i am an art history major and normally make very good grades in art but not this class. final is worth 47%. exams essays given in advance but images are random and unpredictable. class will put you to sleep. terrible teacher, terrible class. terrible decision."
7522,307103,2.0,3.0,"Professor Wong seems nice but she grades harshly. If you're not an art history major, don't expect an A. You don't really have to go to class but if you do, remember to take a pillow, because you will fall asleep. But all in all, the class wasn't that bad, sometimes boring but not a lot of work"
7523,307103,1.0,5.0,"this woman is so sarcastic it is unbearable, no social skills what so ever, grades harshly. She also never specifies the grading on each and every assignment or exam, for example she will just give you a &quot;B&quot;, which could be 83-88, but depending on how much she dislikes you she will  give your final grade based on her personal preferences"
7524,307103,3.0,4.0,"two essays (one comparison, one research) for 30%, two quizzes 10%, midterm 30%, final 30%. i dont know any japanese, so memorizing all the names is a ****, and there are wayyy to many buddhas. tough to do well. i'm a A-/B+ student, and i have a B-. prof. wong is nice, but difficult to understand, esp from the back. soft voice. dull in class."
7525,307103,1.5,4.0,"She speaks so softly that in a dark room in the afternoon you can't help but fall asleep. The slides for the exams will be 6 ceramics and 4 paintings when you study 90% paintings. Also, even though it is East Asian art history, she spends all her time on China. 2-3 classes on Japan, about 1/2 a class on Korea. Also, she doesn't post slides online."
7526,307103,4.0,3.0,"I also think she's very knowledgeable, fair, and has a soft voice, but I found the midterm to be hard, maybe b/c I didn't do well, but I studied a lot and had trouble memorizing all the slides. I know for a fact that the art history majors did a lot better than me, but coming into this class as a inexperienced first year, I had a lot of difficulty."
7527,307103,4.0,3.0,"She's very knowledged about the topic and really goes in depth. Her tests aren't too hard and the reading is not that difficult. She does talk very softly though, and when the lights go down its really easy to fall asleep, so watch out for that."
7528,307103,3.0,3.0,She's a very good professor and knows her stuff well. The readings are also fair. But the second she turns down the lights and starts talking (because she's got a soft voice) you go to sleep.
7529,307103,2.5,4.0,"i could not hear or understand what she was saying. Very lulling, i slept in every class."

7531,307103,4.5,4.0,"Such a cutie!  You will work hard for this class, but Professor Wong is a fair grader and a helpful teacher."
7532,2396070,2.0,4.0,"Terrible at communicating material. Spends most of the class silently writing equations on the board. Everything is take home though. 3-4 problem sets, a midterm, and the final each account for a third of the grade. Very difficult questions, but generous curve at the end. Worth taking it with him for the take home tests and the curve"
7533,2543532,3.0,3.0,"He's a super passionate and is extremely knowledgeable in the course material. He takes attendance every day so you can't really afford more than 2 skips. He gives lot of group work and group projects which can be annoying in the media studies curriculum. Good professor, bad class."
7534,1101741,5.0,1.0,He was a wonderful and great teacher and mentor!
7535,1101741,5.0,3.0,Great class!
7536,1101741,5.0,1.0,He is a great teacher!

7539,995253,5.0,5.0,"Great class! SO interesting, was sorry to see the course end. Now I am a die-hard fan of gender and film.  Great professor who loves what she is doing and cares about students really learning."
7540,995253,5.0,5.0,"Great class, best in media studies. Amazing professor, very concerned for students, organized, and eloquent. Please keep her!"
7541,995253,5.0,5.0,"Great class, one of the best I've taken at UVA. Recommend it. Professor very knowledgeable and organized. Made learning fun."
7542,995253,5.0,5.0,"Wasn't that interested in the topic before, but this class changed my life. Highly recommend it. The professor is so interested in what she is teaching that it's infectious, in spite of myself I became interested."
7543,995253,5.0,5.0,"This professor is among the best I've had at U Va. Please keep her! She really cares about the students and gives one of the most brilliantly organized courses I've had, teaching really important material to a wide range of students."
7544,995253,5.0,3.0,"LOVED this class, and she really sparked my interest in Media Studies and gender studies. great professor, really cares about what she's teaching."
7545,995253,2.0,4.0,"Attend her class - even if it's life or death. She never accepts absences. Incredibly unreliable and unresponsive. Picks favorites. Only take the class if you're a die hard fan of the subject. Otherwise, it's not worth subjecting yourself to her."
7546,995253,1.5,3.0,she was really knowlegeable but also really flaky
7547,995253,3.0,3.0,No Comments
7548,765878,3.0,3.0,Subject is hard to get the hang of and his voice just puts you to sleep. You are going to have to teach yourself everything which is tough if you aren't great at math. Have a solid study group ready or take someone else
7549,765878,4.5,1.0,"He's a really nice guy, and a pretty good teacher. Clearly understands the material and presents it well, if a bit slowly. Goes over homework problems in class if you ask, and gave me a lot of points back on quizzes and tests when I asked. Highly recommended."
7550,765878,4.5,4.0,"Very friendly teacher.  The subject matter in 212 is not necessarily very easy, but Prof. Thurneck is very interested in making sure you understand.  He occasionally makes mistakes while doing problems on the board but what math teacher doesn't&#63;  Very friendly guy.  Recommended"
7551,765878,5.0,3.0,Very methodical and organized explanations of multivariable calculus concepts.  He will never leave you in the dark and he always answers questions satisfactorily.  The grading is fair and the tests reflect what you learn.  Homework not graded or due but necessary to finish to get a good grade.  Attendence is not taken.  Excellent professor!
7552,765878,5.0,3.0,"Good teacher, explains things well."
7553,856003,1.0,1.0,"if the A school shut down, this guy would be out on the street without a job. his qualifications and work are questionable. how can you take his critique serious when he hasn't done anything himself."
7554,856003,1.0,4.0,I can see how he got where he is....it's obvious stat.
7555,2625496,5.0,2.0,"His class on cats offered a great perspective and introduction into the ethics world. I liked how caring and friendly he was for us and the discussions he fostered were very natural. It had a good amount of reading, but it is all very doable."
7556,2625496,5.0,2.0,"Professor Chen did a phenomenal job in teaching this Engagements course. Although the class was reading heavy, it was incredibly rewarding, relevant, and informative. I felt as though my thoughts and perspectives were being recognized and valued by Professor Chen and the learning environment that he created. Plus, he's funny and his cats are cute."
7557,2502634,5.0,3.0,"Professor Nieves was one of my favorite professors this semester. The curriculum for Spanish 2010 is pretty much the same across all of the 2010 professors. She is a sweet woman that truly cares about her students. During class, she was engaging and funny. I really recommend taking SPAN 2010 with her."
7558,528366,4.5,3.0,very helpful and enthusiastic.
7559,528366,4.5,4.0,"Intimidating at first. It seemed that he was on something and that his goal was to make life miserable. But over time he softened up. He is truly passionate about the subject which is by nature hard to teach; he does a fairly decent job, especially with interval training and rhythmic stuff. Enjoyable once you get used to things."
7560,528366,3.0,3.0,"You really get out what you put in, there are a lot of bitter people in the class that try to make excuses for not practicing and try to blame it on the teacher...how do I know&#63; I've done it too. It is really good if you want to train your ears."
7561,528366,1.5,3.0,"He is extremely arrogant and unhelpful.  The class was very disorganized, and he would throw random material at us to read or transcribe that was way beyond our level but didn't teach us or allow us to build gradually up to a higher level.  I learned nothing and this class was a waste of time."
7562,528366,4.5,3.0,"Enthusiastic about subject, allows plenty of time for student discussion, diversity of reading and listening materials, responsive to personal concerns."
7563,528366,4.0,3.0,"Loren is an amazing individual.  Plus, he can crank out a mean Bangles."
7564,528366,1.0,5.0,terrible. worst ta EVER.
7565,528366,1.0,5.0,"HORRIBLE TA.  He should be kicked out of the University for the quality of his teaching, or lack thereof. How do people this inane get into UVa&#63;&#63;&#63;....Stick with Michael &quot;Moore&quot; Bishop as your TA if you want to take the History of Jazz class."
7566,528366,1.0,5.0,"Graded all the midterm essays based only on grammar/diction, instead of the amount of historical material used and the quality of the argument. He's a huge jerk, especially when you come late to class even though he doesn't show up half the time. You learn nothing in the discussion. He's bald."
7567,528366,1.0,5.0,"terrible, i dont get anything out of the disc class.  terrible grader on the papers, seems like he takes off points whenever he feels like.  all we do is listen to songs during class and while that is important for this class, he doesnt do much to help us learn the details of the song.  terrible."
7568,880626,1.0,5.0,Not bad
7569,880626,5.0,5.0,"This professor is AMAZING, not only is he incredibly intelligible- he is HILARIOUS. He has that type of sarcastic humor that makes everything seem funny. Yes he can speak fast at times, but honestly I'm just more amazed at the stuff he's spitting out when he speaks. I'm amazing by how informed and smart he is. I hope that it rubs off on me."
7570,880626,4.0,4.0,"A fantastic professor. He talks very fast, so I had a hard time keeping up with the notes. He is VERY funny."
7571,880626,4.0,2.0,"Germano is very poetic and really knowledgable. Pretty good about making the class interesting, tends to go off on tangents which always made me laugh. Kind of on another wavelength. Not all the readings are necessary by any means. Eva (TA) grades easily. I loved this class, it was interesting and Germano is hilarious."
7572,880626,2.0,4.0,"Germano rambles and says a whole lot of words without really saying anything useful. The readings don't make any sense. The class is interesting, but not at all what I expected."
7573,880626,3.5,1.0,"Germano was a great professor, as was my TA (Geoff).  There was a lot of reading but to be honest, you don't have do do all of them to do well.  If you show interest, the TA's are willing to help you get a better grade via all sorts of extra credit. Germano is extremely knowledgeable and also very sarcastic. I found his lectures to be entertaining."
7574,880626,4.0,3.0,"A great professor who really knows what he's talking about. He's incredibly well connected and hardly ever actually lectures, so if you have the chance to take a class with him do so! My TA was great and the essays weren't bad, even if there was a ton of reading."
7575,880626,2.0,4.0,"Class had WAY too much reading and the final paper was way TOO LONG! Lectures were interesting but rambling and sometimes incomprehensible. But, I do think he had a lot going on which contributed to that. I had grea expectations and was exteremely disappointed."
7576,880626,2.5,4.0,"In my opinion, lectures were kind of boring and repetitive. Extremely knowledgeable man, and passionate about what he teahes, just not enough to hold my attention for the entire lecture. No tests, just three papers."
7577,880626,4.5,4.0,"David Germano was one of the first westerners to visit Tibet after the end of the cultural revolution. He has gone there at least once a year since 1986 so you can be sure the things he teaches are relevant to Tibet today. His lectures are great because they incorporate American analogies to Tibetan tradition . He is known to go off on tangets,cool"
7578,880626,5.0,3.0,A little absent-minded but in a funny way. Has lots of first hand experience with subject. Makes lectures accessible to students who know nothing about subject. Helps to have some background in Buddhism though. No in-class exams - just 3 essays.
7579,880626,5.0,3.0,"This guy is great to listen to and learn from.  Lectures are inventive and fun to go to and you still learn something.  Will make time to see any student outside of class to help them.  Overall, one of the best teachers I have had at U.Va. without a doubt."
7580,1052673,1.0,5.0,"Not a good teacher, way to strict, not for anyone, mean."
7581,1052673,4.5,3.0,amazing teacher and such a babe
7582,1052673,5.0,3.0,"Paloma is a wonderful teacher! She's from Peru but very easy to understand and very patient with her students. There's a decent bit of homework but there is in any foreign language class. She's not a really hard grader, she's very fair. She's also extremely helpful during office hours. One of my favorite teachers I've ever had."
7583,1052673,4.5,3.0,"She is a fairly good teacher. Very good in office hours (she will personally give you handouts and study aids that are not given in class) and encourages participation. Returns graded work promptly and there are always ways to make up a bad quiz. Online homework is a annoying, but extremely critical for doing well in the class (especially the final"
7584,1691650,5.0,3.0,"Incredible lecturer! Makes 2 1/2 hour seminars go by so fast, very dynamic and gives great feedback. Helped me completely rethink how I view the world, amazing professor."
7585,1691650,3.0,2.0,"Thick accent but you get used to it, he's very well spoken. Obviously passionate about the subject but class is scattered concerning material...I really don't know what's going on in it half the time!"
7586,1396746,5.0,4.0,"Extremely organized, conscientious professor.  This class is for those that actually want to be challenged- it is difficult- but WELL worth it.  Easily the most satisfying course I've ever taken.  And hardest, too!"
7587,1396746,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Kessler has very standards and you will work hard in his class. The workload is intense, but it is well worth the effort. Dr. Kessler is very supportive and easy to contact. You will be a better writer and deeper thinker after taking his course. Do not take his class if you are looking for an easy A."
7588,1396746,5.0,4.0,"He is the most dedicated professor you will ever have. You will get out of his class whatever you put into it.  The material isn't hard, but there is a wealth of information, and then some. If you want to be intellectually stimulated and want a course you will never forget, this is the course to take."
7589,1396746,5.0,5.0,"Glenn Kessler is the hardest working teacher I have ever had. He cares so much about his students. He constantly asks for  feedback on how he can improve the class. He is determined to include each student. Yes, he gives alot of work and you learn alot. Fantastic professor."
7590,1396746,1.0,5.0,Whatever you do - Do not take his class.  He is the hardest prof. that UVA has to offer. It is insane the amount of work he requires his students to do.  I and 3 other students ended up dropping the class b/c it was that bad.
7591,1970187,4.5,1.0,"Hafen was awesome! Apparently, Child Psych is tough with another professor but he made it very easy to a point where it was basically common sense. His exams are straightforward and aren't tricky at all. Would definitely take the class if he's teaching it again."
7592,1970187,4.5,1.0,"Hafen was a fantastic teacher. I had a much easier time with this class than a lower level psych class. He gives great examples and his lectures are interesting. You can earn extra credit by going to all of them and filling out his survey questions. Fantastic class, and he was a first time professor!"
7593,872467,4.0,3.0,"Stangl's lectures were really interesting and really useful. Everything she said and put on the board in class was on the tests, so if you don't understand the readings, attend lecture and you'll be set! One of the most thought provoking classes I've had."
7594,872467,5.0,3.0,"She manages to make philosophy fun and interesting! She would sometimes spend the whole class just answering questions to make sure the students really understood everything. I didn't do any of the readings because she explained everything so clearly. Tests and papers were graded pretty harshly, but I feel like I learned a lot in there."
7595,872467,4.0,3.0,The lectures were very interesting and clear. You could get away without doing the readings because she goes over the information you need very thoroughly. It was not easy to do well in the class because all grades were papers or essay tests that the TAs grade very subjectively. Overall I recommend the class.
7596,872467,2.0,1.0,The most worthless lecture I have ever been to. Do not take this course. Seriously. It's terrible. The TA saved it for me.
7597,872467,4.5,2.0,Stangl is phenomenal. She is the best teacher in the philosophy department and  easily one of the best at UVA. I only took this class because another class of mine got cancelled the day before school started and this was the only class open. I couldn't be happier that happened!
7598,872467,4.5,2.0,"Stangl is amazing. I had little interest in philosophy and am now looking to major in it. The lectures AND TOPICS are not only clear, but interesting and the readings are aren't too long or heavy, especially for what you'd expect in a philosophy class. Get Ben Richards as a TA and your semester is made."
7599,872467,4.5,2.0,"Stangl got me interested in Philosophy because she is good at making lectures easy-to-understand and accessible. She's also very helpful at office hours! I was really happy with this class, and Stangl made it fun. There are 3 papers, a midterm, and a final (which are both 2-3 essays)."
7600,872467,3.0,3.0,The Second half of the class is much easier than the first so if you get through the dense Aristotle/ Kant you will be fine.  Some of Stangl's lectures are absolutely unbearable but others are okay.  With that said as long as you skim the readings and are very attentive in the discussions you will be fine.
7601,872467,4.0,1.0,"Definitely my favorite class so far. She does go on the occasional tangent, but overall I think the examples (however trivial or simplistic they appear) are fantastic for making dense theories more relatable. She also posts ultra helpful study guides for the exams. Definitely understand the reading but skimming is sufficient in most cases."
7602,872467,4.5,3.0,"Stangle teaches clearly and thoroughly and uses examples that are often criticized for their simplicity or irrelevance. However, this is untrue. If anything, her examples clarify dense Aristotelian and Kantian concepts. She's a phenomenal professor. I highly recommend taking her class."
7603,872467,3.0,2.0,Class was really easy but putting up with Stangl's lectures for an entire semester was painful at best. She has a bad habit of going off on tangents that shes convinced are really funny (like talking about her cats for a half hour)
7604,872467,4.5,2.0,"Moderate amount of reading that you should probably skim through before class, though she mostly goes over the important points during lecture.  An interesting class in my opinion and she is rather knowledgeable and personable.  There seem to be only 3 grades as far as written work, so reading is necessary for papers."
7605,872467,2.5,3.0,"lecture is annoying at best; her public speaking gives you that uncomfortable feeling of being embarrassed for someone else. while the topic was interesting, listening to stangl stutter and giggle about it ruined the class for me"
7606,872467,2.5,3.0,"Going to lecture is pointless. If you go, you will be bored to tears and put to sleep, she is not the best public speaker. There are 3 papers, a midterm, and a final. The midterm and final are like reading quizzes and she posts a study guide with all possible questions of toolkit. The difficulty level of this class really depends on your TA"
7607,872467,4.5,2.0,"Very smart, funny, and good philosopher.  Great lectures, but allows students to take control of discussion too often, in my opinion."
7608,872467,3.5,2.0,Overall a good class to take.  She really summarizes the reading in her lecture slides and goes over the essentials.  Get a good TA because they do all of the grading.
7609,872467,5.0,2.0,"Very clear, balanced, engaging lectures. Moderate reading load. Very enthusiastic and sweet person. She is my role-model. Very smart too."
7610,872467,3.5,1.0,"Class is incredibly easy. Comprehensive study guides for midterm and final, and neither reading nor attendance mandatory. Papers a big part of grade but are graded easily."
7611,872467,4.5,3.0,"Rebecca is a fun teacher! She's not super awesome, but she definitely loves what she teaches and makes you interested in it too.  She explains things really well and offers lots of viewpoints on everything.  REALLY interesting class!"
7612,872467,5.0,2.0,"Excellent teacher - i loved this class! She was very energetic and approachable. Summerizes main points of readings in lecture, which is helpful, but must do the readings for a good grade on papers. Encourages discussion and often uses amusing examples to emphasize her points. I highly recomend taking this or any class by her."
7613,372772,5.0,5.0,"Hilarious, engaging teacher; brutal, obscenely difficult material and tests. The only UVA CS professor I've ever had who TRULY expects you to know your crap backwards and forwards, both on the theory and implementation in code."
7614,372772,3.0,3.0,"Grimshaw is the worst professor I have ever seen. He is not serious about teaching and grading. I am in his Operating System class this semester, basically he assigned us to write 28 paper reviews but he only graded 13 of them. He does not need to prepare for teaching, because every student need to do two in-class presentations on average."
7615,372772,4.5,3.0,"Prof Grimshaw is the most down-to-earth professor I've had, really funny and also very knowledgable.  I strongly recommend his classes."
7616,372772,5.0,1.0,"Good teacher, approachable, class was very easy, i went to half the lectures, didnt read anything in the book and still got an A. definately take this class."
7617,372772,1.0,4.0,"Took this class years ago, still have bad memories. He used to laugh when people screwed up. Ha ha."
7618,1273896,3.0,4.0,Professor Broyles was excellent at being available outside of class and was extremely helpful during office hours. He's very understanding of students' heavy workloads and is lenient with deadlines. A lot of reading and frequent pop quizzes.
7619,1273896,4.0,3.0,"His 9am ENWR was definitely one of my favorite classes of my semester. He really knows what he's talking about and is great at guiding discussion. Always extremely helpful during office hours and it's always best when you come prepared, but he'll be able to help guide you in the right direction when you're stuck. He's truly great and intelligent!"
7620,1273896,5.0,3.0,"Best class ever. He's very fair with his grading and understands when you are in a difficult situation and can't turn an assignment in on time. He makes 9ams fun and exciting and I actually look forward to going to his class in the mornings. Even though the topic seems weird, he makes it so interesting  and relevant. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

7622,389160,5.0,3.0,Professor Lyu is such a kind and caring professor. She gives amazing feedback on papers and genuinely wants to help you get better with your French. I would highly recommend taking her class.
7623,389160,3.0,5.0,She is very nice but her class is difficult
7624,389160,5.0,2.0,extremely caring and well-spoken. her french is impeccable and she always offers the best insights. this class/madame lyu have made me fall in love with french poetry and literature!
7625,389160,5.0,3.0,"She is one of the best professor I've ever had. She can be tough sometimes but show her effort and improvements, you'll get a lot out of her course."
7626,389160,1.5,4.0,"i write a rough draft. she gives it a terrible grade.  i go to see her in office hours, and she tells me i'm terrible in french and don't understand how an essay works.  thanks for the encouragement."
7627,389160,4.5,4.0,I took two upper-level French classes with Mme Lyu and wish I could've taken more.  Her passion for poetry is evident and contagious.
7628,389160,2.5,4.0,"If you're into poetry, this is a good class.  Lyu is nice, and you'll still learn some stuff."
7629,389160,1.0,4.0,No Comments
7630,389160,4.0,3.0,"wonderful and very knowledgeable! She emphasizes the process of learning, not the answers. The key to success w/ her is showing how much you've improved. Lots of work in beginning of semester with poetry, less with plays and novels."
7631,389160,4.5,3.0,"Simply awesome. Really pushes you to succeed, and gives you plenty opportunity to do so. Recommended!"
7632,389160,5.0,3.0,She is wonderful. Very sweet. Highly recommended.
7633,913451,3.5,2.0,"Most people are taking this class merely to fulfill the requirement. Tests are standardized throughout sections, and as long as one studies the text and asks questions in class, they'll be fine. He tends to give short, in-class quizzes and is prone to give and check a bit more homework than other sections. Overall, Snead is helpful and caring."
7634,913451,4.0,2.0,he is really nice and always willing to help out
7635,913451,5.0,2.0,M. Snead is a marvelous teacher!
7636,913451,4.0,4.0,"Doesn't always have realistic expectations of how much we can speak in French, but he's a total hottie."
7637,913451,4.5,1.0,"Very helpful, tries to make class fun, nice guy, not always perfectly clear but its charming"
7638,913451,4.5,2.0,"Excellent class, teaches really well."
7639,413751,1.0,5.0,I would not advise any student to take any course with this professor. This professor is the most difficult teacher. She makes classes very challenging and does not care about the students.
7640,413751,4.5,5.0,I loved this woman. Her lectures were always well-organized and clear. She had a very no nonsense attitude. Very knowlegable and helpful.
7641,413751,4.5,5.0,I loved this woman. Her lectures were always well-organized and clear. She had a very no nonsense attitude. Very knowlegable and helpful.
7642,413751,4.5,2.0,This is definitely an easy course as long as you keep up with the reading (not a lot) and allow a generous amount of time to study power points.  Dr.M only expects you to know basic concepts and she tries to make her lectures enjoyable with a few dirty jokes.  I managed an A.
7643,413751,3.5,2.0,"Relatively easy class. Dr. M is very knowledgable in this subject matter. Only grades are 2 midterms and a final, so study your lecture notes/power point slides and you can manage an A/B."
7644,413751,4.5,2.0,"I thought Dr. M was a great professor. Her lectures weren't boring, and she made her presentations interesting w/ stories, jokes, and little current issues type tidbits. She was very enthusiastic, and willing to help. There were 2 midterms and a final but they were doable if you study the concepts well."
7645,413751,2.5,5.0,"Very knowledgable woman who knows her stuff, but very difficult exams.  Only 3 grades in the class--2 midterms, 1 final.  You really need to memorize your stuff in order to do well in this class, or study really hard."
7646,413751,4.0,3.0,"Midterms are straight off the slides, but the final is much more challenging.  Really knows the material, but is still boring at times.  No homework or additional readings.  Mainly tests about just what is discussed in class.  So go to class and you can get a B or A."
7647,413751,3.0,2.0,"The tests are based directly off of the slides so it's not much incentive to go to class, although they are sometimes quite interesting.  She definitely knows her subjuct area and is very knowledgable about current scientific studies.  She's nice butintimidating at times (even though she's like 5 foot!)."
7648,413751,4.0,3.0,"Can tells he loves the subject, and she tries to make lectures interesting and always joking.  Tests aren't bad at all if you study the slides."
7649,413751,1.5,4.0,"Worse prof. I have ever had. She constantly commented on how every student was a cheater. On exams, she wrote hypothetical situations involving &quot;you and your fellow flunky lab students.&quot; This woman shows no respect to her students. BUT she's the only prof for intro to bio lab, so there's no way around taking her class."
7650,413751,5.0,3.0,"Intro lab, I agree with everyone, she isn't the easiest to approach, however one on one and in upper level classes she is very nice.  Her tests in upper level classes are a lot easier than 203 tests.  She just tested us on the big picture.  She basically tries to make you think, but it's not bad. Virology was my personal favorite."
7651,413751,4.5,4.0,"She must not like teaching intro... great in upper level classes, though tests are difficult"
7652,413751,4.5,4.0,"While this class is challenging, it isn't an impossible class.  Professor M can come as harsh at first, but she is a good professor who really knows what she's talking about.  And she's extremely approachable during office hours."
7653,413751,1.5,5.0,Dr M is really scary and a hard grader. The material is boring and my TA sucked. Make sure to get a TA that speaks English if you have to take this.

7655,413751,1.5,4.0,"worst teacher at UVA, by far...complete ****"
7656,413751,3.0,4.0,"Boring class, because I've already done everything in high school. Boring lectures. Moderately hard tests, though fine if you study pratice problems. But she's enthusiatic and nice, albeit loony and cynical."
7657,413751,1.5,2.0,"The book and the professor suck.  My TA was horrible, a complete idiot. The material and tests are interesting though, challenging and satisfying."
7658,413751,4.0,3.0,"She is a little scary at first (ok, my whole semester in BIOL 203). But once you get used to her and the first cell phone rings and she doesn't kill anyone, she is quite entertaining.  Also enthusiastic and knowlegable about material."

7660,413751,1.0,5.0,I would rather have taken this class from Satan himself
7661,413751,1.0,5.0,Heinous ... witch
7662,413751,4.0,2.0,"Sorry I can't remember the course number.  awesome teacher at upperlevels.  avoid into bio lab, but definitely consider taking one of her upper level classes."
7663,413751,4.0,4.0,"A very good class and instructor.  She has had serious issue with cheating including a student hacking her computer to steal the exam, so her precautions are completely understandable.  The course is hard (she tells you that upfront), but it is in no way imposible to get an A. Class is very worth it"
7664,413751,1.5,5.0,She is horrible...you have to rely on the TA's if you want to learn anything because she cannot coherently explain anything.  Dr. M also completely undermines the honor system at UVa; she automatically assumes every student cheats.  Only take this class if you have to as a premed or Bio requirement
7665,413751,1.0,5.0,"Dr. M made me cry after the very first class last year so I waited a year and tried again and she's no better. She couldn't be more bitter and if you think this will be an easy intro course it's NOT, don't be fooled by the 200 level because it feels like a 400 level."
7666,413751,4.0,3.0,"she knows the information really well, which makes her tests really hard. overall, not a bad class, rather interesting, but you will need to study hard."
7667,413751,2.0,4.0,"Clearly knows what she's talking about, but cannot communicate to the students."
7668,413751,1.0,5.0,One of the worst professor in UVa.  Very bitter and wants to be hated.  Her tests are tortures.  She makes thos course 100 times harder and worse.
7669,413751,3.0,5.0,"From the first class she comes off as someone who hates her job and hates her students even more.  She explains things well, and the book is very helpful.  The tests are impossible.  When you think you almost have the answer, your brain shuts down."
7670,413751,2.0,5.0,take it during the summer...she flies through everything
7671,413751,3.0,5.0,"Definitely knows the material, but she also assumes we do too.  For an intro class, it focuses on very specific topics in molecular biology.  The first few classes are intimidating, but she genuinely wants her students to learn and apply what is taught."
7672,413751,1.0,5.0,"Not a good teacher, avoid whenever possible"
7673,413751,3.5,5.0,"I was scared after the first class, but after which she isn't all that bad.  She occasionally will say something funny and teaches well and answers questions in class.  Her tests are impossible, but everyone is in the same boat, so stop complaining!!!"

7676,413751,2.0,4.0,One of the must unpleasant instructors I've had.  She doesn't seem to enjoy her job and developed a great antagonism toward the students in my class.  Spent much more time criticizing our shortcomings than trying to help us with them.
7677,413751,5.0,5.0,Very specific about what she wants on tests and quizzes.  Takes material straight from class notes; don't bother reading the book
7678,413751,4.5,4.0,A great lady. Whiners: your days of being spoon-fed/babysat in class ended in HS
7679,413751,3.5,4.0,She's a nightmare for 203 but is actually pretty good as an upper-level teacher.
7680,413751,1.5,3.0,No Comments
7681,413751,1.5,5.0,Ridiculed students in class.  Academically snobbish.
7682,413751,3.0,4.0,"in lecture seems evil, but quite helpful in office. opposed to grade inflation"
7683,413751,2.5,5.0,"The exams were just poorly made, not enough time, and they had confusing wording"
7684,413751,1.0,5.0,she is mean.
7685,413751,1.0,5.0, More concerned with ruining people's career goals then teaching them lab bio..

7689,1060923,5.0,3.0,Nina was a wonderful professor who was extremely helpful. I enjoyed her class. :)
7690,1060923,3.5,4.0,"I enjoyed Dr. Barzachka's class as much as I can see myself enjoying Comparative Politics. THe beginning was a little bit rocky, but I got the hang of her accent and her teaching style. She is very open to students' ideas when it comes to how she should lead the class. I have very few complaints about her."
7691,1060923,4.5,3.0,"Nina is a great professor. She really knows her stuff about European political parties and is willing to help you as a student however she can. You have to do the readings before class, but participating will be beneficial for your grade. Nina works very hard and she is extremely helpful. User her office hours she will go out of her way to help you"
7692,1060923,5.0,4.0,She is very knowledgeable about the subject. Taking her class definitely cleared up a lot!
7693,1060923,2.0,5.0,No Comments
7694,1060923,1.5,3.0,"Take someone else if possible. She frequently shows up late to section, is difficult to get in touch with, and is unclear in class. She appears to be very educated in the subject matter but struggles as a teacher."
7695,1232957,3.0,3.0,"Maybe it's just the class itself, but I did not find STS 1500 with Carlson enjoyable. He's not actively bad, it was just a mediocre class which often turned into a snoozefest with an annoying 'lab' component."
7696,1232957,5.0,3.0,"Honestly, if you aren't a good writer, don't take this class. I made that mistake. However, Professor Carlson was AWESOME in lecture. This man made the agricultural revolution interesting to a room of engineers."
7697,1232957,4.5,2.0,He is actually very fun and very helpful. He spends as much time as necessary on guiding you through the thesis/prospectus/etc... process while also having time for interesting discussions into STS topics. (as much as that might seem like an oxymoron he actually does it well)  I fully recommend this class.  He might be the best sts prof
7698,1232957,3.5,2.0,"W.B. is the man. Really nice guy and a fun teacher.  He connects well with his students and engages the classroom as much as possible. STS 2500 was a decent class with some interesting readings that you didn't really even have to read.  All the grades were based on group projects, presentations and papers that had nothing to do with the reading."
7699,1232957,4.0,2.0,No Comments
7700,1232957,3.0,3.0,Overall he's not that bad a professor.  A lot of reading for the class.  During lecture he goes kinda nuts (He oscillates between talking like a professor and talking like a 6 year old) but at least he's not boring.
7701,2691134,1.0,4.0,"Heavy accent but understandable. Easy to reach outside of class. The tests and exams took major part of your scores. Basically, 80% of your grade is based on those. So if you screw up a test, drop it."
7702,2691134,5.0,4.0,"I took ODE course with him and he's one of the best professors I've had and you can tell he loves teaching and educating. I'd recommend him to anyone interested in learning ODEs, as this has been a great positive experience."
7703,2691134,5.0,4.0,Farzad was completely inclusive and welcoming to every person regardless of any status. He was a kind teacher that offered me opportunities to give feedback in class as well as helping during class while his lectures provided thorough examples.
7704,2191423,1.0,5.0,"He was not very understanding nor was he the nicest person. Discussion was not discussion but a summary of the readings in which Doug gave you his two cents, which is the only two cents that matter apparently."
7705,2191423,2.0,3.0,"3/4 of major grades for the class are essays (2 take home, 1 long research paper). The grading feels very subjective and based on his personal opinions, so i struggled to receive good grades, even on the essays i was most proud of. Grading rubrics for each assignment do not exist and the syllabus is unclear on how essays are graded."
7706,2191423,4.0,3.0,"Overall a worthwhile class, learned a lot about the subject. Homework is reading, class is going over the readings. Take good notes, highlight the books well, and essays should be fine. You have a few papers based on readings, a research paper, a presentation on the research, &amp; a final exam paper. Teacher is nice, friendly, and good one-on-one."
7707,2191423,5.0,3.0,"Doug's Queer American History class was by far my favourite class taken at UVA. His lectures are clear and concise, and although he does assign a ton of reading material, it's all relevant and interesting. Attendance/participation matters and detailed notes make his papers a breeze. He's super funny, personable, smart, genuinely kind, and lovely."
7708,831552,1.0,3.0,The midterm made no sense. His class was extremely tough because there were no quizzes or anything just midterm and final that are basically worth your entire grade. This is an easy way to bring down your GPA.
7709,831552,2.0,4.0,"Worst decision I made. His grading is horrendous, he takes points off for writing more than just the answer, and then when you answer just the question, he takes points off for not elaborating further. Beyond frustrating. Secondly, he is the most monotonous lecturer you will ever have. Third, everything is on the powerpoint, but he never posts them"
7710,831552,4.5,3.0,"Best professor ever. So nice, and really tries to help his students. I took him last year and if you read the books and write the weekly reading responses you will do fine. Make sure you read before each class, cause its a discussion type class!"
7711,831552,4.0,1.0,"He is the kindest man ever. Material is interesting, not a lot of work/reading. Reasonable expectations. This class is very laid-back and chill; professor is a nice person who is helpful. Highly recommend."
7712,831552,1.5,2.0,BORING MONOTONE VOICE. Such interesting material gone to waste because he pauses five minutes between sentences and cant seem to make clear to-the-point statements!
7713,831552,1.0,3.0,Most Boring Class I have ever taken - avoid at all costs!
7714,831552,4.0,3.0,"I took grad/undergrad course, Chinese Family and Religion.  Fairly small class (30 ppl), yet it was /entirely/ lecture.  I think maybe he taught from his research notes, which was probably fun for the grad students but boring for undergrads.  The course is extremely overspecific and hard to relate to anything beyond a particular area of SE China."
7715,2191431,5.0,1.0,Professor Bevill is amazing!  She's so personable and she creates such a comfortable atmosphere to learn and practice a new language.  I feel like she genuinely cares that her students have an amazing experience.  She also cares about revealing the real and darker sides of French history and culture and I think that's invaluable.  Highly recommend!
7716,2191431,5.0,1.0,"Whitney is the best professor! She is so fun and personable. If your class section keeps up with their homework outside of class and is clearly putting the work in, she lets you discuss current events and such (in French) instead of lectures. The class is highly discussion based, few lectures, super fun. She's so sweet and rambles in the cutest way"
7717,2486344,5.0,4.0,"If you take this ENWR you need to be prepared to think independently, but with help, because Professor Johnson gives you a lot of freedom and expects a level of intellectual maturity that some students aren't able to handle."
7718,2486344,4.0,3.0,Very passionate and friendly. Allows and encourages different opinions and discussions. Wasn't a fan of the discussions but stops full lectures a few weeks before class ends to work on independent projects. Has 3 papers with rough and final drafts and also conferences that are individual and also with peer review partners.
7719,2486344,5.0,5.0,"Interesting class that assesses non-traditionally but very transparently. I found grading philosophy very clear, actually, but a lot of people were not able to think outside the proverbial box in class. This class is better suited to students who realize they are out of high school and want to THINK now that they are in college."
7720,2486344,1.0,3.0,"God the only reason why I made an account is to down rate this professor. The best thing about her class is that you and your classmates will hate it so much you will actually bond over your mutual hatred for the class. She doesn't believe in &quot;grades&quot; but rather says you are &quot;accountable&quot; or &quot;unaccountable,&quot; then doesn't explain what accountable is"
7721,1134671,2.5,4.0,"Pretty fly for a white guy. Ask him about his time in the war. Nice guy, means well, not a great lecturer... Seriously, I go to class like once a week because it's not very helpful, it's early in the morning, and and he doesn't mind.  However, he is very helpful one on one, so if you ever have trouble, office hours are great."
7722,1134671,1.5,4.0,"Very unclear, hardly ever finished the point the was making in a clearconcise manner. He was so inaudible (mostly while writing) the first few weeks that he had to get a mike to be heard. I got little out of class time. He posts all his notes online though, which are pretty good information sources."
7723,1134671,1.0,5.0,"Class was Physics of the Human Body.We spent literally three weeks on one probability topic about diffusion that he ended up dropping from the final.Homework will make you look up formulas on your own (no textbook),level of math is way beyond what we learned in PHYS 201-2,exams are too difficult,and there's no way to tell your grade. Stay away."
7724,2396241,5.0,2.0,"Her american poetry class is so manageable, with short readings (since they are poems). Barely any work outside of class, except for when there are papers due. The first and last essays are 2-4 pages, and the middle two are 5-7 pages. You also have to make 2 poetry memes for 10%. The discussions are chill, and the class satisfies SWR."
7725,2625620,5.0,2.0,"Professor Wood is one of the best professors I've had at UVa. She is incredibly understanding, especially given the difficulties of this semester, and she really wants her students to succeed. Her lectures are pretty engaging, and she is knowledgeable and passionate about what she teaches. If you have to take social psych, her class is great."
7726,1781848,4.5,2.0,"She's a really nice TA.. would highly recommend her if she's still TAing. She is so nice, she saw me outside of class after the semester was over and gave me a hug - what a nice person! discussions in political theory can get a bit dry but she tries to make them more fun."
7727,1396828,4.5,2.0,"I had Chuck as a T.A for Phil. of Science with Humphreys. Charles was helpful, and the discussions often served to clairify the confounding lectures. A few times I noticed Charles not communicating extremely diffucult of concepts in a coherant way, but who can explain the intricacies of Nagelian bridge laws clearly, for gods sake?"
7728,1396828,4.0,3.0,"Very nice, knows the material, communicates superbly."
7729,1396828,4.5,2.0,"He is a great TA. Really nice and accommodating if you need to meet with him outside of class.  Like the other comment though, he is extremely attractive and I did not listen to many a discussion session for that reason"
7730,1396828,4.5,2.0,Awesome ta. He's really nice and helpful outside of class. Doesn't have set office hours but pretty flexible about meeting up. Only con is he's incredibly sexy which makes it hard to focus at times.
7731,1192038,1.0,5.0,"Utz was the single most useless prof I had during my tenure at UVA.  He constantly mocked and berated students, lectured directly from the text book and solution manual, and was generally rude and unpleasant. I learned nothing and hated the class in the end when I had been looking forward to it coming in."
7732,585831,1.0,1.0,"Funny guy, but disorganized class."
7733,585831,1.0,2.0,He is somewhat scatterbrained and tough to follow occasionally.
7734,585831,5.0,1.0,Really nice professor who just wants to see his students succeed. 
7735,585831,5.0,2.0,"One of the best TA's I've ever had.  Extremely intelligent, extremely friendly, his class was a great experience."
7736,585831,5.0,1.0,"he's really wonderful, funny, and probably the only ta i've really learned from."
7737,585831,5.0,1.0,HOTHOTHOT.  And a great teacher.
7738,585831,5.0,1.0,"He RULES!  Take him for anything--he's an incredibly nice guy and knows his stuff.  He's adorable, too!"
7739,585831,5.0,1.0,one of the best ta's i have ever had
7740,585831,5.0,1.0,"Wonderful TA!  One of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.  Interesting, helpful.  Discussion was a blast!"
7741,389224,5.0,3.0,Awesome
7742,389224,3.5,4.0,"Professor McKinnon is a really nice person and a good professor. She made this class bearable, and that is a huge achievement considering that 3010 deals with very dry and difficult theories. She is helpful, nice and responsive to your thoughts and ideas. Take this with her!"
7743,389224,4.5,3.0,"was intimidated by her at first, but she's extremely helpful and nice one-on-one. her class is hard but if you're actually keeping up with the readings and everything it's not impossible."
7744,389224,3.0,2.0,No Comments
7745,389224,3.0,2.0,"If you haven't taken anthropology before, be prepared  for offensively one-sided information.  I'm liberal, but this woman was ridiculous- she tried to tell us that conservatives don't want women to have equal pay!  Regardless, pretty easy class and Jason was a great TA.  Small projects, short papers, really easy reading quizzes, and no tests."
7746,389224,5.0,2.0,Very interesting class.  Prof. McKinnon is an excellent lecturer.  She seemed very easily approachable and easy to talk to.  4 papers (1 paper's the final)
7747,389224,5.0,2.0,"In the beginning the class was semi boring, but as the semester advanced the topics became more interesting and related to modern political and social issues such as abortion, poverty, etc. My favorite class so far in terms of interesting course material. you didn't have to go to class but it helped because then you didn't have to do the reading :)"
7748,389224,5.0,2.0,"this woman is awesome. readings are interesting, class lectures are entertaining and short. i was never bored and always looked forward to going to class. discussions are a must, but overall the material is really engaging. its a must take class at uva!"
7749,389224,1.0,2.0,"McKinnon's class is incredibly easy, no midterm or final, just three papers and discussion, and going to class is pointless because her lectures are just reviews of the reading,so if you want an easy grade and don't mind being bored, here's a good class for you."
7750,389224,4.5,2.0,"Not too hard, very interesting readings. If you're extremely conservative, you'll hate her, but she is not &quot;extremely liberal&quot; by any stretch of the imagination; the subject matter she teaches reveals facts that the conservative tends to deny without justification."
7751,389224,4.5,2.0,"I thought she was a good professor, the lectures were really easy to follow and you don't have to take too many notes.  She is definitly a very approchable person."
7752,389224,4.5,2.0,"I dont think she is overly liberal - just fair. She is approachable, friendly and interesting and her lectures are worth attending despite the fact that you dont really need to."
7753,389224,1.0,2.0,she is completely one sided and clearly only teaches from an extremely liberal prospective.
7754,389224,4.5,2.0,"Very interesting lectures. Readings were okay. The class isn't too hard. No exams, just essays."
7755,389224,4.0,3.0,"Really interesting material, although sometimes the reading can get boring.  Not a very difficult course.  Make sure you get a good TA if you want to have interesting discussions."
7756,2338921,1.0,4.0,"This was supposed to be a good class; unfortunately, this was most definitely the worst teacher I have ever had in my 21 years of life. The professor barely covered concepts and expected the back of the grammar book to teach you everything. There was no review and was unhelpful during office hours. She's also really mean despite receiving respect."
7757,2240621,5.0,3.0,"She is a fabulous professor. Being Chinese she shares about her culture which is an added bonus for this class. This is a BIS program, and as such this class is very manageable. The content is quite interesting and pertinent. Highly, highly recommend this professor."
7758,1167469,5.0,2.0,"This class was seriously easy and enjoyable/applicable. Tober is super cool and relatable, and her lectures were great. Work was a 500-word blog post each week based on the weekly reading/lectures, an article-based research paper, and open-book 50 MC for both midterm and final. Little effort needed for an A, wish I could go back and take it again."
7759,1167469,5.0,2.0,"Tara really is very passionate about the subject matter, and she really tries to make the class feel the same about it. For a 200 level class there is a lot of reading, but if you do the reading and go to lectures/discussion the class is very manageable."
7760,1167469,4.5,3.0,"I hated this class. I felt that she was very biased and grades for students who didn't agree with her perspective were lower. Although Tara herself was nice, the reading material was accusatory, angry, and single-sided. Don't take this class if you are conservative at all. The tests are also tricky with the wording."
7761,1167469,4.5,2.0,"tara's really nice. the class is VERY interesting; i loved the material, though there is a lot of reading. you have to go to class because she doesn't post her power points; the notes are very helpful and the exam is heavier on lecture than on readings. you have to study a lot for the exams but they're pretty straight-forward (multiple choice, t/f)"
7762,1167469,5.0,4.0,This was the best class ever!  Tara is so helpful and you learn such cool things about food and eating... it's social!  Excellent course!
7763,1167469,4.0,2.0,"Great TA. Easy class if you pay attention to the details. She's a tough grader, but it pays off in the end. She's helpful and understood that none of us wanted to be in there for the full 2 hours."
7764,1978484,5.0,3.0,My favorite professor at UVA.  Really knows the material and is always happy to help!
7765,1978484,4.5,3.0,"Linstrum is really a great professor. I love going to lecture and, although I could have skipped many times, I never wanted to. He gave lecture outlines at the begging of every class that really helped me structure my notes. Only two papers, neither are very long or difficult. The TA was very good at helping to understand things. 10/10 would take!"
7766,1978484,4.5,3.0,"Linstrum is a young guy who's very active and happy to be teaching. He gives out helpful course outlines and makes expectations clear. The readings are very long, but you can get by without reading every detail. For someone teaching about the British Empire, he really doesn't seem to like Britain, and teaches with an agenda, but I got by that soon."
7767,1978484,5.0,3.0,"One of my top 3 professors at UVa.   Linstrum is relatively new to UVa but that just means he gives his students that  much more individual attention. If you try in this class and go to office hours, you can get an B+/A. Absolutely adore him. His knowledge of the British Empire is impressive and he's so passionate. "
7768,1978484,5.0,3.0,Great course! Professor Linstrum is very approachable and really encourages you to participate.
7769,1871990,4.5,1.0,"I think she is fantastic. She is really understanding and very nice. Apart from her personality, she really taught me a lot, and I definitely came out of her class with a stronger grasp of the Spanish language as a whole, despite its focus on writing."
7770,2781311,1.0,5.0,"In my experience, he treats students consistently rudely, not replying to messages, inconsiderate, and abrasive. His self-centered attitude created a major problem that shifted the course of my time at UVA and left me with no recourse. This was consistent, not an isolated incident. He will not support you."
7771,831622,4.5,2.0,This teacher is very helpful.  HIs lecture was fast but not too fast if you use a laptop.  Keeping up with notes should be enough.  It takes studying but you are rewarded for your work.
7772,831622,4.5,2.0,"Professor Trella is one of the kindest teachers I have ever had. He teaches very well and class is so relaxing and chill.  He grades very very generously. I loved it. Take his class, any of them! You'll love him too!"
7773,831622,5.0,2.0,"Oh snap! Trella is the man! His class was sometimes the highlight of my day. Fun class, fun and interesting material, very relaxing because of the lecture structure. I highly recommend that everyone take it regardless of your major."
7774,831622,5.0,2.0,"Good lecturer.  Some of the material covered seemed a little flakey (reading Clan of the Cave Bear), but usually the material was very interesting.  Tests and quizes are very fair if you stay up on the reading and go to lecture.  Highly recommend this course."
7775,831622,5.0,2.0,"I loved this class!  Prof. Trella is great and there's not too much reading.  He's a great guy nad the reading is not too difficult.  And, it's really, really interesting.  He's very helpful."
7776,831622,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Trella is sooo nice and really easy to talk to.  He's extremely clear in lecture, and there really isn't that much reading, except for Clan of the Cave Bear which was a really easy read.  And you don't really have to read Darwin.  His tests aren't difficult at all, very fair.  He's great!"
7777,831622,4.0,4.0,"Good class, good teacher.  Just keep up with the reading.  If you go to office hours, he's really helpful"
7778,831622,5.0,3.0,No Comments
7779,831622,1.0,4.0,"Trella lacks the ability to connect with students, and gives too much reading. I don't think he's a fair teacher."
7780,831622,1.0,3.0,this man is an idiot.  a terrible and incompetent teacher.
7781,2420872,4.0,3.0,Prof. Apostolellis does a great job making the lectures engaging and enthusiastic although he often misunderstands questions/takes a while to answer what is actually being asked. Overall the programming assignments and quizzes aren't too hard but the in-class quizzes can feel quite a bit harder.
7782,2420872,3.0,4.0,"I loved the material in this class. Honestly, I think that this should be a required class if you want to get a computer science degree I took for 3 week class. It was too hard Professor speaks very bluntly. Does not mean he's uncaring Collab site layout is fairly unintuitive You should take this class. Prof wasn't best teacher but is trying"
7783,2420872,2.0,4.0,Questions on exams and quizzes are always way beyond the scope of what you learned in class or in assignments. Hard to get a hold of outside of class. Not very lenient on grading even if the issue came from his end.
7784,2420872,5.0,3.0,Great lectures Open note quizzes project is important Thursday lectures are fun
7785,2420872,1.0,4.0,"HCI with this professor is, in a word, painful. Firstly, if you've ever had issues with group work, don't even consider taking this course as it's 90% groupwork. He always tries to fit far more than he can teach in his lectures, but still quizzes us on what he had to skip over because of time. Overall, a poor teacher of what was once a good class."
7786,1904803,1.0,4.0,absolutely terrible. asks questions on hw that he doesnt cover in lecture. learning catalytics in-class questions do not go through majority of the time so you lose points. no idea what hes saying 100% of the time. if youre not an astronomy major dont take alien worlds. if you dont put your hw answers in his exact wordsf.
7787,1904803,4.0,2.0,"Lectures could get long and boring at times, however the subject was super interesting and you could tell he really cared about it. The tests were very straightforward - all multiple choice. "
7788,1904803,2.0,2.0,"Class was easy in a way (no outside work, but exams could be very nit-picky), but painfully boring. Phil seems like a good guy, and sometimes the powerpoints were funny, but his delivery was very flat and NO ONE paid attention. Subject matter in theory was really interesting at times, though."
7789,1904805,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic guy. Endearing, funny, and scintillatingly smart. Top 3 professors ever at UVA. He shook my foundations of everything I ever thought I knew."
7790,1904805,5.0,1.0,I LOVE THIS GUY!!! SUPER SUPER SUPER EASY and interesting. He's literally the best!!! His classes are extremely interesting yet very easy.. trust me! You will learn from the best
7791,1904805,5.0,2.0,"I LOVE this professor! He's extremely brilliant! Like real BRILLIANT and trust me the class was worth every minute, he gives great feedback, discussions are really fun and I just wish he taught all my classes. He makes the materials extremely interesting. He is also flexible, you are allowed to skip out three times!"
7792,651440,4.0,2.0,"The lectures can be interesting, but more often than not, they're a bit dry. Regardless, there are some interesting elements to the course, and Cesaretti is a very nice, invested professor that I would recommend to everyone."
7793,651440,5.0,1.0,A truly incredible professor to learn from
7794,651440,5.0,1.0,"One of the kindest professors I have ever had, he cares about his students and works with you. Take him!!!"
7795,651440,4.5,3.0,Il migliore! Professor Cesaretti is a master with his material and quite the looker as well. Both my mind and eyes were thoroughly sated by the end of the semester.
7796,651440,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Cesaretti's class on the Novella made me fall in love with Italian literature. Most of his insights are downright enlightening, yet I never felt intimidated to offer my own opinions, even if they sometimes contradicted his.  He's very nice (I had bad luck and got sick 2ce this semester, and he was very understanding about work)Take his class!"
7797,651440,4.5,2.0,"Interesting teacher, keeps learning fun by not requiring a lot of outside work aside from reading Italian newspapers and some essays.  Good teacher, nice guy."
7798,651440,2.5,3.0,nice guy...interesting topic (Utopias)...but difficult and absurd readings (such as about a man trying to overthrow pasta)...the course is quite confusing and he usually does all the talking..just add in a few comments every now and then and u'll be fine. i enjoyed the class but regret taking it due to my grade...definitely needs more guidelines
7799,651440,5.0,1.0,he's SOOOO hot...i almost got a B in his class because of his looks...he's like one of those italian guys that all girls dream about!
7800,651440,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Cesaretti is so wonderful.  He is a great professor, and just an overall nice guy.  Take a class with him, it will not only help you Italian, but also get you more interested in it."
7801,864436,5.0,5.0,"Omar had a very intelligent approach to the material. He is helpful and courteous and expects students to be the same. Even though there is a lot of reading involved yet his summaries and notes make the job much easier.. This class, in my opinion, is for those who are willing to challenge their own preconceived notions of current popular issues."
7802,864436,4.5,3.0,"Omer is a REALLY good teacher.  He expects students to do all reading assigned - and it's A LOT of reading.  He's very helpful, especially if you meet with him during office hours.  It seems as though he has a genuine interest in his students and what they think about the course.If you like discussion and challenges, then he's a good choice."
7803,864436,3.0,4.0,Omer is a cool guy.  He makes you think about very out there concepts. This class has tons of reading!
7804,864436,4.5,2.0,"Omer has a pretty intense style that some people don't like.  He's anal about attendence and participating in the discussion so be prepared to answer some hard questions.  He really pushes you to think hard, but a lot of times he pushes his own opinions in class.  Overall a pretty good TA, he makes sure discussion goes somewhere and isn't wasted."
7805,864436,4.5,3.0,"This guy is really very smart. He obviously loves what he's studying, and he pushes you hard to think about the things that aren't readily apparent.  I found him very approachable and definitely willing to spend time to help me out. I guess his aggressive style isn't everybody's cup of tea though... He's challenging, that's for sure."
7806,864436,1.0,5.0,"This guy is awful. First day of class he says &quot;I have a reputation for being a really hard grader, I like to tear papers apart.&quot; That pretty much sums him up. He is one of those TAs who obviously wasn't happy with how he was as an undergrad and proceeds to take it out on his discussion memebers. Avoid him at all costs!!"
7807,864436,1.0,4.0,"I had him as a TA and he was not helpful whatsoever.  He expected too much of students and was not approachable.  I asked him to help me on this paper and he didn't help me but just made me feel stupid and accused me of not trying.  If I wasn't trying, then why would I try to see him for help&#63;"
7808,864436,2.5,3.0,Confusing and uses big words. Tries to make people think but does not realize people want to get good grades and thats it - esp for this intro classes! Difficult grader. Never gives a straight answer! At times very frustrating!!!
7809,1896633,5.0,1.0,"Shea is awesome. He's always in touch with the creative side of literature and helps make a writing requirement class loads of fun. I took his class by accident, but it's been my favorite class at UVA so far. I highly recommend him for Adventure Writing.  "
7810,1896633,5.0,1.0,"Shea is a great professor; he's funny, young/cool, and interested in poetry. Great guy, take poetry writing with him!"
7811,1142972,2.0,3.0,"He's alright, but he definitely doesnt take an interest in you learning the language. We did way too much individual work, & one class he handed out worksheets for us to complete silently while he worked on his laptop. Grading is inconsistent; sometimes just he'll give out a's but on the exams he grades like he expects us to be fully fluent. Avoid"
7812,1142972,4.0,2.0,"Juan doesn't really get attached to students but definitely wants them to do well. Pretty easy grader. He is from Spain, so he talks legit spanish, but generally speaks slower for us not-so-spanish students. He is very nice I saw one guy who forgot an assignment and I think Juan let him bring it later. Of course I still don't recommend late work..."

7814,479424,5.0,3.0,Professor Dearth was one of the best professors I had during my time at UVA. He is extremely knowledgeable and clearly passionate about what he talks about. I took a summer class with him this past year right before I graduated and it was the best decision ever - he made those long hours fly by. I really learned so much from him!
7815,479424,1.0,5.0,I came to audition for the jazz ensemble as a female freshman bass player with extensive classical but no jazz experience. John D'earth took a look at me and refused to even let me audition.
7816,479424,5.0,4.0,"Unbelievable professor and person. It's not easy - you'll frequently be way out of your comfort zone - but he makes the class a very supportive environment and you will improve more than you ever thought possible. If you've ever played an instrument, take this class before you graduate."
7817,479424,5.0,1.0,"Had him for jazz ensemble and his improv class. Phenomenal teacher and person. Cares about his students, both on an academic and personal level. Worth taking his improv class if you have any interest in music. And try out for the jazz ensemble!"
7818,479424,5.0,4.0,"John is an amazing instructor!! He knows his music, has played with the best of them in his life, and is phenomenal at teaching people of all levels. He taught me theory when I knew nothing more than my major scales and how to read music. Now I'm in his jazz ensemble and having a blast! Even if you can't take his class, just talk to him!!"
7819,479424,4.5,1.0,"Dearth is awesome! His Jazz Improv class is great for developing your skills no matter what level you're at. We had experienced pianists and others who knew no theory at all in the beginning, and they all learned so much. Dearth is relaxed, a great teacher, willing to help, and very flexible. If you want to study jazz, TALK TO JOHN DEARTH!"
7820,479424,5.0,3.0,"He's a great guy, always willing to help you improve as a musician outside the realm of the music that is actually being worked on. He also genuinely cares about students to the point of even wanting to get to know them. His ability as a jazz musician is astonishing, and everyone interested in music should hook up with him at some point."
7821,479424,5.0,3.0,John is an awesome teacher who is more than willing to help students and even just chew the fat so to speak. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Jazz music.
7822,1691843,5.0,1.0,Hamid is a Very nice professor. Helpful and He knows his stuff. Fun class. If I have a chance I will definitely take him again.He is very organized.  This was the most organized teacher I had. I wish I could take a class with him again
7823,1691843,5.0,1.0,Profesor Tavakolian is the best. His lectures are easy to follow and he always has a smile on his face. I was able to understand and enjoy everything he lectured. I got a good grade. Tavakolian rocks!! Take his class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7824,1691847,5.0,3.0,"One of the greatest professors I've ever had. If he teaches other undergraduate economics in the future, it should not be missed.  Excellent communication during and after class, extremely helpful. Thumbs up."
7825,1691847,5.0,2.0,"Professor Tavakolian is one of the best professors I had. he knows his stuff  Overall, he is a great business professer. I would recommend him for businss classes."
7826,1691847,5.0,1.0,"He's a great communicator and teaches the concepts of the course in a clear and easily understandable way. The readings are dense, but he explains the main concepts in lecture, so thankfully you don't have to delve yourself too deep in them. The course is demanding, but if you're willing to work hard and put your mind into it, you'll get an easy A."
7827,1691847,5.0,1.0,"Awesome Professor. Vibrant and super helpful. I had a lot of fun in his class. Profesor Tavakolian is the best. His lectures are easy to follow and he always has a smile on his face. Even though subject is difficult, I was able to understand everything. I got a good grade. Tavakolian rocks!! Take his class!!"
7828,1691847,5.0,2.0,"A great prof. A nice and approachable MAN with a relaxed and fun attitude. He kows Strategy Management and he is very intelligent.  definitly, the best teacher I have had.  I learned alot from him."
7829,381130,5.0,3.0,"If you have any interest in learning more about autism, take this class. Jaswal is a super knowledgeable about the topic and leads some really interesting discussions. Reading is mandatory, but as long as you keep up with it, you'll be fine for the midterm and final."
7830,381130,5.0,1.0,Great man! Very engaging in lecture and made me want to pursue Psychology as one of my majors.
7831,381130,5.0,3.0,"Really interesting lectures, goes at a steady pace and very approachable. Definitely recommend. Take detailed notes and do all readings to do well on the tests."
7832,381130,4.0,3.0,Professor Jaswal is amazing. He really tries to make his lectures engaging and understandable and often reiterates that he is available during his office hours for any questions or just to chat. He also offers an optional weekly review session. I would highly suggest doing the reading if you want to do well on the tests.
7833,381130,5.0,3.0,"The class was enjoyable because of his passion and personal experience with the topics he teaches. Appears nice and approachable, though I only briefly spoke with him for clarification during tests. The essay/interactive assignment that counts for 10% of your grade is enjoyable, make sure you put effort into that essay. Tests harder than expected"
7834,381130,4.5,3.0,"Vikram is the nicest professor you can get. There's a ton of reading, but this is a 4000 level seminar, so be prepared. Assignments and questions on the readings are on a weekly basis. One group long project and one essay on a book: it's pretty manageable. Go to class because the discussions MAKE the class. Would take it again in a heartbeat."
7835,381130,3.5,4.0,"Great guy and gives great lectures, but the test are evil. And I mean evil. Make sure to read the book. "
7836,381130,3.0,4.0,"the tests are really hard! and the subject matter is not THAT interesting, he's an amazing guy tho! take it but be warned thats there's a LOT of work to get a good grade"
7837,381130,5.0,2.0,Extremely clear professor who is a great lecturer. All exams are multiple choice and are pretty fair if you pay attention in class and read the textbook. You can drop 1 exam out of the 4. Pay attention in  the lecture and make notes b/c he only provides an outline for the day. Very nice and approachable
7838,381130,4.0,4.0,"Genuinely interested in teaching and helping. Corrects inconsistencies in books, offers funny and insightful examples, great disposition."
7839,381130,4.5,4.0,"Very personable and great lecturer. Lectures were interesting as well as interactive, so you didn't feel as though it was a 300-person class. Highly recommended!"
7840,381130,4.5,2.0,"Fun, low-key class. Jaswal is a really sweet, approachable guy who knows what he's talking about. Gives a lot of demos that make up for sometimes dry lectures. Tests aren't bad at all and he puts slides online. Take this with Jaswal, he's just a really likable guy teaching a really interesting class."
7841,381130,3.0,3.0,This class was pretty awesome. You take 3 exams.  Your lowest one is dropped. The Final was SO EASY. Knowing the book is helpful in his class. He covers material very well.  He's a great guy and really cares.  He's emailed students about how to improve their grades-- or simply to compliment them on their improvement.  Great guy and great class! :)
7842,381130,5.0,1.0,"Although the book is very dry, Jaswal explains the important stuff well and gives meaning to the text. Lectures are entertaining. Very approachable. 3 exams with a cumulative final (all multiple choice). Lowest of first 3 exam grades is dropped. Would highly recommend!"
7843,381130,5.0,3.0,"He's really nice, genuine and always willing to help. Tries to make the course as interesting as possible and has his own endearing sense of humor. The class is really interesting and wide-ranging; exams test a lot of applications so you have to understand the material. I'd definitely recommend taking the course with him!"
7844,381130,5.0,3.0,Great! He's very approachable and knows what he's talking about! Tests are a mix of reading the book and paying attention in class! I still talk to him now!
7845,381130,4.5,3.0,"Not a bad class at all, and Jaswal was pretty awesome. He definitely had his boring days but I think a lot of that is just the fact that Cognition is not my thing, but overall he is good. Make sure you read the book, or at least skim it, and understand things well enough for an application process since thats mainly what his tests are. Great guy!!"
7846,381130,5.0,3.0,A complete sweetie! He has a genuine interest in his students and tries to teach everything clearly except for when he seems rushed. The book is incredibly boring and the tests are based mostly on the applications of the experiments explained in lecture. He loves to talk about his cat and his niece.
7847,381130,5.0,4.0,"This class is pretty tricky - he likes to test applications, not just memorization. Lectures are interesting and he includes lots of demos and relevant videos. He is an extremely nice guy w/ a genuine interest in all of his students."
7848,381130,4.5,3.0,He has a very soothing voice.
7849,381130,4.0,2.0,"Lovable guy who really cares about his hundreds of students.  Just quickly read the text; his tests are based on his notes, which are all on Powerpoint on Toolkit.  Interesting topic, but sometimes got boring.  He tries to engage the class in his lectures by interactive activities.  Overall a good class."
7850,381130,3.0,4.0,"Made me major in psychology. Hard but extremely interesting material, and Jaswal is an articulate and appealing kind of guy whose class is well organized. Very good class. If he happens to teach it, I'd say take it from him or Willingham."
7851,381130,3.0,3.0,No Comments
7852,381130,4.0,2.0,"Extremely nice, energetic, loves students, very prompt with emails. Likes to mention his cat a lot in his lectures. Tests emphasize the notes more than the book (warning: the book will put you to sleep). Interesting lectures, though he lacks the comedic touch of other psyc professors, but he sure does try."
7853,381130,5.0,1.0,"I enjoyed this class, and most lectures were pretty interesting.  Vikram used a lot of videos and funny examples.  Sometimes he would drag out an easy point and fly through more complicated ones but he was very helpful and always open to suggestions. This is a great class for people interested psychology."
7854,381130,5.0,3.0,I heart Vikram Jaswal!  He makes learning fun and pretty!
7855,381130,3.5,3.0,One of my least favorite classes this semseter. I heard that UVA had a great PSYC department and this class did not confirm that for me.  I did not enjoy the class. I recomend taking cognition with Willingham (the author of the textbook).  I hear he is much better.
7856,381130,4.0,4.0,"If you attend lectures with any class he teaches, you will do well. The tests are more based on his specific notes, not the book."
7857,381130,5.0,3.0,Very good.
7858,381130,4.0,3.0,No Comments
7859,381130,5.0,2.0,Great class!
7860,381130,4.0,3.0,"I was worried by how young he is, but he's quite good and has entertaining lectures."
7861,381130,4.5,3.0,"The book is very boring and the lectures aren't much better, but the subject material is interesting and the professor is straightforward and a very nice guy."
7862,381130,3.0,3.0,Boring lectures; skimming the book and reading the PowerPoints will get you a B on the tests.
7863,381130,2.0,2.0,very poor teacher in comparison to other psyc teachers.
7864,381130,5.0,2.0,The book is boring but the lectures aren't and it is very important that you do pay attention to his lectures. You can't simply just d/l the powerpoints. He drops one of the three tests. I failed the first one because I didn't paying attention in class but then I aced the next 2 tests and the final
7865,381130,4.5,4.0,"Very coherent, very organized, very eve-paced.  Exams are not easy, but not too difficult either.  Textbook does getting some used to, and I loved the videoclips!"
7866,381130,2.0,3.0,Very good at putting students to sleep.
7867,381130,4.5,3.0,"Always tries to liven up the lectures with film clips, music, and pop culture references.  Energetic lecturer and easy to understand."
7868,381130,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting and straightforward lecturer. Also, he integrates movies or other multimedia into the lectures for variety. The book is horrible, but it's necessary to read it; plus, must go to all the lectures. Great teacher who actually teaches!"
7869,381130,4.5,3.0,"great lecturer and very prepared (his powerpoints are very helpful). Textbook is dry, and the tests aren't easy but it's worth it."
7870,381130,3.5,3.0,an interesting class and a nice guy. as long as you read the textbook and pay attention during the lectures (coz the lectures do help) youll ace the class
7871,381130,4.0,3.0,"the textbook is sheer boredom, but the lectures are slightly more interesting."
7872,520410,4.0,3.0,"Coastal /Fluvial Environments and other classes in the 80's with Bob Dolan ultimately led to my career choice.   8am class, but eyes wide open as we traveled to the world's most dynamic coastal environments through his slides.  Very knowledgeable, funny; excellent mentor -was his TA later in grad school.  Pioneer researcher in coastal geomorphology"
7873,520410,1.5,3.0,"He was all over the place. Slow to return grades. Repeat lecture slides, repeat test questions. No clear expectations for assessments so nobody knew what to study. My whole class is frustrated with him. He scheduled the final on a reading day, which isn't allowed. The department has received lots of complaints about him and his classes. AVOID."
7874,520410,1.5,2.0,cute old man. he reminds me of my grandfather. he is always repeating himself and loses track of what he is talking about. he is very forgetful and the class is slow. I'm very interested in the is class but didn't learn anything new in this class. info can be confusing but there is no other resource to reference. just his research
7875,520410,1.0,4.0,My friends took this class and they said they received b's. I'm just a non sci major trying to get my credits. This guy repeats wrong information throughout the course and confuses the heck out of you. The TA made the tests and she would always put the next weeks information on the test so you had no idea about some questions. Don't take
7876,520410,1.5,5.0,"not great, cute old man but lecures were all over the place. He repeated information wrong often and never was around for office hours. topic seems interesting but i didnt learn much at all."
7877,520410,5.0,1.0,Took 3 or 4 classes of his. All of them were equally great!
7878,520410,4.0,2.0,"Sort of a doddering, absent minded guy but he has had incredible experiences and lots of stories.  I really liked him."
7879,520410,2.0,3.0,not that great of a teacher. he seems full of himself and is not very clear on things (repeats his figures wrong a lot). his tests are set up kind of easily but the questions are unclear due to his lectures being unclear
7880,520410,3.5,1.0,"The 382 Coastal Processes class seemed like it would be hard, but it was a peice of cake. He repeated a lot of lectures, but it helped cuz it means you KNEW the material. There was a huge project at the end, but he grades fairly. I think everyone in the class go tna A or B on everything. Plus there's an awesome 4 day field trip to Nags Head."
7881,520410,5.0,2.0,"Friendly approachable guy, funny and absent-minded.  He can be unclear about what he wants, but he's fair about it when you talk to him."
7882,520410,2.0,3.0,"i thought this was going to be interesting, but the lectures were boring and the tests were really hard (even though they were multiple choice).. the grades were all low, but i think he curved them"
7883,520410,1.0,3.0,most unorganized professor ever.  he put up wrong quiz answers for us to study from before the final exam...he accidentally put last year's answers...we had to deal with it and the average grade for the final exam was in the 70s...there's no curve
7884,2560219,5.0,4.0,"I thought the class was good overall. There was nightly homework, but it wasn't super overwhelming. Even with projects mixed in at no point did I think the workload wasn't doable. Professor Grammar is really nice and approachable. She tries to keep the class interesting with videos and French music."
7885,2560219,5.0,3.0,"Extremely skilled and fluent native French speaker who makes the language requirement worth it. She reignited my interest in French by relating it to contemporary culture and practical uses, too. Gives detailed feedback and really wants you to improve your fluency, pronunciation, and understanding. Patient, kind, and has a lot of respect."
7886,2085082,5.0,4.0,Learned a lot!
7887,2085082,5.0,4.0,Great class!
7888,1306848,2.0,3.0,"I thought she was nice, friendly, and fun when I first met her. She has bad-mouthed students to other students and the staff in the past unfortunately..a lot of unprofessional behavior like that. So please be on guard and constantly ask how you're doing in clinical."
7889,2732267,1.0,4.0,"At first I had high hopes for this professor. All quizzes and home-works are graded for completion and he was always available for office hours. However, beware of this professor, he is not very clear with his explanations, and does not go over quizzes or home-works in the best manner possible. He does not give good feedback, which is needed."
7890,1831148,5.0,3.0,Professor Greeson is a super talented professor. Her lectures are so engaging and I feel like I have a new appreciation for southern literature. Definitely try to take a class with her if you like literature. The grading and everything else just depends on your TA
7891,1831148,5.0,3.0,"I took AMST 3880- Literature of the South with Professor Greeson and absolutely loved it. She is a fantastic lecturer, expect to be fascinated by what she talks about if you have even the slightest interest in lit/American history. Very few grades but if you read what you r supposed to (not a lot) and attend lecture, you will be fine."
7892,1831148,4.0,4.0,"Greeson was a fantastic lecturer - always prepared with a great powerpoint, examples, stories, and even songs to complement her ideas! ENAM3380 went by quickly with loads of readings for each week but I think it was well worth it."
7893,1093869,1.0,5.0,By far the worst Professor in the country.
7894,1093869,3.5,3.0,"He's a little dry, but Fluids is a pretty dry subject as well. He is very consumed with his research, so he makes it difficult to get a lot of help from him. BUT, we had a VERY helpful TA who knew what he was doing and helped a bunch. Just do your homework, go the TA sessions, and pay attention. You'll be fine."
7895,880883,5.0,4.0,I heart her Queer Novel course. So so good! I wish there were more classes like this at UVA.
7896,880883,5.0,4.0,Prof. is THE G.O.A.T. Enuf said.
7897,880883,2.0,3.0,"What a waste of three credits. I hardly learned anything! She mostly lets students talk, and rarely offers more than vague suggestions of deeper meaning in the texts. Her lectures sound sourced by Wikipedia. She also makes you turn in drawings of monsters from the texts, so get ready for that. She is a harsh grader though- plan your papers y'all."
7898,880883,5.0,4.0,I took the Dystopian Novel with Professor Chakravorty during the elections.  It's the most eye-opening and relevant course I have taken at UVA.  Chakravorty is unsettling but in a good way.  I haven't stopped thinking about the books and lectures from the course!  More English classes need to be like this.
7899,880883,5.0,3.0,"Chakravorty's great. Despite not having separate lecturediscussion class periods, she's really good at being able to balance the two in class. There weren't any tests, and she's a relatively tough but definitely fair grader. Gives LOTS of helpful feedback on papers and makes herself very approachable. Lectures were really interesting too."
7900,880883,5.0,4.0,"Prof. C is a strange cookie. You're never sure if she's way ahead of her time, very timely, or just timeless. Turns out she's all three and that's cool. Her lectures are genius. Just dazzling. Who would've thought monsters--fascinating as they are--symbolize capitalism's dead labor?  But they do! Take any class with her. Sure to open your eyes. "
7901,880883,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Chakravorty is incredible. Her class is challenging and engaging, and she really pushes you to look beyond the obvious when crafting an argument. I highly recommend any class she teaches."
7902,880883,4.5,5.0,"Professor Chakravorty will challenge you to the point of insanity, but she is definitely worth it. She's brilliant to listen to in class, and she's helpful in Office Hours for papers. I highly, highly recommend her class, but not if you're not willing to work your tail off (loads of reading & long papers). More classes at UVA should be like this."
7903,880883,2.5,3.0,"Chakravorty is most definitely difficult to follow at times: you really need to ask questions and concentrate if there's something you want answered. Occasionally thick accent aside, she was quite passionate and knowledgeable on the subject matter (migrant fictions) and helpful in office hours when it came to papers."
7904,880883,4.0,4.0,"i had a passing interest in the topic; not anymore. i am a huge convert.  the books are smart, and prof. chakravorty is smarter!  she makes post-col. the hottest topic around.  i'm onboard.  imperialism must be subverted."
7905,880883,5.0,4.0,"I love this class!  It's not super easy, but it's definitely worth the challenge.  The readings are really intense, and she gets you to think in totally new ways.  This class has really made me think much more deeply about things happening in the world today."
7906,880883,2.5,3.0,"So incredibly boring... lectures way too fast, and is often difficult to understand. She is really tough on papers, and sometimes her comments make no sense. BEWARE"
7907,831736,4.5,3.0,She does a good job as a teacher and I learned a lot in a short time.
7908,831736,4.5,4.0,She is very enthusiastic and willing to help.  Also very well-organized and knows what she is doing.
7909,831736,4.0,3.0,Very enthusiastic professor and shows a passion for teaching. While the material itself can be confusing at times Professor King is very approachable and willing to help her students.
7910,831736,2.0,5.0,"Prof. King is the worst professor I have ever had.  Even hopped-up on 3 Diet Cokes, she makes classes long and uncomfortable by grilling us into parroting the readings, and then making weird faces when students are talking.  In general she discourages independent thought, de-motivates her students, and destroys your GPA."
7911,1052921,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed Professor Crane's class. The class meetings were her lecturing, and there were weekly readings and assignments. Overall, the lecture part of this course was generally pretty good; participation does matter (at least it's strongly encouraged). Grades are determined by TAs, so it can depend a little bit on the luck of the draw."
7912,1052921,4.5,3.0,Prof. Crane is a great scholar. I think she might be better in directing researching than lecturing. She is smart and patient with students. I think her class was challenging but I did learn a lot!
7913,1052921,5.0,1.0,"Professor Crane is an excellent speaker and is very knowledgeable about what she teaches. The lectures can get somewhat boring, but she tries to make the topics intriguing and interesting. The weekly assignment questions were annoying and the readings were dull. However, the class was ultimately pretty easy."
7914,1052921,4.5,4.0,Professor Crane is a very good scholar. She is very knowledgable and helpful. This class is a high level class and it is challenging.
7915,1052921,3.5,3.0,She's really passionate about the subject and is really personable one-on-one!
7916,1052921,5.0,4.0,"Sheila is an amazing professor, who truly cares about presenting herself as a standout educator. She is always available for discussions either through email or office hours, allowing students easy access. She is so organized and clearly defines her expectations for tests and assignments. All of her course materials are on Collab. A great class!"
7917,1052921,1.5,2.0,"Hardly anyone goes to class.. I feel bad for her because she is such a horrible public speaker.  I think she knows what she's talking about, she just can't explain it.  She seems like a really nice lady! I guess it's a good class if you want to skip all of the lectures and wing it in discussion.  Midterm, paper, final"
7918,1052921,1.0,3.0,"Awful teacher. Gesticulates far too much and is distracting with her overuse of subjunctive clauses and qualifiers. AND &quot;um.&quot; By the end of the class, barely anyone showed up and those who were there were playing tetris."
7919,1052921,1.0,5.0,She sucks
7920,1052921,2.0,4.0,"I took AR H101 with her, and really enjoyed it.  AR H203 was a different story.  She is very knowledgeable, but her lectures are often difficult to follow."
7921,1052921,1.0,5.0,"She is horrible.  I never make comments here, but for her, I'm making an exception.  I hope for your sake you take my advice and avoid her at all costs."
7922,1052921,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher, great scholar."
7923,1052921,1.0,5.0,I can see how she got where she is....it's obvious stat.
7924,1052921,1.0,5.0,"her first class was fine, but near the end it get really boring ---i felt like a prisoner in that class avoid taking her class ---one of the worst teacher at the A-school"
7925,1052921,2.0,4.0,the worst teacher by far ----i didn't enjoy her class at all
7926,1208572,5.0,3.0,"She's awesome! Super passionate about her field of study, very knowledgeable and up to date in her information and research."
7927,1208572,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors I've ever had! She is not only a great teacher but she's extremely inteligent and has great background information. She genuinely cares about all of her students and is really excited about the material.  Her lectures were interesting and she was very helpful outside of class. I would recommend ANY course taught by her!
7928,1208572,4.5,4.0,"She is THE BEST!  Shes cute, fun, interesting and is understanding with her students.  I HIGHLY recommend her for anyone in Anthro.  She's new here to UVA and I hope she stays.  Made what could have been a boring class into something that I looked forward to attending."
7929,1208572,5.0,3.0,"Very nice professor, very ethusiastic about the class. SHE IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL and not a hard grader! She even offers extra credit for those who may need it!"
7930,1208572,4.5,3.0,"I'm so glad I took New World Civilizations on a whim-- the material was overwhelming at times but was pretty interesting, and she is one of the nicest professors I have ever had.  You can tell she's really enthusiastic about what she teaches, and that's what makes the class fun. Not conceptually difficult, but her tests required a lot of studying."
7931,430338,3.5,2.0,"Sam can get off subject in but that is mostly because students don't have very much to say so he goes off on tangents. If you actually had any questions and weren't afraid to raise your hand, he'd be more than happy to talk about them. Also, he is extremely helpful on papers with both content and grammar, he wrote a whole page explaining my grade."
7932,430338,2.0,3.0,"Sam Turner's discussion is utterly useless. He's nice, but he really doesn't know how to lead a discussion. You spend the whole session talking about irrelevant speculation on what you read with no textual nor historical basis that won't help you anywhere in the course. On papers he's good at grading them grammatically but not substantively."
7933,430338,3.5,3.0,"great TA...very out there, but somehow it all makes sense..haha He made us cookies and a mix CD too!!! : )"
7934,430338,4.5,2.0,Sam is pretty much the best TA.
7935,430338,3.0,2.0,"sam is an awful teacher. we hardly ever talked about writing, more about the weird dreams and thoughts he has. he won't give you good advice on your paper, just rip on it and give you a B-. he's not constructive. if you want to learn how to write, find someone else."
7936,430338,4.5,2.0,"Sam is a great TA! Anyone who makes his class cookies and CD mixes on the last day of class is worth having. He is definitely fair with grades, and more than willing to look over a paper before it needs to be turned in."
7937,430338,4.0,1.0,Pretty easy grader and total goof...in a funny way. I found him hilarious-talked about everything under the sun in class but little about writing. Recommended if you want an easy writing class.
7938,430338,5.0,2.0,"He has this awkward way of making random things very funny, yet is very dedicated to writing and therefore focuses on good writing very hard and very well. I would recommend his section, especially if it is the one about monsters."
7939,430338,4.0,2.0,"I had Sam for ENGL 382 Discussion. At first I was taken aback by his irreverant style, but he proved to be a superb TA. He is extremely knowledgeable about many of the texts, but also lets the class take its own direction. For such a phenomenally boring subject, his crude sense of humor and obscene language made disc far more fun than anticipated."
7940,430338,4.0,1.0,take sam's section for 382 or 383!
7941,430338,4.0,1.0,"Sam is the man. if you get the chance to take this class, do it."
7942,430338,2.0,2.0,"Sam is a crazy guy. Yeh, he's funny at times but it gets old really fast! His class was useless to me, it taught me nothing. He grades pretty easy but if you really want help with your writing do NOT take ENWR from Sam Turner! You never get your papers back on time. He didn't give our last papers back until 2 days before final portfolio was due."
7943,430338,3.5,1.0,"Sam is awesome! The class feels a little pointless..he's obviously very busy with his own work, so if you need a lot of help with writing, don't expect it unless you go to his office hrs. He is enthusiastic about the subject and EXTREMELY encouraging and friendly. Quirky and unusual individual that makes class easy and enjoyable."
7944,430338,3.0,2.0,OMG this guy makes me laugh every class just because of how crazy he is.  Sometimes his thoughts don't make sense at all so his class is hard to follow.  Overall a nice guy.  Certainly an &quot;interesting&quot; class and I don't really mean that in a good way.
7945,430338,4.0,1.0,Yeah!!!!
7946,430338,4.5,1.0,Sam's a great TA. a total scatter-brain but completely willing to work with you if you come to him. Tries to make class fun while getting through the sometimed boring tasks.
7947,430338,2.0,2.0,Wonderfully nice guy who does make class fun sometimes. Very little work... BUT He is absent minded and slow with returning papers. NEVER returns emails even during his exam/portfolio week. FRUSTRATING TA!
7948,545033,1.0,3.0,"the worst professor I've had at UVA. Very pompous and loves to hear himself talk. I ended up never going to class because I couldn't hear him ramble on any more. He never listens to students when they have comments and is very condescending. There's also no syllabus which was really annoying. Not that hard of a class, just painful to sit through."
7949,545033,3.5,3.0,Amazing professor. Probably the most brilliant professor i've ever had. He will point out things that you wouldn't se in a million years and is entertaining. If you don't like the subject matter you may not enjoy the class but if you are interested you will love it.
7950,545033,3.0,3.0,syllabus&#63;
7951,545033,5.0,5.0,Secret Society!!!
7952,545033,4.5,2.0,"He's brilliant and interesting to listen to - he'll stretch your mind and make you laugh. He tends to keep the class late sometimes. He grades papers fairly easily, and calls out students when they sound like pompous idiots. He's very understanding if you need to turn a paper in late. He usually doesn't give tests."
7953,545033,1.5,4.0,"Bennet constantly changes topic and repeats things instead of clarifying them.  He has high expectations for the amount of reading and doesn't make sense during lecture.  The class was supposed to be about comedy- Literature and Laughter- but the texts were not funny, and Bennet's attempts to explain how humor works were way over students' heads."
7954,545033,3.5,4.0,"Bennett is, unquestionably, the most intelligent teacher of my life.  Don't be surprised (or discouraged) if he sometimes goes into areas beyond normal comprehension.  He extremely willing to help you on papers and appreciates those who speak up in class.  Take any of his classes if you want to see the height of human intelligence."
7955,594190,5.0,2.0,"I LOVED Spanish 327! Best class I've ever taken, by far. Fernando did a spectacular job of engaging the class in the lectures. He's funny, creative, and has a good sense of humor. "
7956,594190,4.5,4.0,"Super sweet, kind, and a good prof. It's a hard class, but he'll help you if you need it, and his enthusiasm and cheerfulness rub off. You'll speak better Spanish too!"
7957,594190,5.0,2.0,"For any student that hopes to speak Spanish after graduating from college (who isn't just fulfilling a distribution requirement) this is a must take class!  Every day, I learned something new that I had been pronouncing incorrectly for the past 5 years.  Not difficult."
7958,594190,5.0,5.0,"Tejedo is AMAZING!  I've had 4 of his classes (Span in US, socioling).  He knows his stuff, loves what he teaches and has a great sense of humor! highly recommend his office hours in the very beginning of the course because the classes are all fairly difficult.  Stick with it, do reading - As are totally feasible. textbooks are copy packets"
7959,594190,4.5,4.0,"The class wasn't too hard, but the final was.  Tejedo is enthusiastic, fun and helpful outside of class.  I felt like the class really improved my pronunciation as well understanding and I enjoyed it a lot"
7960,594190,5.0,4.0,Simply awesome. He's ridiculously smart but so interesting.  Doesn't hurt that he's hilarious and super-cute in a nerdy kinda way.
7961,594190,4.5,2.0,"Even though the subject matter is rather boring, Fernando teaches it in an interesting way. he really is a great guy, and taking this class greatly improved my pronunciation and understanding of the structure of the spanish language."
7962,594190,4.0,3.0,"At first it is hard to understand Fernando's native accent, but you get used to it and you don't really get called on to participate, because he does all the talking! Not a hard class, either."
7963,1356051,2.5,4.0,worse professor ever
7964,1356051,1.0,5.0,"Phil does not deserve the title professor. He hails from Miami University and brings that school's mentality with him. He stated at the beginning of the class he knew nothing about this course and that the University had no one else to teach it. That sums it up! AVOID! The University should never use him as a temp., much less a teacher, again."
7965,45331,5.0,2.0,"Professor Urbanovich is an experienced man from Soviet Georgia, and many provocative topics can be discussed during the class PLCP2600. The reading is informative and relatively easy for students from other majors. "
7966,45331,5.0,2.0,"Is this guy a professor or a bard? Took this course way back in Summer 2015, you sit down, &amp; he just starts telling you stories from his life. Wanna explain late stage USSR corruption? Story where he was annoyed at a loud person in a Baltic state restaurant who the establishment wouldn't shush because they were literal mafia. A gem of a course."
7967,45331,2.0,5.0,TOUGH GRADER!!!! BEWARE!!!! you have been warned so my job here is done.
7968,45331,5.0,3.0,"YURI IS THE BEST! If you have the chance to take one of his classes, do it. He's such a kind, sweet man and as long as you at least try, you won't come out with anything lower than a B+. Show up to office hours and you'll get bonus points. There are few assignments but they're graded easily. Guaranteed you'll learn a lot AND enjoy the class."
7969,45331,5.0,1.0,"I love this professor! Class readings are completely optional. As a professor, he tends to have very long lectures instead of discussions but he obviously very much cares about what he is teaching! You won't get a good grade on the exam but everyone comes out of the course with an A. He is one of those professors who doesn't care about grades."
7970,45331,4.0,2.0,"Fascinating man and interesting class.  His lectures can get somewhat rambling and dull at points but he really is a fascinating man to listen to, especially near the end of the course when he teaches about the fall of the USSR by telling stories about his time growing up and living there.  Lots of outside reading that is kinda dull"
7971,45331,4.0,2.0,"I took The Rise and Fall of the  Soviet Union. Professor Urbanovich's lectures are fascinating. He has amazing stories about his life in the USSR. Readings can be very long and boring but his lectures make up for it. As long as you participate, you should get an A. Very easy grader. He cares more about how much you learn than grades. Great class!"
7972,45331,5.0,2.0,He makes the lectures interesting. Prepare your presentationgroup work EARNESTLY and don't miss class (you can miss one but no more than two). Readings are interesting but sometimes gets overwhelming.
7973,45331,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, very helpful, and very knowledge, Highly recommended!! He is a great lecturer, very clear, and very passionate about the course. "
7974,45331,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic Professor! Book readings aren't always necessary, but definitely do the collab readings. Tests are easy if you study and the final isn't bad either. Urbanovich wants his students to understand and entertains any questions, anytime. He is great!"
7975,45331,5.0,5.0,Great professor. I recommend to anyone interested in russian history.
7976,45331,5.0,1.0,"He is the best professor in UVA.  He genuinely wants his students to understand the material.  I liked him so much, i took another class with him the next semester.  TAKE THIS CLASS!  He is so nice!  No need to read the material. Go to class, pay attention and def. take notes."
7977,45331,5.0,2.0,"1 midterm, 1 final, and participation grade. Yuri gives a crystal clear image of Soviet history. Exams are fair as it consists of mostly core material that we talked about in class or read in the exam; only a few obscure facts are asked. Most important is still to note every single word Yuri says in class!"
7978,45331,4.5,2.0,"Professor Urbanovich is an extremely knowledgeable and caring professor.  This class really helped me understand the Soviet and post-Soviet periods of history.  Not only that, but I looked forward to the class each week because Prof Urbanovich was funny and engaging.  I would definitely take another course from Prof Urbanovich!"
7979,45331,3.0,3.0,"Ok, he's a nice guy, but beware: this is not a typical USEM.  It is a lecture, not a discussion.  If it is a discussion he tends to take over and suddenly we (the class) were wrong about something.  He's really opinionated and assigns an unearthly amount of reading.  Class was mostly made fun by Facebooking each other about the funny things he says"
7980,45331,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Urbanovich has a wonderful lecturing style, telling stories about Russian politics and the history of foreign policy in the USSR and Russia.  He gives quizzes and tests requiring you know dates and have read the chapters assigned.  He is a very fair professor."
7981,45331,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, easy to understand and takes a real interest in his students."
7982,45331,4.0,1.0,"This class is amazing-- even if it is really early in the morning. Urbanovich is a great professor and lectures are very interesting. If you have any interest in the USSR, or just foreign affairs in general, take this class!"
7983,45331,5.0,1.0,"My friends, I would say that Yuri is one of UVA's finest assets. His classes are worth it for the anecdotes alone. Tests are manageable, and if you want to understand what life in the Soviet Union was really like, he's your man."
7984,45331,5.0,3.0,"OMG!!! I can honnestly say that he is the best prof. teaching at UVa right now.  I had 0 interest in Soviet/Post-soviet history and politics before taking his class.  Mind you it was J-term and we had to be in class for 5 hours a day, yet I looked forward to hearing him talk everyday.  He is highly knowledgeable, VERY engaging, caring, kind, funny."
7985,45331,2.0,2.0,"A self-motivated class -- students have to do the reading and participate, or they won't get anything out of it. Readings are excellent, lectures are long and sometimes unfocused. Very little class participation most of the time -- &quot;seminar&quot; becomes 2.5-hour lecture."
7986,45331,3.5,1.0,"This is a great class to take- just not on Monday mornings for 2 1/2 hours. Lectures can go on, but the material is easy"
7987,45331,5.0,3.0,Urbanovich is the man. I had no clue about Soviet politics/Russian history before taking his class and now feel like I can have an informed conversation about anything to do with Russia. He was a weapons control diplomat before becoming a professor so he has incredible stories and class always fly by. TAKE IT
7988,45331,4.0,2.0,"This was a jterm class, so inevitably there was a different feel (i.e. stress-wise); however, prof. Urbanovich is very fair, funny and will make 5 hours of class worthwhile. I had no interest in his subject prior to this class, but i am considering the concentration in FA for this region now. Great class, very knowledgeable!!!"
7989,45331,5.0,2.0,"Yuri is one of the best professors I've had at uva.  His adorable accent and good looks along with his lectures, film screenings, helpfulness, and eastern europe experiences makes this class enjoyable.  He makes you want to go to class and learn.  In the end, he wants Americans to be familiar with russia and eastern europe!"

7992,45331,5.0,3.0,"this man really knows his stuff. his lectures are always engaging and his personal anecdotes are always amusing. having studied (and taught) international relations at a prestigious Moscow university, there's no better professor to take."
7993,45331,5.0,1.0,HE IS AMAZING. he is very cute the way your grandpa is. has the best accent ever. laughs a lot. anectodes from Russia where he studied during the Soviet regime. very helpful and outreaching. even though it had been 2 years since I've taken his class it is the first techer i'm rating! take his class.
7994,45331,5.0,3.0,If you're interested in learning anything about Russia or the Soviet Union don't pass up a chance to take his class!  He is AMAZING!
7995,45331,5.0,4.0,"He's the man, coolest prof in the university, always nice, funny, smart, and interesting.  Big ups to the juggernaut from Georgia."
7996,45331,5.0,3.0,"He's adorable!  Prof. Urbanovich is an extremely interesting and engaging speaker, and he has first-hand knowledge of many of the most interesting times in Russian history.  You will learn a lot from him, particularly through his own anecdotes.  Take this class for an enlightening experience!"
7997,45331,4.5,2.0,"Great class, great teacher who really know swhat he's talking about. He goes out of your way to help you and make sure everyone knows what's going on. Cutest russian man with the cutest accent. One of the best professors I've had."
7998,45331,3.5,1.0,"easy class, quizzes are graded easily (10/10 = A+, 9/10 = A, 8/10 = A-, etc), movie review & essay are easy too.  Readings are sometimes dry."
7999,45331,3.5,3.0,It was an okay usem.  Quizzes are harder than I expected but he graded relatively easily.  He's a very nice man with a great accent.
8000,45331,4.5,2.0,fun to listen to. very engaging and helpful. very enlightening. one of my favorites. I highly recommend him to anyone that doesnt know much about russia
8001,45331,5.0,2.0,Awesome class. Yuri is a ****.
8002,45331,4.5,3.0,"Great class, although the room gets hot.  Interesting, powerful speaker.  Textbook is wordy, but he is interesting and good."
8003,45331,4.5,3.0,"Take this class, Yuri has a great understanding of USSR and Russian politics and has great anecdotes, plus a great Russian accent."
8004,45331,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Urbanovich is the best professor at UVA without tenure.  If you want to learn Russian/Soviet politics from an insider's perspective, you MUST take one of his courses.  The work wasn't too difficult, and if you stay engaged in the class, you will be rewarded."
8005,45331,5.0,3.0,"cant go wrong with this class.  he goes the extra mile, constantly has extra review sessions and reaches out to interested students.  very interesting material as well.  great professor"
8006,45331,4.0,1.0,"He's very nice and likes lots of discussion. Sometimes lecturing can get slow, though. Almost no work and relatively easy tests. But it's still good if he knows you and likes you!"
8007,45331,5.0,1.0,Great prof! Really knows what he is talking about but goes off at a tangent A LOT and cannot stay on schedule
8008,45331,3.5,4.0,"Likeable teacher, definitely a harder USEM though."

8011,45331,3.0,2.0,Him talking about his own like experiences was always more interesting class
8012,2732312,1.0,5.0,"By far the worst professor I've ever had. Several recorded online lectures had no audio, and his response was just that he'd look into it for future lectures and just read the notes. He has office hours, but doesn't help with anything but very specific questions and just says to look at the solutions to the homework."
8013,2625817,5.0,3.0,"Saucerman is a fantastic professor. His lectures tend to be a little long, but the content is interesting, and he uses Kahoot and other tools to foster in-class participation. He also gave minimal extra credit for test corrections and participation (so don't rely on it). Problem sets were challenging but stimulating - great class overall!"
8014,1765690,5.0,3.0,"Going into this class I was worried because of all the reviews but I really enjoyed it and learned a lot! As long as you're willing to do the reading, you'll be fine so don't stress too much! Really loved the class and he's a great professor!"
8015,1765690,3.0,4.0,Three exams (lowest can be replaced by clicker score) and a final make up your grade. There's two textbooks with what feels like endless readings per night. Very specific test questions. Might've been easier for me if I had a background in stats.
8016,1765690,2.0,4.0,"You have to read the ENTIRE TEXTBOOK to get a decent grade. His exams are incredibly specific and although there are extra clicker points, you really have to put a lot of effort into this class."
8017,1765690,2.0,4.0,"The tests are extremely specific and require you to basically memorize everything that you read in the textbook. If you do not especially like psychology or don't completely believe in all of its studies and theories, you probably won't do well. I've heard good things about taking social psychology with other professors, don't take it with Smyth."
8018,1765690,1.0,5.0,"DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS WITH SMYTH.  This has been my least favorite class at UVa, and it's because it is unreasonably hard for an intro level class.  The exam questions are poorly written and incredibly specific, and you WILL read the entire 600+ page textbook if you want to pass. Save yourself from this because I wasn't able to."
8019,1765690,3.0,5.0,The class was extremely difficult for an intro course and he is a good lecturer but doesn't care about you as a student.
8020,1765690,2.0,4.0,This class was unreasonably difficult for an intro level course.  Take it with another professor!
8021,1765690,4.5,3.0,"Probably my favorite professor that I've taken a class with in five semesters at the University. His lectures are very entertaining, incorporating effective live examples and media to illustrate the subject matter. Assigned all 650 pages of the textbook to read (slightly overwhelming, though worth it), but otherwise there were no other assignments."
8022,1765690,4.5,4.0,"Even though the content of the course in very dry, Smyth manages to make it interesting. He is very funny and makes the lectures kind of interesting. the only problem is that the readings are endless, and you have to do they to answer the clicker questions. Even though you do your readings, there will always be a tricky question on the test. "
8023,1765690,4.0,2.0,"Professor Smyth is wonderful. His lectures are typically very engaging and he is for the most part very clear in what he expects. There is quite a bit of reading however. Usually at least an hour and a half worth per class. Unfortunately, this reading is absolutely essential as about +60% of all of the tests are based upon it. "
8024,1765690,4.5,4.0,The class is extensive but the professor is extremely clear in his lectures and provides excellent help during his office hours.  He truly is there to help you and be there for you!  Just don't slack off in the readings and you are golden for the semester!
8025,1765690,4.0,3.0,"Prof Smyth is one of the nicest, most approachable professors. He also does chin-ups at the AFC ;) I failed my first exam miserably and went to him, and he helped me out with studying for the next few exams. The class requires reading (clickers galore!) and the labs are easy. Midterms are split between Collab and paper. Great guy, Smyth  Morris :)"
8026,1765690,4.5,2.0,"Great Prof, very approachable and helpful. I would definitely recommend taking 1010 with him. Be sure to study the powerpoints as well as the book for the tests. If you work hard you'll get an A or B without a problem. Be sure to do the readings though, he gives bonus iclicker questions every class and they can really help your grade."
8027,1765690,4.0,3.0,"Professor Smyth gets a bad rap because his voice is somewhat monotone, but I loved having him as my professor for this class. He tries to make the lectures enjoyable, is extremely smart, and made an effort to remember me even though the class was huge. You do have to put forth work to do well though."
8028,1765690,3.0,4.0,"DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU PLAN TO MAJOR IN PSYC. The amount of reading is insane, the lectures are boring AND unhelpful, and the tests are really hard. I took the class because people always rave how psyc courses are really interesting but psyc 1010 bored the pants off of me."
8029,1765690,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, he really wants you to succeed. Knew my name after the first day and never forgot it. Tests are easy so long as you do practice problems and ask him for help if you're confused. He made an intimidating subject a fun one. Definitely would recommend!"
8030,1765690,5.0,2.0,I would definitely recommend his course! He is a very nice guy and he offers generous extra credits. There are three midterms and you can drop your lowest grade of the three.
8031,1765690,4.5,4.0,"He is the man! Nice, helpful and kind. He explains everything clearly and always applies theories to life experiences. Tests are hard: filling-in-blank requires memorization of almost entire textbook. His tests also cover lecture stuff. I spent a lot of time studying and ended up with an A-. I recommend this class as a good intro to psychology."
8032,1765690,2.5,4.0,I do NOT recommend this class with him. Apparently he is a great teacher of other courses but this was his first year teaching social psych and I had a terrible time with it. The textbook readings were very interesting but his tests are SUPER specific and you have to basically memorize the entire textbook to get a good grade. GOOD LUCK.
8033,1765690,5.0,2.0,"Smyth is a great, friendly, and helpful professor. It was an 8am so a bit hard to focus in the mornings and his voice can kinda lull you to sleep. Must read textbook to keep up & do well on tests but his powerpoints are also important to guide you towards what you should study. A bit of a curve on the tests helped too."
8034,1765690,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Smyth is amazing! He is really enthusiastic about what he teaches, tries to relate it to funny material, and is great at answering questions and holding office hours. Tests in PSYC 3005 weren't hard, and I'd recommend him for any class."
8035,2617661,5.0,3.0,I took Prof. Fernandez J-term Spanish 2010 class and it was the best experience I have ever had with taking a language. You can tell that he honestly cares about you and wants you to enjoy being in class. He doesn't put you to sleep with grammar and ties it to relevant interesting topics that a younger generation likes. Also he is SUPER CHILL!!!
8036,1716542,2.0,3.0,"The flipped classroom method is not for everyone. If you are already good at Math then I recommend you take this class, but if not, it is very difficult to learn straight from videos. She also does not explain clearly when asked questions in class."
8037,1716542,5.0,2.0,"4 exams, participation, weekly assignments and sometimes quizzes that all count to your grade. Mor uses the 'flipped classroom' method of teaching which explains material extremely clear. She makes complex mathematical concepts simple which is perfect for Applied Calc level. Exams are very straightforward, just need practice."
8038,135494,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor, his teaching style is in a Socratic seminar fashion, and he has very insightful thoughts and comments. Always listens what student have to say. There is no one right answer with him. If you interpret something one way and have evidence to back it up then it is worth discussing. Very laid back, he is definitely a more relaxed guy."
8039,135494,4.5,3.0,"incredibly interesting, smart, and funny. he was approachable and made going to class exciting. also really helps with papers and is very understanding and willing to work with students. overall, one of my favorite classes/proffs at UVA-- highly recommend!!"
8040,135494,4.5,1.0,great teacher. Sometimes did not wear shoes during classes. you are guaranteed to be entertained by him
8041,135494,2.0,4.0,"you're kidding, right&#63; excellent LECTURER&#63; often late, rarely organized. at his best, cracked good jokes. at his worst, disected the wrong assignment."
8042,135494,4.5,4.0,"One of the best professors at UVA, hands down. He is so intelligent, super witty, and his classes are great experiences. He is a rock star of academia and UVA faculty, specifically."
8043,135494,3.5,2.0,Cool guy. Class is actually enjoyable and interesting most of the time.
8044,135494,4.5,2.0,No Comments
8045,135494,4.0,2.0,"This course on conspiracy films is amazing - and the professor even more so. The class discussion makes attendance worthwhile because everyone has something insightful to say. Most of the films I would have watched in my spare time anyway. Lott is magnificent-always something  intellectual to emphasize. If you have a chance, take a course with him."
8046,135494,5.0,3.0,"Post-War Film was amazing. He's great in lecture and is wonderfull outside of class with helping on papers or just discussion. Unlike some film studies professors he actually rewatches the films so he has specific scenes to talk about, not just vague theories. He has a great choice in films and looks like a washed up rockstar. Take him if you can."
8047,135494,5.0,3.0,"eric, so HOT in those red boots! a 1980s**** star, went to uni and made it big time!  you'll love him. his classes are awesome!"
8048,135494,4.0,3.0,he is definitly an interesting guy

8050,135494,4.0,3.0,"I definitely found Lott to be one of the most interesting professors I've had (check out his wardrobe), but sometimes I found his lectures to be a little scattered.  I feel like he is probably much better in smaller, more intimate classes."
8051,135494,5.0,3.0,America in the Movies was a GREAT class - one of the best of my undergraduate career. Great teacher - very cool and funny.
8052,135494,5.0,3.0,Lott is smart and funny! The 1970's course is the best course I've ever taken.
8053,971093,2.0,4.0,"took this class because exams were online and the content seemed easy. I did enjoy the content, but the grading sucked. There are two huge exams and you won't know what you get wrong, at all. You also have no guidelines for how they should be completed. She wants you to write a book. Homework assignments are confusing. Barely used books."
8054,971093,5.0,3.0,"I really liked this professor and class. I felt like I learned a lot and I like the way she builds up incrementally using a variety of materials. I particularly liked the use of media and 3d immersive materials in class, it made for an immediate learning experience."
8055,971093,5.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher and really nice woman! Loves what she's talking about and is so interested in history. Willing to take questions and explains them very well! Also, offers extra credit opportunities. Only two tests, but each test is only 2 questions and have to write an interpretation of the work! Would take again!!"
8056,971093,5.0,3.0,"I really liked this professor and her course. She is kind and understanding, and offers a variety of materials by which to learn, including ppt notes. I can't say her class was difficult, even for non majors. You'd have to be super lazy not to do well. Would def recommend!"
8057,971093,2.0,5.0,"Anastasia Dakouri-Hild was interesting, but not a good professor. The test and quizzes were extremely difficult unless you were an art history major and the midterm was the hardest test I've ever taken. The textbooks were zero help, and discussion had nothing to do with the course. Anastasia didn't care about her students and yelled at. DONT TAKE."
8058,971093,3.5,5.0,"This professor seems like a good one, but the few tests and little feedback on the tests make this class rather hard. It was almost as if you had to read the professor's mind to know what answer she wanted on the free response exams. I felt as if I knew all the material very well, but still did not manage to do very well on tests. "
8059,971093,5.0,1.0,"Dakouri-Hild was by far my favorite professor this semester. Her class was fascinating. Easy to get points by doing weekly assignments and showing up to class (clicker points). She clearly is fascinated by the subject and rather than expecting us to memorize pieces for tests, she asks us to think about them. Her presenter notes on ppts are super!"
8060,971093,5.0,3.0,"A lovely person and a very effective teacher! She just has that special touch in the classroom. Very engaging lecturer, though I will admit I was distracted by her great looks and high heels... drool-worthy."
8061,971093,5.0,4.0,"My favorite professor at UVA so far. The course is a little front-loaded and intense, but she's so nice with students and passionate about her stuff, I felt stimulated and engaged throughout the term."
8062,971093,5.0,2.0,"I learned a lot, without ever feeling overwhelmed. Prof. DH is funny, nice and engaging."
8063,971093,4.0,3.0,"She is extremely helpful and is very open to suggestions/comments. Course objectives are clear and grading is fare. If you want to take arth, take it with her!"
8064,971093,4.5,2.0,Very understanding and helpful teacher!
8065,971093,4.0,1.0,A fair professor without the podium attitude - some of the best visuals I've seen in campus. Cute accent too!
8066,971093,4.5,2.0,"This was one of the hardest classes I took this year. But definitely worth it. For one thing, unlike other Art History courses, prof. DH does NOT expects students to memorize, but to think. I loved the archaeological context in which she places ancient art. Makes much more sense to do it this way. Great class, but be prepared to work for it!"
8067,971093,5.0,3.0,"Great prof. She really cares for her students, and is very smart."
8068,1511770,5.0,1.0,She is awesome.
8069,2085219,1.0,3.0,Worst teacher I've ever had at UVA. He made easy concepts confusing and made huge mistakes on some of his tests/grading.
8070,2085219,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Yung was an inspiration and I wish he taught every class at UVA.  If you're ever doubting a professor to take, it's Dr. Yung."
8071,2085219,4.0,4.0,"Very smart.  Clear, but moves fast.  Pay attention."
8072,2208108,5.0,2.0,Professor Roach has been one of my very favorite professors I have had the privelege to take. Attending her class was a joy! I feel like this course not only increased my knowlege of the subject material but also made me a more efficient student and significantly improved my data interpretation skills. I would highly recommend this class!
8073,946546,5.0,3.0,THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER!
8074,946546,5.0,3.0,"I had absolutely NO knowledge of the subject before taking the class, in fact I was terrified of it. But Calhoun broke it down very well so that it wasn't scary, he always had a well prepared outline for lectures, but would also take time out to explain anything anyone was unclear on. Just go to class and pay attention - you will learn so much."
8075,946546,4.0,5.0,hard professor!. he assumes that you understand the basics as well as some advanced topics. he keeps going and throws a crap-load of material at you in no-time. good luck if are taking him. Make sure to familiarize yourself with basic concepts before taking him.
8076,946546,2.5,5.0,"this professor is helpful but, his test are like 30 page booklets with only 4 problems but each problem has parts A thru Z, and you're suppose to finish it in an hour. Even if you study and have kept up with the HWs the test problems are still going to be extremely challenging. Let's not talk about the final exam. Good luck with this guy."
8077,946546,4.0,4.0,"Really clear and down to earth as the last poster said, but tests are insane and very hard to prepare. The average for the first test was a 71. Homework and labs aren't bad though."
8078,946546,4.5,3.0,"Excellent professor, really clear and down-to-earth."
8079,815491,5.0,1.0,"He is the nicest professor you will ever have! He cares about students so much, its insane. He came into visit us on Saturday while we were all working on our ICE project. He has such a kind heart, and truly is able to view himself inr our perspective. I LOVE PROFESSOR KEHOE!! I WISH THERE WERE MORE PEOPLE LIKE HIM IN THIS WORLD!"
8080,815491,4.0,1.0,"Kehoe is great!  He will come visit you in Clemons when you've been working on your project for hours.  He goes on tangents every 10 seconds, but that's what you've gotta love about him."
8081,815491,4.5,2.0,Prof. Kehoe is the greatest guy ever.  He's the most sincere professor I've ever had.  This guy could give me an F and I'd still love him.
8082,815491,3.0,1.0,"Kehoe is a big teddy bear, Im pretty sure. So approachable but runs wayyyyy off subject in lecture. Great guy though."
8083,1520006,1.0,5.0,"office hours are not helpful, he does not teach and then expects you to know everything, the tests and hw are stupidly hard"
8084,1552775,5.0,2.0,Have him him for many classes. Very genuine and a great guy. Loves Spanish and knows how to teach. Really makes the classes enjoyable. Just listen to him and you will succeed in his courses.
8085,1552775,5.0,2.0,Wonderful teacher.  This is the one class I don't fall asleep in.  Plus the tests are pretty straight forward and simple.
8086,815494,3.0,3.0,"Professor Marcel communicates the material well, but his introverted nature tends to rub students the wrong way. Not the most inviting of professors, but he does a good job of teaching the material. I personally appreciated his down to earth teaching style. Does a good job of refining students' answers in class without telling them they are wrong."
8087,815494,4.0,2.0,"Marcel is a great professor.  He teaches you a lot of material in a short amount of time, and is very down to earth.  He jokes around a lot and doesn't take the subject too seriously, which is refreshing.  Definitely do your reading before class!"
8088,815494,1.0,4.0,Jerk. unclear and terrible teacher. thinks hes better than everyone else. has no interest in students work at all. skips major presentations. inconsistent grading highlighted by a complete lack of interest in student's performance
8089,815494,3.5,3.0,"Strategy professor. Funny laid back guy, but he can be very frustrating. Difficult to please- most people think he doesnt like them. Ive had him for a year and hes still a big mystery."
8090,70026,4.0,3.0,"He returns papers/tests incredibly quickly, and with very useful feedback. I found his course well structured, and every paper he assigned helped my understanding. He is the sort of classicist who likes grammar a lot (I am not) - you'll need to be able to explain why words are in certain cases/moods, bc it makes up a lot of his exams."
8091,70026,5.0,2.0,"Really great teacher. Very patient, clear, not excessively demanding, and a really nice guy. Best Latin class I've ever taken."
8092,70026,5.0,1.0,"Best class ever. If you are interested in Greek Mythology at all, you should take this class. Very funny. It's pretty much a comedy riot in his class all the time. Even discussion sections are not miserable bc the TAs know their stuff. Tests are easy if you listen to him at all."
8093,70026,5.0,1.0,"I loved this class, it was so interesting.  Lectures were like story time where we got to listen to the soap opera of the gods/goddesses.  Tests are easy if you go to class.  TAs are helpful and good.  Definitely a wonderful class!"
8094,70026,5.0,1.0,"One of my favorite Classics professors, and very helpful with advice about classes, etc."
8095,1020318,4.5,2.0,"Took his Calc 3 class at Clemson, he's just a really awesome guy. Accent is tough at first, but you get used to it. Spends time both explaining concepts and giving you examples in class, the textbook is awful though so make sure to go to class. Weekly quizzes, but homework is all due on one day a week instead of daily which is nice. Recommended."
8096,1020318,4.0,4.0,Extremely sweet and helpful. Office hours very helpful for those who are not great with math.
8097,1020318,4.5,3.0,"Extremely nice teacher, really care about the students. Passionate and clear. Office hour is very helpful."
8098,1020318,5.0,1.0,"extremely great teacher, very talented and nice!"
8099,1020318,4.5,3.0,"Shitao is somewhat soft spoken and timid, but is extremely nice & intelligent. Sometimes he covers unnecessary concepts and doesn't go over many examples but coming to office hours is very helpful for clarification if you need it."
8100,2159009,1.0,2.0,"This professor is difficult to talk to and understand; he is brutal, does not like to admit when he is wrong and is overall a hassle to deal with."
8101,971174,4.5,3.0,Felski is awesome.
8102,971174,4.5,3.0,Very difficult subject matter but Felski makes it more navigable if you meet her half way and ask for help. She gives students a lot of freedom in their papers so they are actually fun if you get creative with them and they really help you on the exams because you have to become an expert on one of the essays to write a paper on it.
8103,971174,1.5,4.0,No Comments
8104,971174,2.5,4.0,Boring lecturer. It looks like she knows her stuff but I have a feeling that I could learn the same thing with a quick google search that I would learn in an hour in her class.
8105,971174,5.0,3.0,"This was one of the best classes I have taken at UVa. It's a greatest hits sequence of theorists that have influenced literary thought during the 20th century. Professor Felski does an amazing job of presenting difficult material with clarity. The class requires a good deal of close reading, but it's all interesting...definitely worth it."
8106,2404777,4.0,4.0,I was in Professor Behl's F1/10 Autonomous Racing Course and it was one of the best courses in CS I took during my time at UVA. Prof Behl's lectures are very enjoyable to listen too and he explains the concepts very clearly. You can tell he is an expert in the area of self driving cars.
8107,315822,1.0,5.0,She just sucks don't do it. It's not worth it AT ALL. 
8108,315822,2.0,5.0,she's a stickler for small details that normal people would not find necessary or reasonable to remember. everything is based on the lectures (which are based on the readings) so NEVER miss a class and NEVER skip a reading. before her I've never gotten below a B+ or had a final that took the whole 3 hours.
8109,315822,5.0,3.0,"Took her ten  years ago, and I can easily say that she was the best math professor that I have ever had. I learned a lot from her, and she is a true scholar of history and mathematics. Really not sure why the ratings are so negative, you will learn a lot from her, and I also thought that she was a great lecturer. I was willing to put in the work."
8110,315822,3.0,4.0,"DO NOT take this class if you are a first year.  The amount of reading is insane and overall the class is very challenging.  The material is interesting but the professor is not at all dynamic.  Exams are not too bad if you come to EVERY class and do all the reading (that said, I got an 83...A-...on the midterm, and I studied a TON).  Too much work"
8111,315822,2.0,4.0,"It's true - she's demeaning to most, and has a few favorites whom she treats like humans. She's pretty strict and VERY boring, reads from notes that she's used for ages, and reads from books for the rest of the class.  I can't say that I learned anything from her that I couldn't have gotten from the book. This is a horrible class, do not take it!"
8112,315822,3.5,5.0,"She is not a nasty person, only while grading. Grading scale is obviously subjective, though in person she is very nice. Old-fasioned strict teaching style. Quotes from the book in class because test answers must be verbatim. I found the course extremely enlightening, but if you must get a good grade; avoid; avoid; avoid. Stress not worth it."
8113,315822,3.0,4.0,"Very boring lectures. Proves everything, and throws in all these historical facts that are irelevent because she is also a History teacher.  Still have no idea what she was doing on the first day of class when she was writing in ancient egyptian and doing word problems."
8114,315822,1.5,5.0,"by far the worst class i've ever taken. she grades on an unknown scale that seems purely subjective. i used information from her lecture in a paper, which she proceeded to correct. reads to you in class word for word from the books."
8115,315822,1.0,4.0,"This class COULD be interesting. However, it wasn't. She sticks to the same information she has taught for several years. Her grading is very arbitrary and subjective. It quite possibly the most boring and pointless class I've taken to date. If it had not been a requirement I would have ran from the room on the first day."
8116,315822,1.5,4.0,"One of the worst, she remainds me the lady from 'Screwtage letter' by C.S Lewis. She has very strict and high stardard for the others. Her favoriate line is 'all I want is a cup of coffee that is properly made or a loaf of bread that is properly baked'. It seems such a small demand. However, she never found that a cup of coffee.(i.e. she is evil)"
8117,315822,2.0,4.0,"She is a cruel, nasty person and seems to enjoy spreading her wrath over poor students, save a few special favorites. You should definitely take this course if you want to feel like a pathetic excuse for a person for the entire semester."
8118,315822,3.0,5.0,"This is an interesting class, but she's a *tough* professor. Homeworks are long and proof-oriented. Tests are difficult, cumulative, and include proofs and calculations from homeworks and lectures. Other 354 sections are said to be easier and less history-based. Overall, she expects a lot, but she's pretty reasonable."
8119,315822,2.0,5.0,"Long hw that counted for nothing. Very anal about writing the proofs in her way,or skipping steps and restating the obvious.Many pts taken off b/c that's not her way, not b/c we don't understand the logics. Office hours r not helpful at all. She never answers ur questions directly.She asks how u did it. If I did it right, I wouldn't come to u!"
8120,315822,2.0,4.0,Worst math professor I've had.I'm a math major.She made the class very unlikable.All she does in lectures was restating the book.Then she threw long hw that required many hours.They only count for very small % of grade.She's anal about skipping steps and restating obvious things & took huge chunk of pts off for them.Office hr totally unhelpful
8121,315822,2.0,4.0,There are teachers who seek to help the entire class get it and then there are those who get satisfaction from making the majority of students feel like failures. Karen Parshall is of the latter type. Her teaching manner is very demeaning (&quot;That's high school algebra&quot;) and the grading overly picky. The only thing I learned from her was frustration.
8122,315822,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Parshall is an excellent professor!! She is knowledgeable, clear and VERY available to help and assist students in and out of class.  The course is challenging, but Professor Parshall is more than willing to help any student who is willing to seek it.  I couldn't recommend her more."
8123,315822,5.0,4.0,"Very good professor - knows her math, knows her history, class is a good blend of both.  Grading is fair and requirements, though tough, are not unreasonable.  Very approachable outside of class but doesn't seem to be the type to put up with any nonsense (turn OFF your cellphones people!)"
8124,315822,5.0,4.0,"Professor Parshall is very knowledgeable in the field of mathematics and history, and she is very fair, yet challenging.  I enjoy very much her lectures.  I have learned more from this course than any other math course that I have taken."
8125,315822,1.0,5.0,"this was the worst class taught by the worst professor on earth, it seemed like she tried to make the class boring.  who cares what year columbia university started their biology program&#63; NOT ME"
8126,315822,2.0,4.0,woah.... that's messed up
8127,315822,1.0,4.0,"She is mean, and grades harshly (some would say unfairly). I handed in a paper that was paper-clipped together. I got it back with a staple in it and a note &quot;this is a staple, stupid&quot;. I lost points for it."
8128,2306489,4.0,1.0,"Prof Fowler is more interested in the subject matter of her ENWR than in actually teaching about writing and inquiry. Make sure you attend class and participate, but the reading and watching the science-fiction/fantasy shows isn't absolutely necessary-- if you don't watch or read though prepare to be spoiled."
8129,1053138,5.0,2.0,"A great teacher who cares about his students and math, teaches well, and runs class efficiently. Also very quick at grading, he once returned grades from a test only 8 hours after it was done."
8130,1053138,5.0,3.0,Lecture of Prof. Ershov are clear focused and easy to understand. He gives detailed feedback of homework as well as exams. Best professor that I have met at UVA. I will definately take this his course again!
8131,1053138,5.0,3.0,"Dopest professor east coast no question. Will know your name by the second class, homework and tests back on time. You know how when people are talking in class profs will be like ""Janet did you have a question?"" but it's lowkey just a hint to get you to shut up? He actually cares. Interacts with the class. Tests are not a joke but there's a curve."
8132,1053138,5.0,4.0,Best math professor ever! Really considerate for all of his students and super smart. Would take any class he teaches!
8133,1053138,4.5,3.0,"He is an amazing teacher.  He knew everyone's name after the first week.  He returns all of the tests the next class.  He remembers what mistakes you made and is more than accommodating if you want to go over them with him.  Basically, he goes the extra mile and a half to teach you the material."
8134,1053138,5.0,2.0,"354 with Ershov is absolutely my favorite Math course at UVa. He cares about all his students, remembered everyone's name in the first class! Def take him if possible."
8135,1053138,5.0,3.0,"I'm not sure if Michael's still teaching 354 in the future, but bsolutely choose his class if possible. He's fun, smart and enthusiastic about maths. He understands the subject and what's important is that he knows how to guide his class to learn the material. He gives out hints on HW which are very helpful when you have no idea about a problem."
8136,856562,1.5,5.0,Worthless classes. The teacher was not prepared. I should have taken anything but this class. Grades were LOW
8137,856562,5.0,2.0,"Great guy. Loves what he teaches, and who he teaches. Open to discussions after class, including those involving career choices."
8138,856562,4.5,4.0,Great prof.; loves teaching; always available outside of class.
8139,856562,4.5,4.0,"Difficult material, but genuinely a nice guy and has straightforward lectures. Passes out Ch handouts and review guides which are really helpful (other sections don't do this) for tests. Hydromaint sucks but go to class and you should be fine."
8140,995835,5.0,3.0,She is amazing. Would take again.
8141,995835,1.5,1.0,"In a world of inclusion, this, the only special education course for mainstream teachers, should invalidate the so called quality of teacher prep at UVA. You watch whole movies where clips would do, discuss them on a superficial level, occasionally listen to textbook summary powerpoints, and get out early. Grading criteria doesn't ensure learning!"
8142,995835,2.0,2.0,"Even though the course claimed to apply to secondary and primary levels, she focused only on primary. Strategies and activities would never work with high school students! Spent bulk of class sessions on her own reading model, instead of exploring a variety in depth. Totally self-serving. Dull lecturer, and doesn't seem to care about students."
8143,995835,1.5,1.0,The TAs do most of the teaching. She doesn't seem to be interested in the class.
8144,995835,3.5,2.0,"I thought she was sweet. Her lectures aren't thrilling, but I really enjoyed the material. Pullen isn't the best in Curry but I didn't find her as bad as these other raters did. I would take the class again."
8145,995835,2.0,1.0,"Was hard to get in touch with in between classes, and didn't seem to care much about the class."
8146,995835,4.5,3.0,"She knows her stuff and teaches in a clear way with material you can use.  Treats students with respect, will do anything she can to help you learn and do well with the material."
8147,995835,1.0,1.0,No Comments
8148,995835,1.0,2.0,"Decent researcher, horrible teacher. Very disappointed considering she's teaching future educators. Very rude."
8149,733695,2.5,2.0,"He is a really nice guy and his lectures are interesting. However, I felt that he graded what were supposed to be easy assignments too harshly. The class was easy though and there was a lot of interesting discussion about the various media ethic issues."
8150,733695,4.5,2.0,"Amazing teacher. Encourages discussion. Light amounts of reading. No one is evere told they're wrong in the class.  Three mini papers, one 12 pager. No tests."
8151,733695,4.5,2.0,He is a great teacher
8152,733695,4.0,3.0,"It is very nice to have a professor who encourages discussion and who does not spend the whole class time lecturing.  He is a very smart and nice guy, and this class was probably my favorite that I have taken at the University so far.  I highly recommend him"
8153,733695,2.0,1.0,"Horrible, a complete waste of time.  Didn't even know what the guy was talking about half the time.  The other half we watched films and was quizzed about minute factoids from them.  Take this class if you identify with complete, utter randomness."
8154,2429450,5.0,1.0,Anthony was a super helpful TA and he made discussions fun. He was clear in his expectations and truly wanted us to succeed in the course.
8155,2429450,5.0,3.0,"Anthony is an easy going, approachable TA with a great sense of humour . He makes discussions entertaining and worthwhile. He often would go over readings to help the class gain a better understanding which really helped and he gave opportunities for extra credit, like peer reviewing essays. I would definitely recommend him as a TA for this class."
8156,2429450,5.0,3.0,"Anthony is the BEST! He was my TA for MDST and he is hilarious!! He made class fun, while still worthwhile - I was actually excited for my 10am discussion. He cut through the BS and made sure that we had meaningful conversations. His feedback on papers was also very helpful. 10/10 TA - one of the best I've had at UVa."
8157,2429450,5.0,3.0,"By far the greatest professor/TA I have had at UVA. He is hilarious and can make any class fun. He often connects concepts in class to anthropological questions that are really engaging and get you thinking. He grades fairly, and he really cares about every student and their success. I HIGHLY recommend taking a course with him."
8158,2429450,5.0,1.0,"Anthony is a fantastic TA- best one I've had at UVA so far! He is insightful when discussing readings, brings in outside examples that make content more relevant, and when he feels like we've covered enough he calls it a day. Would highly recommend him in MDST 2000, or any other class he may teach in the future"
8159,2429450,5.0,1.0,"Very easygoing, chill, yet helpful TA. Would definitely recommend taking it with Anthony"
8160,2429450,5.0,3.0,Amazing class great at relating and teaching. Funny guy and all around positive atmosphere definitely worth it.
8161,2429450,5.0,3.0,He is the best teacher ever. Really helps you to understand topics and understands college students.
8162,2429450,5.0,2.0,Anthony was my TA for my MED ANTH class and I truly feel as though I lucked out in having him. He made seemingly boring discussions very entertaining and does not shame people if they aren't the type to speak frequently in a discussions section. I would definitely take another class with him and hopefully this time with him as the professor.
8163,2429450,5.0,2.0,"Really cool guy, that made an otherwise boring discussion interesting with his humor and investment in helping students to learn."
8164,2429450,5.0,2.0,Anthony is a cool guy he really helps you if youre stuck and does a great job of telling you what you need to know. Hes very up front about what it is you need to and wont sugar coat anything. Would highly recommend taking his class hes hilarious and is just a real cool dude.
8165,2429450,5.0,2.0,Best TA I have ever had at UVA!! He genuinely cares about students and has an OPEN MIND and is HONEST which is hard to find at UVA... He also uses examples (that are easy to understand) to demonstrate difficult concepts from readings. 10/10 recommend
8166,2429450,5.0,2.0,"Pretty good for an intro class. He sometimes goes on tangents, but brings it back to the point. Actually learned something in this class."
8167,872971,5.0,3.0,Diana is the best math professor I've had since I started my college career. She is amazingly helpful. I missed a week out of a four week summer session and she still managed to get me caught up and I got a B+ in the course. Her exams go with what she teaches and she is awesome at explaining things in a way that's easy to understand. A+ Professor.

8169,2363918,5.0,2.0,Cristina is an amazing professor who gives every student the chance to succeed and works to make sure that all students achieve their goal. Cristina hypes up students when you do things well and is very communicative and easy to talk to. She makes every student feel important and like they belong in her class and she is very funny. 
8170,2363918,5.0,2.0,"Cristina is amazing. Her class for my ENWR was easy (gender and gothic), but I felt like I was really getting something done. She spaces out assignments well, gives extensions, supports all the arguments you make no matter how half baked. Easily one of my favorite professors so far."
8171,2363918,5.0,2.0,"Just such a wonderful, kind human! Facilitates meaningful discussions where everyone feels like their opinion matters. Respects your time and is flexible when you have issues/need an extension. So kind and easy to talk to!"
8172,2363918,5.0,4.0,"Cristina is warm, funny, and extremely intelligent. She's got a fantastic memory and makes a strong effort to know every student inside and outside the classroom. One of the kindest, most brilliant and articulate professors I've had the pleasure of getting to know. Ask her about her love for the Great British Baking Show!"
8173,2404887,1.0,4.0,"Very unorganized. Delivers change in materials untimely, usually before deadlines. Not a hard class, but a horrible professor to follow along with. Self-learning is sufficient."
8174,1716769,4.0,3.0,He is very knowledgeable and speaks in great detail and clarity. He is also engaging and funny. 
8175,1716769,4.0,2.0,"Incredibly kind man, gifted with a sharp mind and obvious joy in his subject. He's not a tough grader as long as you get what's going on, his lectures are about as organized as the average relg prof's (so...not very), and the books you'll read with him are a delight. O'Connor, Dostoevsky, and anything about marriage are particularly good."
8176,1716769,4.5,2.0,"Vigen is the BOMB. He is a relatively easy grader and actually cares about his students. He considers all of us as his children, and that is a rarity. He really wants to see you do well. I have taken two courses with him, and he is just the best. If you get a chance to take Dostoevsky with him, you should."
8177,1274405,5.0,2.0,"This professor inspires me every time, I have her. She is an amazing professor and mentor. Whatever she teaches is gold."
8178,2134566,1.0,3.0,He's very unclear and hard to understand.  He just kind of says something and expects people to automatically understand him.
8179,1552942,1.0,3.0,"She/they whatever she is.. s t i n k s. ""Kori"" only cares about herself and does not let people speak up. Her intentions at first seem great, but you learn quick that she is selfish and condescending. Her attitude and energy is negative. You cannot have a conversation with her unless it reflects how bad men are. Wake up Mr/Mrs/Them Field."
8180,1552942,4.0,3.0,"Professor Field is a great person with a lot of insight into WGS! Make sure you actually put in the work in the class and develop a relationship with her by going to office hours and the experience will be very pleasant. She doesn't tolerate slacking, so this is a must. She is a very caring and even motherly figure in lecture!"
8181,1552942,4.5,3.0,"Professor Field is amazing. She's incredibly passionate and cares for her students and tries to make things as clear as possible. She is always willing to help you, whether it's after class or in office hours. She's also incredibly nice. Tough grader with papers, but she makes the criteria clear and helps you do better with each paper."
8182,1552942,5.0,4.0,This was an incredible class mostly because of the professor. Cori was very reasonable and organized--assignments and readings were well selected and very thought-provoking. Made me rethink a lot of things.
8183,1552942,4.0,2.0,"Field is a knowledgeable professor who's skilled at teaching many perspectives and really utilizing an intersectional outlook. She gives credit to everyone's ideas but uses her extensive historical knowledge to support her claims. Lectures are interesting, tho reading journals can be annoying and student presentations take up a lot of class time."
8184,1552942,5.0,3.0,"Such a good professor, her lectures were always so interesting and engaging.  NOT a droning history professor by any means.  Reading and coursework was different and interesting as well, lots of room for exploring own topics!  Highly recommend her!"
8185,1552942,5.0,3.0,Cori Field is the BEST professor I have ever had at UVA. She truly cares about her students and is always more than willing to meet outside of class to discuss or clarify anything. Her passion for history makes her an interesting and engaging lecturer. She even comes to discussion sections to hear the ideas of her students. TAKE HER CLASS!!!
8186,1380914,4.5,2.0,"Mr. Dizinno was a fantastic and deeply intelligent teacher, I thought. Of course he's new but just the quality of his ideas . . . can't believe you guys didn't get his personal stories . . . they all tied into the lessons quite logically and, to me at least, they proved really useful."
8187,1380914,2.0,3.0,"Easily the worst TA I've yet to encounter at this university. Granted, I had him during his first semester of teaching, but still. His sections were completely unstructured and he often went on long-winded rants about his own experiences. On the plus side, he's a fairly lenient grader and doesn't expect any extra work on his students' part."
8188,528948,5.0,3.0,Great professor! Challenging class but worth it!
8189,528948,5.0,3.0,"taking cs101E with him now. Excellent prof! (I can't read his writing on the board, tho.)"
8190,528948,1.5,5.0,This man's class was the hardest I've ever taken and for no reason.  You will dread going to class for fear he'll call on you just to mock you for not knowing the right answer.  His assignments are impossible and will consume all of your time (many all-nighters).  Best wishes to anyone who has to take one of his classes especially CS414.
8191,528948,3.0,5.0,"Really challenging programming assignments. I recommend that you get a partner, if you want to survive them."
8192,528948,2.5,4.0,"Class is what I expected, but Humphrey is, well, an ****. He'll call people out in class and make fun of you if you don't get the question right. If you don't know the answer for sure, don't raise your hand or claim ignorance. It's better to bear the &quot;I don't know&quot; embarrassment rather than have the man mock you."
8193,528948,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher! Really knows the material! very challenging, though. Best class I've taken at UVa."
8194,528948,1.5,5.0,No Comments
8195,528948,4.5,3.0,"Good teacher, interesting class.  Tough assignments but with work you can get through them and learn something."
8196,1479223,1.5,2.0,"Attendance is optional except for some required quizzes, which is nice, but then when it's time to look over quizzes, her explanations will be mostly incomprehensible...they don't make sense. She's a nice girl, but if you need a TA that will help you through the class, I urge you to choose a different one."
8197,1479223,4.5,3.0,I found Fatema to be extremely helpful and attentive during her TA sessions.
8198,1479223,1.0,3.0,Might possibly be the worst t.a. No preparation before class and very unprofessional. I felt like I was more lost after discussion than when I went in. Not helpful at all.
8199,184891,1.0,2.0,"For a professor teaching in the Engineering school, has very little understanding of any sort of technology. Uploads 40 page pdfs with pages all rotated differently, can't upload files to collab correctly, constantly has students explaining basic things like Google Drive to her. Frustrating to watch."
8200,184891,5.0,4.0,Professor Neeley was the probably the single best course instructor I had during my time at U.Va.  She challenged me to think of engineering as more than just technical achievement without a social or ethical context. I am a better business professional thanks to her.
8201,184891,3.0,3.0,Neeley is very serious about the material and wants you to be into it. Jonas Hart was one of my favorite TAs ever. Just learn the main points of each reading and you should do fine.
8202,184891,1.0,5.0,Horrible class. Learned literally nothing from it and it can make you very frustrated because it seems to be the same no matter how hard you try.
8203,184891,2.0,4.0,"Most boring class in history. Assignments are borderline idiotic, with prompts that let you know you have to BS to get it done. Readings are terrible. Lecture is disorganized. Professor seems to be rather stuck up. PhD in English, teaching a bunch of engineers random philosophy. Suffer through."
8204,184891,2.5,3.0,"Says some interesting things sometimes, but other times you walk out of lecture irate that 75 minutes of your life has vanished.  The papers weren't too bad, but be prepared to make something up to meet the word count requirements."
8205,184891,1.5,4.0,Absolutely terrible class.  Every lecture is the same useless material and she acts like it is the most important thing that has ever happened to you.  She won't admit defeat and comes across as slightly arrogant.  Do not take STS if you don't have to.
8206,184891,3.5,3.0,"So much reading. Thinks that engineers just think they work hard, and tries to tell us we don't.  Many useless readings.  Test is difficult even if you read the readings because multiple choice questions are basically opinions.  Suck up."
8207,184891,1.5,3.0,Worst ever.  Pompous attitude seething underneath endless discussions of the most trivial subjects you can think of.
8208,184891,3.5,4.0,"HARD, but fair. Interesting discussions and topics.  I felt like I got the same grade no matter how hard I tried. Great teacher, but requires a lot of work and attention in class."
8209,184891,1.0,4.0,Addicted to the word 'notion' and will get it stuck in your head.  I also got the same grade for everything on a wide variety of effort.  She'll make you work like an english grad student but as for herself&#63;..&#63;&#63;  *Seems like a very nice lady but treat her like you're stone-hopping across a rapid river.  1 wrong step and you're shtlisted.
8210,184891,2.5,4.0,"We do have other classes besides STS, and I have more work for this class than for any other class. Also, didn't tell us the date by which we had to read a huge book until the week before. Probably has killed 3 small forests from just the handouts she's given us so far this semester."
8211,184891,5.0,3.0,"Very impartial in class discussions; gives you the same grade for everything. BONUS: cooked us yummy dinner at her huge house and we watched a movie for the class afterward.  It was very nice, she is also very considerate and nice"
8212,184891,3.0,4.0,"Thought she was great and selected her again for ENGR302. Then the nitemare started. She wrote me recomms for grad school apps which she later WithDrew W/O telling me b/c another prof badmouthed me to her, thereby causing irreparable damage to my future. she sure can smile but ruthless"

8214,184891,4.0,5.0,"She'll make you read 300 pages per week, and she'll give you a terrible grade.  She plays favorites, and seems to give you the same grade on every assignment regardless of how hard you try.  Nice lady though, very hard, and bad grades. Boo"
8215,184891,4.0,5.0,"She's way too demanding.  I mean, we do have other courses that probably matter a whole lot more than TCC.  Nice lady and very into her work, but a Nazi behind the grading pen."
8216,184891,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Neeley was my favorite teacher this last semester. She admits when the material is a little boring and does what she can to make it better.  Overall, the class was interesting and the work required really helped to learn the material."

8219,2470459,5.0,3.0,"Professor Tate is fantastic! She's super sweet and has very informative lectures. You'll write quite a few essays, but they're not hard. Make sure you keep up with the readings, because there's a lot of them and it's very easy to fall behind. She makes the class super interesting!"
8220,782912,4.0,4.0,"I really like Professor Abramenko, she is so sweet and will help you any way she can. This is the weed out class for STEM majors, but she explains things so well that you will never feel like you won't pass. I would recommend having her as your professor you will learn a lot."
8221,782912,4.0,3.0,Had her for Calc 2. I liked how she explains things &amp; she was always really nice.
8222,782912,1.0,1.0,She's horrible. She rates herself. Avoid.
8223,782912,3.5,4.0,"Although I did retake this class , I would like to say that she is a very helpful professor. Yes, she will always ask if you have read the textbook but it is seriously something you should do to do well in the class. If you read the textbook, stay on top of group work, and go to office hours when needed, expect a B+ or A-. It's hard but doable."
8224,782912,3.0,4.0,"She has a very thick German accent which can make it difficult to understand her. She also has a tendency to get confused when students ask her questions in lecture, despite this she clearly knows her calculus very well and is excellent when helping students one on one."
8225,782912,5.0,3.0,"Really excellent professor. She moves quickly through the material, but is always ready to go back and explain when there are questions."
8226,782912,5.0,1.0,She is the best APMA professor I have ever had
8227,782912,4.5,2.0,shes cool. nice lady. i took in summer school and she gives us at least a 10min break. she deducts grade for attendance which kinda sucks if ur smart and can just show up for the exams and get 100's without coming to class. but its only 10%. She's cool with turning in homework late too. You should take her MATH 1140 class. She got german accent.
8228,782912,5.0,4.0,"Abramenko is one of the best professors I've had at UVA!She's personable and wants you to learn. Her office hours are very good when there aren't 100 people there. Linear Algebra is a difficult class to keep up with, the first few chapters can give a false sense of security. She's fun to listen to and really knows her stuff!"
8229,782912,5.0,3.0,The best APMA professor I've had yet.
8230,782912,4.5,2.0,"She's my favorite professor here- in all seriousness, she is very helpful and approachable and truly cares that her students do well.  I took her class once and failed it because I didn't try, and she let me take it a second time and I got an A, with her guidance and assistance."
8231,782912,3.0,2.0,Do not think that this is an easy class! Material is prety easy but test questions are not clearly worded so rather hard to figure out what exactly is being asked to calculate.
8232,782912,4.0,3.0,"I agree, if you go to class and do your homework EVERY night you will prob. be able to pull off a B+ if you are not a math whiz.  However if you are looking for an easy, don't do alot of work type of class, do NOT take this. office hours are mandatory for clarity.  Teacher is very nice and understandin, she will NOT curve any tests, not matter what"
8233,782912,5.0,3.0,"Loved her!! She was really nice and made the class as easy as possible.  I hadn't taken math for 4 years, so I had a rough start, but after meeting with her for 15min I have been getting A's on everything since.  She helped me understand what I was doing wrong, which kept me on track for the rest of the semester."
8234,782912,3.5,5.0,"Au contraire. I found this class VERY difficult. I struggled alot understanding the material and applying it on the exams. She is a very understanding and helpful professor though. If you like math, I would suggest it but be very careful from Day 1...ask for help!"
8235,782912,4.5,1.0,"Probably the nicest professor I've had.  This class is easy and applicable to the real world.  I'd definitely recommend it, and if you do the homework and study for the quizzes and tests, it's an easy A."
8236,782912,4.0,1.0,"It is a great class. As long as you go to class, you will get an guaranteed A+. Half of the class doesn't show up and says it was not as easy as they thought; it's because they didn't go to the class!"
8237,782912,4.5,3.0,"The class was not as easy as I assumed it would be, but if you work hard, A's are definitely possible.  Attendance and homework were not mandatory, but to understand the material, highly recommended.  I recommend going to her office hours for understanding and also so she can see you're making effort.  The exams feature a lot of extra credit."
8238,782912,4.5,2.0,"Didn't know what to think of the class before I took it, but I thought it might help me.  On the first day I realized she had an accent, and I didn't know if I would be able to understand everything, but I soon realized that she was actually a really good teacher.  If you just pay attention and do your work, you're fine.  She did a really good job."
8239,782912,3.5,4.0,"The class wasn't easy, the teacher did have an accent, but she is very helpful if you go to office hours.  Nice lady.  If you honestly do the homework then you will do decently well."
8240,782912,2.0,4.0,"German with terrible english. Says, &quot;because I said so&quot; to explain some answers."
8241,2683462,1.0,5.0,"I am a second year mech-e student and I have just started APMA 2120 with Julie Spencer. Recently they have redesigned this course to be more &quot;hands-on&quot; which is &quot;better for learning&quot;, but it is not. Julie literally doesn't teach. We are all lost with 7+ hours of homework a week. And it is only the 4th week of school. I have not learned anything."
8242,2683462,2.0,4.0,"Spencer is super unorganized: consistently comes to class late, almost never comes on time, makes excuses (ADD, covid, etc). Tests are difficult (department-wide average on first test was 64%). But, she is very understanding and kind to students. She is a good person but has too much going on, and it burdens her students."
8243,2560585,4.0,3.0,The course was difficult to understand and the readings were challenging but the course itself with a lot of thought is immensely helpful.
8244,651853,3.5,5.0,"This professor is brilliant, but you need to be well-read and intelligent to keep up with him. He can be hard to follow, but he is the smartest person I've ever met. His classes are absolutely worth taking. He is also incredibly helpful one on one. Thought-provoking, astounding--the perfect absent-minded professor."
8245,651853,1.0,5.0,"Prof. Kinney's lectures are impossible to follow due to his heavy use of unnecessary use of &quot;educated&quot; language.  Also, he starts on a point and then completely jumps to another subject without completing his initial claim.  AVOID!!!"
8246,651853,2.0,4.0,"If you cna fight through the the fog of flowery language you might learn something.  Very disorganized, lectures jump from one topic to another without following any coherent sequence.  Very nice man, however."
8247,651853,3.0,4.0,"Seemingly disorganized as a professor. You really, really have to pay attention to get the two or three true kernels of insight from each lecture. Doesn't use the text much. Very open to helping students, though, and very thorough..."
8248,651853,1.0,2.0,"I do not recommend taking a class from Mr. Kinney.  While he is a very nice person, his lectures are usually extremely difficult to follow.  He arrives late to class every day and also runs at least 5 minutes over.  There are 2 weeks left in the semester and he hasn't returned one graded paper to anyone in the class."
8249,651853,4.0,3.0,"I agree with everything the person before me said. There was not enough discussion- his response to every comment was &quot;[pause] I think that's useful...&quot; and then moving on to more lecturing. He's a really good guy though, understanding and helpful."
8250,651853,2.5,4.0,"His classes were hard to stay awake in. He has a hard time engaging the class, and talks more than he lets other talk. We read too many books in too short a time, and we did very few close readings.  However, he is lenient if you need to turn in a late paper."
8251,594517,2.5,5.0,"Just like everyone else has said...His HW is pointless and has little to do with the class. They're also graded incredibly hard. You will probably lose points (up to 75% deduction) for semantical errors, even if you convey all of the economic concepts perfectly clear. He is very set in his ways and won't bend to your whining."
8252,594517,3.5,5.0,Prof. Young is a good lecturer overall. The contents of his lectures were very interesting but takes sometime to fully understand them - there's quite a lot of intuitions behind what he says. The midterms were not that hard if you did the sample questions. But the final was REALLY hard - he tested very detailed stuff he taught during the semester.
8253,594517,3.0,3.0,class is pretty boring. midterms are just like the sample problems and pretty easy. Homeworks are impossible but you can drop them and make your final worth 60%. But the final isn't like the midterms and is very hard.
8254,594517,2.5,2.0,"His lectures are boring, but necessary if you want to pass the tests. If you do the sample tests, the exams are not suprising and relatively easy. His HWs are abo****ely pointless and totally irrelevant to the course, not to mention mind-boggling hard. His TAs suck, and he's not much help either."
8255,594517,2.5,2.0,"If you go to class- this course will be very easy.  If you don't, youre pretty much screwed.  Young is pretty arrogant and doesn't really care about helping students outside of class.  The homeworks are really difficult and aren't relevant to exams."
8256,594517,3.0,1.0,"pretty easy class. the tests are predictible, and his lectures are very outlined and logical. interesting guy but the homeworks are killer."
8257,37479,1.0,3.0,"This professor is incredibly unclear and often rambles on during lectures. I would not recommend anyone taking his course unless you are VERY interested in the subject he teaches. He has a way of making a valuable lecture completely boring and confusing. On top of this, he assigns an insane amount of work. Good luck to you if you decide to commit."
8258,37479,4.0,3.0,"Professor is incredibly knowledgeable. However, his course is heavily laden with reading on top of personalized reading projects. Definitely a grade you work for. He can be rather funny, however, there are time where I question his approachability. A bit intimidating in that sense- but have heard that he is kind. Have yet to notice but probably."
8259,37479,4.0,3.0,"Insightful. He knows a lot about the subjects. He wants you to, and part of that is discovery by reading the assignments."
8260,37479,2.5,2.0,"He is the nicest guy ever. one time i was having a bad day and he emailed me after class asking if i was okay. he's a little confusing sometimes, but this class is a relatively painless way to get your 2nd writing requirement. easy final/midterm, you just have to be vaguely familiar with the readings. sometimes he makes no sense but still great!"
8261,37479,1.5,3.0,"I would avoid this class and Damon. He is a confusing lecturer and you're never sure if what you're listening to is important. The slides are completely unhelpful. There are five essays, one which is a group essay, and one ten page final paper. The questions are unclear and he expects you to make random connections. Not a good experience."
8262,37479,4.0,3.0,"Damon is the man. He can be confusing at times, but he is passionate and well informed about his class. If you pay attention and skim the readings you'll do well."
8263,37479,3.0,5.0,"You get to learn interesting topics that are related to America, but the prof can be confusing. The essay questions he gives out are difficult."
8264,37479,2.5,2.0,"He clearly knows his stuff, but he is extremely confusing.  Even anthropology majors are likely to get lost.  It's not clear from his lectures or syllabus or any other official part of the course what you're supposed to learn.  It's interesting though."
8265,37479,1.5,2.0,"Damon picks out great books to read, and through them you do gather a good sense of the subject.  He openly states though, that his research is more important to him, and he spends a good deal of time on tangents and on name dropping during lecture. The theories that he incorporates seem arbitrarily chosen.  Beware, this man may make little sense."
8266,37479,2.5,4.0,Damon knows anthropology but I don't think this is his favorite class to teach of it and when he does it is biased towards his way of viewing it (you had better REALLY like Levi-Strauss).  The TA did basically teach what we should have learned during lecture.  Damon has a big tendency to go off on a very non-related tangent.  The TA saved us all.
8267,37479,1.0,1.0,all majors have to take this but God help you when you do.The only thing I learned in this class was which world newspaper is best to roll and smoke w/no joke.The man loves to talk but not about anything that comes close to the hist and thry of anth.The TA was a god send & eventually wound up teaching in section what we should have learned in class
8268,37479,4.0,2.0,"He is awesome.I love his class. His TA is also really good. Although u have to read a lot, it s a fun class. He is really clear and helpful. I totally recommend this class"
8269,37479,4.5,2.0,No Comments
8270,37479,4.5,4.0,"I took his Eco. & Soc. class. Beforehand, I had no interest in the subject but had an open mind. The class turned out to be incredibly edifying and fulfilling. Great, topic-specific readings offer insight into broader concepts. Damon's knowledge is voluminous, so he tends to go off on tangents in class, but overall he's great. My best prof at UVa."

8272,37479,1.0,4.0,"My worst experience in college.  He spent a 50 minute lecture in &quot;Everyday Life in America&quot; telling us about his previous case of malaria.  Bad reading, and even worse assignments.  He's also unclear about his policies (I recieved an F because o"
8273,37479,3.5,4.0,sexy in a rumpled kind'o way
8274,37479,3.0,3.0,"Quite clearly intelligent, if a bit confusing.  Wears cute sweaters with holes"
8275,37485,1.0,3.0,"A terrible human being. Condescending, a bully, insecure. What more could you ask for?"
8276,37485,4.5,4.0,Professor Luftig is easily the best professor I've had at UVA. He truly cares about his students and really really knows his stuff... but he's also super open to new student input and ideas. He can make any book interesting and relevant! 
8277,37485,4.0,4.0,Very helpful professor. Not an easy class but it's worth the work.
8278,37485,3.5,3.0,"I'm pretty shocked to see so many negative comments for Prof. Luftig. He really is interested in the material (Modern Irish Lit), and expects good analysis and visible effort from his students. I think he is a compassionate teacher and really wants everyone to do well."
8279,37485,4.5,4.0,"Took a graduate course with Victor on _Ulysses_.  He demands a lot from his students and can be VERY particular, but it's perhaps the single best class I've ever taken.  He's great at facilitating discussion and provides super-helpful comments (written and in person).  As a bonus, he's a funny guy!"
8280,37485,1.5,4.0,"He is a Horrible professor and person. In all honesty, the man is not all there and borders on creepy. I had to reschedule my final to take a graduate level exam (offered 3X/yr) and he refused to let me. He is Real pathetic. He loves to go on a power trip with 20 yr olds just to feel good about  himself and his bad teaching."
8281,37485,1.5,5.0,BAD.BAD.BAD. boring. bad lectures. mean professor. stupid exams. Study the entire semester just to identify quotes in 20 minutes. he is nasty too. discussion 2x a week. honestly such a waste of time. he talks in a monotone voice the entire lecture and is grossly condescending to students who go to office hours.  Avoid him if you have to take 383
8282,37485,1.5,5.0,He is a terrible teacher. 383 is required but if you can take it with someone else! He is a terrible teacher and not such a nice guy!
8283,37485,1.5,5.0,"He is the least compassionate and understanding professor I have met at U.Va. Don't get on his bad side because he is a bully and honestly does his best to make students life difficult if he wants to. I fell ill during the semester and he went out of his way to bully me and harass me. Despite the comments of this professor, beware!"
8284,37485,4.5,3.0,"Easily one of the best professors I've encountered at this university. His knowledge of Ireland and its literature is expansive, and he picks interesting texts for his students to read. Objective tests are fairly simple if you study, but he's a bit tougher when it comes to grading essays. Loves participation and really gets to know his students."
8285,37485,4.5,3.0,"I took the class expecting it to mostly focus on Modernism in general, but it ended up being almost exclusively colonial vs. post-colonial comparisons.  His lectures are organized and clear, but he focuses too much on Ireland.  He is funny though, and he seems like a great guy, my less-than-enamored feelings towards Ireland now aside."
8286,37485,4.5,1.0,"snore. i don't care about the history of ireland, i want to talk about the literature. he wasn't that bad...it was just such a boring class. having to identify quotes on the exams is horribly annoying. i'm ashamed this kind of testing exists at uva."
8287,37485,4.5,3.0,"Really fun class - he is able to run discussions that are low-pressure in a large class.  He also caters to those who aren't big in-class talkers.  Be aware that there is a good amount of history, but if you're interested in Ireland it's fascinating."
8288,37485,5.0,2.0,"Interesting class--lot of history and he tests on some obscure dates, but it's so much fun!  He's a really funny man and it's obvious he loves what he's teaching.  I really enjoyed it and learned a lot.  Take it if you are interested in Irish Lit at all.  I had him and his wife (Liz Fowler)  at the same time--they have some of the same quirks."
8289,37485,4.5,2.0,"Great professor and a really fun class, if you're at all interested in anything Irish. Lots of reading, but if you pay attention in class, you'll do fine. He loves participation and really goes out of his way to get to know his students. Very much recommended."
8290,37485,5.0,4.0,"Tons of work, tons of reading, but a fabulous, insightful professor!"

8293,1045105,5.0,2.0,"A genuinely great person and a clear lecturer. Has a good sense of humor and isn't boring to listen to. Recorded lectures are available but he does have iClicker questions so show up to class. 1 weekly quiz &amp; worksheet (open note, easy), no midterms, 1 final. Strongly recommend"
8294,1045105,5.0,5.0,No Comments
8295,1045105,5.0,1.0,"He is a great teacher to have for such a fast-paced course. It's my favorite class this semester. The information is difficult, but the way he puts things just makes sense. And if you ever miss class, just email him and he'll help you out in any way possible. Try to get into his class if at all possible if you love Latin or just want to know more!"
8296,2380414,4.0,1.0,"Honestly, the class is very easy but sometimes it felt like I was just wasting my time in there since you could skip class and still get an A on the quizzes."
8297,2380414,5.0,1.0,Take any class you can with Professor Kachru!
8298,2380414,5.0,1.0,"Best class at UVA, such an easy class that was both engaging and worth the time! I would 100% take another one of his classes. No exams or papers!!"
8299,1913484,5.0,3.0,"By ""textbooks,"" I mean the novels, which obviously you have to read. Fun, insightful, helpful professor. Gives good feedback and encourages student participation. Highly educational class. Novel well selected. "
8300,1913484,5.0,3.0,Really great sense of humor and knows his stuff.
8301,1077917,5.0,2.0,Dirk is always helpful and suuuupppeeerrrrr nice! (and not to shabby looking either ;)

8303,1077922,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed this class, and Professor De Wekker clearly cared a lot about the material. The lectures were clear and the tests mostly followed the slides, but make sure you read the textbook too. I'd happily take another class with him!"
8304,1077922,1.0,3.0,"One of the most boring classes I've ever taken in college.  De Wekker is inept and will put you to sleep.  He definitely enjoys the class, but it's no way to learn the (any) material.  By the end of the year I couldn't even go to lectures I was so bored.  I learned everything I know about the material through the book.  I feel  a bit cheated."
8305,1077922,4.5,3.0,"Really wants you to understand the material. He's enthusiastic about what he teaches and is very nice. Took mountain meteorology-- interesting class, readings were all from journal articles or modules online, not too much work overall except a paper at the end."
8306,1077922,4.5,2.0,No Comments
8307,2650786,5.0,3.0,Highly recommend! Helps you review the material thoroughly in discussion and makes everything very clear and accessible. Very organized. Would take any class with him as the TA in a heartbeat.
8308,594598,1.0,5.0,"One of the worst classes, probably followed by COM2010 also by Roger. This class was in enjoyable in every definition of the word. He lectured maybe 45 mins the entire semester. You would have a better time buying McGraw hill on your own dime. "
8309,594598,5.0,4.0,Good class and Professor Martin's end of unit reviews for Intro to Financial Accounting are super useful. Sends emails to congratulate students who significantly improve their test scores.
8310,594598,1.0,2.0,Gets paid to just make the students read the textbook while doing absolutely no work. I'm sure he's a smart guy but I haven't learned a single thing from him this semester and have the same style course with him again next semester because these are requirements to get into the UVA school of Commerce.
8311,594598,1.0,5.0,He is an incredibly unforgiving Professor. I had three deans send him an email for my extenuating circumstances due to very serious personal issues in order to grant me an extension on the exam and assignments and he did not respect it. Instead he asked me to prioritise his class over my everything in an email and refused to grant any extensions.
8312,594598,2.0,4.0,This course was by far the worse one I have ever taken at UVA. I am unaware of why he even gets paid to instruct the course when in reality our teacher is the online software and textbook. This class made me reconsider why one would pay so much for a UVA education only to be taught accounting from a computer-automated program.
8313,594598,2.0,3.0,Online class this semester. No actual lectures- did not teach anything. Left all learning to smartbook reading and questions and did really minimal if any work himself. Did not have any leniency with bumping grades and grading scale he used makes a typical grade percentage wise a whole mark lower. Strict on this after doing no work himself
8314,594598,5.0,4.0,"Beware of tricky homework, for they take time and practice to receive some ideal credit."
8315,594598,5.0,1.0,"This guy is very hot if you like suede buck shoes.  Hopefully he has upgraded from the polyester pants he showed up in a freshman at the University of Kansas.  he appears to have overcome the handicap of growing up in Topeka, KS."
8316,594598,4.5,2.0,"Very Helpful, always available"
8317,594598,4.5,1.0,AWESOME professor! Very well prepared for class... is available to help you when you need it. Research exams are a little hard but not if you put in a some effort. Best professor Ive had at UVA until now! Oh and really funny too!!
8318,594598,5.0,3.0,INCREDIBLE! Without a doubt the best professor I have had at UVA. Grading is fair and he actually makes accounting enjoyable. Take this class or find a class with him!!
8319,594598,4.0,3.0,Awesome professor! Without a doubt one of the best accounting professors i've had. He makes you think and challenges you. Very good class. A bit time consuming expecially with hydromaint but Prof. Martin actually can make accounting fun!!
8320,594598,4.0,5.0,Great teacher. Very patient. Open office hours are wonderful. The only thing holding him back is Hydromaint!
8321,1053351,5.0,1.0,best teacher EVER
8322,1053351,5.0,2.0,Easily the best TA at UVa. Kept the discussion fun and entertaining at 8am by always doing goofy and outside the box stuff. Proves that you can have fun and learn A LOT at the same time. It would be worth taking a class just to have Bartow as your TA. Go Braves!
8323,1053351,5.0,2.0,"Best TA I've had @ UVa. His funny/whacky sence of humor keeps the atmosphere light and enjoyable. Not only will you look forward to discussion, but you'll learn A LOT in the process. Go Braves!!"
8324,373415,5.0,4.0,"The proffessor sets up the class so that it is well designed legitimately engender learning and understanding. He avoids most of the handwaving that is so prevalent in many mathematics courses, and imparts a true, solid understanding of the material. His classes and lectures are solid and well-designed."
8325,373415,3.0,5.0,"Professor Rapinchuk is an absolute genius, and despite the accent, does a very good job explaining course material. Go to office hours, he's more accessible there. 2315 is extremely difficult. It is possible to get an A if you put in A LOT of work. That said, the tests are take-home. Everything is manageable, but be prepared to work a ton."
8326,373415,4.0,4.0,"Calc 3 honors is pretty hard, however no in-class tests. A lot of take-home assignments. Only take if you like math/good at it. Good professor tho"
8327,373415,4.0,3.0,"A capable and hard-working teacher. Gives out weekly comprehension quizzes, weekly (normal) quizzes, midterm, and final, but only the midterm is closed book. Midterm and final are difficult, so prepare to understand the material well regardless. Also, the book he assigns is difficult to understand, so listen well in class."
8328,373415,3.5,2.0,"While he does focus alot on the theory or the proof behind different equations, overall Professor Rapinchuk knows a lot about what he is talking about.  His method of grading for the honors class is to have open book comprehension quizzes (easy), open book homework problems, and then a closed note quiz on the same material.  No tests, save midterm "
8329,373415,2.5,4.0,"Very capable and knows materially perfectly. Unfortunately, his accent sometimes interferes with easing understanding. He also moves very quickly. Still he's always willing to clarify anything at the end of class. He's very calm and unanimated. I love that he always attempts to prove and derive everything which I think cultivates more understanding"
8330,373415,3.0,5.0,"yall are too hard on teachers with accents, i understand him. it's still a real hard class, if I could do it again Id go to his office hours all the time, I went a couple times and he's really helpful in office hours, much more than in class  I agree with the other guy, he enjoys being mean on tes"
8331,373415,2.0,4.0,Get someone else.  Unless you enjoy difficult tests and high-pitched Russian accents.
8332,373415,2.5,4.0,"So, yeah,  he's a little crazy...and Russian.  I took the honors course.  He'll prove the world before actually doing an example that will help you.  Lot's of theory."
8333,373415,1.5,4.0,"Definately not a fan.  Its not easy material by any means - but at least Rapinchuk could do something to make it easier.  He teaches straight from the book, right down to examples, and classes are about as interesting as Al Gore's personality."
8334,373415,1.0,5.0,No Comments
8335,373415,2.0,4.0,Tests way too long for such a short period. Enjoys being mean about tests a little too much!
8336,1962677,5.0,2.0,"If you are in the E-school and have the opportunity to have Professor Ma, take her class! She cares for her students and actually wants you to learn, not just pass the class. Her mastery grading system is great too. "
8337,1962677,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor! Her lectures are so well organized, and she makes sure students understand before moving on. The tests are not too hard as long as you do the homework. Also, she really cares about her students. I will definitely take her class again!"
8338,1962677,5.0,4.0,Great professor with concise lectures. Explains information and content very well and would highly recommend. Takes great effort in making sure content is understood. Homework is quite a lot but it's manageable.
8339,1962677,5.0,4.0,Manageable workload and great lectures. Absolutely fantastic professor who really works to make sure you comprehend the content thoroughly. Would take another one of her classes in an instant.
8340,1962677,5.0,4.0,"Class isn't easy, but Hui Ma REALLY cares about her students and helping them succeed. I had an issue with the teaching style and talked to her about it. By the next day, she had slightly shifted her teaching style in a way that was far more effective. Worth going to her office hours and talking to if you're struggling."
8341,1962677,5.0,3.0,best math lecturer I've had. very understandable and teaches concepts in a thorough but manageable way that I really appreciate. don't feel like I have to teach myself!
8342,1962677,5.0,3.0,I took APMA 1110 with Hui Ma and I am very thankful I did. She was awesome and really explained how to do the problems. She is the type of professor who doesn't like to waste time with proofs. She did examples through the whole lecture which I personally enjoy. Calc 2 is not an easy class by any means but taking it with Hui Ma is a good first step.
8343,1962677,5.0,2.0,She's an angel of a professor. Super nice and super fun to talk to. She does a lot of problems in class so you understand the material and really cares if you understand the concepts or not. She is the best professor for Calc 2 in my opinion.
8344,1962677,5.0,4.0,Hui Ma is one of the best math teachers I've ever had. Her classes are structured where you are discussing topics with your peers more than listening to a lecture. She is very effective in teaching and is very understanding. Make sure you do homework and stay up to date with reading assignments because classes are rooted in participation.
8345,1962677,5.0,4.0,Best math professor at UVA!
8346,1962677,5.0,3.0,"After having a terrible experience with the APMA department my first semester, Hui Ma is a savior sent from heaven. She is so far my favorite teacher on grounds and really cares about her students learning. "
8347,1962677,5.0,3.0,"She is a great math professor, she really engages the students and will repeat a topic as many times as necessary."
8348,1962677,5.0,3.0,"Everyone sleeps on Hui Ma because she is fairly new to UVA, but she is easily one of the best math teachers I have ever had. She teaches very comprehensibly and conveys concepts very clearly, exactly how you need to know them for the exams. Although she has an accent, it is not hard to understand her. I would definitely take another class with Ma."
8349,1782459,5.0,1.0,"He is very caring, and as long as you complete your homework, it'll reflect on exams. Practice speaking, writing, and listening. Your grammar is very really important! He gives you practice exams that are like his real ones. He's also really funny and makes a lot of jokes. Bilal is the goat. "
8350,1782459,5.0,2.0,"Bilal is extremely enthusiastic about teaching. I enrolled in Arabic for my language credit at UVA despite my linguistic challenges. I will be referring him to everyone since he genuinely cares about his students, and my Arabic conversational and discussion abilities improved drastically as a result of his teachings."
8351,1782459,5.0,4.0,LOVE BILAL.
8352,1782459,5.0,3.0,"Bilal has made Arabic genuinely fun, and even though it's an everyday class each class is engaging and makes my brain work consistently without getting burnt out. If you need a day off, that's fine. He likes to let go early on Fridays, too, lol."
8353,1782459,5.0,3.0,Bilal is amazing and inspired me to stick with Arabic.
8354,1782459,1.0,3.0,Not respected.
8355,1782459,5.0,1.0,I LOVE Bilal.  One of the best teachers I've ever had!!  He's very funny and super kind.  Super helpful if you need it and a pretty easy teacher.
8356,1782459,5.0,1.0,"AWESOME DUDE! Probably one of  my favorite teachers ever. Explains things very well, super super understanding of any problems you may be having, he is kinda a saint. I HIGHLY recommend him. "
8357,1782459,5.0,2.0,"Bilal was awesome! He's really nice, funny, super helpful, and excellent at presenting the material. I cannot recommend him enough."
8358,1782459,4.0,2.0,"Bilel was a great professor. His class was laid back and he was flexible with due dates for homework. He gave us ""survival"" arabic to learn how to communicate at airports and hotels. He does give a lot of homework but our class only met twice a week."
8359,2372283,4.0,3.0,"Benjamin is a nice guy who is a really really lenient grader. I turned in some weird papers and he was always consistent with his grading and MORE than fair. The classes are structured well and provide for conversation, not just lecture. Also love that we did not have to buy anything for the class."
8360,2372283,4.0,3.0,"SPAN2020 is full of busywork, but Prof Romero understands that and made sure that we understand the material. As a native speaker, he simplifies grammar forms bc the textbook sometimes overcomplicates things. You'll get a good grade if you get the E-Porfolio done by the end of the semester, ask him for grammar help, and learn the grammar forms"
8361,611015,3.5,3.0,"She's nice and tries hard, with good French (she's not a native English speaker).  She just seems tired all the time.  The TA I had last semester (Mr. James) was more fun and relaxed."
8362,611015,4.0,2.0,"Great Prof, she is willing to help.  Dont take the night class though, 2 1/2 hours is a long time."
8363,611015,5.0,2.0,"She is extremely helpful and nice.  The class may have been a long 2.5 hours, but she found ways to keep it interesting.  Very fair grader.  My favorite professor during my first semester!"
8364,611015,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, clear, helpful. Class moves fast, but it has to to cover 2 semesters worth of material in one. Study for the quizzes that are about every other week and you'll be fine."
8365,611015,5.0,2.0,"Mme. Ciudin is excellent.  She is enthusiastic, which is important for the 2.5 hour, twice a week section.  The class moves fast, but that's to be expected in intensive French.  I highly recommend her.  She is skilled at explaining tough concepts and willing to help students having difficulty.  Generous grader.  Very fair."
8366,611015,2.5,4.0,She is a good teacher but moves a little fast. SHe is not very good at explaining grammer and if you take the 2.5 hour class(trice a week) prepare to be bored. Class is nevertheless fun but she is an extremely strict grader adn classes do not prepare you for her tests.
8367,611015,5.0,2.0,Madame Ciudin is amazing!  She is one of the best professors I have had at UVA!
8368,611015,5.0,4.0,This proffesor is amazing..and so hot!!!
8369,611015,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher! Great pronunciation and very understanding and approachable. You won't be disappointed.
8370,611015,4.5,3.0,She is great! I adore her and will miss her when I have a different french teacher. She is very sweet and an easy grader.
8371,611015,5.0,3.0,The best language teacher I've had in six years of foreign language studies.  Very helpful and willing.
8372,611015,4.5,2.0,"one of the nicest french teacher ever!!!! she can be unclear sometimes especially when it comes to grammar, but she's definitely willing to help always."
8373,1077963,5.0,2.0,"Great TA!  Really quick when responding to emails and very helpful.  He probably had a lot of his own stuff going on during the semester, but you wouldn't know it b/c he was always available to help."
8374,2298593,3.0,3.0,Miyabi is very interesting but short with first years. JPTR's readings were extremely interesting however the questions she would ask were too difficult for most of the class to even answer. Got a bad grade on my paper even though the prompt was extremely vague. Would take this with another professor.
8375,2298593,5.0,4.0,"Probably the most understanding, encouraging, and enriching professor I know. She really makes you think about the material, and though sometimes the readings are strange, the classes are engaging. She didn't do exams for this class. She is open to what you think about the material and encourages you to give reasoning for ideas. Taking her again."
8376,2773734,5.0,2.0,"Jeddie's class is super engaging and I love the way he formats the class! The assignments are mainly short readings or videos to watch, which we discuss in depth during class. He explains topics very clearly and encourges students to try grammar and writing styles out of their comfort zone. He also allows revisions on essays. Would recommend!"
8377,2773734,5.0,2.0,"I absolutely loved Jeddie's class!! He made college-level English feel very accessible. The readings were fun and well-balanced with dynamic video content. The grading is clear and fair, even allowing revisions on essays. This class covers pop-culture topics and made writing a means to indirectly understand technology, psychology, philosophy, etc."
8378,1487600,2.0,3.0,"Not very good at explaining and very insecure. Exams are too extensive for the time you are given to complete them, nobody ever finished them."
8379,1487600,1.0,3.0,He does not know how to teach this class.  It's very easy to fall asleep in his class until he gets super excited about a topic and you can hear his girlie voice pop out.  Stay away from this class.  He is a horrible instructor.  Not pleasing to the eye either.
8380,1487600,2.5,4.0,Not very organised. Needs some practise I guess.
8381,1487600,1.5,3.0,"Stephen didn't know how to teach Micro Econ. I ended up in this class because Elzinga's was full and I wanted to take Micro in my first year. MISTAKE. I should have waited until second year, because Stephen didn't seem to be knowledgeable about Econ at all, was disorganized, and an ineffective teacher. I taught the course to myself from the book."
8382,2831089,5.0,2.0,The professor really does not want to give you a lot of work and is understanding if you are stressed or getting behind on the work. She gives a good amount of reading maybe 5-15 pages a week but you will only have to spend an hour max outside of class.
8383,1561331,3.0,4.0,"Dont buy the textbook, you wont need to read it. Go to class and pay attention. You will get 1 point added to your course grade for attendance (measured by iClicker). Cox teaches first half, Brodie teaches second half. Cox is an okay lecturer and has straightforward exams. Brodie is a good lecturer but has hard, very ambiguous exams. No homework."
8384,1561331,3.0,4.0,Brodie's lectures are alright but his exams put familiar concepts in unfamiliar contexts and are sometimes poorly worded. The books aren't necessary if you go to lecture. The TA was nice enough but less than helpful in discussion. Extra credit for missing &lt; 4 lectures is a nice gesture but 1.5 points out of 400 doesn't actually mean much.
8385,1561331,4.5,3.0,"He taught the second half of Evo Eco, and was the better lecturer in my opinion. I really enjoyed the class but tests are hard (and it might be due to the TA, who was awful). If you can't go to lecture get someone to record it for you because they're indispensable, and the textbook is just for clarification."
8386,2274056,1.0,3.0,Youre given very few grades in this class and she is unable to clearly teach concepts required for the test. Much of the learning is required at home. Not sure she should be teaching at this level yet.
8387,2274056,1.0,3.0,Despite accounting being slow she makes it impossible to sit through class. Speeds through difficult concepts. Failed over 1/3 of students on a test that had nearly no information from in class and did not curve. I received an A-/B+ but was still one of the worst professors Ive had.
8388,2274056,4.0,3.0,So I probably shouldnt be bragging about this but I skipped class like 2/3 of the time and got a B+. Shes really not that hard of a teacher. Homework was realllllly hard but thats probably cuz I wasnt in class. Her tests were hella curved and she was a nice person overall. The subject was boring but she was a good professor in my opinion.
8389,2274056,4.0,4.0,"Katie is a nice professor that really cares for all of her students! she wants to make the class worth going to! the material (and textbook), however, are hard to understand at times, and the homeworks do not relate to the tests very directly. Tests are hard, HARD, but the curve is very comforting. Love Katie, dislike financial accounting"
8390,2274056,4.0,5.0,"she is a super duper nice lady, but goes very quickly and gives hard tests. the homework and textbook don't reflect the tests, but she does curve and tries to help you cushion your grade with an easy project and the homeworks."
8391,2274056,4.0,4.0,"It is true that the homework and textbook are not that useful but she gives out in-depth guided notes and gives time for questions. Not a fun class just due to the subject but McDermott is a pretty good professor who is really passionate and is fair when it comes to grades (92 average on the first test, second was rounded to a B average)"
8392,2274056,1.0,5.0,"Teaches little to no broad concepts, prepare to memorize steps and compute hidden values."
8393,2274056,2.0,5.0,"Very, very dry professor. She teaches at a fast pace which makes it tough to follow. I find it hard to learn accounting with her teaching style. Accounting itself is not an exciting subject, but she manages to make it even more boring somehow."
8394,389909,4.0,4.0,"Very knowledgable about Leonardo and interesting to learn from. She grades harshly, however - on one paper, she said my only issue was that my grammar was occasionally unclear, but the content was excellent and accurate, and I got a B+. You can get away with never reading the textbook, but you should buy it anyways because it's very helpful."
8395,389909,2.0,5.0,Hard class. Alot of studying. Very hard grader. Not very fair about it either. No real reasoning behind  why she gives you what she does.
8396,389909,4.0,2.0,Don't take this course unless your an Art History major. You won't get an A unless you really know your stuff. The reading isn't really necessary... just show up to lecture.
8397,389909,4.0,3.0,"best professor at UVA: she is inspiring. take the class, but be ready to work and attend section- you won't regret it."
8398,389909,4.0,3.0,"Love her.Really understanding and passionate about material. Didnt have prior ARTH experience which was a little tough but definitely do-able. a lot of reading but relatively easy to not do. class attendance important.  SO MUCH STUDYING is required for the two exams, but i'm overall so glad i took this class and have this worldly knowledge."
8399,389909,4.0,2.0,"The professor's lectures were a little choppy sometimes, but that may have been due to the nature of the course material... otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it... overall, very enjoyable class."
8400,389909,3.5,3.0,"She went over important slides several times, so we reviewed things over and over; it was really helpful for making information stick.  It was cool to learn about Italian art in and Italian accent!  Her class inspired me; I need to go to Italy and see everything we talked about someday.  There were a lot of texts to read, but I've kept them."
8401,389909,1.0,3.0,"If you love hearing someone say &quot;um&quot; 3000 times a class with an Italian accent and consistently mess up the slides, then this class is for you!"
8402,389909,4.0,4.0,"I learned so much in this class about Italian Art, and it was very interesting. There are just 4 assignments: 2 papers, a midterm, and final, so mainly there's just reading and notetaking for work. Fiorani is a great teacher and very knowledgable and fair."
8403,389909,3.5,3.0,she was mean to me
8404,389909,5.0,4.0,Very helpful and interested in students. Great knowledge of subject matter and loves sharing her knowledge with others. Terrific teaching style.
8405,389909,3.5,3.0,"lectures could be repetitive, and assigns plenty of reading, but you learn tons.  really kind, too"
8406,389909,4.0,3.0,"She has an Italian accent, but you get used to it. Tests and papers are fair. Great lectures and she loves the topic! Very knowledgable, great teacher."
8407,389909,4.5,2.0,"Very fun and knowledgeable.  Italian accent, but you get used to it fast.  Very helpful, and keeps mandatory lectures fast-paced and fun."
8408,1454869,4.5,3.0,"Marcon is a really nice person. His lectures can be a bit disorganized, but overall, they were pretty good. His tests are quite easy because he gives out study guides. I definitely recommend him!"
8409,1454869,3.0,2.0,Prof Marcon is a great guy. Has an accent that some probably find hard to understand but I got used to it. There was also a lot of reading(like 400 pgs some weeks) but some people can probably get by just skimming it. he will sometimes make funny comments that keep the class interesting and made sure to be open for lots of office hours if needed.
8410,832279,4.5,2.0,Dean Luedtke is pretty much awesome. took her ELA Study Skills class over winter break and found it to be really helpful in terms of gaining strategies and skills critical to academic success. she bought us lunch twice and had us laughing all the time. class was mainly discussion but be prepared for ample reading and writing! everyone got an A
8411,832279,2.5,3.0,"I really don't know why she gets paid. She doesn't teach us anything.  It's mainly other people coming in and our TA's doing everything. She managed to make the class less interesting, and her assigned readings were a little too much."
8412,832279,2.0,3.0,"I liked Professor Luedtke as a person, but she never taught us anything.  She never lectured.  Instead, every class we had a video or a guest speaker.  Everything I learned from the class was from my discussions."
8413,832279,1.5,2.0,"Professor said she was 'bad at lecturing' [which she was] so most classes were led by guest speakers or movies. TAs taught all material in discussion, but attending lecture was [unfortunately] still mandatory. Directions were repeatedly vague, esp. on reading responses and midterm. Overall I did not enjoy and would not recommend this class."
8414,832279,2.0,4.0,"Professor said she was &quot;bad at lecturing&quot; so most of the class was guest lectures and videos. She left the teaching of material to the TAs, which did not work out in my case. A lot of the papers seemed like busywork, and the exams were frustratingly vague and time-consuming."
8415,832279,4.5,3.0,"Great discussion leader, very engaging and approachable. Grading based on essays and other take home assignments - which can be time consuming, but are thought provoking and fun. I think anyone can get an A in this class if they work hard - I got a B+ because I had to devote time to my core classes."
8416,832279,2.5,2.0,"Had her as a professor for this class; despite meeting for lecture just once a week, she frequently played videos, had guests speakers come in or otherwise left the material in the hands of the TAs. Interesting subject matter, and the videos/guest lecturers were good, but Luedtke herself added nothing of value to my experience."
8417,832279,5.0,3.0,"I took SWAG with Karlin back in the late 90s. When I saw this website, I had to look her up. Her class had a really profound effect on me, & through the almost decade since, I have been grateful for her inspiring & eye-opening lectures & discussions. Always wished I could find her & thank her. Projects from that class still come up in conversation!"
8418,832279,4.5,4.0,Professor Luedtke is an awesome teacher. The workload was heavy but she's really considerate about getting assignments in.    She's also a great discussion leader.
8419,832279,5.0,2.0,"I loved this class! If you need a lot of structure, however, it might not be for you. Many of our classes were discussion-based and enjoyable. Honestly, the hour and 15 minutes flew by. Professor Luedtke is friendly and approachable. I learned so much in this class, and now my friends want me to shut up about gendered representations in the media."
8420,832279,5.0,2.0,"I loved this class.  For a 100 level class, I can't believe how much I learned.  Prof. Luedtke is really great and really nice and very helpful too.  I would  highly recommend this class or any class she teaches to anyone!"
8421,832279,2.0,3.0,"This class proved to be a huge waste of time.  I not only did not learn anything, but I was also embarrassed that UVA offers such a worthless class.  Luedtke was regulary unprepared for class, and she always would assume no student ever read so we wasted time talking about endless B.S.  For what she put in as a professor, the gradings were too hard"
8422,832279,4.0,3.0,She is a great professor who knows a lot about the subject. She lead some really interesting debates and the class definitely opened my eyes up to media portrayals of gender. The class has a lot of reading but it is all really interesting and the papers aren't too hard either.
8423,832279,5.0,2.0,"She's a great instructor, very enthusiastic. The course is interesting, esp. since it's media-looking at women in magazines mainly. More work in 1st halk of sem. but she's an easy grader and really approachable.  I would definitely recommend her!"
8424,2568981,3.0,2.0,"30% of course grade is from participation in discussion. Lectures can be dry, but exams are free response and pretty broad. Lots of readings from equally dry books. Definitely worth it to knock out gen-ed requirements."
8425,1086257,5.0,3.0,Hilde is AWESOME!She makes the work rewarding and is *very* willing to help you do well and she is also a great person to talk to for academic advise. Class discussions were great and engaging because of her. She's also very approachable and I would highly recommend taking any class she teaches.
8426,1086257,4.5,5.0,"TAKE HER CLASS. ITS WORTH IT! She knows her stuff & is very helpful. She's really into the subject & keeps readings current/interesting. Discussions move at a good pace, she's very enthusiastic. She grades fair; no curve; meaning you'll get the grade you deserve. But she's easy to talk to & likes to interact w/her students. TAKE HER CLASS!"
8427,2700081,4.0,3.0,"Professor Schiro was incredibly passionate while lecturing, which was really great. She was definitely more invested in the material than any other professor I've had. Make sure you read the textbook and do the extra credit, but an A is very attainable."
8428,938806,3.0,4.0,"Sweet man, funny man. I enjoyed his class even if just to watch him swirl around in his own energy. But a 10 page final essay and extensive final exam due within a week of each other for a low level 300 class is a bit much. Still, he tries very hard to impart knowledge, even when it is slightly misguided. Always got As on his papers."
8429,938806,5.0,2.0,"Easily my favorite English teacher I have ever had. Very common to have no idea what is going on in class, yet still keeps class interesting(through hand motions and dance)."
8430,938806,2.0,4.0,"Jason Coats is an uninteresting, unhelpful professor.  He is obviously knowledgable but fails to impart his knowledge to his students.  Papers are nearly impossible to do well on and the final was just as unclear."
8431,938806,5.0,1.0,"Professor Coats is one of the best professors at UVa. He really tries hard and is dedicated to what he is teaching. Takes some time to get used to his style, but once you do he is awesome"
8432,938806,3.5,3.0,"Incredibly nerdy in a really cute way, obviously loves the book he assigns. It's a lot of reading and I agree that I never really knew what he expected on papers, but overall I enjoyed his class."
8433,938806,3.0,3.0,"Overall I enjoyed the class and thought he was a nice person. However, I have two complaints: first, that I never really felt like I knew what he wanted on papers. I would go for help but it never seemed to improve my grade. Second, I thought that for a 200-level class it was far too much reading--and too many quizzes."
8434,938806,3.0,3.0,"Very charming professor with immense knowledge, but I feel like it was hard to do well in this class because I was never certain exactly what was expected of me...I enjoyed the class though!"
8435,938806,4.5,4.0,"He's brilliant and dedicated to teaching difficult literature in a way that we can understand. Obviously loves teaching, cares a great deal about his students."
8436,938806,2.0,4.0,"Humorous, but hard to follow. Very limited guidelines for expectations."
8437,2642743,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Johannessen's Intro to Public Policy in Fall 2020 and he was compassionate and flexible, especially during COVID. His lectures were engaging and all of the important terminology was color-coded so note-taking was easy. The workload was somewhat heavy, but nothing out of line with similar classes at UVA."
8438,2642743,5.0,3.0,"Really nice and caring prof, especially during COVID. Very clear expectations with clear lectures with lots of examples. Definitely worth taking."
8439,1135415,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Q is a great professor, but she has very high standards. She provides a lot of material for you to work with and it very helpful in office hours. That said, she goes into a lot of pure math and isn't super generous with partial credit. Her lectures are awesome."
8440,1135415,1.5,5.0,"hard, unclear, too smart to teach."
8441,1135415,4.5,4.0,She is really an awesome teacher. She explains everything well with a lot of details and really wants you to do well. She is really flexible with her office hours and will do whatever she can to help you out. The class itself is a lot of work but she really did a great job teaching it. you can tell she loves it.
8442,1135415,5.0,4.0,"Katie is an amazing teacher! She is great help when you go to her office hours, she is clearly very excited about her material, and I feel she does an excellent job preparing you for the exams. Try to get into her section!"
8443,1135415,4.5,4.0,No Comments
8444,1119046,1.0,4.0,She has no clue what she's talking about. Her lectures were terrible. Her exams were written only based on textbook info. would not take this class again
8445,1119046,2.0,4.0,"Didn't explain concepts well and would often confuse herself and therefore her students. Tests were SUPER difficult and abstract. In office hours didn't really help, because she wouldn't explain difficult concepts in an understandable way."
8446,1119046,3.0,4.0,"She taught the first half of Evo Eco, and could sometimes be confusing. I really enjoyed the class but tests are hard (and it might be due to the TA, who was awful). If you can't go to lecture get someone to record it for you because they're indispensable, and the textbook is just for clarification."
8447,1119046,1.0,5.0,This class is horrible! she doesn't know what she is talking about most of the time...She puts pictures on the slides and just names the animal.  Her exams are hard and she doesn't fulfill her duties as a teacher.
8448,1119046,4.5,1.0,"Enthusiastic teacher--one of the better lecturers I've had at UVa. However, I have to agree with other reviews that her tests are ridiculous. The material seems so easy (sometimes to the point of boredom) in class, but she asks a lot more on the tests. Some people &quot;get&quot; them, others don't. I couldn't get higher than a C on tests."
8449,1119046,4.5,4.0,"Great lady! She is so helpful, sincere, and passionate about her work. You need to study for her class hard, but effort will be rewarded. One of the nicest people at UVA."
8450,1119046,1.5,3.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  The material is interesting and there is minimal work required, but the exams are legitimately ridiculous.  In the beginning I came to every lecture, took good notes, and did the reading, and still got a 74 on the first exam.  It's seriously not worth it."
8451,1119046,1.5,1.0,"She has one office hour a week. Class is incredibly easy, no homework or anything but then you get the test and it is completely ridiculous.  Tests are unfair and very unpredicatable."
8452,1119046,5.0,1.0,"I have had Prof Galloway for 302 and 345, she is also my Biology major advisor, and has been extremely helpful about everything in general. She is extremely reasonable about helping students, her tests are not hard with a reasonable amount of effort."
8453,1119046,1.0,5.0,"Good God, never again do I want to take a test made so poorly that some questions had to be thrown out and some made extra credit... The standard deviation was pretty much the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen... Stay away from her, she will make you loose hope in... well anything you have hope in."
8454,1119046,4.0,4.0,"This class was really good and although the tests are difficult, as long as you go to class and pay attention you can get good grades.  Textbook was useless- wish I hadn't bought it.  Also had her for 302 which was much more difficult but studying hard does the trick!"
8455,1119046,1.5,5.0,"Ridiculously hard and unfair tests. Neither reading the book or attending every lecture will ensure you get a good grade; it's just luck of the draw. She's nice, but I really question her teaching method. You can't avoid this class since it is a core class, but definitely make time to go to discussion sections and office hours."
8456,1119046,4.5,2.0,Awesome Lady!  She is so helpful and very knowledgeable about botany and biology in general.
8457,2544467,1.0,4.0,"The lectures were boring and painful to get through. He gives homework without ever explaining how to do it in class and doesn't provide the resources needed to properly do them. I asked him at least 5 times throughout the semester to do some example problems in class, but he never listened to me."
8458,1241962,3.0,2.0,"Boring class and she has no sense of humor but tests are a joke. You get to pick 2 of the 3 sections and they are usually examples very similar to the practice tests and worksheets. Go to class, pay attention, and never worry about having to open your  book."
8459,1643371,1.0,4.0,"Kimberly Kelly was the worst professor I have had at UVA. She doesn't post notes and give incorrect information in class, ask for it on a test, and then tell us it is wrong, even though it's what she told us in class. There is no accountability for her. She is unorganized and can't teach. All she does is recite the textbook. I hated this class."
8460,1643371,1.0,2.0,Horrible professor. don't take her classes. She does not know what she is talking about
8461,1201018,4.0,3.0,This class actually inspired me to major is AAS. I enjoyed the material but I do remember crying over a paper grade once... I ended up doing fine and got so much out of it.
8462,1201018,2.5,3.0,Class wasn't boring but was kind of a pain. Don't expect to get an A unless you are an amazing writer and thus probably should have passed out of this class. Readings were usually short and easy so you might as well do them. she never really gave back our papers so it is kind of hard to improve
8463,455557,4.0,4.0,Overall a good class and learned a lot. I felt the course was difficult but fair. You should start labs early as you never know how long you may be stuck on them. It is not overly difficult in terms of understanding the material but is difficult in terms of the amount of work and time needed. Workload 20-25 hours / week generally.
8464,455557,5.0,5.0,"Bloomfield is one of the best profs at UVA. I took his class during the Spring 2020 semester and he handled the switch to online learning really well. The class is one of the toughest I've taken, but if you don't procrastinate and stay on top of the labs, doing well shouldn't be a problem."
8465,455557,5.0,5.0,"Bloomfield's a great professor, among the best at UVA. This class is hard, probably one of the first &quot;real&quot; programming classes you'll take, since it's a bridge between lower level and upper level CS classes. He's a great lecturer and the labs are notoriously hard (especially hash lab), but the class is worth it since you learn so much."
8466,455557,5.0,4.0,"When COVID forced us into online classes, Bloomfield was the most accommodating of any of my professors. He cancelled/extended assignments, made lectures available online anytime and held frequent office hours, and when Collab crashed during our final, he handled every single student's exam situation individually to ensure we were graded fairly."
8467,455557,5.0,4.0,"CS 2150 is a great class and Bloomfield is a great professor. There is so much to learn, but Bloomfield is the guys to teach it."
8468,455557,5.0,4.0,"Aaron's actions are those of a hypocrite.  As far as office hours are concerned, for some reason he will go to the office hours of other professors, like Abhi Shelat, and talk to Abhi during his entire office hours session while students are waiting to ask Abhi questions about the difficult material in his algorithms course Fall 2011, pink rules AB"
8469,455557,5.0,4.0,"I love him! I think he is the best professor at UVA. Great lecturer and really cares about his students. Also, just the sweetest guy. Really wants everyone to do well and will do whatever he can to help you out. So long as you work hard on 2150, start labs early and don't slack off. This class should be fine."
8470,455557,4.5,4.0,"It's a well-organized class. Bloomfield was one of the hardest professors I've had, but easily the best. His lectures have a great blend of humor, knowledge, and clarity. His lab assignments (split into three parts and function as homework) are notoriously difficult and lengthy, as are his tests. But it's worth it. You will learn so much. "
8471,455557,5.0,5.0,this guy is pretty good at teaching. i'd say one of the best in the CS department. just remember to go to his office hours instead of TA office hours. labs are pretty hard if you don't already have a background in programming and the tests are pretty bad. overall the work was my least favorite but the professor was my most favorite.
8472,455557,4.5,4.0,He is awesome! A very passionate and energetic professor who would make those hard materials interesting. Labs were disastrous but you'll gain a lot after a semester with him!
8473,455557,4.5,1.0,"He's pretty sexy in my opinion... He tries to be funny but he's too nerdy so it doesn't work. He's good at explaining vocally, but his written lab instructions are abominable. Be prepared to be endlessly confused and hate your life when doing his labs."
8474,455557,5.0,3.0,"Bloomfield is my favorite professor in UVA! He is remarkably organized and helpful, and I'm attracted to his class because of his great sense of humor. Yes this class requires a decent amount of work, but it's totally worth it!"
8475,455557,4.5,4.0,"He's a very good professor, probably my favorite CS professor. The labs were difficult at times, but if you start early, you'll be fine. He's organized and clear. Tests are a bit tricky, but he curves the grades if the average is too low. There's always help outside class if you need it, which was nice as well."
8476,455557,4.0,5.0,"Really hard professor, his test are impossible, BUT if you go to class and pay attention you should be good."
8477,455557,5.0,4.0,"Bloomfield expects A LOT from his students, and he tells you that up front. Be prepared to spend many many many hours a week on this class. That said, I learned more in 2150 than all other classes at UVA."
8478,455557,3.5,5.0,"Class is fairly difficult and a lot of work. His tests are filled with random things he mentions in class, things that aren't on the slides. Labs can be long at times. He's an average professor"
8479,455557,5.0,3.0,"Bloomfield rocks!  Engaging, loves what he does.  HIS RED SLIDES ARE AWESOME (take the class and you will see what I mean!)  Brings CS to life.  Highly recommended."
8480,455557,4.5,4.0,"This was his first time teaching the course, but he clearly knew what he was talking about. I would give him a 5 on clarity if it wasn't for him mixing up Java/C++ occasionally and sometimes being tired after coding the labs until 3 AM :) Don't bother getting the book, I never did, and make sure to go to class! He's an engaging speaker."
8481,455557,4.0,4.0,"Structures opportunities for seeking help outside of lectures superbly. Help from TA is constantly available outside of class. TAs work under professor, whom you can also seek for help. Submission system for assignments is quite efficient."
8482,455557,4.0,4.0,"I like his teaching style, and everything is pretty simple to understand. He recognizes that some material is boring and jokes about it. My one complaint: he cites the &quot;real world&quot; in terms of workload and doesn't take into consideration that his students have 4-6 other classes."
8483,455557,5.0,2.0,very entertaining. thinks his class is harder than it actually is. really funny guy.
8484,455557,5.0,3.0,"Spectacular professor, one of the best in the engineering school.  He loves computer science and actually has the ability to make his students love it too.  The UVA engineering school needs more professors of his caliber."
8485,455557,2.0,2.0,Bloofield is an okay professor. His humor is pretty much nerdy inside jokes. Class was okay besides all the stupid jokes/comments. Exams are very selective so if you study the wrong stuff you're not going to do well.
8486,455557,5.0,2.0,"Had him for 101, too, both times fantastic.  Is teaching 216 next sem, I recommend him for any of those.  Very engaging lectures, for 202: easy weekly HWs, bad text (but need for HW) get Rosen's book out of Clark to study/learn. 101: yeah, don't need book.  Practice exams for both classes are VERY helpful.  Also, go to review sessions, good tips."
8487,455557,5.0,1.0,"Prof Bloomfield is awesome! He makes class interesting with his humor breaks, and explains everything clearly. Don't both buying the book. Also, doing the practice exams really helps for the tests. All in all, I really liked this class, even though I knew nothing about CS."
8488,455557,4.5,2.0,Great teacher - very funny.
8489,455557,5.0,2.0,"GREAT! Very organized, all notes are in powerpoints and there are videos of the class online. Shows funny vidoes and pictures so you dont get bored. There were 19 TAs so help is always available."
8490,455557,4.5,2.0,"Gives straightforward, clear, and humorous lectures that are punctuated by &quot;humor&quot; slides. Has awesome music selection before the start of class!"
8491,455557,5.0,3.0,Prof. Bloomfield is the greatest. He makes a point to add humor/interesting tidbits to his lectures to break up the tedium of a 1.25 hour class. Heart!
8492,455557,5.0,2.0,"We love Prof. Bloomfield!  The man is absolutely hillarious and really knows his stuff.  He's very friendly and helpful.  Go to his office hours, he's great. CS101 was definitely my favorite class of the semester, I looked forward to going to lectures because of Bloomfield."
8493,455557,5.0,2.0,"Making such a boring class enjoyable is a true talent.  If I didn't think it would get him fired, I would make sweet, sweet love to this man."
8494,455557,5.0,3.0,Very nice professor. He has a good sense of humor and tries to keep his lectures entertaining.
8495,455557,4.5,2.0,"Fun class, awesome teacher.  Look forward to having him in CS 202.  Lectures are long, but he tries to keep it interesting.  If you don't like his style of humor, than that's probably a sign that your shouldn't be a CS major."
8496,455557,5.0,1.0,Prof. Bloomfield brings the hotness!
8497,455557,5.0,3.0,This is the best class I've taken at UVa and the best lectures I've sat through. Bloomfield is an awesome professor.
8498,455557,5.0,1.0,I want to have Bloomfield's love child!
8499,455557,4.5,3.0,"Quite a good teacher.  Lectures will be boring but I attribute it more to the subject matter than the professor.  Tries to be fair grading.  From personal experience, class isn't required for most CS101E students but CS202 students must attend class.  CS202 text was horrible but answers in the back for homeworks."
8500,455557,5.0,2.0,clear. concise.  funny.  what more could you ask for&#63;
8501,455557,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Bloomfield is incredible.  He understands that the class is really big and really long, so he breaks up the lecture with lots of humorous things.  The homeworks, labs, tests, and quizzes arent too bad, and if they are... go to class, he will help you out!"
8502,455557,5.0,2.0,"very good prof! even with a large lecture class tires to make sure that everyone understands the material and answers questions. helpful outside of class, too. lectures can be boring, but he does best with material at hand."
8503,455557,5.0,2.0,Bloomfield is my hero. Take his class. You'll learn a lot.
8504,455557,5.0,1.0,"Very helpful, great slides, tries very hard to make coding interesting.  A dork, but a sincerely nice dork.  Tests were open book, labs were reasonable.  Class can be boring, but it's computer programming...Bloomfield is one of the better professors at UVA, take his class!"
8505,455557,4.5,1.0,"Good professor although the material is boring, he tried to make it interesting.  Pretty easy class, and Bloomfield was very helpful if you had questions."
8506,455557,4.0,2.0,"Let's be honest, it must have been hard to lecture on writing computer code and make it interesting at the same time. At least the demotivators help. But despite falling asleep during several of his lectures, you can learn a lot through the hws and labs."
8507,455557,4.5,1.0,"If you are really into computer humour you will find his lectures interesting, otherwise they are very boring. They have a slow pace which can be good or bad depending on your perspective. The class is easy to do well in, things are graded easily. Take it if you need it for a requirement."
8508,455557,4.0,3.0,"hated the material, time consuming.  Tests are open book though!!"
8509,455557,4.5,3.0,"Nice guy, very approachable, loves to help you out if you're struggling. Good teacher, too. Tests are reasonable."
8510,455557,4.5,3.0,Bloomfield is a nice guy..does his best to try and make his lectures about Java interesting..demotivational posters are the best!
8511,455557,4.5,3.0,"A huge dork but a nice guy and a decent teacher. I had heard that this class was hard, but Bloomfield makes it very reasonable. I would greatly prefer him to any other CS teacher I've had."
8512,455557,4.0,2.0,"The material is pretty boring for most of us but he does try and as quite coherent.  If I'm asleep its caus of the course, not the professor."
8513,455557,4.0,3.0,"Sense of humor is weak,but at least he's trying, he's a decent teacher, nice guy."
8514,455557,4.0,3.0,"Straight forward, speaks loud enough, PPTs are well organized, pretty good for a new prof."
8515,1930117,4.5,4.0,Professor Lindgren was an amazingly helpful and really nice professor.  His class was very difficult (i'm also not in the engineering school so I was probably not qualified for this class) but he was always willing to work with you to help you understand what you needed to do to improve your grades.  
8516,1930117,4.0,3.0,"Very helpful, great professor. He's passionate and interesting."
8517,455559,5.0,2.0,"Idk how those bad feedback comes from. He's the most intelligent professor I met in any APMA courses. Knows everything about math that you can think of. Pay attention to his lecture and you'll find out that's the most worthwhile class ever. However, he's class doesn't fit those who skip the classes cause there're lots of homeworks and quizzes."
8518,455559,1.0,5.0,All he does is go off on tangents and cover proofs that don't help with the homework or quizzes at at all.
8519,455559,1.0,4.0,"Not clear at all.   What he does is just copying his note to blackboard with terrible handwriting. He used to test on some problems that were only covered in the review session, not in class.... the review session of course is optional The good thing is that, he is a nice old man outside classroom.  But he is definitely not a competent teacher"
8520,455559,2.5,3.0,"I had to dedicate my whole weekends to finish the homeworks. I would recommend Fulgham if you want less homework. However, the grading was very fair, and he always gave a decent curve for EVERYTHING so it was easy to get an A. He is boring and soporific, but he projects passion for teaching despite his age. I came to respect him very much."
8521,455559,1.0,5.0,Dorning is the worst teacher I have ever had. He takes attendance because he knows nobody would come if he did not. The homeworks take forever and you must learn everything on your own. Take ANY other professor if you are going to take this course.
8522,455559,2.5,3.0,"Dorning is a really nice guy, but like most engineering professors, he's not a really great lecturer. The material can be confusing, but if you can manage to pay attention in class, it'll be fine and you'll learn to appreciate Dorning more."
8523,455559,5.0,2.0,"By far the best professor I have ever had.  Is fair, great lecturer, and really cares about students learning.  Explains concepts very well  For all who criticize him look up his background.  You'll be impressed."
8524,455559,4.5,3.0,One of the best professors I've ever had. I've taken three classes with him and he always teaches the class perfectly.
8525,455559,4.5,4.0,Best professor I've ever had.
8526,455559,2.5,4.0,Class is pretty bad.  The book is worthless and Dorning mostly copies example probs from the book.  He usually mumbles and is hard to hear.  Goes over the class period essentially ever class.
8527,455559,4.0,4.0,Dorning is a decent professor and those are hard to find in the applied math department. He does have a tendency to mumble and you can usually learn as much from him as you can from the book.
8528,455559,5.0,2.0,"He writes the book on the board, but that's because it includes everything you need to know. I don't know why people complain about his using the book. If you want the teacher to teach something other than the book, buy a chemistry book and use it for the course. It's a good book, and he helps you understand the concepts presented in the chapter."
8529,455559,5.0,1.0,"Very nice, very patient and extremely smart. he is fair to everybody."
8530,455559,1.5,3.0,"What ever you do, do not take him!!! I ended up having to sit in on another class in order to pass! Awful Awful Prof!"
8531,455559,1.0,4.0,"Awful. He just writes up what's in the book on the board. Given the choice, I'd pick the book; it doesn't mummble."
8532,455559,1.5,5.0,No Comments
8533,455559,4.5,3.0,"Great Professor. I saw somebody said his classes run over time, that is true but only because he doesn't notice the clock.  Makes very complicated aspects easy to understand. The only problem is that he is a genius and I am not, so his advanced classes really are advanced."
8534,455559,1.0,4.0,"Avoid this man at all costs.  Lectures are boring, uninformitive, and he does not hesitate to go over the scheduled length or schedule additional lectures that may or may not fit into your scheduled. (not that it matters since you wouldn't learn anythinf if you went anyways)"
8535,455559,1.0,4.0,All he does is write the book up on the board.  Not helpful at all and a bit of an ass.
8536,455559,1.0,5.0,"Awful awful awful...mumbles, doesn't answer questions, harsh grader, just copies notes on board. Will schedule late night lecture sessions at short notice if he &quot;has&quot; to leave the country. Changes grading criteria and doesn't tell us. Never again."
8537,455559,2.0,4.0,"very, very unhelpful.  Focuses too much on theory and not enough on actual examples."
8538,455559,4.0,3.0,"Making an honest effort, friendly + notes are well organized, needs to speak up."
8539,1815444,5.0,3.0,"He is the most moving, amazing lecture I've ever seen, and he's humorous. He teaches us to punch the reality and question the rationalist tradition. He asked lots of questions in class and gave us enough time to express our own views. He is open to interpretations other than his own. Two papers(17 pages in total) -- and he is a nice grader."
8540,1815444,2.5,2.0,"What you need to understand is that he is a genius and a great guy. If you love literature, take a class with him; he knows so much about the history of language and literature, it will surely change your perspective. Arguably, Bennett is unclear at times. His ideas are truly his own and are often hard to grasp. But he is very nice and funny. "
8541,1815444,2.0,2.0,"Definitely the most painfully boring and confusing professor I've ever had. He doesn't provide a syllabus and talks the entire class about really abstract, ridiculous concepts. I never went to class because I couldn't sit through his lecturing. Easy because there were only two papers and you don't have to read because he doesn't let you talk..."
8542,529301,2.0,4.0,This class was just my second writing requirement but I recommend this class if thats what you need. This guy was funny and pretty interesting to listen to. He even looks exactly like santa clause!
8543,529301,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Colomb always has a funny joke and tells it like it is. He is harsh on some with some of his retorts but knows what he is talking about. The class itself is very hard with a long paper due at the end, but the &quot;graduation&quot; the last day of class is fun."
8544,529301,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Colomb is perhaps the funniest and most pragmatic professor I've had at the University.  I loved his jokes.  I would recommend for business or engineering, among other majors."
8545,529301,2.0,4.0,"Wow, I'm out of this class. I don't want to waste my time on someone who uses a foul word every few sentences and preaches to us about how the world really is, so &quot;tough s---.&quot;  There are so many more encouraging professors and classes at UVa; I'll find some other way to get my 2nd writing requirement."
8546,529301,2.0,2.0,Avoid if you have any interest in the English Language
8547,529301,3.0,1.0,"you will learn nothing. A time-filler, opporunity to get a grade for a total bogus &quot;project.&quot; What a blowhard!"
8548,529301,1.5,2.0,"Lecture once a week was painful, but you must go to pick up packet from TA (otherwise I don't think anyone would go).  If your TA is fun, the overall course might not be as miserable as my experience, but I wouldn't take chances."
8549,529311,4.0,3.0,"I have taken three classes with Zieman (Wetlands Ecology, Marine environments and organisms, and a seminar). He does ramble in his lectures, but once you get a hang of how to take notes it isn't so bad. He is very helpful and approachable outside of class. One of my favorite professors! You just have to work hard, it isn't an easy A."
8550,529311,2.0,5.0,Awful class. He does class with Dave Smith who (how can it be possible&#63;) is worse.
8551,529311,1.5,4.0,"Zieman is unapproachable, doesn't answer emails, makes almost impossible tests and then yells at you for not studying hard enough. His lectures have no organization whatsoever and the things he emphasizes in lecture are not on the tests. He is frustrating, incomprehensible, and could care less how he teaches the class."
8552,529311,1.5,4.0,"Completely and utterly disorganized and impossible to follow lectures. Can't tell whether he's rambling or if what he's saying is important. You need to know dozens of latin names, which he either never writes down or if he does his hand-writing is so illegible it's impossible to read it. Same goes for a number of graphs. Constantly brags. Awful."
8553,2634656,5.0,3.0,"Unbelievably knowledgeable about books and poetry, and pretty nice, but seems also to have a strong bias against Greek life which makes you wonder why he's at UVA?"
8554,2634656,5.0,2.0,"Smartest person I've met at UVA, and incredibly caring, too. Inspires a love of literature in his students (and quite a few crushes)."
8555,766882,1.0,5.0,"I don't know what is the meaning of taking the class. There is no lecture at all. He just give pop quiz then explain them. He even give quiz with out going though the slides. Why are we paying tuition for a class with only quiz but no lecture? The HELPFULNESS, CLARITY, EASINESS are form 1 to 5. But I want to give 0!"
8556,766882,1.0,5.0,he is not good at all
8557,766882,4.0,5.0,This class is tough. I would recommend taking Quantum Physics (also taught by Ghosh) and have a significant interest in Physics 2 (and all the math along with it) before taking this class. You WILL be rewatching lectures (many times). All in all he is a helpful professor who seems to take a personal interest in students understanding the concepts.
8558,766882,5.0,5.0,awesome professor!
8559,766882,3.5,5.0,Really helpful outside of class. Lectures were mathematically based proofs that leaves your head spinning at the end of the day. Grading philosophy is very little partial credit despite work. Make sure you brush up on second semester phys before coming in
8560,766882,4.5,5.0,"Pretty good for his first time teaching at this school and the first time teaching this material. Still one of toughests classes you can take. It'll be hard no matter who your teacher is I think, but Ghosh is a good guy and he did a good job."
8561,766882,5.0,3.0,Great professor. He took the complicated ideas/material and transformed it into simple but useful forms.
8562,529320,4.5,4.0,"Reg is an awesome guy, he is a tough teacher but he does curve the grades so thats helpful. Only thing was, nutrition was taught more on chemistry than nutrition, understandable because he is a biochemist. I didn't read the book at all and stopped taking notes half way through the semester. He is a really nice guy and has cool stories."
8563,529320,1.5,4.0,"Nutrition is not an easy class, lots of memorization and lots of quizzes. Average grade a 70, I heard he curves it. Its like no matter how hard you study, you can't memorize it all bc its like impossible"
8564,529320,4.0,3.0,Nutrition is a very easy class if you study. Garrett is a very good lecturer. The lectures are boring sometimes but he tries to make them interesting. Tests are straightforward and require memorization but are not tricky.
8565,529320,4.0,4.0,"After reading all the negative reviews on here, I almost didn't take the class. BUT! I'm so glad that didn't stop me. I think Professor Garrett is great! He's challenging but very fair and gives you practice quizzes so you know exactly what to expect on tests. He has a great sense of humor and is an engaging lecturer. TAKE NUTRITION!!!"
8566,529320,1.0,5.0,Challenging class. But certainly not easy.
8567,529320,1.5,5.0,"I hated this class.  I took it because it was supposed to be easy, but it was NOT. The hordes of athletes in the class were also very distracting.  At the end of the semester he gave us an &quot;extra credit quiz.&quot;  I later emailed him and asked when it was going to be posted on tool kit and he said that the quiz was a joke!"
8568,529320,2.0,5.0,"One of the most ridiculous classes I've ever had.  The professor tests on intentionally useless trivia from notes to see how much you memorized instead of testing your true comprehension of the subject.  If you have the ability to memorize very trivial facts, go for it.  I enjoyed the subject material but not because of the class."
8569,529320,4.0,5.0,"Not an easy A like I expected.  Make sure to go to lectures, because Prof. Garrett intentionally puts questions that are not in the book on the tests."
8570,529320,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  I got an A, but, again I say, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  It's way too hard for the 106 ranking and it takes too much time away from other classes to be a course for non-majors."
8571,529320,4.5,2.0,"Lectures are not mandatory, but GO ANYWAY!! He posts lecture notes prior to class for you to bring and fill in as he goes over them. There are 7 quizzes (50 mult. choice questions) and 2 get dropped. Not a hard class at all if you go to lecture and the review sessions, also read the book!!! He is a very enthusiastic professor, great class!"
8572,529320,2.5,5.0,"DON'T take this class if you don't have to.  I thought it would be an easy way to get a science requirement out of the way, but it's really going to hurt my GPA.  Quizzes are really hard and the only way I didn't fail all of them was by going to the review sessions."
8573,529320,3.5,4.0,"This class was a bore.  Most people skipped. I went to class about everyday.  Tests could be a struggle.  Make sure you allow yourself plenty of time to read the book.  Sample tests are crucial! Take them, find the right answers... you'll be pleasantly surprised by the what similar questions will appear on the exams. 7 quizzes 2 are dropped 1 final"
8574,529320,4.0,4.0,"Definitely not a given A... The averages on tests are usually around a 70, but there's a pretty generous curve. He moves way too fast through the notes, you might want to take a picture or something."
8575,529320,3.5,4.0,"Was an overall interesting class. To those that didn't like it, they probably either didn't study enough or didn't like the monotony of how the material was presented. If you have any knowledge of Bio and you think nutrition is interesting. Go for it, he is actually pretty helpful for those with clear questions."
8576,529320,4.0,4.0,"This class is supposed to be for non-science majors but don't let the 100 level fool you, this is NOT a gut class. There are 7 quizzes and you get to drop 2. If your avg after the 2 dropped quizzes is an A, then you're exempt from the final. You definitely can't miss class because he doesn't post all the notes up and study study study before the quizzes!"
8577,529320,1.5,5.0,"Professor simply repeated the text in lecture, and was FAR too mechanism-oriented.  This class did NOT give me a better understanding of the subject and was NOT enjoyable in any way.   A definite &quot;miss.&quot;  Avoid at ALL COSTS."
8578,529320,2.0,5.0,"Terrible lecturer, goes too fast thru notes--heard this was one of hte e asier classes at UVa, couldn't be more wrong-- studied like crazy/wetn to class/ only got a B+.  Take MATh 121/114 or how things work if ur looki for an easy math/sci credit"
8579,529320,3.0,4.0,"This class was supposed to be one of the easier classes at the University, it was not. If you earn an A on 5 out of 7 quizzes you are exempt from the final. only 40 students out of 500 were exempt. The good thing is that he curves the quizzes which really helped out my grade. I went from a 60 test average to a B for the class."
8580,529320,4.5,4.0,"Don't study too hard for quizzes. Unless you study like super, know everything like the back of your hand, it's not any better than skimming through the notes the night before the quiz. quizzes were miserable but there must have been a super curve at the end of the semester. about 80% of questions on the final was exactly from previous quizzes."
8581,529320,5.0,3.0,"Print the notes before class, and quickly scan each overhead to find what you need to write down, try and make it to every class, Garret does a good job of taking things straight from the headlines into the lectures, I cramed for three hours before each of 7 quizes and beat the curve. Scan the chapters and take good notes, its hard not impossible."
8582,529320,3.0,4.0,"whoever said it was easy, yeah, it's not easy. i go to lecture everyday and still find the quizzes extremely difficult to do well on. sometimes, i spent more time studying and reading for this class than i do for my orgo class. review sessions are not helpful at all. the TA's always recited what was EXACTLY on my notes from class."
8583,529320,3.0,4.0,"not a fun class.. a lot tougher than it sounds, especially for a 100 level course.  there is eventually a curve, but you have no idea how you're doing until the very end"
8584,529320,4.5,3.0,"Great class and insanely useful!  You learn a ton, but I highly recommend reading, but regardless, NEVER miss review session, they are so helpful. Dont let people trick u into believing this is an easy A, but there are curves, come to class and review and get no less than a B. Bring lecture notes 2 class 2 help you keep up and take notes as u read"
8585,529320,2.0,5.0,"Wow, everyone who said this class is easy is lying.  He talks too fast to copy the notes, his voice makes me want to cry, and tests are waaay harder than everyone said.  I'm no good at science anyway, but this guy makes me hate nutrition with a passion.  Plus, having quizzes every other week REALLY sucks."
8586,529320,1.5,5.0,Learned a fair amount but the lectures were extremely frustrating because he would post his notes with some sentences missing so you would spend the entire class ignoring what he was saying and trying desperately to find what parts of his notes on the overhead were missing from the notes you had printed out. Quizzes were pretty impossible.
8587,529320,3.0,3.0,"I rarely went to class and I failed almost every test except the first one. The final exam was EXACT questions from the previous tests.  I got a 99% on the final and got a B. Boring class, yaaaaaaaaaaaaawn"
8588,529320,5.0,3.0,No Comments
8589,529320,3.0,3.0,"A really fun and funny class. Most likely if you just study the notes and pay attention in class, you're almost guaranteed an A (and exam exemption). The review sessions helped too when it came to getting an idea on some of the test questions. However, most of his TAs were horrible."
8590,529320,3.5,2.0,"I loved this class.  If you get an A on 5 of the 7 quizzes, you don't even have to take the exam.  His lectures were never boring"
8591,529320,3.0,3.0,Good sides and bad sides.  I'm a non-science major and found that I liked the lectures more than could be expected.  I quit going to class about three weeks in and came out on top at the end.  He's very helpful.  Just do the practice quizzes and you will do fine.
8592,529320,4.5,4.0,"The class is hard, but anyone can do it if you just put the work into it.  Great professor.  Really nice guy....If you have him, get to know him"
8593,529320,3.5,3.0,"very funny prof, makes jokes in class...and yea, the final is a joke. it took me 20min! out of 3hours to finish 150questions. seriously, this class is fun and i'd recommend it to anyone. the final is just amazing if you care to look up last tests...literally. he copies and PASTE!"
8594,529320,4.0,2.0,"Of 7 tests, he drops two. the class seems difficult until the final, which consists solely of questions used on the 7 tests during the semester. all you have to do is memorize the right answers, it took literally 15 minutes to finish 150 questions on the test. take this class because of that."
8595,529320,3.0,4.0,"Not as easy as it was two years ago,supposedly.The lectures are fairly dull, and while the guy has a few good puns, his voice is incredibly soporific and can just lull you to sleep.Of course,this is coming from an English major.I suppose it isn't that hard of a class if you care/are interested/study"
8596,529320,4.5,1.0,This class is a freaking joke. If you read the class notes even more than once you will do well. The tests are straight from the notes. Its all just memorization. Definate GPA booster
8597,529320,4.0,2.0,"very good class, funny teacher, just try to stay above average. and beware of april's fool day."
8598,529320,3.0,2.0,"not as big of gut as you would think. 7 quizes... drop lowest. some are a joke, some are harder... I had 2 semesters bio, so most was a joke. no need to go to class. 1-2 &#63; on quiz will come from class out of 50. Just beat the curve and you'll be fine. so many quizes get old though."
8599,529320,5.0,1.0,"This is a great class for non-science majors, Garrett's lectures are fast-paced and pretty interesting."
8600,529320,4.0,4.0,"He definately knows his stuff... he wrote the book actually.  HARD class, a ton of information and really should be about 15 credits for the amount of work that goes in."
8601,2036664,4.0,2.0,"Prof Evans is super nice. His lectures, though a lot, are meaningful and focused on the readings and providing background. His comedic side needs growth but he means well. Would seriously take his class again."
8602,2675646,3.0,4.0,"The theme for this class was &quot;Literary Science Fiction.&quot; In short, this is a good class to take if and only if you are truly passionate about creative writing. Given that I struggle with writing, I ended up getting 85% on the 60% devoted to the actual story writing, which was the heart of the course. I managed to get SOLID A's on all of the others."
8603,537562,5.0,2.0,"BEST PROFESSOR EVER. Seriously, *everyone* at UVa should take Russian and Soviet Film and/or America Through Russian Eyes. She's hilarious, easy-going, and crazy-knowledgeable!! A+!"
8604,537562,5.0,2.0,"She is super duper awesome and fun and creative. I love the class and I actually have a bit of a crush on her, but you can't tell her :) I have learned so much about Russian film, and I love writing papers about what I learned. AMAZING. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
8605,537562,5.0,2.0,"I can only second what others have said, Ms Nafpaktitis is so warm and kind, I can't remember talking to her without a genuine smile on her face. Lectures are a pleasure to attend, always both informative and entertaining. She's also intelligent and thoughtful, her feedback on the many papers I wrote was constructive and useful to me as a writer."
8606,537562,4.5,2.0,"She is beyond amazing. I loved coming to class, only one I looked forward to. Kept the class interesting with different with cultural things and facts. Best professor i've had at UVA. Highly suggest taking this class, it's not hard, and she's willing to help in and out of class."
8607,537562,5.0,1.0,"First of all, this class is super easy. Grading is very lax. Secondly, it would be absolutely worth it even if it weren't. This class is AMAZING! Prof Nafpaktitis is so funny and interesting and her enthusiasm is contagious. You will LOVE this class!"
8608,537562,5.0,2.0,"amazing class, amazing teacher. actually made me enjoy paper writing again as much as one can enjoy that. her stories about life in russia never cease to amuse. she made me really want to live there or at least visit. seriously take this class you won't regret it!!! i tell everyone i know!"
8609,537562,5.0,1.0,"Best class at UVA and everyone should take it!  She teaches you wonderful skills for later college years, lecture flys by because its so interesting.  She includes various media, such as song clips, photos, and her own wonderful personal stories.  She's funny and quirky and very helpful.  She loves the subject and teaches you to love it as well."
8610,537562,5.0,3.0,"this was by far one of the best classes i've taken at UVA. i wish i could take the class again b/c it honestly was that good. we learned so much about the russian culture and she tries to incorporate all aspects of culture, music, lit, etc. and we had a party at the end of the semeter! it was one of the classes you loved doing the work for."
8611,537562,5.0,3.0,"great class! Really interesting, relaxed, funny stories. GREAT teacher (we even had a party complete with home made russian food and slippers at her house). I wish i could take the class again."
8612,537562,5.0,2.0,No Comments
8613,537562,5.0,3.0,Great class overall. She's really intersting and nice. Good personal stories complete with mimicked russian accent.
8614,537562,5.0,3.0,SHE IS SOOOOOOO AWESOME!  I wish EVERY class was as fun and interesting as this one!
8615,2225119,5.0,1.0,"I love her.

Great experience overall.

Teammates are important, this is a group-project based class.

Do not be the one who takes a free-ride!"
8616,2225119,5.0,3.0,"I loved having Prof. Morkowchuk! As someone who did IB Chem in high school, the content wasn't too difficult and much of our coursework was done online. She is extremely friendly, approachable, and easy to reach. I was lucky to have her for expo as well. All lectures are recorded so I barely showed up and still passed :)"
8617,2225119,2.0,3.0,"I can't grade Lisa because I never saw her during the lab. The lab itself was awful, the experiments are either boring or confusing and the grading is totally dependent on your TA. Lisa gave videos to provide background on the lab work which were never helpful. If you don't have to take this lab, don't. It sucks way too much for a 1 credit class."
8618,2225119,4.0,3.0,"I had Morkowchuk for 1410 Fall 2019, and she was such a good lecturer that I took her again for 1420. She's very clear with her expectations. If you've taken Chemistry before and are good at it, chances are you will do very well in her class. A little bit more work is required if you're not strong in Chemistry but she lets you know what to review."
8619,2225119,3.0,4.0,I mean she's good but she spends way too much time on her job. You know that one teacher that made you do arts and crafts in like the 7th grade. She reminds me of that teacher. She's just over the top and its kinda annoying. Sad part is she's the second best Chem prof at UVA. Stains is EASILY #1. She's new so she's not well known but she's the best
8620,2225119,4.0,4.0,"I had Prof. Morkowchuk for CHEM1411 Lab, but she also did a couple of the video lectures for CHEM1410. Those recorded lectures were on the longer side, but the readings for the lab component were very reasonable. Quizzes are mostly straightforward; not too much homework &amp; plenty of time to do it, but some assignments can be graded somewhat harshly."
8621,2225119,5.0,2.0,Lab was easy and straight forward. I took the physics lab online during COVID and it was absolutely hell compared to this. This lab is so much better I literally cannot express how good it is.
8622,2225119,2.0,3.0,"The entire lab was online due to COVID, which was super lame. The entire thing was run by TAs and I never even met Professor Morkowchuk. I thought the content was super boring and the labs weren't engaging or interesting at all."
8623,2225119,2.0,4.0,"The class was run by TAs- I never once had Morkowchuk pop in and say hello or anything. The grading is very harsh on Postlab assessments, but the other grades aren't awful."
8624,2225119,4.0,3.0,"I took 1610 with Professor Welch and his teaching style was very different than what I was used to I suggest Morkowchuk who teaches more traditionally as I took her for 1620. Pretty good lectures, engaging in such a large class and good notes."
8625,2225119,3.0,4.0,"Lecture can be a little boring and she covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. The tests are challenging if you do not the homework or go to office hours, and even then they can be quite hard. My advice: Get a study group early, do practice from the textbook, don't slack off. She's a nice person at heart though, kinda funny."
8626,2225119,4.0,3.0,"Lisa is not as bad as everyone says. Her tests are easy if you study hard and know the material. She explains things well. There are also other opportunities to boost your grade besides tests such as homework, participation, and mini quizzes which are fairly easy. Final is much harder than the midterms though."
8627,2225119,1.0,5.0,"Awful. Do not take it with her... she will ruin your grade. Take it with Columbus or Welch. She does not know how to teach and her exams are ridiculously difficult. If you want your GPA to be 0.1 points lower than what you are hoping for, then take Morkowchuk."
8628,2225119,5.0,4.0,"I took CHEM 1410 and 1420 from her during the summer session. It was difficult but also proved to be excellent prep for Orgo and Biochem. Grading was fair and consistent, and the professor was readily available to go over difficult topics in office hours. Put in the work and you'll be thankful during later chem courses."
8629,2225119,1.0,4.0,This lab class was run by TAs and Lisa just planned the experiments. It may have been a 1-credit class but felt more like 3. The quizzes are unreasonably difficult and there were a couple nobody did well on due to poorly written questions. Some TAs are alright but they can be very hit or miss. Postlabs are very harshly graded and coding is a pain.
8630,2225119,3.0,3.0,"An okay class, lectures are somewhat boring but usually concepts are fairly well explained. Textbook is engaging enough and the amount of reading per class is very reasonable. The once-a-week online assignments are quite time consuming and I'm not sure how helpful they are. The assessments are challenging because they have relatively few questions"
8631,2225119,1.0,4.0,If you don't have a strong background in Chemistry be careful with this class. I didn't take AP Chemistry and felt behind in the class. It's fast pace her tests are short and challenging. She also doesn't curve at all.
8632,2225119,1.0,5.0,"Awful, awful, awful. Hated this prof and the way she taught. As a student who used to enjoy chem, Lisa managed to ruin it entirely for me. I'm pretty sure she was ordered by the Dpt. to make this a weed out class- everyone I knew thought this class was atrociously taught and graded incredibly unfairly."
8633,2225119,2.0,5.0,"At first, I really enjoyed this class. Morkowchuk seems fairly sweet from her lectures, and I didn't mind going until the first test. It focused so little on what we focused on in class. 30% of one of the tests was on a subject that we spend 5 minutes on in class, which was ridiculous. Overall, her tests relate nothing to what she actually teaches"
8634,2225119,1.0,4.0,"Uninspiring, heartless professor who teaches like a robot and creates ruthless exams with only 25-26 points each meant to weed out those pursuing pre-med. Teaches using a scribbled note of paper she projects on the screen, and talks in a daunting, pessimistic tone as to give her students no hope in improving and enjoying chem. Avoid at all costs..."
8635,2225119,5.0,4.0,"Took this class during the Summer, so it was a lot of work with an exam every Friday. Professor Morkowchuk was very prepared and methodical with her lectures which made them easy to follow. She is also incredibly beautiful."
8636,2225119,2.0,4.0,"There are plenty of UVA chem professors who structure their tests and quizzes in a way that lets students demonstrate what they know. Morkowchuk isn't one of them.  Save you energy and take gen chem with a prof who is going to make chem interesting and (somewhat ) enjoyable, not a professor who designs assessments to trick you."
8637,2225119,2.0,4.0,Lectures didn't prepare you for homework. Tests didn't reflect a most of the homework and most test questions had some twist. Tests were out of 26 points tops (miss 2 and out of A- range) and 5 question quizzes (15% of grade) had no partial credit. Never knew what to expect on tests/quizzes. Think like her and do every practice problem you can.
8638,2225119,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed my class with Prof. Morkowchuk. She is a very caring professor and truly wants you to pass her class. Although the class is a typical pre-med course, she makes the necessary topics easy to understand and retain. The textbook is VERY important. If you want to do well on the tests, definitely reinforce the notes from class by reading"
8639,2225119,4.0,4.0,She was enthusiastic and changed the level of the tests based on how the students did on the tests.
8640,1045472,3.5,2.0,Ok
8641,1045472,1.0,5.0,"agreed, atrocious teacher"
8642,1045472,3.5,3.0,No Comments
8643,1045472,1.0,5.0,"She is absolutely the worse teacher I have ever had. I actually feel like I am unlearning everything I properly learned in fluid mechanics. She has no clue about what is going on. Her notes are terrible, she makes countless mistakes, she nervously laughs about worthless stuff and her homework is literally impossible because she can't teach. AVOID."
8644,1045472,2.0,3.0,"Prof Curran is the worst teacher I have had at UVa. She is absolutely terrible. She is extremely disorganized and makes countless mistakes in lecture. Homework assignments are impossible because she is so unclear. The book is usless as well so you need to go to class to get notes, but it is such a waste of time to go because she cant keep on topic."
8645,300000,1.0,5.0,"Prof Nelson knows what he's talking about and is a pretty good lecturer. That being said, he structures his classes horribly, only have 4 assessments, making the midterm weigh a lot, and only have 1 grade in before the final had to be taken. Also he uses norm-reference curved grading in a subjective class which absolutely makes no sense."
8646,300000,5.0,4.0,"Seriously, jump at any opportunity to learn from or work with Professor Nelson. The way that he structures his courses is clearly masterful -- you'll learn heaps from lecture alone because this man knows how to TEACH. Be prepared for one of those rare classes that truly reminds you why educational institutions are sacred and indispensable things."
8647,300000,5.0,3.0,"He's really charismatic and he's not afraid to joke around. There are very few assignments (three short papers, a midterm, and a final) so you NEED to put time into studying for them. We analyzed all sides of Thomas Jefferson and I'm glad that Nelson didn't make TJ out to be a saint. Moral of the class was that TJ was a complex hypocrite."
8648,300000,5.0,3.0,HE is the best professor i have ever had
8649,300000,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor. Make sure to do all the reading and take notes during the lectures. The individual portion of the main group project for the class I took (ARTH 2753) was very stressful and difficult, but if you seek the right guidance and work hard in the class its possible to get an A. Great lecturer and great course!"
8650,300000,5.0,3.0,Great Class
8651,300000,5.0,3.0,Great Professor!
8652,300000,4.0,4.0,Stone cold pedagogical excellence.
8653,300000,5.0,3.0,"Louis is easily the best professor I've had so far at UVA (4 semesters). You can tell he's passionate about the course material and  the lectures are amazing! That being said, the readings are pretty intense (although no textbook!) and you really get out of the class what you put into it."
8654,300000,5.0,4.0,"Professor Nelson is one of my favorite professors I have had so far in college. I am not an architecture major, but found his class engaging and his talks very interesting. He is a fair but tough grader. There was a lot of reading and writing in my class, but he gives you plenty of useful feedback on papers. He is particularly a stickler on prose."
8655,300000,4.5,3.0,Professor Nelson is a really interesting guy. His lectures are great - very engaging and easy to follow. It's obvious he has a true passion for what he's doing as well as an excellent understanding of it. I would really recommend his Arts&Cultures of the Slave South class with Professor McInnis. The two really teach well together!
8656,300000,5.0,3.0,"Great lecturer.  Even if you aren't interested in the class, you will be by the end of it.  Lectures are very organized and tests are very straightforward with no tricks."
8657,300000,5.0,3.0,"Louis Nelson is a great guy and a great teacher.  His lectures are interesting and well organized. Also, he is reeeeeeeeally hot."
8658,300000,5.0,3.0,Louis Nelson = AMAZING!!!! I could not have asked for better!
8659,300000,4.5,4.0,"Professor Nelson's class was well organized, entertaining, and very interesting.  His lectures are awesome, and he tells you the exact information that you need to know.  The term paper was a challenge, but if you study hard and follow the directions on all tests, quizzes, and assignments, an A is definitely attainable."
8660,300000,4.0,3.0,"Nelson is a great professor.  The paper is tricky, so you must be creative. DO NOT MISS LECTURE, ever. I loved this class so much that Arch. History is going to be my minor.  Take this class!"
8661,300000,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely loved this class! Professor Nelson's lectures were the easiest to pay attention to and very well organized. And he tells you exactly what he wants on tests, quizzes, and papers which is so helpful. Also, he has a great sense of humor which always helps makes things more interesting. Take this class!!!"
8662,300000,5.0,4.0,... he's great!
8663,300000,5.0,2.0,really nice...well spoken  good sense of humor and sense of how to help his students. very approachable.
8664,300000,4.5,3.0,"i definitely recommend this class...nelson is a great teacher and knows the material.  he makes the lectures really fun, and has really corny jokes.  the material is kinda hard but he tells you exactly what he is looking for. make sure you attend lectures"

8666,1774564,2.0,2.0,"He acted like he knew everything about everything, yet anytime someone asked him a question he could not give a direct response. Generally easy class though. He gives you the exam questions throughout the semester so just memorize those and thats all you need to know. I barely did any readings, just what was needed to write my papers and got an A-"
8667,1774564,1.5,3.0,I had Professor Duncan for Intro to Moral and Political Philosophy. His lectures were extremely dull and essentially pointless; he depends heavily on previously made powerpoint slides which don't usually make much sense. He was pretty unclear about many of the philosophies we discussed. He had a few funny examples; he's a pretty funny guy though.
8668,193521,1.0,3.0,"This guy sucks.  He rambles on about stuff that is extremely unclear.  This USEM was on E-Comm, but instead he just talked about outdated technology, useless or extremely obvious info about websites.  He lost my midterm paper and his class is mind-numbing.  Learned NOTHING."
8669,193521,2.0,1.0,I'm sitting here in class pulling my hair out and hitting my head. He has no idea what he is going to talk to us about ahead of time. He just rambles on about random things I have no clue where he's going. Good thing we have computers in here.But its an A
8670,193521,2.5,2.0,Another useless COMM prof. who tells you stories about his wife all day.  You won't learn a thing from him.  Stay away!
8671,1643532,5.0,1.0,Best prof
8672,1643532,4.0,2.0,"Topic was Stereotypes. Make her like you early and you'll do better on papers. Class didn't teach much new information, but the topic was interesting. She's a little hard to understand sometimes, but not too bad. I got an A-, papers were easy. No exam. good for ENWR"
8673,1643532,3.5,1.0,My class was on stereotypes. The class was really interesting with a lot of discussion about topics. We have a total of four papers that are pretty easy. Plus she's super hot.
8674,1643532,4.0,1.0,Very nice and approachable.
8675,1856524,5.0,3.0,Dr. Connelly changed my life. She is truly an incredible professor who loves and cares for every student she teaches.
8676,1856524,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Connelly is a fantastic professor. She makes learning the material feel so effortless, and she is incredibly knowledgeable of what she is teaching. Her tests can be tough, but they come straight from the notes. So, study well and the tests will be a breeze."
8677,1856524,5.0,3.0,I absolutely love her and she is truly passionate about what she teaches.
8678,1856524,5.0,4.0,"Good teacher, makes the class fair. Learned a lot."
8679,1856524,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Connelly is the absolute best. I always looked forward to going to her class and she definitely made my transition to UVA easier! She's honestly like your mom away from home, and her class isn't easy, but so worth it! She cares so much about her students and it's so evident in everything that she does."
8680,1856524,5.0,3.0,"I love Dr. Connelly!!! She is the BEST professor I've had at UVA. Her class is extremely interesting and it is more fun the more you get to know her (and trust me, she definitely wants to get to know you!) She loves teaching and it shows. Her exams are straight out of the notes, so they're hard if you don't study but they're fair. Know your notes. "
8681,1856524,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Connelly was a fantastic teacher! She actually cared and was willing to explain things if you were confused. The tests were pretty hard, but they were straight from our notes."
8682,1856524,5.0,3.0,Dr. Connelly is the best! She's very helpful and cares about her students. Her lectures are interesting and fun and her tests are hard but they come straight from the notes so there are no surprises.
8683,1856524,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Connelly is by far my favorite professor at UVA. She makes a hard class understandable, and she takes the time to learn all of her student's names. Her tests are challenging, but they come straight from the notes and are very fair."
8684,373778,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Murphy is one of the most understanding professors I've had. He has also been one of my most talkative professors. It's not a bad thing, just be prepared to listen. There were no tests and our grade revolved around three papers that we were allowed to edit and turn in at the end for our final grade."
8685,373778,3.0,2.0,"Good teacher, nice guy, but he talks FOREVER. Likes to ramble on and on, but is super flexible when it comes to deadlines and to papers. Read the books and be ready to talk about anything and you'll be fine."
8686,373778,5.0,3.0,Murphy is great - a really good teacher and a really nice guy. I'd gladly take him again.
8687,373778,3.0,2.0,"Easy, but boring. Rambles on and on and on....."
8688,373778,1.0,3.0,The only thing that kept me involved in this class was Prof. Kinney.  This guy has no idea what he's talking about and doesn't really care a lot about students.  Doesn't respond to emails. Bad feedback.  Not helpful. And can't lecture for anything.
8689,373778,5.0,2.0,Mr. Murphy is *excellent.*  He is one of the best instructors I have had at UVA.  The other rater from ENLT 226 misrepresents Mr. Murphy's performance in the course.  He has a great sense of humor and he did a great job with class discussion  He is a fair grader and allows an extension on one assignment.  He gives lots and lots of helpful feedback.
8690,373778,2.0,5.0,"Murphy is NOT a friendly grader and has a zero late work policy. Did a good job fostering discussion for maybe the first two classes but after that i expected to hear him speak for a least 45 minutes randomly in the middle of every class. Try to avoid, if possible"
8691,373778,5.0,2.0,"Friendly grader, approachable, and clearly explains material while fostering discussion."
8692,373778,3.5,1.0,"The class is alright, though he does seem to enjoy the sound of his own voice at times.  He is very flexible though and willing to move due dates when necessary."
8693,1274908,5.0,3.0,"Christine is a gem of a professor.  I had her while she was in her final year of PhD studies, and she was incredible:  clear, warm, welcoming, engaged, and interesting.   The class certainly wasn't a cakewalk, but expectations were clearly outlined with an easy-to-understand rubric, and she was incredibly helpful in office hours.  Fantastic."
8694,1274908,4.5,3.0,Great Professor. A lot of fun. Very helpful and recommend this course highly.
8695,1274908,4.0,2.0,"A very good graduate student for ENWR 110 - Medievalism Today. Only four papers and they are mainly based on films. You are guaranteed a B if you can write. Attendance is mandatory, but you are allowed 3 &quot;absences&quot;."
8696,1905695,2.0,4.0,"Professor Burns is a very passionate about materials science and even though it is an intro class, don't expect it to be easy. He goes through all the powerpoints really fast which is overwhelming. The tests are really hard because they are multiple multiple choice and math questions. All I have to say is go to the TA's!! They will explain it well."
8697,1905695,5.0,3.0,"Kind of reads from the power points, but a good clear teacher. Posts all of his lectures online. Not that difficult of a class if you do the reading and a normal, expected amount of studying, because it's a lot of vocabulary to learn."
8698,767009,3.5,3.0,"Cool guyfun topic. Lectures could be a bit dry but has the occasional flurry of energy that kept me awake. If you do the readings and try on the papers and final, then it should be an easy class. Fulfills non-western requirement."
8699,767009,3.5,1.0,"Very nice man, easy grader."
8700,767009,2.5,2.0,"Easy, enjoyable class.  Professor Lyons is a beast among men.  He knows his material and can speak roughly 6 Euro-Asian languages.  There are two book/internet site/movie reviews and two tests, which consist of several short essays.  I definately recommend this class not just for its scholarly value, but also because of the chance to experience Sha"
8701,767009,3.5,1.0,"He possess the strength of 10 men and his only weakness is the small spot on the back of his heel where he was held while dipped in the river sticks.  Good easy class, knows his stuff."
8702,767009,3.0,2.0,He means well
8703,2102308,4.0,2.0,"Fairly interesting course that packed a lot of African history into the semester without sacrificing quality. Grading was fair and more on the lenient side, and consisted mostly of short papers. Pretty frequent mentions of her research work, but otherwise engaging as far as lectures go."
8704,2102308,5.0,3.0,She is very interested in and devoted to the course material and how the students react to the material.
8705,2102308,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've taken at UVa. I took an intro course - very good for challenging preconceptions about Africa and African history. Really passionate about teaching and approachable to students. For Early African History, there are four tests and one two page paper. Readings are manageable, but you do have to go to class."
8706,799784,5.0,3.0,Most enthusiastic teacher I've ever had. Loves his subject. Almost inspired me to switch from Finance to Marketing . . . almost. Entertained and learned a lot. Great teacher and a man of very good character.
8707,799784,4.0,3.0,The most interesting teacher in the COMM 180 sequence.  Comes off a little intense but is great at getting your attention.
8708,799784,4.0,2.0,lindgren is awesome!!!! entertaining classes and shows hilarious tv advertisements! may scare you at first but he's a lot of fun!! his 5 classes are probably the only ones in comm180 that are worth to attend...plus he gives fairly easy tests. just know the materials well and you are golden.
8709,799784,4.5,2.0,I love Jack Lindgren! He's the most entertaining professor I've ever met from the COMM school.
8710,799784,5.0,2.0,Enthusiastic and lively! Amazing professor and he really connects with the students. I wish I could have him for all my classes. He gives you simple examples to relate material to and his tests are pretty straight forward. Definitely take him if you can!
8711,799784,5.0,5.0,"What a stud, awesome prof, great guy"
8712,2741290,3.0,5.0,"Gennady is really smart. He's also quite funny; there were a few moments where he cracked a joke that made me laugh. That being said, though, Gennady is not a great teacher. This class is going to take up your time more than anything else. This class alone accounted for more than half of my total homework. And that final, jesus. Hardest test ever."
8713,2741290,1.0,5.0,Gennady is the nicest &amp; worst math teacher I have ever had. Although he is smart he is also over qualitied for his position teaching calc 3 and is hard to understand. If you have taken mulitvariable before it is still confusing. His only grades are tests and homework and his homework are unsolvable without office hours. Do not take this class
8714,2634802,5.0,3.0,"These other reviews of Natasha Heller really don't accurately reflect her. She is a really caring professor who gives feedback on everything and constantly checks in with her students about how the class is going and if we want to change anything. I've taken her 2 semesters in a row, got an A both times and learned so much. 10/10 recommend"
8715,2634802,1.0,3.0,"Other review said it perfectly - Professor Heller is only focused on career and not on her students. I found her to be distracted, patronizing, and an ineffective lecturer. Beware if you are in Religious Studies / East Asian Studies - not worth your time dealing with her."
8716,2634802,1.0,1.0,Horribly rude to students. Cares about her career more than anything else.
8717,1496116,4.0,3.0,"Cogill knows his stuff and is a pretty good lecturer.  He lays out the basics and expects you to try the challenging stuff on your own first, but will help you if you get stuck and then approach him."
8718,46132,5.0,1.0,"Very cheery and nice guy. Explains things well, and the quizzes and tests are a breeze. The class follows the book for the most part, and it's very good, so it can be used if you miss a class or something."
8719,46132,5.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher. I barely had to read the textbook because his notes are so good. Attendance is mandatory, but definitely worth it."
8720,46132,4.0,2.0,No Comments
8721,46132,4.5,3.0,"Awesome teacher, keeps a dry subject interesting, and plus his fourth hours are at 1 oclock take this class if you have the opportunity"
8722,46132,5.0,3.0,"Takes attendence every class, takes it really seriously. But he's still really amazingg. Probably the best professor i've had so far. Makes the material much easier. His quizzes are sometimes culumative and requires you to constantly keep up with the work, but still reasonable. Just make sure you dont get on his bad side and go to class everyday."
8723,46132,5.0,2.0,"Had him for multivariate last year, was an absolutely awesome professor. Explains things so that they are easy to understand, quizzes are a little easier, but I felt like I understood the material better than people in the other classes. Take his class if you can, he's one of the best professors I've had at the University."
8724,46132,5.0,2.0,"Wicked funny teacher. The BEST teacher Ive had so far at the entire University. He takes subject matter which could possibly be wicked challenging and makes it easy and have some fun while you're there. His quizzes and tests aren't bad at all, a few tricks, but thats it. If you CAN take him...DO IT. Seriously. Irish accent with a lisp, 'nough said!"
8725,46132,4.5,2.0,"Awesome man! HIGHLY recommended!! Very nice guy, funny in class, but also very good at teaching subject matter. Go for it! Also not too difficult avg this semester is a B+"
8726,46132,5.0,3.0,Best professor in Engineering !
8727,46132,5.0,3.0,I LOVE CORNELIUS!  He is soo cute and funny and nice and a great teacher.  He makes pretty easy tests and is very approachable and helpful.  He is the cutest teacher ever!  Take a class from him if you can because I wish he could be my teacher forever!  Cornelius is the best EVER!!
8728,46132,4.5,1.0,he is AWESOME..  i mean his quizzies and tests were relatively easy and simple.  I am REALLY glad that I had him for multivariable calculus

8730,46132,5.0,3.0,"This guy is great!  If you can take multivar from him, go for it.  He has a quirky yet entertaining sense of humor.  His quizzes and tests are easier than the other professors'.  He explains material concisely and is very down-to-Earth."

8734,1496124,3.0,2.0,"Bob is a great guy, very funny and he does his best to make the material engaging. However, his powerpoints are ridiculously long and he never has time to get through the details in an effective way. Instead, you're left with hundreds of slides to look at before each test, most of which won't be relevant to the questions asked. Not great overall"
8735,1496124,2.5,1.0,"To be fair, some people may enjoy Swap's style of lecture: I am not one of those. He is certainly passionate and some find him funny, but I did not.  Swap moves too fast in lecture, but puts the slides up online. His tests are pretty easy, but always include obscure questions. Easy class, but unless you are interested in EVSC, avoid this class."
8736,1496124,4.5,2.0,Professor Swap is a great lecturer and very interested in engaging his students. He's frequently available outside of class and extremely helpful. I definitely recommend taking this class.
8737,1496124,4.5,2.0,Professor Swap always challenged with various ideas. I leave his class feeling more educated and learned about the world. He may be disorganized at times but that's because he includes various current events. He always saw me when I needed help.
8738,1496124,2.0,1.0,"I was very disappointed by this professor. He was poorly organized which led to wasted class time and overall disinterest from the students. By the end of the class, I had a very negative view of development and the impact of foreign aid. Swap was stubborn and inconsistent, very frustrating overall. But if you're going for an easy A, sign up."
8739,1496124,5.0,2.0,"Professor Swap is a really cool guy. If you like environmental science, you should definitely take this class. He's really helpful outside of class and his tests aren't hard at all."
8740,611400,4.5,1.0,Overall enjoyable class.  I think it is his first time teaching this particular course so he was a little bit rusty at times but clearly is extremely insightful and is a great lecturer.    Haven't finished the course yet but it seems like he's pretty chill about grading.  Definitely recommend the class if he teaches it again.  
8741,611400,1.5,4.0,"He showed rudimentary knowledge of the course, occasionally deferring to students when creating GIS models for lack of understanding. He brings absolutely no enthusiasm at all, which is an enormous problem in a two and a half hour seminar. He lectured on irrelevant information and tested based upon this information, OVERALL DISAPOINTED "
8742,611400,5.0,4.0,"People that aren't interested in the subject or are too lazy to work hard and learn from him should not take this class.  He assigns a good amount of reading, but if you do it you will learn to love this class and benefit greatly from his expertise.  Definitely recommend! PS-he grades EXTREMELY fairly almost all of my friends got A's or A-'s."
8743,611400,5.0,4.0,"Brilliant professor. Talk to him in office hours and go to class, otherwise you won't get on his good side. He's passionate about what he does!"
8744,611400,1.0,3.0,Professor Charles Kromkowski was very demotivating. He did not take any interest in my well-being in the class and was very rude when I went to his office hours for help. He did not coach me or mentor me but instead belittled me and made me feel like I should not be in his class. Never take a class of his.
8745,611400,5.0,3.0,Very insightful lectures.  One of my favorite professors this semester so far.  Going to look for classes to take from him in the future.
8746,611400,3.5,2.0,his class was painfully boring and he usually ends up holding us over 15-20 minutes after we've already had to endure a 2.5 hour class. He assigns hundreds of pages of reading each week that is nearly impossible to complete and we must write a 1-3 page summary every week so you have to try to keep up. Readings are very random
8747,611400,4.5,4.0,Fair professor.  A lot of reading.  He is very knowledgeable and passionate about Virginia State Elections.  The GIS mapping is actually interesting and he is more than willing to help outside of classroom hours with projects etc.
8748,611400,4.0,2.0,"I took his class on VA elections. Krom def expected us to complete the heavy reading load, but it was worth it bec. it allowed us to have some enlightening discussions. A pretty easy seminar all things considered-just 3 two-pg summaries, 3 quizzes, and a 5-pg paper- but he does expect a huge group project at the end relying heavily on GIS data."
8749,611400,4.0,4.0,"I took two of his classes - 424D and 464.  While each class had a lot of reading (and you had to type a summary each week so there is no chance of falling behind) I found the seminar sessions engaging and interesting.  He is extremely intelligent, promotes discussion in the class, and is very reasonable with assignments and grading."
8750,611400,4.0,2.0,"Interesting class with a lot of insight into political process (and how much of a quagmire it is). His lectures sometimes become dry, especially when he tries to explain simple concepts with weird theories, but knows his stuff and is a good guy. Yes there is a large amount of reading but if you read it even decently the quizzes are pretty easy."
8751,611400,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, great class.  Be prepared to read a lot, Krom likes to pile on the reading each week.  However, he is amazingly intelligent and his lectures are thought provoking and fun. He is also a very fair grader. No complaints, overall a wonderful experience"
8752,611400,5.0,3.0,"great professor - highly recommened!  reading is a little heavy, though"
8753,848971,5.0,2.0,awesome class but tough
8754,848971,1.0,5.0,"He has a very monotone voice, so the lab lectures were not very engaging.  The info wasn't too helpful either because it was just stuff that was covered on the slides.  TA grading and the final were both crapshoots."
8755,848971,1.5,5.0,"Had him for lab lecture -- really, really boring, monotone voice, and the material doesn't help. If only we could know in advance when the head TA was coming instead."
8756,848971,1.0,5.0,"If you want a professor who sounds like Ben Stein, doesn't make any sense, and could not care less about teaching you, this guy is for you."
8757,848971,1.5,5.0,"The only reason this class subsists is because of his head TA, Tom Matthews.  Macdonald would be excellent, except that he's disorganized, can't teach, and doesn't care.  The final is an absolute crapshoot."
8758,848971,5.0,4.0,"One of the first professors i've had who didn't need the textbook as a crutch.  You could learn everything you need just from his lectures with minimal outside reading.  He also managed to have lunch with almost everyone in the class.  I also had him for 182L where he was infact monotone and boring, but that was a lab lecture..."
8759,848971,2.0,4.0,Ugh! Hard to keep attention too due to monotone voice. Did not seem like he wanted to be teaching the class. Curve was unfair- he told the class curve-altering information during the final!
8760,848971,2.5,4.0,"Not clear at all in lab lecture, he didn't seem like he liked the subject at all, except for little dry jokes here and there. Curve at the end of the semester wasn't nice at all and getting suck with harsh grading TAs was terrible (normalization didn't fix the problem). And the class was very time consuming."
8761,2372687,2.0,4.0,"Though you'd expect philosophy (lvl 101) would be fairly easy and valuable to boosting your gpa without too much effort, you'd be harshly mistaken with this class. Very long lectures with confusing quizzes based on said lectures. Definitely take any other lvl 100 humanities course. Also quizzes and participation are the only grades you'll receive."
8762,1119315,2.0,5.0,"I agree with the previous assessment! The class was at 8a.m. and listening to his monotone voice put me to sleep almost every time. He only has two tests, an extra credit paper and a final. Grades harshly, no room for error. There is no curve, at all. Everything came from the book and directly off lecture slides. No need to attend."
8763,1119315,4.0,2.0,"Easy course. He posts all the slides. Tests are moderately easy if you read the slides and the text but there is an optional paper if you do poorly on one exam. OK lecturer, can't really go wrong with taking abnormal psych if he teaches it."
8764,1119315,4.0,5.0,No Comments
8765,1119315,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Aaron is an awesome lecturer.  He is actually a practicing psychiatrist so he def knows what hes talking about.  He's also kinda nice to look at at 8am in the morning...  ;)  Pretty awesome class.  DEF read the book-- exams can be pretty tough, but he's fair in grading.  Optional paper too to replace one test grade.  2 tests, cumulative final"
8766,554067,4.0,4.0,Clear and unambiguous.  Lectures from start of class to finish with no interruption.  Discussion section attendance recommended.
8767,554067,3.0,4.0,"Copeland is a good professor, and his lectures are pretty clear. He's very knowledgeable and excited about the information. Reading is ridiculous, class is on the challenging side of things, but do-able."
8768,554067,3.5,3.0,"It was a really interesting class! Reading is ridiculous, try reading a couple of things each week, not ALL. Copeland is enthusiastic, friendly, and gives good lectures. The only assignments are a 10-page paper and a pretty easy final (other comment), so devote a lot of time to them, and participate in discussion. Also, Catherine Sanger = awesome."
8769,554067,5.0,4.0,"Considerable amount of heavy reading involved in this course. The theories are more important than the historical information. Learn to master them and use them to make clear, logical arguments with reference to historical evidence when necessary. Clear lectures and try to have Catherine Sanger as your TA."
8770,554067,2.5,4.0,Very difficult class. RIDICULOUS amount of online reading that is never clarified.  Lectures not really all that helpful as final exam and midterm are taken directly from the midterm.  Entirely too focused on his own DDT theory with little mention of modern conflict (except Iraq).  Not recommended.
8771,554067,4.5,2.0,"I highly recommend this class to people who are pursuing a major within the politics department. There is considerable amount of reading involved; however, they are not too hard and you learn a lot. Mr. Copeland elucidates the cases quite well in his lectures and if you have questions, you can always bring them to the TAs."
8772,554067,4.5,3.0,good lectures a ton of reading but all of it worth it....really prof...super enthused to teach it
8773,554067,2.5,5.0,"If you are considering taking this class, THINK AGAIN. The amount of reading for his class is INSANE. There are 2 books to buy, and approx 2,000 pages of online articles, which he requires you to print. This class should be a graduate class. If you are not satisfied with reading/studying and having no social life, do NOT take this class!!"
8774,554067,4.5,3.0,gOOD TEACHER
8775,554067,5.0,2.0,best professor ever
8776,554067,3.0,4.0,"A well trained realist IR theoretician, but omits a great deal of the rest of the paradogms in his lectures."
8777,554067,4.0,2.0,"Great professor. Agree that it should be more modern, but still very interesting. Good amount of reading. Final exam- he gave us 5 essay questions to prepare for a week in advance, had to do 3. Also got to use a 4 x 6 notecard. If you go to lecture and do the readings, and can make an argument, you will get at least a B, probably an A.  Take it!"
8778,554067,3.0,3.0,"I concur with prior statement.  Copeland very much preaches from his book on Dynamic Differentials.  And he talks way too much about the current Iraq war as a quagmire ala Vietnam, which it's not.  The readings are good although I've had most of it in other classes.  He should just call the class &quot;Copeland's Perspective on War&quot; but I doubt many students would sign up."
8779,554067,3.5,3.0,"Heavily theory-based military force IR class. Good class, but Copeland, I think, errs in supporting in his lectures almost entirely only his personal quasi-neo-realist &quot;dynamic differentials theory&quot; Focuses heavily on major wars (WW1, 2)--would do better to shift  to smaller, more modern conflicts."
8780,226389,3.0,3.0,"He's not the best lecturer--really boring, slow, and unenthusiastic.  I hardly ever went to class.   I've got to give him some credit though, because he seems like a really nice guy who genuinely cares about his students.  He's just not a good lecturer."
8781,226389,2.0,5.0,"Bryant is a bad lecturer. His lectures are boring, and attendance has slowly decreased as a result. I think it's clear that he loves chemistry, but he is not right for teaching gen chem."
8782,226389,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Bryant does a decently good job making quantum mechanics understandable for people who don't know a lot of math; if you open your eyes once in a while, you may discover his &quot;conceptual&quot; approach. The class is heavy on spectroscopy, which makes sense because he knows more NMR than anyone else in the department. And he's a nice man too."
8783,226389,4.5,4.0,"I heard a lot of bad things about this class, but it turned out to be both reasonable and enlightening. Dr. Bryant is both helpful and a genius. Those who whine might perhaps benefit from taking a minute to brush up on their basic math (e.g. dx/x = dlnx)and actually trying to understand the material rather than plugging and chugging."
8784,226389,4.5,3.0,If you are intellectually retarded I could understand you disliking his style. But if you have a three digit IQ there's no reason not to enjoy his classes.  The guy is so smart it'll make your head spin. He is a walking chemistry encyclopedia.  Wise students will take advantage of what an amazing resource Dr. Bryant is.
8785,226389,5.0,1.0,"the hottest man alive. intellectually exciting. however, do not transfer into the honor series out of his class mindlessly. know, physical chemistry is not until the  very end. til then he wont be around to keep your motor running."
8786,226389,5.0,2.0,Great teacher.
8787,226389,1.0,5.0,He has the amazing ability to make a person absolutely hate chemistry.  Awful teacher.
8788,226389,5.0,1.0,not any different from other profs got A
8789,226389,1.0,5.0,"Though he may know chemistry, he rambles and does not lecture on the material in the book.  His elaborate slide shows and graphs are impressive, although they are useless when you do not know what they say.  Office hours are also a joke as he tends to speak in another language."
8790,226389,1.5,4.0,"Don't take him unless you're very interested in chem. Otherwise, you're bound to skip/fall asleep in class. Tests are ridiculously harsh, and have little to do with lectures."
8791,226389,1.0,3.0,"I'm usually not one to skip class, but with this class, I felt like going to class was useless.  Halfway through every class I'd think about just getting up and leaving, but I didn't want to be rude.  Afterall, he's a nice guy. He's just not a great teacher. Plus, I hate the way he stutters!"
8792,226389,2.0,5.0,"Very hard to follow lectures, kinda funny/interest, but makes tests ridiculously hard (I took honors chem previously and study for the tests)"
8793,226389,1.0,5.0,"aweful professor, will make u want to hate chem"
8794,226389,3.5,3.0,"His tests, while hard, were based off the book and not-impossible. His final was borderline easy. You all sound a little bitter: chemistry is inherently hard, this ain't high school anymore and he's not treating you like a baby when 50 people are right behind you trying harder. Step up or step out."
8795,226389,1.0,3.0,Horrible teacher.  worst teacher in chem department.  in his own world.  uses calculus to teach a non-calculus based course.
8796,226389,1.0,4.0,"I have had two years of chemistry in high school before, and I found interest in studying the subject more until he came along.  He totally sucked out the fun in Chemistry.  I used to enjoy doing nomenclature and thermodynamics in high school, now I've just grown to hate them.  Find another teacher!"
8797,226389,1.0,5.0,"I could teach the class better, not kidding. He is bad at teaching, planning, organizing, and making quizzes. They are completely irrelavent, and that's what makes them hard. He makes tons of careless errors as well, which is surprising b/c there re 450 students that suffer from his stupid errors."
8798,226389,1.0,4.0,terrible
8799,226389,4.0,4.0,Lectures not nearly as bad as people say
8800,226389,1.0,5.0,"He is a horrible professor.  Lecture time is completely useless.  Out of the crap covered in lecture, he puts the most insignificant things on the quizzes.  Would have been an easy class if he didn't teach it.  Beware!!!!!"
8801,226389,1.0,5.0,"Teaching to a lecture of 500 students where his tests/homeworks/and slides had nothing to do with each other and an average test score of 35 sometimes made this class a nightmare, where a monkey would get the same grades as a human."
8802,226389,1.5,4.0,He is incredibly brilliant but he sometimes forgets that it is an intro-chem class.  a lot of stuff is going to go over your head- advice: take gerrans
8803,226389,1.0,3.0,don't bother going to lecture because you won't understand a single thing that comes out of his mouth. your time would be better spent napping. take gerrans instead.
8804,226389,1.5,5.0,USELESS...take gerrans or get a C
8805,226389,1.0,5.0,Find a different chem teacher
8806,226389,1.0,5.0,No Comments
8807,226389,1.5,4.0,He really doesn't seem relevant and it's hard to focus when he rambles on about stuff that doesn't make sense. The last class of the semester as his review for the final he talked about burning corn. I learned a whole lot more from TA Ben's recitations.
8808,226389,1.0,4.0,"take gerrans or metcalf, but not Bryant. He is a horrible teacher, anything you learn in this class will be done on your own time and good luck retaining it. Lecture is pointless, he is incoherent a majority of the time. material isnt too tough."
8809,226389,1.5,5.0,"Awful weed-out class. Vague, unclear lectures... review the old quizzes and read the book."
8810,226389,3.5,3.0,"He makes you think a lot, which some lazy kids don't like to do.  However I find his class challenging and interesting because it doesn't just rehash the book.  He brings new perspectives and applications into the discussion."
8811,226389,1.5,4.0,"Very blue eyes...watch out. He is smart and knows he is. Gets really deep in class. Hard to stay awake. Has a dry sense of humor, but has one. If speak in class, he likes you better."
8812,226389,1.0,4.0,out of over 200 students between 60 and 75 are actually in class.
8813,226389,1.0,5.0,"Don't take his class!  He is extremely unclear.  When I go to class I don't understand anything he's saying.  Read the book, do the homework, and take the old quizzes.  It's the only way to pass the class."
8814,226389,1.0,5.0,"Probably the worst teacher I've ever had.  He knows what he's talking about, but does a horrible job of relating it.  I've gone to other lectures, it was like night and day."
8815,226389,1.0,5.0,Nasty man.
8816,226389,2.5,4.0,Read the book at home and the newspaper during lecture.
8817,226389,1.0,4.0,Lectures have little to do with tests and are pointless unless you already understand the material.  He does know what he's talking about though.
8818,226389,1.0,5.0,"Class is worthless, you learn nothing. Extremely hard not to fail."
8819,226389,1.0,3.0,"You will learn NOTHING at his lectures...read the book and do the homework instead. Rather unfriendly and seems a bit arrogant...but he does know his stuff, seriously."
8820,226389,1.0,5.0,No Comments
8821,1864789,2.0,4.0,"Amber is a nice person, but she is very shy.  This is not conducive to being a good lecturer.  She is monotone and a little too defensive if a student asks a clarifying question.  She grades on a letter grade scale and rarely gives anything above a B.  Her quiz questions are annoyingly specific and graded for correctness rather than participation."
8822,1119319,5.0,2.0,"Harriet is awesome! Makes Latin fun at 9 am and has a great sense of humor. Class isn't too hard, but you will need to put at least some effort in. Oh, and you should ask about Kiwis."
8823,1119319,5.0,2.0,"Harriet really is awesome. This class is fast paced and you definitely have to keep up. But she will help you as much as she can, and she's so much fun at the same time. Very nice lady!"
8824,1119319,4.5,3.0,She is Awesome!!!
8825,1119319,5.0,1.0,Harriet-dizzle-shizzle-kizzle... etc... is the best teacher of Latin there is.  period.  I love her to death-- actually made Catullus fun!   :-)
8826,152675,5.0,3.0,Prof van Hover clearly loves teaching. She makes herself available to her students and it is clear that she wants us to love the learning process. Lectures are clear and assignments are ambitious and she provides the necessary support. She models the best practices that will help us succeed in our careers as teachers.
8827,152675,4.5,3.0,Beauty and intelligence are rarely combined so perfectly...I am in love!
8828,152675,5.0,2.0,"Most useful class I've had in the Curry School thus far; perhaps even at UVA, for that matter. Very engaging--It was a pleasure to come to class. What she teaches is actually USEFUL in field placements and student teaching. Very clear about assignments and what she's looking for."
8829,152675,5.0,4.0,No Comments
8830,152675,5.0,3.0,It's irani that she spends so much time at Charlottesville High School.  I think she might teach there as well...or learn there.
8831,1381480,5.0,2.0,"I've taken two classes with Prof. Parker and have loved both of them. He's extremely intelligent and loves to get into the nitty gritty details of literature and history. He might go on a tangent every once in a while, but he always is gifting you a wealth of knowledge and fun facts. Without a doubt one of my favorite professors I've ever had."
8832,1381480,5.0,3.0,"Parker is easily the best lecturer I've ever had for a class. He does readings in lectures that really come alive, and his views on the material are incredibly insightful. He makes you want to read the material, which is great because he designs the midterm and final to be easy as long as you've been going to lecture and keep up with the reading."
8833,1381480,5.0,4.0,"Parker is no doubt one of the smartest professors at UVA. On top of that he is a delight to talk to in his seminars. He challenges his students and expects you to bring 100% to each class, and in return you'll have one of the most enjoyable, most beneficial semesters."
8834,1381480,5.0,4.0,"TBH if you take an English at UVA, take Professor Parker!"
8835,1381480,4.0,3.0,"Parker is a fantastic lecturer. His insights are awesome! He is really hot, too. Go to lecture, take notes, study, & you will do well on the Mterm & Final. Only the works discussed in lecture appear on the exams.If you do not do this, you will fail, just like he tells you at the beginning of the course."
8836,1381480,4.5,3.0,"Great, great professor. Makes the texts more fun that I could imagine. Lots of sexual references and tries to push the limits, but it's all with good intentions. If you want to take an English class, I'd get one with him. VERY ENTERTAINING. It's definitely a class to which I look forward."
8837,1381480,5.0,4.0,"John Parker is the reason I am an English major. I loved going to his class everyday. His examinations of the text are intriguing, clear and his excitement for the reading is tangible. No English majors should graduate without taking one of his courses."
8838,1381480,5.0,3.0,Parker is the man!  His lectures are intriguing and captivating and provide new insights into the text.  Quite possibly the best professor I've ever had!
8839,1381480,4.5,3.0,"He is hilarious, very insightful, very interesting.  Not an overwhelming amount of reading.  The tests are based on the information covered in lecture so attendance is a must (but you only need to study what is covered in lecture).  Exam forced you to ID title, author, who is speaking to whom, give context, and list important themes.  Loved it!"
8840,1299561,3.0,3.0,"He is very patient with students who do not get it at the first time. He explains issues well though he drags some topics unnecessarily. His lectures are monotonous though most of the time they have content, his style is boring and not appealing. Promotion to full prof. pending."
8841,1299561,5.0,3.0,"Gingerich is an extremely clear, careful, patient lecturer.  The class is taught as a seminar and he engages all students actively and takes their ideas seriously.  The course touches on a wide range of Latin American countries, political institutions, and polisci topics.  A must-take for pol students interested in L.A. or institutions."
8842,1299562,5.0,2.0,He is one of my helpful professors that helped me so much.
8843,1299562,5.0,1.0,"Ling 509 provides a very pragmatic, comprehensive, and useful introduction to teaching English as a Second Language.  Professor McCollum knows an extraordinary amount about the subject, and he creates a very positive classroom environment.  The course isn't difficult.  If you are interested in the topic, take this class!"
8844,849008,5.0,3.0,Megan is a fabulous teacher. She will meet you where you are and help you get to where you want to be. She is one of the best art professors in the department.
8845,849008,3.0,2.0,dont get on her bad side.  so-so teacher
8846,849008,5.0,4.0,"Awesome professor, you'll learn a lot, but be sure to work hard and go to class!"
8847,849008,4.0,3.0,"Megan is kooky for sure, but really knows what she's talking about.  SHe's into all kinds of art and can find the best and worst in any painting.  Ask for help, and she'll make your stuff tons better than it was.  She's really funny and gives awesome assignments."
8848,849008,2.5,3.0,All of the learning in this class is self-directed. She offers really loose instruction at the beginning of each session that kind of doesn't really help. She doesn't hold your hand.
8849,849008,3.5,3.0,She cusses and offers sporadic advice for drawing improvements. We did lots of figure drawing with (almost) nude models and then did 3 outdoors projects with soft pastel. Tries to scare you off by saying that very few people get an A.
8850,1643632,1.0,5.0,"Under no circumstances would I recommend taking 2415 with this professor. Trying to learn physics from him is like trying to go to space in a Honda Civic. I sit in class, pay attention and leave dumber than when I walked in. I can't begin to express how frustrating it is to go from enjoying physics to taking this sorry excuse for a class."
8851,1643632,1.0,5.0,Well let me tell yall about the time he stared at his powerpoint for a solid 5 minutes and didn't understand what was happening. You literally just have to go for the clicker questions but even then it is a torture to wake up and have to sit through lecture for an hour and 15 minutes just to come out even more confused. Escape while you can.
8852,1643632,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I have ever had the horror of taking. One time during lecture the man walked into class with a jumbo sized jar of pickles under his arm. Staring at us the entire time, he placed the jar on the desk, unscrewed it, and proceeded to consume the entire jar while clicking through slides, maintaining eye contact all the while."
8853,1643632,1.0,5.0,He is the laziest and most useless professor I have ever had. He works out practice problems incorrectly and just copies notes from power points he found online.
8854,1643632,1.0,5.0,"He is the worst professor at UVA. He is awful at explaining and has subjective clicker questions, yet he still makes them multiple choice. When he sees that just 60% of the class has the answer right, he feels no need to explain."
8855,1643632,1.0,5.0,"Didn't learn a single thing all year in this class. He's not one of those teachers who's either hated or loved, the general consensus is that he's a terrible teacher. He seems like a fairly nice guy, but he just mumbles during lecture, doesn't teach anything, and expects far too much for the iClicker questions."
8856,1643632,1.0,5.0,Literally the most useless professor ever. All he does is mumble things off of the powerpoint that only makes you more confused. The only reason people attend his class is because of the clicker questions.
8857,1643632,1.0,4.0,"He skips important notes, doesn't explain anything, and is very aloof to the massive confusion of his students"
8858,1643632,1.0,4.0,"By far the worst teacher I have had in my entire life. His powerpoints are incomprehensible, as is he. You must read the book and/or get a tutor. Clicker grades are based on accuracy and participation and he counts all of the questions even when more than half of the class gets it wrong (nearly every question). Avoid him at all costs."
8859,1643632,1.0,4.0,"Shivaram is the worst prof. in the history of professors. He can't explain anything. One time, I asked him to clarify something, and he replied ""no, too easy!"" Rude. His lectures are not organized and he does 10+ clicker questions (graded for accuracy) per lecture on material he hasn't even taught us yet. I used to like physics, and now I hate it.."
8860,1643632,1.0,4.0,"Good lord, if you learn anything from this professor then you are something special. He rambles, works problems incorrectly, and his lectures have nothing to do with the homework. If you are on the fence about taking this course with this professor, DON'T DO IT! p.s. You'll need the textbook, as it is the only thing that will help you."
8861,1643632,1.0,3.0,"Literally the worst teacher I've had at UVA.  Doesn't work with students at all, gives questions with multiple correct answers, then refuses to accept the correct ones.  Homeworks are in broken english and use an incredibly frustrating website."
8862,1643632,1.0,4.0,"He literally takes CHUNKS from the textbook and pastes them into powerpoints. And it's not like it helps with the homework at all, either. When you try to ask him for help, he... just rambles. D: Slightly condescending, too. Try not to take his class if you want to pass."
8863,1733748,2.0,1.0,someone put this dude up here?? Get on his good side and he pretty much feeds you the answers but you don't learn jack.
8864,1733748,5.0,3.0,only TA who deserves to be here. looks out for his students and is a good guy. You'll learn a lot Full of corny jokes.a good guy. discussions make this class worthwhile.very easy to do well in this class
8865,2356349,5.0,3.0,Love him.
8866,2356349,5.0,4.0,Awesome!
8867,2667651,5.0,3.0,"It is a difficult class, but paying attention in class and doing the assignments really helps. Professor Sonkin is also very approachable if you have questions during class/classwork. There are weekly quizzes, but you don't really need to prepare since he goes over the content right before the quizzes, so you're fine."
8868,2667651,4.0,5.0,"MATH1320 is structured horribly - its incredibly hard no matter who you take it with. Sonkin cares about his students, but his quizzes were substantially harder than the other prof's. But, I was more prepared for the exams. His lectures are helpful if ur prepared. He also holds review sessions before exams & stays till ALL ?s are answered. "
8869,2667651,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed MATH1320 with Professor Sonkin. His lectures definitely clarified the material in the textbook, and he was extremely patient and helpful during office hours. I'm not much of a math person, but I would take his class again."
8870,2667651,1.0,3.0,Lectures are basically him going through useless examples. You teach yourself using prep videos and webassign. Barely referred to the textbook. The exams are almost impossible because they always test material that was never taught. Tests basically make up your grade. No extra credit and was very bad at explaining. Would not recommend taking him.
8871,1414285,1.0,1.0,Very political. One sided. Would not recommend unless extremely liberal.
8872,1414285,2.0,2.0,"Prof. Schmidt was very kind and inspiring, but so disorganized that the class became difficult to follow. Her assignments weren't hard but sometimes seemed trivial with unclear instructions. There was a lot of trouble with due dates, and again the class was extremely confusing and chaotic. Definitely interesting, just wish it was better executed."
8873,1414285,2.0,2.0,"Prof. Schmidt cares a lot about activism and the community at UVA, and this engagement class is her passion project. However, the assignments/expectations are often unclear and her lectures tend to stumble and wander. As a political person, I had hoped to learn more but most knowledge was very surface-level. Grading was lenient and group-based."
8874,1414285,5.0,4.0,Very inspirational invidual.
8875,1414285,5.0,4.0,"She is wonderful. She is the wind beneath my wings, as it were. She took me on an ethnic journey I didn't know I needed."
8876,1414285,2.0,4.0,"There is so much reading. If you don't do it, and you're gonna have a REALLY tough time. "
8877,1414285,3.5,3.0,"I enrolled in this class primarily because all other classes fulfilling the non-western requirement were full. I ended up loving the class. As a chem major with taking mostly science courses, this class was wonderful. She is a great lecturer, and the readings are interesting. Must say she is a tough grader. One paper,  midterm/final are all essays."
8878,1414285,3.5,2.0,"This class is different. Lots of emphasis on historiography and learning about an often overlooked aspect of history. LOTS of reading (via collab or books on reserve...~30 to read for each class session). Kind of rambles on in class talking about lots of things. Only 2 tests, 1 paper (easy). You get what you put into this class."
8879,1414285,2.0,4.0,She is very abstract and confusing. Tends to be very theatrical but it makes her point hard to understand.
8880,2307217,5.0,4.0,So I had Dr Peeksmeese several years ago. I didnt leave a review then eventhough the environmental class was really amazing. I still think about the class but yesterday I received a letter that Dr Peeksmeese had us write to ourselves. In the middle of this pandemic it was surreal to get a letter from myself that I wrote three years ago. Thank you!!
8881,2307217,5.0,5.0,Straight up thought I would hate this class bc I did not think I would ever need to know the stuff. I did love the class bc Peeks makes the material really easy to understand and bc he will use UVA info he gets to have us use the formulas on. PNow work in consulting and am impressing others w/ what I know about stats which is cool. Take him.
8882,2307217,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Peeksmease is by far one of the best professors I've had at UVA. He is so passionate about environmental issues, social justice, and sociology. This is a class that makes you think -- it's not a lot of memorization. I would encourage any majors (not just sociology) to take this class!!!"
8883,2307217,5.0,3.0,Peeks is the best prof I have had at UVA. I had him for stats and it was my favorite class last semester. Super engaging and cares about his students. So I went to see what he was teaching this semester and he wasnt listed. I emailed him and he said he wasnt teaching at UVA but might later. Supper bummed but if he does again take him.
8884,2307217,5.0,4.0,I was lucky enough to have Peeks for crime and environmental sociology. Super engaged lectures and loves what he does. Cares about his students and asked me to be part of a book club based on social justice and activism. If he asks you to be part of the book club (there were 13 of us) do it! You wont regret it. Also luv the youtube project!!!
8885,2307217,5.0,5.0,"Dr P was a gpa killer for me but Im glad I took the course. TBH I haven't thought more about a course while at UVA and I am a junior and its mid summer. Lots of reading, lots of work with flex deadlines, and gives tons of feedback. Really cool guy with a diff way of looking at things. Really challenged me in a good way. Take him!"
8886,2307217,5.0,4.0,Peaks is the most caring prof I have had at UVA. I had a lot of personal stuff go down and he worked with me so I could still complete the work. Uses lots of personal examples and very social justice focused. Always wanted to know what we had done to better the world since we last met. Awesome lectures and loved the readings. Tough grader though.
8887,2307217,5.0,5.0,Peakes rocks. Had him for statistics and I HATE math. I thought I would fail but got a B-. I went to his office hours and some other times. Makes all his stats about UVA so you can relate and you can tell he invests a lot in his teaching. I really felt like he saw us as human beings and equals. I actually understand multiple regression -- WOW!
8888,2307217,5.0,5.0,This class is really hard but Dr. Peeksmease is really great. Really invests a lot into his lectures. For an 830 class he was always excited and his energy and humor made class enjoyable. This is my first stats class and while REALLY hard I actually really enjoyed it. He is always available via e-mail or in his office. Caring prof to.
8889,2307217,5.0,5.0,Environmental sociology doesn't have any exams. Lots of assignments and reflections. Gives amazing feedback. I got back nearly 3 pages single spaced for my final project. The class is very activist based so you have to do things in the community and let others know how you feel. Must back everything up with evidence. Very caring and inspired me.
8890,2307217,5.0,5.0,"This class changed my life. Based on talking to Peeks during office hours, I got out of a abusive relationship that I've been in for 2 years. This class made me reconsider my legacy made me want to make my landbase stronger and healthier. Lots of assignments gives lots of feedback. Learned so much about environmental issues. Just made me care more."
8891,2307217,5.0,5.0,This is my 3rd class with Professor PeeksMease. He is why I switched to a Sociology major. Watch out though because the other professors are not like him. I wish I could take more classes with him. If you get the chance take him. I mean he even makes stats relevant and understandable and awesome.
8892,2307217,5.0,5.0,"He sent this to the class. It says who he is.'that I really appreciate and value all of you in this class. There is a legacy worth having and I appreciate you contemplating what your legacy will be during your time on this Earth. That contemplation is the first step toward intentional living. Know yourself, trust yourself, and be kind to yourself."
8893,2307217,5.0,4.0,"Aaron literally changed my life. I cant believe I stumbled into this class. I was so going about the motions and then he snapped me out of it. He kept saying whether I was making the world stronger, healthier, and diverse because of my presence. I reevaluated my friends and people I hung out with. Dang. Just was like, I gotta change things and did."
8894,2307217,5.0,4.0,Taking this right now. He actually makes all the lecture examples about UVA students. So like he gives us the #s of different racial grps @ UVA and then has us figure out ratios and percent changes over the years based on real data. Makes it more relevant and interesting. Plus he actually knows how to teach and cares. Highly recomend the class.
8895,2307217,5.0,5.0,Love this environment class. Lots of reading and assignments but they are all meaningful. You have to make posts in newspapers and put them on your FB page. There is an activism assignment and just lots of cool info. Like also that he assigns radical and mainstream writers so you can figure out where you might be. Really smart and makes me think.
8896,2307217,5.0,3.0,"Genocide via Film with him at JMU. It was the most amazing class. He is so passionate about what he teachers. It's never boring. He is a tough grader, and sometimes there's pop quizzes, but just do the readings he tells you too. He makes an effort to hear out everyone's thoughts about touchy subjects (like genocide). You'll take away so much!"
8897,2307217,5.0,4.0,It's stats and he makes it enjoyable to attend class. Odd but it is my favorite class this semester. Cool guy and really accessible. Always in his office hours and even met me outside office hours. Lots of energy and makes it really relevant. Awesome class and wish he taught more classes at UVA.
8898,2307217,5.0,4.0,Taking environmental sociology from Dr. Peeksmease and love it. Lots of assignments getting us involved in the world where we have to make posts on news sites and our FB page. Super interesting readings and his lectures are awesome. Gives lots of feedback so you can improve. Can tell he really cares about what he does and making the world better.
8899,2307217,5.0,4.0,"Really enjoyed taking this class. Peeks is not like other profs. He will bring up a controversial topic, note the best arguments for competing sides, show you the data and then ask how that data fits into those arguments. Just really cool approach. Decided to become a Soc major after taking him. Always available and really cares about students."
8900,2307217,5.0,3.0,"If you get a chance to take a class with Peeks, do it. He is an amazing lecturer and very engaging. The class itself is very interesting and Peeks provides multiple perspectives when teaching. You will want to go to lectures because all course material is learned through lectures, so take good notes! Exams are not hard if you take good notes."
8901,2307217,5.0,3.0,He is the best professor I have had. I decided to minor in Sociology because of his criminology class. His lectures are great. The tests can be difficult if you do not take close notes during lectures since he will not post powerpoints online. He always makes himself available. Projects and papers are simple and straightforward. Amazing guy
8902,971923,5.0,2.0,I knew Marty before he was a cool Professor.  He helped me through a academic challenge I had with a selflessness that was truly extraordinary. It is great it see he is using his kind personality and keen intellect to shape young minds.  American is better for this vital service he renders to willing minds. I wish him all the best. Koz
8903,971923,4.5,3.0,"Mr. Keutel is the sweetest guy.  He taught me to actually enjoy this subject and i will always love him for that.  Also, his dry sense of humor is excellent!"
8904,971923,5.0,3.0,Mr. Keutel is the best math teacher ever. He is so helpful. He really cares about his students--he learns all of their names. Definitely take math with him!
8905,971923,5.0,3.0,Mr. Keutel is a trip.  He actually makes Calculus...not dry
8906,971923,1.5,4.0,This man needs to stick to teaching calculus 121. When he was teaching 131 was horrible.He cannot explain this in simple words at all. He is a nice guy but  not that good of a teacher.
8907,971923,5.0,3.0,"It's evident how much hard work Mr. Keutel puts into his class and if you put in half of the effort he does, study for quizzes and exams, and read his notes, it's easy to do well.  He's a great person who really cares about his students and goes out of his way to make the subject more understandable.  Do your homework and it'll be fine."
8908,971923,1.5,5.0,this class was definitely a struggle. He assumes that everyone has taken calculus before and knows everything he is talking about... which is obviously not the case.  It was frustrating because I hadn't taken calc before.  I suppose if you have taken calc before you're fine... that goes with in any class than again. Anyways... he's enthusiastic
8909,971923,4.0,2.0,"If you've taken calculus before, then you'll be fine. He can be confusing at times - go to his office hours if you don't understand him. He's really nice and tries to make math interesting."
8910,971923,3.5,3.0,"he teaches well, puts in effort, wants you to learn the subject and is helpful during office hours."
8911,971923,4.0,1.0,He is a great professor. Just pay attention in class and this class will be a breeze.
8912,971923,2.0,5.0,"I agree. :( Avoid if at all possible. Unless you already have a really good understanding of calculus and are just avoiding taking CALC131, then I would suggest steering clear of this &quot;teacher.&quot;"
8913,595097,4.5,1.0,"Shiflet is the man! Although his lectures can get boring, you get more out of it the more you put into the class. 3 non-cumulative midterms were easy if you do the readings and look over the powerpoint. You can study for the exams the day before and do fine. Take it if you need a gut class!"
8914,595097,5.0,1.0,Awesome professor! Definitely take this class! He is really nice and knows a lot! He keeps it interesting and keeps the reading light. TAKE THIS CLASS!!
8915,595097,5.0,1.0,TAKE THIS CLASS. Go to class and you will actually enjoy it (and get extra credit). Shiflet is the dudeeee
8916,595097,4.5,2.0,Classes are kind of boring but you get 10 extra points on your final grade for going. It is an easy A if you study for the 3 exams you have. Exams are not that difficult and are not commutative. Professor Shiflet is extremely helpful and nice. The class is very easy for a science class.
8917,595097,1.5,4.0,Watch out for the DICKENS
8918,595097,3.0,4.0,"WORST PROFESSOR EVER!!! Goes off on tangents that have no relation to the class.  You will be studying for the exams  noticing that you covered only half of the material in the lecture.  If it weren't for the extra credit points rewarded for attending the class, I would not waste a single minute in his lecture.  Good Class, sorry professor"
8919,595097,4.0,1.0,You get out of this class as much as you put in. If you want to learn and are interested in the material go to class and you will learn a lot and get an easy A. If you are just in it for the grade you will hate this class. You get extra credit for going to class and lectures are most of the time interesting because he is entertaining.
8920,595097,2.0,3.0,Extremely boring.
8921,595097,4.5,1.0,"He is great and so nice!! The class is easy, yes, but you will learn some really interesting stuff that will give you a good basis in Physics or Chemistry without the hard problem sets and huge lecture halls. I definitely agree that Shiflet and his class are great."
8922,595097,5.0,1.0,"If you go to class you can easily get an A. If u miss 6 classes or less u get 25 extra points, if u miss 3 or less u get 40 extra points. Definitely take this class because its straightforward and u also learn some pretty interesting stuff. He's a nice teacher too!"
8923,595097,5.0,1.0,"He's made the class harder than I hear it used to be, but it's still easy. If you are mildly intelligent and get the attendance points, you should have no problem getting an A. The stuff you learn is also pretty interesting and Prof. Shiflet is a great guy. Take this class while he is still offering it."
8924,595097,5.0,1.0,"ditto.  he is a good teacher though, if you find the stuff interesting."
8925,595097,5.0,1.0,"This class is the biggest gut I've seen since the junior high school. He copies and pastes practice problems, in chronological order, onto the tests. There are 3 tests, no exam and you get to drop one. You get extra points for going to class (though I recommend not even going bc you don't need them)"
8926,1807527,1.0,4.0,Pretty bad for a high-level math professor. Doesn't really explain and it seems like half of his lecture is him trying to impress you with fancy theorems and then not telling you how to do them while saying &quot;just think about it&quot;. Doesn't give very good feedback and grades very hard.
8927,1807527,1.5,5.0,He always teaches harder subjects comparing to other TAs. very unhelpful. much more hw comparing to other classes. dont take him never
8928,1578155,5.0,2.0,First time teaching at UVA and a 300+ class. Clearly a great prof and smart guy but not used to teaching big classes yet. Lectures are really interesting and can be funny. Open book and note exams but still need to take good notes in class.
8929,1578155,3.5,2.0,"Beginning of the class seemed promising, but he is very unorganized. He is very nice and approachable and makes a point to connect with the class but doesn't necessarily present the material in the best manner."
8930,1578155,1.5,4.0,Doesn't really know how to teach.
8931,1963210,1.0,4.0,"He's not an awful professor but he doesn't really teach the material. He simply goes through the slides and breezes over everything as if it were simple, yet his exams are difficult and confusing.  He is obviously well versed in his professional career but he just doesn't teach this class well. "
8932,1963210,5.0,3.0,"I took Doyle for micro and absolutely loved the class. He is one of my favorite professors I have had at UVA and actually inspired me to want to major in econ! His lectures are very easy to follow and he is very accessible. He definitely wants you to learn. As long as you follow along with the lectures, do the readings, and study you will do well!"
8933,1963210,4.0,3.0,The midterms were ridiculously easy but the final was very difficult. Reading the textbook definitely helped a lot and the lectures were pretty engaging.
8934,1963210,3.0,3.0,"Professor Doyle was a good professor that tested a lot on the lectures that he gave in class. The readings in the textbook were not mandatory, but I chose to do them because they helped me go over the content that was said in class. The two exams that were given were not too difficult but the final was a lot harder."
8935,1963210,1.0,5.0,"Doyle is a difficult prof for Money and Banking. The average for the first exam was an 69%. To be fair, the class itself is very difficult. However, Carter Doyle a lot of times will gloss quickly over material and then test you on the smallest details. Don't take this class if you have a choice. Also, the textbook is super confusing."
8936,1963210,5.0,4.0,Great professor. Makes things simple. Took Macro and Micro with him and got an A
8937,1963210,5.0,3.0,Very glad I chose Professor Doyle.
8938,1963210,5.0,3.0,"Doyle is extremely friendly and approachable. Took Money and Banking with him, he is very well versed in the material as he was a fortune 500 banker in his previous life. Loves what he does and is approachable during office hours and after class. Encourages you to come to him if you're struggling. Tests aren't too bad either"
8939,1963210,4.0,4.0,"Overall great teacher who really cares about his students; especially if you get to know him too. Classes are very lecture heavy and reliant on tests. With this said, yes you can skip class if you want to forego clicker question points, but I don't recommend solely reading the book for educating yourself. Lastly 10/10 recommend the mirco studybook"
8940,1963210,4.0,2.0,He seems like a really great guy and teaches in a clear way. I wouldn't say his lectures are that important because you could just use his lecture slides to learn the material
8941,1963210,5.0,4.0,Doyle  is a great guy and if you get to know him he will gladly give you his time.  He is very caring and genuinely loves teaching and wants to help you in any way that he possibly can.
8942,1963210,4.0,4.0,"Nice guy, good teacher.  Tests are generally straightforward but some questions were just not well crafted, to be honest. Read the textbook as much as possible, it is close to the course."
8943,1963210,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Carter Doyle did a fantastic job teaching his macroeconomics class. I learned a lot and he was always very enthusiastic. Because he taught a pure economics course, his plentiful incorporation of real world data and practical examples was really helpful. I would certainly take a course by him again."
8944,1963210,4.5,3.0,"He's a pretty interesting guy and gives an overall good class.  He can be a bit boring at times, though I think this had to do with me taking the class at 9am (don't take economics classes that early in the morning).  Other than that, It was a pretty pleasant experience.  Incredibly nice guy"
8945,1963210,3.5,3.0,"Prof. Doyle gives good outside examples during his lectures, in fact every test has a take home portion which makes you apply what you learned in class to real world problems. The one problem is that when you get to the test, if you have not read the book the average student could not get an A on the test without reading through the book."
8946,1963210,4.5,4.0,"Really nice guy. He's very willing to help you or just talk if you go to office hours. He made economics interestingeasy to understand; and I had no prior knowledge. I enjoyed lectures; but if you can't make it, he posts the powerpoints he uses online. Tests are not overly difficult, but you must study for them. Read the book; go to discussion."
8947,1963210,3.5,3.0,"Professor Doyle was a pretty good lecturer and he put all of his powerpoint online which was really helpful, but there were clicker questions in class, so you still had to go.  He made us practice tests, but they didn't have any short answer, just multiple choice, which was annoying when most of the test was short answer."
8948,1258703,3.5,1.0,I am so glad I took this class. It was really interesting and Brad kept it light-hearted.  He does take a while to grade things and get them back to you.  Go to his office hours! He is always ready to help andor just chat with you about life. One of the best professors I've had while at UVA.
8949,1258703,2.5,3.0,"Brad is a very funny fellow and he tries to keep things light and interesting. You can't help but like him. However, the class I took with him was somewhat disorganized, and I got the feeling a lot of the stuff we did was impromptu. He takes a long time to grade things as well. But he is nice, approachable, and funny. "
8950,1258703,4.5,3.0,Best class I've ever taken. 
8951,1258703,4.5,3.0,Absolutely take this class!! One of my best so far at UVA. Although this course was not light on reading it was fun and it was worth it. 
8952,1258703,4.5,2.0,"Brad has been one of my favorite professors so far! Super enthusiastic, very witty, and genuinely interested in what everyone has to say! You will not regret taking a class with him, he's awesome!"
8953,1258703,5.0,3.0,Brad is the man. He is the best essay grader at UVA.
8954,1258703,3.0,3.0,"In my class of only 6 other students, he is amazing! I haven't had him in a lecture-style setting yet, but i feel he is a good teacher and a good person. he does have the best outfits and provides personal insight into the novels while also listening to the students opinions."
8955,1258703,1.0,5.0,Professor absolutely incomprehensible during lectures.  Rambles on in deep personal thought while students left behind.  Expectations of students change daily...sometimes hourly.  Condescension doesn't even begin to describe his interaction with students.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
8956,1258703,4.5,2.0,"This man is an amazing professor. He's highly knowledgeable about the subject, and he's very kind as well. I simply don't understand some of the other ratings here!"
8957,1258703,1.0,3.0,"VERY difficult to understand in lecture -- would express incomplete thoughts that trailed off into confusion for the students.  Did nothing to help my understanding of the works we read, and I'm a dedicated and interested reader."
8958,1258703,1.5,3.0,"This man's mumblings make his lectures practically incomprehensible. If you are able to follow what he says, he has interesting insights into the texts. 382 focused a lot more on history than I would have liked and there was a ton of reading with under 70% covered in class. His outfits are the best though, especially the red pants!"
8959,1258703,1.5,4.0,"Pretentious, obnoxious, condescending. Impossible to understand in lecture because he mumbles and his vocabulary is so overreaching that you haft to sift through all the fluff and fodder to understand what he's saying. Also, in a paper prompt he called it egotistical or foolhardy to want to pick your own paper topic. Avoid avoid avoid"
8960,1258703,1.5,5.0,"A majority of the class nicknamed him &quot;Mr. Mumbles.&quot; Enough said. Even when he does talk, it takes a dictionary and a translator to understand what information he's actually trying to relay."
8961,1258703,4.0,4.0,Tough but absolutely worth it. Knows his stuff and is always interested in hearing student opinions-just make sure you have one!
8962,1258703,5.0,3.0,"Took Romantic Lit from him last year when he was at Pomona. A fair amount of reading is expected, but papers and tests pretty minor. He's more of an Enlightenment scholar, but class was still well-taught. Really enjoys looking at original documents, we spent a lot of time in Special Collections, which was cool. Prepared every day to discuss reading"
8963,2839772,4.0,3.0,"We pretty much didn't learn any actual statistics. He's a nice person but not the best teacher (not native english). I would recommend this class for a relatively easy A/B. The homeworks use python alot and take some problem solving so they can be time consuming but you have a week to do them, they're 40% off the grade and a bunch of grades drop."
8964,1365215,4.0,4.0,"Arnold is a really nice guy; modern in itself is a very challenging class, and the tests are brutal with medians typically not rising above F's, but there's a huge curve at the end of the class so that just about everyone leaves with at least a C. Stay on top of the homework and you'll do fine."
8965,1365215,4.5,4.0,Arnold = awesome.
8966,1062111,1.5,1.0,Tao was a nice guy but seemed confused during lab. He is an easy grader but that doesn't mean you will do well on the final. He is terrible at responding to e-mails and I had to go to other TA's or friends to get the questions I had answered. He's also wishy-washy about getting reports back on time.
8967,1062111,2.0,3.0,"Tao does not help you with much, and I think he sometimes is confused himself. He doesn't help you when you ask him questions instead he wants you to figure everything out yourself. As a T.A. he offers no extra advice and I found going to other T.A.s more helpful then going to Tao.  Tao is not a bad guy, but as a T.A. he did not seem to be the best."
8968,505057,5.0,2.0,Professor Martin is very nice and she is always willing to help students.Do not pay attention to the bad ratings!
8969,505057,3.5,2.0,"I think she's great! She's very knowledgeable within the realm of writing, criticism, and discussion of books. I really, really enjoyed her class, &quot;Women-Made Monsters&quot;!"
8970,505057,1.0,3.0,She is really inconsistent with her grading and her lectures are so boring and pointless that you will be left staring out the window. She has nothing intelligent to bring to the class and anyone who thinks that she is a quality prof. is out of their mind. The one helpful thing I learned in her class is to pay attention to posture during presentati
8971,505057,4.5,3.0,Very helpful and understanding. Extremely knowledgable about her subject. Do not listen to other bad ratings about her. 'MEAN' has nothing to do with communication. The person is obviously confusing her with professor Gasman. Take her class!
8972,505057,1.0,3.0,"wow if stupidity were a drug, she would be dead from overdose, has no idea what she is talking about or what a mean is"
8973,505057,1.0,1.0,She is quite possibly THE most incompetent person i've ever had the misfortune of meeting in my entire life. She tells you to do one thing and then marks it wrong on a paper. I feel bad for all of you who will ever have the misfortune of coming in contact with this person.
8974,46307,5.0,3.0,Amazing prof! You will learn a lot through the feedback on your work. Prof. Sofka will help you develop your analytical skills and help you apply theories to our modern world. He is one of the best profs I ever had.
8975,46307,5.0,2.0,"Excellent instructor, extremely knowledgeable and very fair. Thought provoking and teaches the content extremely well.  Highest Recommendation."
8976,46307,4.5,4.0,Lots of work but i learned a lot.  One of my Favorite Prof's
8977,46307,5.0,1.0,"Great Prof.  Don't know if the rummors are true, but he will be missed!  I loved his class and wish more professor taught like him - Allan Lynch could learn a thing or two..."
8978,46307,3.0,3.0,"going, Going . . . GONE!"
8979,46307,4.5,2.0,"this guy is the best professor at UVA..SERIOUSLY...well, at least in politic department. he speaks so clearly and makes it feels like a conversation betweenn two people. just go to class and know how to analyse things and you'll be fine. really great teacher! i'll take him again whenever i can."
8980,46307,4.0,3.0,"His lectures are very clear and well laid out.  He actually gives you a chance to write everything down, which is nice.  If you attend lecture you will do well."
8981,46307,5.0,2.0,"VERY clear, concise, well-organized lectures. Two take-home exams + simple term paper. Syllabus is awkwardly organized--my TA gave us &quot;abridged&quot; reading assignments each week. Doing all readings is TOTALLY unnecessary, given no in-class exams or quizzes. Go to lecture everday!-Your grade will show."
8982,46307,4.5,3.0,"Loved him, loved his class. I definitely recommend anyone taking one of his classes, either towards a major or simply as an elective. You won't regret it--and you'll even learn something! He's extremely interested in the material and approachable. Big thumbs up!"
8983,46307,1.0,5.0,Too full of himself.
8984,46307,4.0,3.0,He's extremely intelligent and his lectures are interesting.  Love his bowties!! ;-)
8985,46307,4.5,3.0,"very knowledgable, great at conveying everything; lots of reading. His lectures are like an great closing argument"
8986,46307,4.5,3.0,He is quite literally the BEST thing to happen to U.Va. since T.J. himself. I've neer had better professor in my entire life...no lie.
8987,46307,5.0,4.0,Dis Dean is Da Bomb.
8988,46307,5.0,4.0,"Very helpful and fun.  Also, a great lecturer."
8989,46307,5.0,4.0,love him! he's an awesome professor. always helpful.
8990,46307,5.0,2.0,"yay for sofka! this is the second class i've taken with him, and he's awesome"
8991,46307,5.0,2.0,"awesome prof., take anything he teaches!"
8992,46311,5.0,2.0,Gotta love Louis. Had him for an engagement and hes about as good as they get
8993,46311,3.0,4.0,He doesn't teach physics in the same way that other physics professors do. Basically every class has a demonstration and he clearly seems very interested in the subject matter. The only issue is that the unconventional teaching method makes it hard to seek help from outside sources because even Physics majors can't really do the problems he gives.
8994,46311,5.0,1.0,"I think he was one of the best professors I had and he was my academic adviser as well. Wonderful person, the class is easy in a sense but requires adequate work. I liked the class a lot- cool demos and useful knowledge."
8995,46311,3.0,3.0,"I really didn't like the class, not because Lou wasn't nice, but because Physics really isn't my area of interest. I wanted an easy science course to fulfill a requirement, and it is ""easy"" in the sense that there is a big curve, but the professor isn't the best lecturer and questions in testsproblem sets are very confusing. But Lou is nice. "
8996,46311,5.0,4.0,"He was an amazing professor, probably one the best I had. His lectures were very interesting. He also made it very clear about what he expected.  The TA's were also very helpful to those who were taking the course as an elective."
8997,46311,4.5,1.0,"Bloomfield is incredible, interesting, and has such great memory - he learns every student's name! His experiments are awesome. He knows his stuff and I learned a lot of cool concepts. Exams are easy, just look at past exams! Read the easy book."
8998,46311,4.5,2.0,"Yeah, college takes work people! This class wasn't too bad though, one of my easier ones. Lou is an amazing professor & does his best to keep things interesting & to get to know everyone personally. I wouldn't recommend buying the physical copy of the book though; you don't use it all that much, and online is convenient & where the hw is anyways."
8999,46311,1.5,4.0,"I loved Physics in high school but had a much better teacher who made it more interesting.  If you can stay awake, you will do well.  Grades on exams don't mean much.  He skews the grades and you will never understand how he does it."
9000,46311,4.0,2.0,"Lou is funny, very approachable, and somehow knows the names of most people in his large lectures. Despite the rumors, this class is not easy, per se. It is simply conceptual as opposed to mathematical, though admittedly simplified. Tests are highly curved, but graded strangely (he account for guessers). Just go to lecture, he's the cutest."
9001,46311,4.0,4.0,"Lou is one of the best professors I've had. He's funny and very approachable. He takes the time to get to know all of his students, even in a big lecture. That said, this class IS NOT as easy as it's made out to be. It's not bad but remember that you really need to put effort into doing the work and you'll enjoy it and do well"
9002,46311,4.0,4.0,"LOVE LOU! Okay..the other comments specify that you are required to go to class..to pay attention..and to do the work..But last time I checked, we are in college and should be doing all of the above. Grades are NOT just handed to you..do you forget that this is a prestigious University&#63; Anyways I say TAKE THIS CLASS..merely because Lou is the best!"
9003,46311,3.5,4.0,"DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY THIS CLASS! I was told this was a very easy class but it is harder than it seems. You do need to attend lecture for clicker question points. The tests are difficult and require attendance in class, reading the textbook, and studying. Prof. Lou is a great guy but this class requires work. Beware!"
9004,46311,4.0,2.0,This class is wonderful!  He does lots of fun demonstrations and is always willing to help if something is confusing.  You can work with other people on the problem sets which is nice.  Study old tests to prepare for the tests.  It's the best way!
9005,46311,3.5,4.0,"STAY AWAY. Everyone talks about how easy &quot;How Things Work&quot; is and how it's an easy B, but many are fooled by his early lectures. As the weeks wear on, he gets more boring and most things blend together into a twister of confusion. Yeah, he's nice, but the tests are impossible, and he HATES athletes, so if you play a sport, prepare to be stereotyped"
9006,46311,4.0,3.0,"Nice guy, but highly overrated."
9007,46311,5.0,1.0,Soo nice.  I took his class 2 years ago and he still remembers my name.  He basically researched my final paper FOR me.  He is not only a great professor but truly a wonderful person.
9008,46311,5.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher, definitely not boring if you listen to him, and not hard if you listen to him. So: show up for class and pay attention and you'll have an amazing semester."
9009,46311,4.0,2.0,"goofy guy, good professor, takes extra effort to get to know his students"
9010,46311,4.0,2.0,"Amazing class!!!! I loved going to this class all semester-Professor Bloomfield clearly loves what he does and this class is so enjoyable!  Could be challenging if you'd never had physics before, but highly recommended!"
9011,46311,5.0,3.0,"Bloomfield is the most amazing professor ever!  If you can get into his class, I recommend that you take it.  I have absolutely no interest in science and had never taken a physics class before, but since it's all conceptual your previous experience doesn't matter.  He's the most helpful and funniest guy ever.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND How things Work!"
9012,46311,5.0,4.0,"Amazing teacher. Of all the classes I have ever taken, this has proven to be the most useful. Bloomfield is incredible and really makes an effort to help you and learn everyone's names. The class material itself is fascinating, and it is definitely the best class I have ever taken, and I have absolutely zero interest in science. TAKE THIS CLASS!"
9013,46311,3.5,2.0,AWESOME professor! He is really nice and passionate about physics. He makes class fun and his demonstrations are really helpful. Definitely a class for non physics majors.
9014,46311,5.0,2.0,Awesome prof.
9015,46311,4.5,3.0,"Took this class just to get my requirement out of the way, but he is an absolute gem. Makes the material fun and lively, and he is by far the most genuinely nice professor I have ever met. Do yourself a favor and take this class if you're a humanities major and don't care about science."
9016,46311,4.5,1.0,One of the nicest professors I've ever met. He learns everyone's name in a huge class (200+) and genuinely cares about how each of them does. No need to read the book and he puts the slides from lectures on the internet so no real need to go to class (but it's always entertaining when you attend).
9017,46311,5.0,2.0,"the class starts out really easy, the first half of the semester is a joke, but eventually weekly homework assignment can easily take more then 2 hours. The lectures are unbelievably boring because you're listening to code but he tries to make it fun with demotivator and jokes, some had trouble, but I found the class pretty easy but im in E school"
9018,46311,5.0,2.0,awesome class
9019,46311,5.0,2.0,"Imagine, if you will, a jolly middle aged professor walking his dachshund around the Rotunda. He passes you, and you wonder, this guy brings his dog to work&#63; Well, actually, he lives in Hereford. That's one of many cool facts about Bloomfield. Do the work, no reason to get below a B in this class."
9020,46311,5.0,2.0,"Best prof ever. And he is NOT boring. His demonstrations were great.  Also, he learned literally every person's name in a class of 502.  I'm serious."
9021,46311,4.0,2.0,"Nice guy, but incredibly boring.  Only take it if you need math/science credits"
9022,46311,5.0,2.0,"Ok, so undoubtedly one of the sweetest men you'll ever meet. He absolutely loves his job, and the University.  One day in class he said &quot;even if you guys understand physics, but you're homesick, come talk to me. I'm a dad, & my little girl just went to college this year, so i understand!&quot; SO CUTE!!"
9023,46311,5.0,2.0,"Amazing, amazing, amazing professor. One of the best professors I've ever had at the UVA, and that's quite a feat considering that I absolutely hate science courses. He made coming to class worthwhile with fun experiments and a really nice and funny personality. I would recommend him to anyone."
9024,46311,4.0,3.0,So I have no interest in physics but this class was made for people like me and prof. bloomfield is such an interesting person...plus you dont have to go cuz you can download the lecture and watch it at home...i mean how great is that&#63;
9025,46311,5.0,2.0,"One of the greatest teachers ever in my years in school.  If you have a chance to take this class, take it.  If you don't, do it anyway.  Bloomfield is an unblievable lecturer and he is a wonderful person to boot.  You may not have to go to class to make a good grade, but you will want to"
9026,46311,5.0,1.0,"Truely great professor, does experiments to show how each concept relates to everyday life. I recommend this class to anyone."
9027,46311,4.5,3.0,"yea man, this guy's awesome.  he actually tries to memorize EVERYONE's names in his huge lecture classes."
9028,46311,5.0,1.0,"I love this guy.  It's like if Bob Saget really knew alot about physics...  he'll help you as much as you could ever need.  He memorizes everyone's names by the third week and knows everyone!  Possibly the best professor on Grounds. The class is slack as crap, to boot."
9029,46311,5.0,2.0,"Such a sweet guy! Always makes you laugh and somehow makes physics fun (imagine that.) Conceptual, NO MATH. Very fair-- not difficult at all. Go to class, helpful and entertaining."
9030,46311,5.0,2.0,"Reall interesting (& frequent) demonstrations. No math involved: Everything is conceptual, which can make the subject matter difficult, but overall it is pretty easy and interesting. I highly recommend it."
9031,46311,5.0,1.0,"How things work is great. It's like watching Mr. Wizard or Bill Nye ever day in class. He reminds me exactly of Bob Saget. Anyway, the class is really interesting and easy."
9032,46311,5.0,1.0,So fun...everyone at UVA should take How Things Work
9033,46311,5.0,2.0,Great prof.  Don't even need to go to class but it does help.  TAs have a review session for the final.  Provided notes online when I was there.
9034,46311,5.0,1.0,"Bloomfield is the nicest professor ever, very enthusiastic about answering questions and clarifying material, I only attended a few classes and skimmed the text and got a B+  Take this class: Bloomfield is the greatest!"
9035,46311,3.5,3.0,"This is not as easy as everyone says, especially for those who have no background in physics. But he wrote the textbook, so you don't really need to go to class. Videos of all the lectures are posted online."
9036,46311,5.0,2.0,"proof that there's no such thing as an Easy A at this school. Maybe an Easy B+, i went to a total of 4 classes all semester, including testing classes, bloomfield is a beast though"
9037,46311,4.5,2.0,"Bloomfield is a beast.  Though the subject matter is not always the most interesting, you can tell he loves teaching. Having all the lectures available online is a plus."
9038,46311,5.0,2.0,He is an amazing professor. He's very enthusiastic and makes class very interesting and I hate science.
9039,46311,5.0,3.0,"I don't even like science, and Professor Bloomfield made it very interesting.  His attitude and enthusiasm made this class a pleasure.  I'd reccomend it to anyone."
9040,46311,3.5,2.0,"very easy, youll find yourself struggling to stay awake in class!"
9041,46311,2.0,3.0,No Comments
9042,46311,4.5,4.0,"Class isn't an easy A - however, Bloomfield is a good professor and is always available to help you out.  I'd recommend this class to anyone interested in concepts of physics, not math.  Don't take if you don't want to study, though."
9043,46311,2.5,4.0,"This class is supposed to be easy, and it would be if I could stay awake."
9044,46311,3.5,4.0,Not as easy as everyone says!  Boring--take a nap before you go to class.
9045,46311,5.0,2.0,No Comments
9046,46311,5.0,1.0,Extremely helpful and entertaining during class
9047,46311,5.0,1.0,"Perhaps the nicest, most helpful faculty members you'll ever meet!"
9048,1586411,5.0,3.0,"Professor Andrews cares about his students and their mental health. The timing of this course (Art and Insanity) went well with the state of things at the time (COVID-19/stress).The require readings were fascinating! Moreover, the final research paper and accompanying art project was a pleasurable task, even though both took many hours to complete."
9049,1586411,5.0,3.0,"Professor Andrews' class was amazing, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The coursework was fascinating and eye-opening, while the professor was incredibly well versed in the subject. In addition, I really appreciated how interactive the lessons were and would absolutely take another one of his classes. Very supportive and caring professor!"
9050,1586411,5.0,3.0,Professor Andrews is amazing! His knowledge of art is astounding. He pushes you to feel confident about your work and he always sees the best in his students. He cares about your work and he keeps you motivated and isnspired every week! He is a must take in any class that he offers!
9051,1586411,5.0,4.0,George is one of my favorite professors at UVA - I've tried to take as many of his classes as I can. He is passionate about art and his students; he always went above and beyond to make sure his students are learning and enjoying the class. I wish all my professors were as wonderful as George!
9052,1586411,5.0,4.0,Professor Andrews is gifted in the knowledge or art. He can teach you how to be an artist even when you do not think you have a artistic bone. His lectures are amazing so you learn a lot about the subject matter. He is a great teacher!
9053,1586411,5.0,3.0,Great class. You get more from the material than you expect because Professor Andrews is very knowledgeable. The book is okay but the films he assigns are great and very relevant to the topic. He's also great at bringing out everyone's artistic abilities regardless of skill level. Definitely take any of his courses.
9054,1586411,5.0,3.0,"Take this class if you want to challenge yourself artistically. Prof allows you to express your art ability w/out pre-judgment. Was reluctant  due to lack of creative abilities. Professor critiques were always supportive and encouraging; other students' artwork-inspiring! Required: weekly writing & image forum posting, and online video screenings."
9055,1586411,5.0,3.0,One of the most engaging professors that fosters an environment for self exploration and discovery. The freedom to explore and experiment is highly encouraged that creates a new outlook and approach to developing new perspectives and concepts. If you are willing to let go of self judgement and doubt you will learn a new way to express yourself.
9056,1586411,2.5,3.0,"I have zero artistic talent, but this class opened my eyes to a new perspective.  He is engaging and if you invest, he will open your mind and eyes up to a whole new world which will have you seeing the world differently.  He is very nice and encouraging.  He does not respond to emails and grades are not posted during the term."
9057,1586411,5.0,3.0,"You will be surprised about how you think about art.  You will begin to notice that your daily perspective changes.  Suddenly, you will begin to view the world as a gigantic art project.  Not many professors can do that."
9058,1586411,4.5,3.0,"The course was fantastic.  The films, artwork, and discussions clarified and reinforced the topics covered in the textbook.  Professor Andrews helped awaken my creativity and passion for art which had been neglected for years."
9059,1586411,5.0,1.0,Great class - allowed me to take up my hobby of photography that I haven't done in years.  Great class!
9060,1586411,5.0,4.0,Fascinating class; the dynamic is energetic.
9061,1586411,5.0,3.0,"Professor Andrews was great! The class allowed people, like me, that are uncomfortable with art to feel at home exploring how they choose. It was always interesting lectures and insightful topics. This is a great class that allows art lovers and non art lovers to discover a new side of life."
9062,1586411,4.0,2.0,Professor Andrews is excellent!  I took an art class of his and he was so supportive and open-minded. Never made you feel like your art was bad and was really open to suggestions in terms of if work load got to be too much.  I will def. take another class of his.
9063,1586411,5.0,3.0,I took this wonderful online class from him last semester at U.Va. and he assigned you tube or video links to view as well as submit feedback weekly to the forum and submit a weekly art project to the Media Gallery.  I never thought an art class could be this effective online but it was fantastic.  Goal=have fun!!
9064,1586411,4.0,1.0,"Prof allowed the class to explore artists we were interested in as well as some we had never heard of that were fascinating.The studio part was awesome.I truly have no artistic talent but that didn't matter. He just cares that you grasp the techniques and concepts, and also how to critique art in an objective manner."
9065,1586411,4.0,4.0,"We did use the book a little. He wasn't terribly hands-on with the drawing instruction and people really need visual examples of how to make images, but he really loves art and encouraged his students to love it too."
9066,2348273,5.0,3.0,Professor Basit is one of the kindest professors I've had at UVA. She is very open and accessible to talk outside of class and genuinely seems invested in her students' success in class. Definitely recommend taking her for CS2100.
9067,2348273,5.0,3.0,"one of the best cs profs by far :) really cares ab u as a student and will set up time to explain concepts so u can feel confident in the class. she will literally listen to u talk ab whatever thats just how nice she is. shes also super accommodating, if something comes up and u cant make a deadline shell grant extensions and try to boost ur grade"
9068,1365241,5.0,4.0,"Hirosky is not so good when teaching lower level classes, but for high level classes deep into the physics major, he is not to be missed. I had him for 5630 (computational physics 1) and had the time of my life. The workload is absurd, but somehow enjoyable. You'll have no idea of your grade until the end of the semester, because he returns nothing"
9069,1365241,2.0,4.0,"Doesn't really have passion for teaching and should probably pursue his career in a labotary, not a lecture hall. Tests are taken straight from the textbook but the lectures will help you minimally at best... without clickers there's really no point going."
9070,1365241,2.0,4.0,"Professor Hirosky is not an amazing professor. He goes pretty quickly in class and you barely have time to write anything down before he is on to the next topic. I essentially learned the material through the textbook. Tests can be tricky, but I tended to do fine just by using the textbook and the posted slides."
9071,1398013,1.0,5.0,"worst professor i have ever had. terrible notes, and terribly unhelpful. pretentious and if you don't understand something- good luck just ask somebody else in class."
9072,1398013,1.0,5.0,Horrible professor. Discourages questions in class. Lectures are hard to follow and always go over the hour. Homework and quizzes are graded down for small errors. He is impossible to reach outside of office hours so if you can't go to the scheduled ones you are on your own. So confusing made a moderate class miserable.
9073,1398013,1.0,4.0,Avoid this professor if you can. His lectures are unclear and very hard to follow. His lectures typically just further confused me rather than clarify the material. He does not follow the text book at all.
9074,1398013,1.0,5.0,"Very unhelpful. You don't need to go to class because it won't help, it will just confuse you more. He doesn't teach from the book so it is hopeless to follow along. I got by with the ta hours and online notees. Extremely disappointed in this class. Avoid this professor."
9075,1398013,2.0,4.0,Going to class made me more confused.  Thanks to the help session folks for explaining stuff to me.  This class was incredibly theoretical.
9076,390398,3.5,2.0,I went into this class with some sense of it being a history of tech class.  It wasn't exactly - more a fascinating look at the way humans have interacted with technology in the last 50 years (they're talking about changing this a bit though).  It's very interactive and I felt like I was much more engaged with the material than I typically am.
9077,390398,4.5,2.0,"Great class, excellent professor. Be prepared for a very holistic, social perspectives-based approach; it's not very factually based, especially in the second half. Balogh is super friendly and very helpful. He's always trying to get more student input, and attends many of the discussions."
9078,390398,4.5,2.0,"Great class, the material is interesting and Balogh is a great guy.  Not the most practical of classes but it was interesting."
9079,390398,5.0,1.0,This was the best class I have taken at UVa. Requires some participation in discussion but incredibly interesting. Balogh is legitimately interested in his students too. Take this class while at Uva.
9080,390398,2.5,1.0,"Very boring class. I wish I had chosen something more interesting for my final semester. Dull, dull, dull."
9081,390398,3.0,2.0,"I found this class to be rather useless.  Balogh is a nice enough guy, but as a history major, I learned absolutely nothing new. A big portion of your grade is based on a group project to build a website; just hope your assigned group has someone good with computers.  All in all, a really useless, VERY boring class."
9082,390398,5.0,2.0,"amazing lectures.. always enjoyed going to class.. let us choose the format of the final exam, very into his students and the material, def. take a class from him!"
9083,390398,5.0,2.0,Balough is wonderful.  The class is so much fun and interesting.  It was one of my favorite classes at UVA.
9084,390398,5.0,3.0,"Remarkable course; remarkable man.  These being _favorable_ remarks, mind you."

9087,390398,5.0,3.0,"great class with a great teacher - he really reaches out to students and tries to help.  Makes an effort to get to know students on a personal level.  Lectures are interesting.  lots of reading and outside work, but it is meaningful and productive"
9088,390398,5.0,2.0,"balogh is WONDERFUL.  his lectures can be a bit bland, but the man is a genious.  and, he's incredably devoted to his students.  I enjoyed office hours more than lecutre.  the material is GREAT.  all in all:  an easy but engaging class."
9089,390398,4.0,2.0,"Viewing America was definitely an interesting class- enjoyed how he approached the material from a media standpoint. The readings could get long, however."
9090,939261,5.0,2.0,I LOVE HALLIE. Protect this woman at all costs. I can tell that she genuinely cared about everyone in her class. She kept a running journal of all the things we told her so that she could get to know us better. Her class is rather easy. Honestly just write something and you will get an A. She gives good feedback and never too much homework.
9091,939261,2.5,1.0,"I was really interested in this class coming in, but unfortunately it ended up being a real drag. She doesn't have much to say about the material herself, the discussion is completely run by the students. It's easy enough, because she doesn't enforce that you do the reading, but that also made for a very boring class. Disappointing to say the least"
9092,939261,4.0,3.0,"Hallie is a very good teacher. I had her for ENLT. She was extremely fair, flexible on absences and had a great personality. I definately recommend taking a class from her."
9093,939261,4.0,2.0,"So basically ENWR is a BORING class, but if you didn't exempt it oh well, at least it's a GPA booster. Hallie is a fair greater, great personality, and as interesting as can be teaching the course matter. 4 5 page papers and some minor 1 page essays. Not bad at all. Give it some effort and you will get an A."
9094,1070339,5.0,2.0,"best TA I've ever had! explains things perfectly, very helpful in office hours. highly recommend!"
9095,1070339,2.5,4.0,Disagree with previous comments. Extremely inflexible and unhelpful. Don't take him!
9096,1070339,5.0,2.0,He has a way of making complex theories and readings incredibly simple which makes the class 100xs easier! Definetely take him as your TA!
9097,1070339,5.0,3.0,"Best TA I've had at UVa!! It's clear he really knows and likes the course material. Smart, engaging, and really flexible about being available for students. Very fair grader if you put in the work. If he's TA'ing your class, get him as your TA!!! You won't regret it!!"
9098,390404,4.0,3.0,I took the fear and anxiety seminar. Moderate amount of work weekly plus a group project and final paper. Grading is very clear and she is always available to help in office hours or by appt. I wouldn't hesitate to take the class if this is your first time taking a seminar.
9099,390404,5.0,2.0,Excellent Class and Teacher
9100,390404,3.5,2.0,"Abnormal psych - a good class. she definitely knew what she was talking about. tests weren't too difficult, tho doing the reading was important."
9101,824599,5.0,1.0,He was a great prof for EGMT1520. Take his class. Easy A. No tests or quizzes. Reading material are comics he draws himself. Content is very interesting and intuitive.
9102,824599,5.0,2.0,i took the engagement course &quot;why we hold hands&quot; and it was really interesting. there were no tests and professor coan is truly a great guy. highly recommend.
9103,824599,5.0,4.0,"Jim Coan is an incredible lecturer. Very engaging and tells awesome stories. He is very careful to lay all the facts on the table and not show you his bias towards/against certain ""pop psychology"" topics. If you have a good memory and really listen during his class, you will be fine. I did not find his tests contradictory at all. Take notes after."
9104,824599,2.5,3.0,"Professor Coan is awesome, bu his tests are hard. Some of his lectures are outdated and disagree with the textbook, which is annoying. He does not reply to emails (he'll tell you the first class) so beware. The final was 2/3 material from the last 4th of class and only 1/3 cumulative, which was nice because we had just learned it."
9105,824599,1.0,5.0,"I swear to god all he wants to do is trick you. He threw so many random pop quizzes at us and knows a lot but even the exam was a trick... he was good at explaining things after the fact, though. And he kept it interesting and fun.  This review was based on his national geographic tv episode... so many tricks man."
9106,824599,3.5,4.0,"Best lecturer at UVa. The down side? His tests are brutal and he seems proud of that fact. However I would recommend him if only for his humor and how entertaining lecture was. Be warned, he's not very available for help outside of class. Also, you read the whole text book and the last test is comprehensive."
9107,824599,4.5,3.0,"I didn't like him at all at first- his policy is to not read emails from students- but during the semester, he and the subject really grew on me.  The lectures got interesting and he's actually pretty funny at times.  It's absolutely necessary to read the book- his test questions are very nit picky."
9108,824599,4.5,2.0,Best professor in UVa!
9109,824599,3.5,2.0,Funny guy with really interesting stories - but really hard to take any notes because he rushes through slides. Good luck ever trying to get in touch with him- no office hours and at times won't show up to appointments with students.
9110,824599,1.5,4.0,"The WORST professor I've had at UVA. Sure, he's funny and nice, but the text and his lectures are amazingly contradictory. It's a hard class not because of the material, but from test questions that are vague, picky, and some we NEVER discussed in class. He relies HEAVILY on his powerpoint slides and constantly walks into class late.  Horrible."
9111,824599,5.0,1.0,Great Prof. Loved the topic and how he taught it. MC tests and final. Awesome class-my favorite!!!!!!!
9112,824599,5.0,2.0,"GREAT class- highly recommend it with Coan. Nice, smart, funny guy! Lectures are interesting. Definitely read the book if you want to do well!"
9113,824599,3.0,4.0,Coan is absolutely amazing!  He is so knowledgeable and is a wonderful lecturer!  Best Prof at UVA so far!!  READ THE ENTIRE TEXT if you want an A!  Tests can be tricky.. all the info is in the book!
9114,824599,4.0,2.0,"Really good class. Coan has a funny sense of humor and his lectures are well-organized and there's usually something pretty funny in them. He's very down to earth, really good class."
9115,824599,5.0,2.0,"Amazing!!! Best Prof I've had at UVA!!!! makes abnormal psych simple and interesting. some test question are tricky -- you must do the readings, but he has great lectures. time in class flies by!!"
9116,824599,4.0,2.0,This was an awesome class. The lectures are really good.  Coan is a really nice guy.  The reading pretty much sucks and you have to do it.  But I highly recommend the course.
9117,824599,5.0,2.0,"Very clear, nice guy in a high spirits all the time. Can't help but like him. 3 MC tests (drop 1) and an MC final. Great lectures, puts slides online just in case. Recommend doing the reading if you want an A (the text is a little dull, but manageable) - overall, a highly recommended class for psychiese esp."
9118,2258201,5.0,4.0,"Daniel Quinn was a great professor. For fluid mechanics, be prepared for the course to be front loaded, as in you'll have more homework the first few weeks before it tapers. It's also largely due to the learning curve of completing his assignments. The first exam will teach you how todo the rest. The final, said to be cumulative, was mostlylast ch."
9119,2258201,5.0,4.0,"Dan is an awesome dude! He's really excited about what he's teaching, which will make's fluid mechanics all the better. Homeworks are fair, and he's not opposed to helping you with them if you get a little stuck. The tests are also fair, but be prepared to study a fair amount."
9120,2258201,5.0,3.0,He is so good at teaching. I became interested in Fluid Mechanics due to so many interesting facts. He teaches enthusiastically and passionately which makes you engrossed to the subject. He is very well-behaved and respectful. Not hard to get a good grade. HWs are very educating rather than just challenging.
9121,2258201,4.0,5.0,"Course material is hardcore math by nature, but Dan does a great job making the problems and examples interesting and inspiring. Incredibly available outside of class and puts students first. Helpful balance of computer visuals/videos and old-school chalk boarding."
9122,2258201,5.0,4.0,"Lectures are well prepared and cover the essentials of fluid mechanics. Homeworks are based on lectures, but also ask you to be creative and do some research on your own. Overall, this is a worthwhile class and I highly recommend it."
9123,2258201,5.0,4.0,The class was very well-structured and Professor Quinn did a wonderful job of explaining the material in a clear manner.  The homework really helped nail down the main concepts used throughout the course and was challenging and engaging. He is also accessible out of standard hours. I got way more out of the course than I expected to.
9124,2258201,5.0,2.0,"This is a class you don't want to miss, especially if Dan is around. Great well-rounded course."
9125,2258201,4.0,5.0,"As a introductory fluid course in graduate school, Dan gave a very broad picture to student like me who does not have much fluid background and did a good job about it. He is very keen in teaching and deliver the course structure in a very smooth manner so that every one can understand it."
9126,2258201,5.0,4.0,"The class lectures were well structured overall and were easy to follow. Though there were some gaps in the connecting some of the material, further discussions with the professor helped filled those gaps. The homeworks were completely manageable and forced you to think outside of the basics that  you learned in class."
9127,2258201,5.0,4.0,"Best graduate professor in Mechanical/Aerospace engineering. Should to be nominated for a teacher award for this class. Clear lectures, accessible outside of class, gives homework that teaches you important concepts and challenges you, prepares you not just with the theory but also the tools (Mathematica) to apply new concepts in your research."
9128,2258201,5.0,4.0,Dan is a very nice professor who has a lot of passion in what he is doing. I think this is a very early stage in his career in terms of teaching but he did a good job.
9129,1643806,5.0,2.0,Alexy was an amazing professor. She made an effort to keep the energy up in a large class as well as remember the names of all the students. She was extremely helpful if you were confused and she made an introductory level class flexible enough to challenge those that had a natural ability for the topic.
9130,1643806,4.5,1.0,"Awesome person, and she is super funny. Her grading is fair too, and it's really not that hard. 3 Major essays and weekly response paper to a topic. its not that hard to do!"
9131,1643806,5.0,4.0,"Allison Alexy is an amazing professor. I came into the course with essentially no interest in the material, but I'm ending this semester without a doubt in my mind that her course was one of the best I've taken at UVa. She's awesome, funny and an great resource. I've recommended her course to several friends already because I've learned a lot."
9132,1897759,5.0,2.0,"Kyle was so helpful. Very knowledgeable, clear, and offered lots of extra credit. He was willing to meet with students for lunch during the week and was just overall overflowing with enthusiasm for the subject matter. If you're taking this class try to get Kyle as your TA. You'll learn a lot."
9133,1766689,4.0,4.0,"It looks like my rating got deleted. I was just checking up on his ratings after a conversation I had with him. I just didn't give him the credit he deserved in my last rating. He's honestly a great professor. Keep in mind he's trying to provide clarity on material that requires years of studying and research, but with only a few hours a week."
9134,1766689,1.0,4.0,"Really aggressive in class. Takes a long time to mark assignments. The assignments are also written very badly, never clear what he expects from you. Avoid him"
9135,1766689,2.0,4.0,"I know many people who have dropped/withdrawn from this class. I should have caught on. Lecture slides are typically just pictures/questions so you take notes from his speaking without much visual aid. With some lecturers, this is easy, not here. Reading is v necessary and there is a lot of it. You have to buy a tremendous amount of books."
9136,1766689,5.0,4.0,"Knowledgeable, approachable, and committed to helping his students learn. Thinks seriously about civil wars and will encourage and help you to do the same. Accessible and helpful outside class. Seminar helps highlight the most important elements of the heavy reading. Take his class if you really want to read and learn a lot about civil wars."
9137,1766689,2.0,4.0,Nasty personality and cares more about theory than history or empirical information.  Confrontational and aggressive speaking style and rather dull.  Not recommended.
9138,1766689,1.5,5.0,Reading is near impossible to keep up with. Lectures are not terribly interesting. 
9139,1766689,1.0,5.0,"Schulhofer-Wohl is a poor lecturer who assigns an unbelievable amount of reading. If you're interested in learning about the middle east, take a course with another professor."
9140,1766689,1.5,5.0,I do not recommend this professor.  He assigns so much reading it is impossible to complete it all.  His lectures are so vague as to provide little framework for understanding all of the reading.  Provides very little instruction as to what he expects for the papers.
9141,1766689,5.0,2.0,"Young professor teaching the class on the Middle East. He's sometimes too lenient towards students who make noise in class, but he's an extremely organized and knowledgeable teacher, especially on civil wars. Kind and approachable, will help you whenever he can. Always do your readings and, very important, follow closely the news: it will pay off."
9142,1766689,3.5,3.0,"Professor Schulhofer-Wohl is replacing Professor Quandt. He is just as knowledgeable, except he lacks Quandt's massive real life experience and his ability to captivate his audiences. Don't be frightened by his name, he speaks English fluently. His Middle East classes require significant reading and attendance, but it will pay off."
9143,1766689,2.5,4.0,The words that come to mind are a boring academic. He clearly knows his stuff but his lectures aren't very interesting. You learn a lot about theory but not so much actual history which is hard for tests. Take it if you're interested in the middle east but not just to fulfill a requirement.
9144,554276,3.0,4.0,"She was ok.  She had a tendency to lecture too much and she seemed to have right answers in mind when she called on people, meaning if you didn't have her answer, she'd tell you you were wrong.  She would sometimes give a quiz on the reading when a four page paper would beb due, which I thought was mean."
9145,554276,5.0,3.0,She was the sub for my class for 2 days but I loved her and wish she had been my teacher all semester!  She seems excellent!!
9146,554276,5.0,4.0,Ms. Herman was the best foreign language teacher ever!  She definately rocks!  Take any class with her if you can!
9147,513322,4.0,3.0,"Very few grades, so everything counts a lot. It's basically two classes in one- Mayan culture and Intro to Linguistics. She's interesting and entertaining, but sometimes the material is dry. Sections (with TA) are interesting though. Test questions can be unclear, although she say's they're in the reading, but I'm not sure about that. Eh it's ok :/"
9148,513322,4.5,4.0,"I had 2 classes with Prof. Danziger and they were informative, well structured with moderate amount of reading material. Always available to students with questions and has reasonable expectations. UPenn educated, she caters to those who want to learn. If u think its unfair to be graded on attendence or her lectures r boring-UVA is not for u then."
9149,513322,5.0,4.0,"Professor Danziger is a brilliant individual who changed my life. If you're not interested in the challenge of learning, though, she probably won't be for you. If you want to think more deeply about the nature of mind, language, and humanity, you should definitely take a class with her."
9150,513322,3.0,3.0,"I would only recommend this class if you have a genuine interest in linguistics.  I liked the class overall and Professor Danzinger seemed involved and interested in her field, though some of the test questions were unclear.  The research project was pretty fun, though, even if it too was a bit unclear."
9151,513322,2.0,3.0,"Lectures were vague about what was important; didn't go into enough detail. Tests are multiple choice w/ some short answer. Final was easy. Majority of grade depends on HWs, which were tedious to do and often had unclear instructions. TA was great and more helpful than the class. Would not take a class taught by her again."
9152,513322,4.0,4.0,Prof. Danziger is one of the most brilliant individuals I've ever come across in my life.
9153,513322,2.0,3.0,"She's pretty much just boring. She's midly excited about her topic, which is helpful, but the excitement is far from infectious. If I attempted to explain anything I learned in her class, I don't think I could do it. Also, I saw her at an Anth conference sleeping in the front row. Real cool."
9154,513322,2.0,2.0,"So boring.  I hated going to class, which was unfortunate, as she graded on attendance."
9155,513322,5.0,4.0,"Best teacher ever!  Asks subtle but brilliant questions that lead you to new insights.  If you like to be challenged to think in new ways, don't pass up the opportunity to take a course from Danziger!"
9156,513322,3.0,3.0,The class isn't too hard. Not a lot of work. The grading is unclear so it's difficult to see how you can improve. The TA didn't seem to know much. Dr. Danzinger seems to control all aspects of the class.  Interesting. Somewhat slow paced.
9157,513322,3.5,2.0,"not too hard, but kind of boring - only three exams and a project - not the clearest grader on tests but that may be the TA's fault"
9158,2086195,4.0,3.0,"Daniel Franz is the best lecturer I've had for any math class. He is funny, very nice, and pretty good at not only telling you what you need to know for the class, but also teaching it to you. His expectations are not ridiculous, but he gives a pretty decent amount of homework."
9159,480565,4.5,2.0,"She is so kind.  She makes little jokes in class and genuinely wants you to succeed.  Grades very generously, even made our final exam optional. Weekly homework from the textbook which isn't too difficult, weekly quiz in discussion which is made up of problems directly from the homework, 3 exams, and a final. She speaks quietly so sit in the front!"
9160,480565,5.0,3.0,Dr. Lasiecka along with Dr. Wang were two of my best proffessors at UVA ever. Not only they were great but as human beings they are angels sent from heaven. I loved both of them dearly. If you ever have to take MATH 331 or MATH 354 take them with one of them. I promise you that you will do good.
9161,480565,4.0,1.0,"She's so lovely. Be warned, she does speak softly. But she makes up for that with her clarity. She does a lot of hw problems for you during the course. This is a very clear, easy math course. I just took care to study a little and I got a 499/500 for both midterms combined. Really nice class."
9162,480565,5.0,1.0,She cares what you learnt in this class. And she makes abstract thoerems extremely clear.
9163,480565,4.5,4.0,"She is a really nice professor. Her lectures are very clear and helpful, which is of great importance for a course like MATH331."
9164,480565,4.0,4.0,"Yes, she speaks softly but she is a great teacher. if you have to take MATH 331, definitely take it with her. I took it with someone else first and dropped it because it was impossible, but after taking it with Lasiecka I expect to get an A. she genuinely cares and wants you to do well, unlike a lot of teachers in the department."
9165,480565,1.0,5.0,Her lectures are unclear and boring. Don't take her for MATH 331.
9166,480565,5.0,3.0,her accent is pretty easy to get use to and understand. she's very patient and helpful.
9167,480565,4.0,2.0,"she does speak softly and has some accent, but she is a very nice lady who wants students to do well in her class.going to her office hours is very helpful. her grading is relatively easy.she teaches via expamples (LOVED IT!).if u review notes and the examples she gives, u will do well in the class."
9168,480565,2.5,4.0,I could not understand her all semester. She is very quiet and has an accent. Easy grading criteria on tests though. She is also helpful if you go to her office hours.
9169,480565,4.0,3.0,"she's real cool.  you'll appreciate her lingo as she goes through the examples.  however, she is fairly soft spoken, and has a heavy accent. diff eq requires endless hours of homework no matter who you have..."
9170,480565,2.5,4.0,"Very hard to understand, ONLY teaches with examples and doesn't explain what she is actually doing.  Unless you read material beforehand, it will take the entire class to simply figure out what your trying to solve, let alone why."
9171,480565,4.0,1.0,excellent teacher because she teaches via examples. if you understand the homework you will do well in the class.  the tuesday hour is essential so do attend
9172,480565,3.5,2.0,"She is a helpful teacher if you can hear her.  She speaks softly and moves quickly. If you take good notes on what she writes on the board, you'll be set for homeworks and tests."
9173,480565,4.0,3.0,"She explains things really well if you can get used to her accent. From what I hear, she's better than the other diff-eq teachers out there."
9174,1209656,5.0,3.0,"A gem of the Spanish Department. Gillian Price is a phenomenal lecturer, and deeply cares about how much her students get out of each class. She's fantastic at stimulating conversation as well. I have never regretted coming to class because the quality of the material was so good. If you get the chance to take a class with her, you should!"
9175,1209656,5.0,3.0,"Gillian is kind of goofy but really nice. She isn't a native speaker but her Spanish is beautiful--very clear and well-accented. She can be a tough grader, but she's not that bad. If you put time and thought into your translations you'll get A to B range easily. She picks diverse and interesting texts that make all the theory worth it."
9176,1209656,2.5,5.0,"Seriously, very nit picky and has predetermined since the first day if you are a bad or a good writer. Dont take this class. ITS BAD!"
9177,480570,5.0,2.0,"Pease grades primarily on punctuality to practices and game rehearsals, so you must be on time, and if something comes up, you must let him or one of the assistant directors know ahead of time. Rehearsal is every Tu &amp; Th with Fr rehearsals and Wed drumline sectionals during game weeks. You are expected to learn music quickly, esp. in drumline."
9178,480570,4.5,3.0,"He has helped to create a fantastic band experience. In 10 years, we've gone from the ground level to the top of the ACC. Dr. Pease has dedicated himself to the band, and making it great, and he has plainly succeeded. He is a motivator, and knows how to get the best quality performance in a short time. There's a reason they put his name on a plaque"
9179,480570,5.0,1.0,"Pease is an outstanding person and is an incredible teacher. His passion for music truly shows when he is conducting. He rarely shows signs of discouragement and he is always the first to acknowledge our hard work. Marchingband has been an awesome experience and is a MUST for anyone who can play (instrument), spin (guard) or twirl (baton)"
9180,480570,4.5,3.0,We had a great semester. Tough music and improved a great deal over the semester.
9181,480570,5.0,4.0,Pease has done so much for me during my time here at UVA.
9182,480570,5.0,4.0,He has taken this band from nothing to one of the best in the ACC. It is sad that anyone would say any negative about Pease. The entire school is better because he is our band director. We have the best retention rate of any college marching band in the state. He is the best.
9183,480570,5.0,4.0,Band has improved every year
9184,480570,1.5,3.0,"Bill Pease is a politician, NOT a band director! Pease always ignored the music majors in the marching band....no wonder they have all decided to disappear! I agree with previous posters-the most insincere director I have ever played under. Was hoping for a wonderful marching band experience...but didn't find it at UVa."
9185,480570,2.0,1.0,"The problem is that this is a non majors program, but he schedules rehearsal in the middle of the day as if our lives revolve around band.  When we complain about schedule conflicts, he just shrugs, but then he whines about how we only 25 people present.  Sure, 7PM rehearsal would suck, but at least people can come.  Impractically stubborn."
9186,480570,2.0,3.0,"Knows his music well, no doubt.  Problem is he doesn't really have a grasp on running an organization like a well oiled machine.  Questionable decisions.  Since day one, one of my least enjoyable band experiences.  He's making the band go somewhere, but not to the heights it could."
9187,480570,4.0,1.0,"Mr. Pease is pretty cool.  He's usually in a really good mood and you can tell he loves conducting for wind ensemble, because he frequently mentions how we're his favorite."
9188,480570,2.0,1.0,"Despite its great start the band has degraded severely. Completely unorganized and devoted to smoozing with benefactors. Director has unreasonable expectations and is not open to suggestions. Frequent major logistical problems with no improvement. Director is rash, quick to anger and insincere, often inappropriate with students."
9189,480570,2.5,1.0,"I have never been in an ensemble with a more insincere director. Mr. Pease goes out of his way to help the band, but at the expense of honesty and integrity. He has no grasp of organization, and makes obscene comments to students. His favorites are treated better than the rest of us. Makes unreasonable demands through proxies so as to not seem evil"
9190,480570,5.0,2.0,"This was the second year I've done Marching Band and I can't imagine NOT doing it again next year. Pease is an amazing conductor, and truly is a friend to all of his students, and really does care for everyone. He's so nice and pushes each of us to our best without making it seem hard. I'll definitely take another class with him. Pease is amazing."
9191,480570,3.0,1.0,"I think Pease is a competent director but nothing more than that. The music is challenging which I appreciate but the music is NOT fun to play and he favors his marching band kids. You never quite know what he's thinking and does most of his bidding through Mr. Koch. His conducting style isn't that great either, no wonder so many guest conductors."
9192,480570,2.0,1.0,"*was* a nice guy. Currently kind of shifty - mumbles a lot, never know what he's really thinking. Don't like the way he runs the wind ensemble: blatantly plays favorites, brings a load of guest conductors and once a soloist that took up half our concert (isn't the concert supposed to feature us&#63;), and picks awful music."
9193,480570,3.0,1.0,awesome marching band directer. a little on the anal side but thats why we have come so far in 2 years. Marching band is incredibly fun and you get a lot of free stuff!!!
9194,480570,5.0,1.0,sooo nice! he's a really cool guy and really cares about his students.
9195,480570,3.0,1.0,"Most frustratingly insincere ensemble director I have ever played under. makes promises he can't keep. devotes half of our concert time to guest artists not associated with us.  He does not appreciate many of his best players, instead focusing on a few favorites (generally those in marching band).  Doesn't choose music students enjoy playing."
9196,480570,5.0,1.0,"Exactly what one would expect from a good marching band director - no more, no less, appropriately militant and conservative.  Don't take marching band if you have objections to the color guard twirling fake guns as props.  You'll be scoffed at."
9197,480570,5.0,1.0,Excellent!  Give it a few years and everyone will be talking about the Cavalier Marching Band thanks to William Pease.  Most people already are.
9198,480570,5.0,1.0,"Pease was awesome.  I can't imagine NOT doing Marching Band after this past year.  He's willing to push every musician to his or her highest without ever really making you feel like you're doing work.  He makes you ENJOY music, he makes it fun, and would do anything he can to fix problems in the band and make things &quot;perfect.&quot;  I love Pease."
9199,480570,4.5,4.0,"He is a very nice, calm, sedate guy most of the time. Even when under tremendous pressure, he maintains his composure: You know when he is not happy with you, but is a really good professor"
9200,480570,4.0,1.0,Great guy.
9201,480570,5.0,1.0,"Marching Band--best band director I've EVER had in my LIFE.  Awesome man--lovable, kind, and hard-working.  This world would be a better place with more Mr. Peases."
9202,480570,5.0,3.0,"Pease is the best professor ever, you'll love him!"
9203,480570,5.0,1.0,"I cannot say enough about Pease.  He's hard-working, devoted, and passionate about building a solid band program while helping the individual players strive for high goals.  He's all I can envision a director to be."
9204,480570,3.0,2.0,"He'll go out of his way for the entire group, and doesn't hesitate to try and fix anything and everything.  Very flexible as well.  However - never gets on the band's case - which lets us avoid blame for things that are definately our fault.  Sometimes gets confused about music/drill."
9205,480570,4.5,1.0,"Best band director I've had.  He is funny, and makes band fun.  Ocationally, he will get in a bad mood and yell at the leadership, but its only when we deserve it. He's a really nice guy, both inside and out of band."
9206,480570,4.5,1.0,Cool guy. Tries his best to make things good for students.
9207,898380,4.5,2.0,"Such a great professor. Supplemented the overwhelmingly white textbook with works from varied African authors. If you want to study French, you have to look beyond Paris! If you want grammar or structural help on your papers, he's really helpful at office hours. Final exam covers the entire course, so good notes are key."
9208,898380,4.5,1.0,"Drame has mastered the rare art of lecturing without too much pointless class discussion!! A true expert on african film. Films usually have english subtitles.  His accent is very easy to listen to. A stickler for grammar, though, watch out! Believes in not giving the students too much work :) Watch movies, do almost no work. Learn much!"
9209,2086225,3.5,5.0,"AVOID this class at all costs. A horribly tough grader. Little to no helpful feedback. While I was getting As on all my papers in other classes, I was pulling straight Cs. Super boring and redundant lectures. Treats you like you are in high school. Thinks she's funny but she isn't. Condescending and rude. A lot of busy work. "
9210,1160542,4.0,1.0,"I don't know where these previous comments are coming from , but Professor Wellmon is a great professor. Yes, he is a little unorganized, but that only benefits the student by allowing for extensions on assignments. This course was very straight forward do the exercises and  weekly informal responses and  your guaranteed an A. Attendance is a must!"
9211,1160542,1.0,3.0,He is all over the place and not very organized. He does not know how to present the information in an effective way and is very confusing. I do not recommend taking a class with him.
9212,1160542,2.5,4.0,He's really nice as a person..
9213,1160542,1.0,1.0,"Chad Wellmon's teaching is a joke. He is a mess as a professor.  I'm biased, because I don't get along with him personally.  But even objectively, I think he's a poor teacher, who takes more interest in his own projects than in spending time with his students. Watch out -- he gets angry easily, and over minor issues."
9214,1160542,5.0,2.0,"Chad is a great, sharp professor that knows his material and presents it well. I'd definitely recommend taking a course with him if you're in the German department!"
9215,972147,3.0,2.0,"Super cool person but her class is boring, can't really place why but it's just not as engaging as you would expect for a class about &quot;Trauma, Accountability, Healing.&quot; The readings were the most interesting part of this class but it's kind of lot (luckily you can get away without reading all of it super thoroughly)."
9216,972147,4.0,1.0,"Laughon is pretty cool but her class &quot;Gender Violence and Culture&quot; was one of the most depressing and boring things I've ever experienced. Attendance is a huge part of your grade. Spare yourself, don't take this class."
9217,972147,5.0,1.0,"Kathryn is great! Her USEM &quot;Gender, Violence, and Culture&quot; is a great class and a pretty easy A. Took this my first semester and loved it."
9218,972147,1.5,4.0,"Bored out of my mind. This is a general consensus. She's very smart, but it's presented in a poor fashion."
9219,972147,5.0,5.0,Just fabulous
9220,1856883,4.5,3.0,Great professor.  Class is lots of work.  Got a slightly worse grade than I expected. Would recommend. 8.5/10  MBTI: ISTp
9221,1619321,5.0,2.0,Great professor in all aspects. He made the class wonderful and everyone in it had a good time because of him. Easy to approach and talk to. He is a great teacher and man. UVa will miss him.
9222,1619321,5.0,2.0,Very fun and entertaining class. As long as you do your readings and participate in discussion you will learn a lot =)
9223,1619321,5.0,2.0,"Very nice and engaging teacher.  Readings are generally manageable, and always interesting. Good at fostering class discussion."
9224,1619321,5.0,2.0,He's a really knowledgeable and nice guy. The readings are interesting and not too long. I strongly recommend his class!!
9225,2389379,5.0,4.0,This was actually at Hobart and William Smith Colleges but I couldnt switch the location!! Prof Abdi is very very nice and her class was definitely worth taking. There were quizzes nearly every class but it was used to really make you remember the material. Homework was not time-consuming at all.
9226,1799567,5.0,4.0,Shiqiao is incredibly intellectual and gives useful feedbacks.
9227,1799567,4.0,3.0,Professor Li is a great guy and amazing intellectual. It hard to find an architecture professor that is so invested in deeper intellectual debate. I personal think that this engagement makes the architectural process much more meaningful. He also doesnt forget the importance the actual architecture. Highly advised.
9228,1799567,4.5,4.0,Great Professor who knows the field and wants you to succeed.
9229,783760,1.0,5.0,"You will have no idea how you did on the homework going into the exams, which is the only thing he gives you or tells you to study off. The expectation is to fail and he will curve everyone up. The class average last year was a 61 from what I understand and even lower this year."
9230,783760,5.0,3.0,"Santugini is awesome. Very personal teacher and makes every student feel welcome. Walks up and down the lecture hall before class talking to every student. There is no textbook and everything is based on lectures so I highly recommend you go. Test heavy class. Mid terms aren't too bad, but the final is harder so prepare for it. Overall great class."
9231,783760,2.0,4.0,"Prof Santugini is nice , but don't take his class for this reason. If you're not super quick with calculus and a fast-paced learner, don't do ECON 3010 with him. Told me this class has to be one of your priorities or it won't go well. Goes super fast and gives no theoretical background, only numbers and graphs. Made me not want to be an econ major"
9232,783760,4.0,3.0,Professor Santguini stands about because he actually cares about his students and he wants his students to do well (unlike many of ECON professors at UVa who couldn't care less). You have to show up to lectures and he goes over material quickly. He is passionate about ECON and it made me interested in the content as well. Test heavy
9233,783760,2.0,5.0,"Professor Santugini is a really great guy. That being said, his course is a mess. There is no textbook, so if you fall behind in the lectures, good luck trying to catch up. The course material is almost entirely math-based and I feel like I barely learned any economic concepts whatsoever. On top of that, my TA couldn't have been less helpful."
9234,783760,5.0,3.0,"Professor Santugini is awesome. He is super approachable, and his lectures go by fast. You can get as many &quot;TA points&quot; as possible so definitely do all of the HW because when you go past 25 it is extra credit. The first two tests are 1/2 take home, 1/2 in class, and they are easy if you pay attention. The final is hard, but the class is very fair."
9235,783760,5.0,2.0,"Santugini understands the concepts of rigor and truly treats economics as a science -- a fun, exciting science. Classwork is beautifully objective and if you try you will do great. Take a course with Santugini!!!"
9236,783760,5.0,4.0,"Santugini is always available and his class is one of the most informative I've ever taken. If you aren't doing well in the class, reach out to him. He will do his uttermost to make sure the students who are trying to succeed will succeed."
9237,783760,5.0,4.0,Santugini Is an amazing professor and his excitement about econ is contagious. He is willing to do whatever it takes to help his students succeed.
9238,783760,5.0,3.0,"Prof Santugini is easily one of my top three Econ professors at UVA. His lectures are fun to come to and he's very approachable outside of class. If you go to his office hours, he helps a lot with some of the math, which is helpful when you haven't taken a calculus class since first year. I would highly recommend taking at least one class with him!"
9239,783760,4.0,2.0,"Pretty good lectures, good guy"
9240,783760,4.0,4.0,Test heavy
9241,783760,5.0,3.0,"Professor Santugini is such a gem. You definitely need to attend his lectures, but this isn't a negative thing. If anything, its good to know that the professor is doing the actual teaching, not the textbook (which is totally optional). He's energized in class and is so passionate about Econ. Always available outside of class!! One of UVA's best."
9242,783760,4.0,3.0,"COME TO THE LECTURE. The class and tests are heavily based on graphs and numbers so if you find yourself a person who runs away from both, then I advise to take the class with another professor. Professor Santugini keeps several office hours and makes himself very available to all students. His TAs are also very helpful and nice"
9243,783760,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely love Santugini!!! His teaching is interesting and if you attend all lectures then you will not fail. His tests are sectioned by his lectures NOT TEXTBOOK CHAPTERS. The TA's aren't that much help, but his office hours are very helpful and he really cares for his students.  The lectures aren't mandatory, but there are clicker questions."
9244,783760,2.0,3.0,"I had such high hopes for this class because I got a 100 on his first test, but then he through a complete curveball at us for the second test. This class really should be accompanied with a set of homework problems, definitely go find practice problems for yourself because he does not give you enough. Also, most of the TAs suck."
9245,783760,2.0,3.0,"Marc Santugini is a decent lecturer but his notes are incomprehensible. He writes on a sheet of paper which he projects onto a screen. His handwriting is messy and all over the page, so most notes taken during lectures are useless. Nice guy but not a great professor."
9246,783760,3.0,5.0,"Marc is a nice guy and all, but he does not provide adequate practice problems. What I mean by that is that the ones he does provide are not like the ones on his exams. And he never posts solutions to the problems he does provide. The only way to get the solutions is to go to his office hours or his TA. I would not take this class again."
9247,783760,5.0,3.0,Love him
9248,783760,4.0,2.0,"The professor is fairly easy as well as his lecture. The most important thing about him is that he teaches really slowly, by which I mean two weeks behind compared to the other lecturer who teaches with the same schedule. But the good side is that his tests are not hard at all, and if you don't skip lots of lectures, you will probably get a A-."
9249,783760,4.5,4.0,"Marc's just a fantastic lecturer. He makes things very clear, even if he may go faster than he should at times (although he's very good at further explaining concepts during office hours). He's funny, straight to the point, doesn't waste a minute of class, prepares you VERY well for exams, and is very understanding. You definitely should take him. "
9250,783760,3.0,3.0,"Really nice and helpful, very willing to help students after or outside of class if you need help but doesn't offer many practice problems which makes studying for exams difficult."
9251,783760,4.0,2.0,"Fantastic...no textbook, gets a bit confusing at times, but he is really nice and will answer and clarify any questions you have...he wants you to learn the stuff and do well on the exams...wish he gave more practice problems/exams, though...otherwise, great teacher"
9252,783760,4.5,1.0,"This guy is pretty cool. He gives you literally everything you need to do well in the class. He doesn't use a txtbook, but he's got all his notes and writes them ALL out on the blackboard for you to copy. A bit fast, but it's an easy class to ace if you go to classes. Didn't go for the beret this year I guess. Small group. Take the class with him!"
9253,783760,5.0,1.0,"&quot;DUTCH KNOCKOUT&quot; RULES!!!!!!  (For those of you who don't know what that means, it means that if you score really high on just the final exam, he will erase ALL the other bad grades of the semester and just use that single one final grade for the overall grade.)  Isn't that sweet or what!&#63;  Thanks Mr. Santugini!  (Your ratings are up.)"
9254,783760,5.0,1.0,"&quot;Dutch Knockout.&quot;  If Mr. Santugini gives me an &quot;A&quot; through this, he is the coolest professor ever."
9255,783760,3.0,3.0,"I think Marc is a pretty great teacher. All these other guys must be jealous of his sexy French accent. Although it is a little freaky that he ALWAYS wears a beret to class. And he always eating croissants. Come on, you're in America, try a donut for a change!"
9256,783760,1.0,1.0,He is terrible.  The only way this class could be worse is if juan carlos taught it.
9257,783760,1.0,1.0,Ridiculous teacher.  CHOOSE JUAN CARLOS BISSO INSTEAD OF MARC STANTUGINI!!!  marc treats this class like a toy... only 2 scanty hw assignments and 1 midterm (whats there to learn&#63;) when theres only like 20 days left in the semester (hint: other normal classes at least use a real book...)
9258,783760,3.5,2.0,"hmm... this french t.a. grad student, who teaches this class by himself, is hard to describe.  Truly a one-in-a-million teaching style he uses... he writes everything he says on the board.  Literally... everything.  I guess you can't ever miss a single note, sometimes a bit boring, but nonetheless, his style makes it easier to do well."
9259,1602959,5.0,1.0,Excellent class. I was amazed at what I took away from this course. The time flew by and I learned so much. I am keeping all the books we read in order to refer back to them should the material slip away. Highly recommend!!
9260,1602959,5.0,1.0,Over all great class I would tell everyone to take it!
9261,1398163,2.0,3.0,"Prof Spencer is a great lecturer, but falls short in every other aspect as a teacher. She was very disorganized- constantly would forget to upload assignments, respond to emails, and grade tests among other things. She also gave a lot of work, a preclass and inclass assignment 4 times a week on top of a webwork problem set."
9262,1398163,1.0,4.0,the worst teacher I've ever had
9263,1398163,1.0,4.0,"I took her class during coivd. Her style of teaching leaves a lot to the student to figure out, I guess she thinks we learn more that way. Before our first test I had to spend about 2 full days studying (free) online math notes to understand the material and I got an A. The class average was a 69. This shows that free material is better than her."
9264,1398163,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed my time with Prof Spencer- she was a great teacher for differential equations (although I know some people who said she was not good for prob/stat. She was always very kind and willing to explain anything further. Tests are hard, but not impossible if you pay attention during class and put in the work! Would recommend her!"
9265,1398163,5.0,3.0,"Easily one of the best professors I've had, her notes are clear and concise, and she really cares about teaching students and helping them become better math students. Some of the earlier negative ratings probably reflect her teaching when she first started."
9266,1398163,5.0,3.0,Best applied math professor I've had here! Lecture is easy to understand and the worksheets make understanding it before doing the HW much easier. Love that she let us vote for 3 or 6 exams. Having 6 has made retaining information and understanding concepts much easier. Also very nice that 1 is dropped. Would 100% try to take another class with her
9267,1398163,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Spencer is great! Her lessons are clear, well-structured, and balanced with practice material (which she provides in abundance). She's also super sweet and approachable. Tests are also very fair, and we never need a curve. I wish she taught more math courses!"
9268,1398163,5.0,3.0,"Definitely one of the most engaged profs I've had here. Her lecture style, which is a little lecture and then the rest of the class on worksheet problems, isn't for everyone. She made herself very available in office hours and is good at explaining things one-on-one. Willing to help, friendly. Gives as much HW as everyone else."
9269,1398163,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS She doesn't like lecturing, so instead of teaching she hands out groupwork worksheets to ""give you practice with the material"" except she hasn't taught the material so its groupwork figure out how the thing works. And the sheets are graded. Occasionally clears things up the next day, but then its too late"
9270,1398163,3.5,3.0,"Prof. Spencer can be difficult to follow and seemed unsure of herself sometimes, but I think this was because it was her first semester teaching at UVA, and as the semester went on she got better at teaching in lectures. She made herself very available during office hours, during which she proved she genuinely wants her students to do well."
9271,1398163,3.5,2.0,"Spencer was kind of hard to get used to at the beginning of the semester, but she definitely improved a lot as a teacher. I think that's because it was her first time teaching the course. It's also really evident that she cares about her students because she does whatever possible to help us. Also her quizzes are easier than the other professors'."
9272,1398163,1.0,5.0,Very bad teacher she doesn't care if you don't understand the material she moves on. When you email her about the material a week before the quiz she respond the day before the next class she is just a terrible teacher and she do not know how to teach at all. She talk about irrelevant things in class like her cat. Transfer out if you in he class
9273,1398163,1.0,5.0,"Really, one of the worst teachers I have ever had. Unclear, disorganized, and doesn't even know how to send an email properly. She always has lower averages than every other teacher simply because of her incompetence and the fact she doesn't write the tests herself. She tries her best, and seems smart, but some people were not meant to teach"
9274,1398163,1.0,4.0,Julia is a horrible teacher. I was in her class for two days and realized i would likely fail the course if i continued. Most would say I am a talented math student. I talked to my RA after my second day of class about any good Calc 2 professors and he specifically said to avoid Julia Spencer. He failed when he took it with her. I would agree.
9275,1398163,1.0,4.0,"By far the worst teacher I have ever had. Does not teach in class and instead forces you to watch 30-45 minute lectures outside of class. Gives unreasonable amounts of homework that far exceeds the difficulty of Calc 3 or other Calc 2 classes. Incredibly disorganized. If you get her, change immediately."
9276,1398163,3.0,5.0,doesnt teach well at all but really wants to help
9277,1398163,2.0,3.0,She was very disorganized and hard to understand.  She often would get really frazzled and have trouble explaining things.  Don't recommend
9278,1398163,3.5,4.0,"She is a grad student, just like the rest of the calc II teachers.  Was not an easy class.  You'll have weekly quizzes, online homework, two midterms and a final. The quizzes and homework actually helped me learn the material even if it wasn't always easy to keep up.  The best advice I have is to GO TO OFFICE HOURS.  Helped me get an A in the class"
9279,1398163,2.0,5.0,She was very disorganized and lectures were hard to follow since she would repeatedly erase all the work she had done. She's a nice person but not a great teacher. I really don't recommend
9280,1701280,5.0,2.0,"I want to take all of his classes, that's how good he is! Presents everything clearly, follows the syllabus, and offers help whenever possible. The class doesn't require too much work. He's also really funny and kind, which is a plus!"
9281,1701280,5.0,1.0,"Very kind guy. Midterm and final are outlined by a study guide so there are no tricks. There are 3 short papers, a midterm, a final, and weekly quizzes posted online. Attendance is not mandatory at all nor is the weekly reading. Just take notes in class and you'll pass."
9282,1701280,5.0,2.0,"He's an interesting guy and a very reasonable professor, grading and attendance-wise."
9283,1701280,4.5,3.0,"Such a wonderful man and a great teacher! Loved being in his class, even though I didn't find the material particularly interesting! I definitely recommend taking classes with him."
9284,1701280,5.0,2.0,"Clear outlines and helpful lecturer, always available for office hours."
9285,1709476,5.0,1.0,She is really good at teaching and engaging. 
9286,1709476,5.0,2.0,"She is definitely intimidating, that being said, her guidelines and classes are extremely structured. Once you figure out her pace (which is VERY FAST sometimes) you'll be amazed by how much you'll learn. But you have to prep yourself for her humor, it's all good natured... I think. But seriously she's pretty cool teacher."
9287,1709476,5.0,1.0,This is the class where I made a ton of new friends - the atmosphere and mood of the class is fun. Just get used to her jokes...
9288,1709476,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Lee is seriously the best. I bow in the presence of her greatness. On a serious note, though, she's always willing to help her students. She can be a bit snappy at times, but it's kind of a turn on."
9289,79268,4.0,3.0,"Challenging, material takes a lot of practice and the weekly problem sets aren't always relevant. But Reynolds wants everyone to understand, pauses a lot for q's, is approachable, pretty good at explaining things, tries to bring in news stories and real-world applications to get people interested. Taught from the ppt so pay attention in lecture!!"
9290,79268,4.5,4.0,"He is strict on grades, of course. But he is really a nice professor, patient and always willing to talk with you. He wants to make sure you really understand the materials instead of working towards a &quot;grade&quot;. Hard and challenging, but helpful."
9291,79268,1.5,5.0,"This professor is a liar. And I quote &quot;if you attend class everyday and do all the homework, you should be fine.&quot; Nope, that is not true. He schedules office hours so that you can never attend them."
9292,79268,1.0,4.0,"A math class taught via powerpoint, just like all of Reynolds' other classes. He gives example after example without any concrete way of how to work a problem. His test averages are terrible, around 55-60% and he mumbles in class. He is by far the worst lecturer I have had."
9293,79268,1.5,5.0,This professor also killed my gpa. I did bad on my first exam and I went in to talk to the professor to see if I should drop the course. He told me no and said I would be fine if I went to his office hours every week and to the TA sessions. This statement was false because I did all that and still received a bad grade in the end. I would have been 
9294,79268,1.5,5.0,"This guy killed my GPA and my interest in CS. To have him as the teacher for the first course in CS major path is completely discouraging. If you're thinking about taking this class, wait for another teacher."
9295,79268,2.0,5.0,"He's a great programmer I'm sure, but he doesn't really get it to stick with you. For that reasons, make sure to work in labs, but lectures are really not necessary. If you are an arts and sciences kid experimenting with CS, my advice is to run away. It's not worth a GPA ball-buster, really. He teaches to CS majors, everyone else, good luck."
9296,79268,2.0,5.0,"As other reviewers have already mentioned, Discrete Math is only hard if you have reynolds. Having no textbook sounds great, but soon you find out that 90% of the online links are filled with irrelevant information. Besides, a 20-minute oral interview (for a math class) that counts for 20% of final grade !&#63;~  Non CS Majors STAY AWAY AT ALL COST !!!"
9297,79268,1.0,5.0,"He teaches the class with the assumption that you have taken an intro class on the material. His lectures and homeworks are such that they are conducive to people who already understand the material, but others be warned that you will get left behind. 45% of his grading is almost purely subjective (Exit interview and participation grade). Awful."
9298,79268,4.5,5.0,Great Professor and great class!
9299,79268,1.0,5.0,this guy is not clear in lectures and will murder ur gpa
9300,79268,2.5,5.0,dropped this...
9301,79268,2.0,5.0,"Definitely take this class with someone else if you can. He teaches the class with the expectations that his class is the only one you have. You may enjoy the material, but be prepared to work very hard."
9302,79268,2.0,5.0,"If you can take this class with anyone else, take it!!!!"
9303,79268,2.5,5.0,"Take this class with anyone else if possible.  The material is ONLY hard when he teaches it.  Also, he's not a very nice guy.  He's arrogant and impatient with students."
9304,79268,1.0,4.0,"actually a bad person, in my opinion... grades unfairly, is extremely defensive, sees students as an annoyance and puts minimal effort into teaching. material was contradictory. darth vader is kinder and saddam hussein is more understanding than reynolds. you would be better off taking this class with any other professor in existence."
9305,79268,4.0,4.0,No Comments
9306,79268,3.0,4.0,"Smart guy, and a decent professor. Can be a little obtuse at times and expects you to keep up with advanced topics. Kind of a prick though."
9307,79268,1.0,4.0,He spent a lot of time talking about his hobbies and not teaching anything. The questions on his test came out of nowhere. One of the worst professors I've ever had.
9308,79268,1.0,5.0,Horrible teacher.  Expects you to do impossible problems and doesn't go over them.  Take anybody else if possible.
9309,79268,5.0,3.0,"Reynolds is very clear with explanations and responds well to questions.  He can get defensive if you're overly aggressive, but in general is really open to questions and even arguments.  His office hours are EXTREMELY helpful as he really understand the m"
9310,79268,1.5,3.0,"i have completed my CS degree, and this was the worst class i took in my years at uva. while it was not particularly difficult, i have not found a teacher this unhelpful in any other classes. not a good teacher, and not a nice guy. take anyone else if possible."
9311,79268,5.0,3.0,"Professor Reynolds is a very organized, helpful and knowledgeable professor. His lectures were very clear, and he explains the material well. You will learn a lot from this course. The course isn't easy though, it's fair but gets hard towards the end of the course. There is a lot of material, tho."
9312,79268,2.5,4.0,he was offended when someone got a 100 on the midterm.  thus he made the final IMPOSSIBLE and the average was 23% !!!
9313,79268,1.0,5.0,This guy's an ass and a horrible teacher.  Oral finals in math classes and other idiotic plans.
9314,79268,1.5,4.0,Not that hard but very shady with grading and you never know if you're doing well or not in the class.
9315,79268,2.0,5.0,Pompous and actually said that he determines your grade by the first time he talks to you. Won't listen to your questions; assumes he knows what you're asking and ends up answering something completely different.
9316,79268,2.0,3.0,"Reynolds is a big joke.the TA teaches 10 times better than him, and he makes his tests too hard."
9317,79268,1.0,4.0,I have enjoyed my other CS classes.
9318,79268,4.5,3.0,"Nice guy, solid teacher, posts all potential test questions, if you don't do well in his class you really can't blame him."
9319,79268,4.5,3.0,"Really made the material interesting; very willing to help. One of the only CS professors who actually cares about you learning. Loves teaching, does it well."
9320,79268,2.5,5.0,taking his class was horrible. one of the worse CS classes i've taken
9321,79268,3.0,3.0,No Comments
9322,79268,4.5,3.0,Good professor.  Keeps the class lively.  Moderate homeworks and tests.
9323,2479539,5.0,3.0,Super knowledgeable and willing to help students
9324,2479539,3.0,5.0,"A prime example of what happens when you make a research professor teach. He's got the enthusiasm, he's got the knowledge, but he really doesn't have time to prepare for the class and it's rather difficult to get space in the office hours. The TAs are of limited use since they refer to Venkat for most questions about the projects. A huge struggle."
9325,2479539,1.0,5.0,Hard and confusing
9326,2479539,4.0,4.0,"This was a wonderful class contrary to what I've heard from last year. I came in not wanting to learn about the subject, but ended up enjoying this class a lot. Venkat is very knowledgeable and his enthusiasm about the subject really shows in lectures. The cache attacks project were very interesting. Exams are on the tough side but not too bad."
9327,2479539,1.0,1.0,If you could only read course forums or surf reddit about this dude on r/UVA
9328,873908,5.0,2.0,Professor Hill is fantastic!
9329,873908,5.0,2.0,I really enjoyed his class
9330,873908,5.0,3.0,"He knew everything, not only about math, but heard me discussing blood types and knew how to deal with a genetics problem I had. So smart! And great on the eyes, too!"
9331,873908,2.0,4.0,"the way he talks and presents information makes it seem like the class is clear, but he always confused me during lecture. he wastes so much time with theoretical proofs and symbols and abstractions. exams ARE computational (plug/chug) and there is little to NO emphasis on that during class. very confusing - i relied on the book's examples mainly."
9332,873908,4.0,3.0,"Other than the fact that I could actually understand him, I didn't much care for the class.  Really learned nothing by going to the lectures.  His quizzes are pop quizzes though, and you rarely have any advanced knowledge of them (meaning you have to show up).  Tests were not too hard."
9333,873908,4.0,2.0,"Mike was a pretty good teacher.  It is easy to follow his lectures and he gave five minute breaks during TR classes.  it was a little annoying that he wasn't in class a couple classes before the midterm, but it is similar to the review and pretty fair"
9334,873908,4.0,3.0,"He's really easy-going, and his lectures aren't bad.  Quizzes are straight-forward, but tests are hard.  Overall, I liked him as a professor.  His notes are clear and generally concise and he goes by the book."
9335,873908,4.0,4.0,Mike is really cute... thats the only reason I remained in that class.. jk but I ended with an A... although the material was very hard and so were the tests... omg! but the final was do-able. i went to that class maybe 7 times but i recommend going to classes....
9336,873908,5.0,5.0,"Try as hard as you can to get Mike for any math class he teaches. If you do not understand something he will do whatever you need to understand it.  Such a nice and funny guy. Does the impossible: makes calc3 an enjoyable class to go to! Also extremely smart, he can answer any question, no matter how abstract."
9337,873908,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher, always available to help out...be prepared to do lots of practice problems and practice exams from other classes in order to do well in this class...I'd take any of his other math classes in the future"
9338,873908,3.5,4.0,"Terrific guy... good teacher.  He wants you to learn and is willing to help 100%, his lectures seem really clear but somehow they are confusing, maybe because of the subject matter.  Do all the recommended problems if you aren't a genius and want to do well!"
9339,873908,4.5,4.0,"I loved Mike! He was so helpful and even met me over the weekend if I needed help. The overall class is really hard, but Mike makes it as easy as possible, which is always good."
9340,873908,5.0,3.0,"He's really clear and willing to help you out if you're confused. Also, he's soooo cute."
9341,873908,5.0,4.0,"He is the nicest, clearest, most patient man to ever walk this earth.  Yeah, multivar is hard as crap and so are his tests, but he adjusts them a little bit and he will work really hard to help you!!!  He's incredible.  Multivar is superduper hard, so might as well get as awesome a teacher as possible, and he is it!"

9343,1054135,5.0,2.0,"Professor Trent is an inspirational teacher. The class is not difficult, he assigns a good amount of reading assignments, but he went over most of them in class, and I rarely read them and did fine. I wasn't sure how I felt about the class at the beginning of the semester, but by the end I absolutely loved it."
9344,1054135,4.5,2.0,No Comments
9345,1054135,5.0,2.0,"Best teacher EVER! This was my first class ever in the Ed. School, and it just made me so excited about teaching every time I went to class! He makes the material so simple and useful and he really gets excited when you contribute to class.  He just seems to really love watching everyone learn!"
9346,1988034,5.0,5.0,Inspiring.
9347,538054,5.0,3.0,"Love Biemann so much--he's so sweet! The readings can be difficult to grasp and the lectures can be confusing, but that might be because Biemann is so smart. I love his sense of humor and it's evident he cares a lot about teaching and his students. He is a very liberal grader and the class is extremely laid back. I recommend anyone take his class!"
9348,538054,5.0,2.0,"I am in Comm at UVa, so I only took his Modern Jewish Thought class because I took intro to old testament and it didn't seem to hard. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Asher is one of the only professors that I have actually cared about at UVa. I will definitely take another class of his.   Just two take homes !"
9349,538054,3.5,3.0,Professor Biemann is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. I was not interested in this subject at all--I ended up in the class last minute. He made it very interesting. There is a ton of reading but he recaps most all of it in lectures. Grade consists of the midterm which is take-home essays and a final which is similar.
9350,538054,4.5,3.0,"I took two classes with him and one inspired me to major in Jewish studies. He spoke up to the Study Abroad program to help me go where I wanted to go and gave me great references so that I could get the job I currently have. He has a passion for teaching and invites his small classes to his home. He's a brilliant professor, mentor and friend."
9351,538054,5.0,4.0,"Asher Biemann was one of my instructors at Harvard before he moved to UVA.  While doing my undergrad and master's degree, Asher was one of the shining lights for his enthusiasm for the topics taught, encyclopedic knowledge, caring attitude towards his students, and his dry sense of humor.  Helped me learn the topic and also learn how to think."
9352,538054,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher. Everyone should take a class from this guy. He's the most stereotypical European intellectual I've ever met. Grading isn't bad but make sure you do the work. One take home essay exam, a paper, and an oral &quot;colloquiam&quot;. Crazy class, but I had a lot of fun."
9353,538054,5.0,3.0,"This guy is an awesome teacher.  I learned more in his class than any other.  He covered a ton of material, and he doesn't go easy on you, but taking from him was still a very enjoyable experience.  If you're in the religious studies department, you should definately take at least one of his courses"
9354,538054,4.5,3.0,"A fantastic professor, one of the best at UVA.  Take his classes, you'll enjoy them and learn something.  An engaging lecturer, knows so much about everything to do with Judaism.  Also really cares about students and very approachable."
9355,538054,4.0,4.0,"Great professor! Lectures are a bit hard to get, because his point can be obscured at times. Very, very intelligent, and helpful overall. Gives oral exams, which are quite good."
9356,538054,5.0,4.0,"Biemann is AMAZING! I highly recommend his classes to anyone interested in Israel or Judaism, regardless of how you feel about the subjects. He is a very precise and intelligent scholar. Furthermore, he is a gentleman, which is seen in both private conversations and in class."
9357,1963494,1.0,2.0,"I was very unhappy with this professor. Do not expect her to be accomodating of illness, even something as severe as a concussion. She is very lazy and will not go out of her way to care for students. Apart from that, class is easy to succeed in. Lectures are incredibly boring, though. I'd say they were useless if it weren't for the mandatory work"
9358,1963494,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Ferrara is a great teacher and the learning material is not difficult. She doesn't lecture though, we just do group work during the lecture time and have to take the notes on our own outside of class. Makes me wish she lectured since she's really great at explaining everything. Labs were easy and there were plenty of office hours."
9359,1963494,1.0,3.0,This lady made my friend drive all the way to school just because she didnt want to cancel class the week of thanksgiving break. Like girl sit down.. she thought she ate thats why nobody showed up to class
9360,1963494,2.0,3.0,"Mediocre class. Learned RStudio, but nothing special."
9361,1963494,4.0,2.0,"Very thorough lectures (almost too thorough, she talks a lottt but I personally found it helpful). If you do all of the work and watch all of the lecture videos, you will definitely do well."
9362,1963494,2.0,3.0,"Notes are all taught in recorded video lectures (at least my semester). Makes it difficult to ask questions and clarify. Synchronous classes felt kind of pointless. Material was somewhat interesting sometimes, but nothing exciting. She is also very particular about format and grading. I didn't enjoy going to class, but didn't hate it."
9363,1963494,4.0,3.0,"Maria is very straightforward and will give you exactly what you expect. Statistics is not that difficult of a course, and she makes sure to cover the things you really need to know. She is very transparent about what will be on the exams. There is weekly online homework that is not difficult. Her exams are short, so each question is worth a lot."
9364,1963494,5.0,3.0,"I never got the textbook, just took good notes on her lectures and paid attention to the homework and labs and got an A. Lectures are pretty clear and not too text-heavy. Exams aren't too bad if you study enough"
9365,1963494,5.0,3.0,"Great instructor. Clear, straightforward grading guidelines and reasonable exams. ALWAYS available outside of class if you need help."
9366,1963494,4.0,2.0,"Maria is a pretty good lecturer and her class makes sense. She is upfront about the fact that there is no curve but most exams averaged about 77% mean anyway. If you pay attention, do the graded homework assignments, and study, this is a fairly easy class provided you're good at math."
9367,1963494,3.0,1.0,"Maria is a really nice person, but not the clearest lecturer. Her slides are very clear, however, so it's not that important. She often seemed a little frazzled in class, but I think it was also because students only take this class for a requirement. Group projects were obnoxious, but there's only 2. TAKE THIS OVER STAT 2120! "
9368,1586666,4.5,4.0,Professor Powell awards hard workers. If you are working hard he'll spend time with you to understand and complete assignments. If you aren't doing well on tests he'll coach you on how to do better. Outstanding Professor!  
9369,1586666,3.5,3.0,"Electronics is a hard class, but Prof Powell does everything he can to make it easy on you and is very understanding if you are having a hard time. If you are not a native English speaker, you may have a hard time with his accent, so be prepared to read  the textbook and work with TAs. If the lab graders are being harsh, let him know. He'll fix it."
9370,1586666,4.5,3.0,"Great Professor. The class is somewhat involved but the material is interesting. Self-teaching is required especially if you are interested in greater detail. Expect to spend 4-6 hours/week on homework, 8-12 hours on Transformer Design Project and 15-20 hours on Final Research Project."
9371,1963499,1.0,3.0,"Worst professor at UVA. Both of her classes that I was required to take were honestly my least favorite I've ever taken. It's not that they were difficult, it was because she gives nexts to no feedback and her grading seems random. When asked, she doesn't give clear explanations. She assigns lots of busy work and I didn't feel I learned much."
9372,1963499,5.0,2.0,"Professor Hornsby is incredible. She gives great feedback. The class is part-lecture, part-discussion based and requires attendance. Intro to Public Health is interesting and a great class for anyone interested in medicine or public health. Expect a few online quizzes per semester and one online midterm/online final, along with a group project."
9373,1963499,4.5,1.0,"Professor Hornsby is a great introduction to public health world. The class is fairly easy, just a few online quizzes and a midterm/final. She does assign one group project for the semester, but it isn't too terrible. Overall, would recommend if you need to take a public health class/want an easier science elective. "
9374,2184683,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Kranz is very knowledgeable about nutrition. Her lecture are extremely important for success on exams. I took her j term class and don't regret it. Way more chemistry based then I expected, but manageable without experience. Not the easiest class but not the hardest. By the way exams are called quizzes (but its really an exam 30-50 questions)"
9375,759277,4.0,2.0,"Awesome guy, awesome class. The class collaboratively writes, compose, and records a song. Sound Design=the shiznit."
9376,759277,5.0,1.0,one of the best classes i've taken at UVA. He's really nice and knowlegable and will do his best to pass on his passion. He's a great teacher and helps you along each and every step. Everyone should take this class. You'll love it
9377,759277,5.0,3.0,"I liked this class....very computer-oriented, make sure you know how to use computers before you take it because the class revolves around computer-based projects. michael's an awesome teacher, very laid-back."
9378,759277,5.0,3.0,"This class has been great! Michael is a very helpful, funny, and  teacher who makes the class fun, yet you still learn a lot in it. It is not an &quot;Easy A&quot;, but he is the type of teacher who wants people to enjoy the subject and really become interested in Sound Design. Definitely take this class!"
9379,824812,5.0,3.0,His enthusiasm for the subject is very apparent and it definitely rubs off onto the whole class. Very approachable both during lectures and afterwards. Lecture style is concise and thorough while never getting close to tedium or boringness.
9380,824812,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Schiavon is very entertaining and easy to talk to. He's very willing to help. If you want to get an A on the quizzes and exam, definitely read the textbook. But you can drop your lowest score and he offered EC so it works out regardless. Lectures sometimes dry and I found I had to learn certain concepts on my own despite going to all the lect"
9381,824812,4.5,2.0,Prof. Schiavon is a very fun and outgoing teacher. The classes can get dull at times but his humor will keep you awake. Most of the lectures are based on the book so it won't kill you to miss a lecture. The quizzes are a little harder than expected and they are almost entirely based on the book.
9382,2717176,5.0,3.0,"This was my first course in education. I am in UVA's online M. Ed. program, so the class was asynchronous, primarily based on reading and assignments. She gave really great feedback on all of the assignments. This was particularly valuable because it let me see if my knowledge was translating into usable skills. I would definitely recommend her!"
9383,1652255,2.0,4.0,She is unhelpful. She is a very harsh grader!!! Her weekly quizzes are ridiculous... and she doesn't always have the reading done!!! 
9384,1652255,2.5,3.0,"She's really kind and every now and then can lead an insightful discussion. However, she's almost too relax about the flow of the class and really not much pertinent information is delivered related to the course itself...I feel like every other class is just a bunch of rambling about themes and what not that have no bearing on anything."
9385,54821,5.0,3.0,Space Bob is hilarious!! His lectures are very engaging because whenever he sees someone not listening he slaps the nearest hard surface with a giant yardstick. You won't sleep in his class! His slides are a bit hard to read so you should definitely attend lecture. Other pros: not textbook required!
9386,54821,4.0,3.0,"I disliked APMA 2120 so I thought this course would be miserable -- I was so wrong! The course material was organized well (with helpful supplemental notes and examples on Collab), the WebWork was tough but thorough and he extended due dates often, weekly quizzes were simple. Study well for the first test, and then ask about partial credit back!"
9387,54821,1.0,5.0,"Very boring, his notes are incredibly unclear, and he tends to mumble. I would advise against taking his sections if you can."
9388,54821,4.5,4.0,One of the best professors I've had.  He will make sure that everyone understands the material and will go out of his way to help students.  Also has hilarious antics and mannerisms in class.
9389,54821,3.5,2.0,"Professor Johnson knows the material, but isn't the greatest at teaching it.  His class isn't that useful and spends most of time giving horrible examples for homework/quiz/test problems.  Definitely makes time to help students though."
9390,54821,1.0,1.0,"AVOID FOR ANY PRE-REQUISITE CLASS!! I didn't take CS333 with this guy, thank god!! His classes are ridiculously easy, and he cancels half of them to go out of town. He won't teach you Jack S**T but will still give you an A. If you take him for a Pre-Req Class I.E. CS333 Plan on almost failing CS435"
9391,54821,4.0,1.0,"Really cool and you can just tell that he knows his****. Really SMART, and ridiculously easy (3 take home exams&#63;!). Cares about students and, well, he's just cool. Also hot."
9392,54821,3.5,3.0,I suck at taking exams and did poor on the tests but when I went in and talked to him during office hours he realized that I did know the matieral and that had bearing on how he waited my grade. He is a nice guy in general
9393,54821,5.0,2.0,Reminds me kinda of In Like Flint
9394,54821,2.5,3.0,"Kinda hard to follow sometimes, mostly just follows his slides and doesn't clarify too much"
9395,54821,5.0,3.0,class is as easy as your classmates make it.  Bob is very helpful
9396,2315819,5.0,5.0,"He does a great job at explaining the concepts and really cares that his students are absorbing the material. The homework is not relevant to the tests, so prepare from the regular quizzes. He curves the overall grade. The tests and quizzes are graded on selecting the correct answer but you get points for every wrong answer eliminated."
9397,2315819,2.0,5.0,I took this class during the summer of 2020 (online due to COVID-19). I must say that (as a rising second-year) this is by far the WORST COLLEGE CLASS THAT I HAVE EVER TAKEN. He is a real hardass. I am a Premed and I understand that Premeds try to knock this class out of the way during the summer. DO NOT TAKE IT!
9398,2315819,4.0,5.0,His lectures seem really easy and understandable but he doesn't do any practice calculations in the lectures to help you understand the homework and doesn't do enough conceptual stuff to help you understand the quizzes. I would say don't take him unless you've already taken physics in high school. Otherwise he's pretty funny and nice enough.
9399,2315819,5.0,4.0,"Professor Yoshida does a wonderful job at providing real-world intuition behind abstract concepts in Physics. While PHYS 2415 is a tough class, his demos and lectures are very worthwhile."
9400,1390133,4.5,4.0,The class is demanding but worth it. Plus she puts a lot of energy into the class and keeps it interesting!
9401,1250869,5.0,2.0,"Best TA I've ever had. She has a brilliant ability to shape fantastic papers and is really willing to help. Extremely nice - the only complaint people had of her was that they couldn't understand her accent sometimes, but I found her English to be fine. Going to be a great professor!"
9402,1250869,3.0,2.0,"Very nice, not terribly hard but tought to understand at time."
9403,2618944,5.0,4.0,I love Professor Parks! She is so helpful and has amazing PowerPoints that save my life every week. Class is always interesting and she explains thing in a way that is easy to understand. I would highly recommend taking a class with her. She is until now the only professor I have liked enough to take the time to write a review for. *chili pepper*
9404,2528835,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Idris is a great professor who clearly knows a ton about political theory. I took contemporary political thought with him and it was a ton of information, but he clearly distinguished each theorist and ideology. Lectures are really dense and there are pop quizzes about readings, so going to class is important. Overall, tough but enjoyable."
9405,1447500,4.5,3.0,"Jesse is a good and interesting lecturer. He uses personal anecdotes to help you understand the philosophical theories, etc. and sometimes gets off-topic, which is charming. He's a bro kind of guy and not what you would normally expect from a philosophy professor, in a good way."
9406,1447500,4.5,2.0,He is hot and interesting. Great class material and fair grading. I recommend this class!
9407,1447500,2.5,5.0,"He's a Nazi grader. The material itself is honestly really not hard, but Jesse for whatever reason feels like everyone deserves a B in the class. He's a good, funny guy and everything, but this is like a kindergarten class that I just can't get an A in. Ridiculous... I think he awards one A- per exam, the highest grade he ever gives."
9408,1447500,3.5,3.0,"I can't put two ends together with this guy. He himself seems like a good guy,  but his grading is so skewed. I can't figure out what to do to please him. Overall, he's a good guy, but I just can't get it. He makes a 9 AM discussion easy and entertaining, but not the most worthwhile. Getting him is neither good nor bad, but at least funny."
9409,153179,5.0,2.0,"He is very smart, kind and helpful. I enjoyed his classes very much."
9410,153179,3.5,3.0,Great class.  Here is your chili pepper.
9411,153179,4.5,2.0,"Great Professor, Easy to follow. Kind and smart!"
9412,153179,4.5,4.0,"Great professor. He breaks things down to the lowest level. If you can't understand nim, you should reevaluate your ability to learn. Found him to be very friendly and caring about students. His stories are hilarious and a welcome break during some of the more difficult subject matters. Beling for President!"
9413,153179,2.0,5.0,"Unfriendly, unhelpful outside of lecture--should not be teaching a course if he does not want anything to do with students."
9414,153179,1.5,2.0,I really couldn't ever connect with the guy. He kept putting me off and that had very bad consequences. I eventually left the department w/o degree. I wouldn't recommend him as an advisor.
9415,153179,5.0,3.0,Best Professor Ever
9416,153179,4.5,3.0,"If you actually listen to him, he is really funny! He answers all questions and makes sure you understand the subject. Wonderful teacher. The people who gave him a bad rating probably got a bad grade cause they never went to class."
9417,153179,3.5,3.0,"Nice guy, not as bad as people below are making him out to be.  Kind of a tough class but you can get through it fine."
9418,153179,2.0,4.0,No Comments
9419,153179,4.5,2.0,I cant believe you guys didnt like him.  He is an awesome prof and hes really funny.  I learned so much in this class
9420,153179,4.5,3.0,I can not believe people didn't like this prof.  I thought he was extremely organized and witty.  He made learning an ease.
9421,153179,1.5,4.0,"The guy is a very judgemental jerk.  He gives attitude during office hours, if extremely unapproachable, and never responds to email.  Wonderful qualities for a college professor."
9422,153179,1.0,5.0,This school should not be teaching engineering.
9423,153179,1.0,1.0,Has he any concept of the REAL world&#63;
9424,153179,1.0,4.0,How did he get tenure&#63;
9425,2750043,1.0,1.0,"Dr. Bentley is one of the newer professors at UVA; his expectations were wild for the non-traditional undergrad student. The material hardly matches up with his pre-created slide show &amp; weekly quizzes. The online textbook was hard to navigate; assignments were very in-depth, grading took forever, and we begged for a study guide for the final."
9426,2750043,1.0,5.0,"He openly conducted an &quot;experiment&quot; using a premade open-ed course instead of authoring his own class. Weekly HW sometimes forced open-ed content creation; obscure software took days to learn. Grading was petty and inconsistent. The text contained errors/biases throughout. He didn't care about how he affected students. Unheard of, in academia. Run."
9427,2750043,1.0,5.0,Unfortunately there isn't much to say about Dr. Bentley. He used an Open Source learning platform that was very confusing. Dr. B relied heavily on the quizzed provided by this open source which sometimes didn't even have the correct answer. The assignments consisted of learning new application interfaces. The class seemed like a bad experiment.
9428,824928,2.0,1.0,jolly old fellow
9429,824928,4.5,2.0,"Forest Ecology -- not an amazingly interesting class, but Hank is a great teacher. He's funny and very very approachable. He loves to joke in class. Take him whenever you can -- he'll help you out any time you ask him."
9430,824928,4.0,1.0,"Lectures sometimes ramble, but they always ramble to interesting places.  Hank tells great stories, uses bizarre sayings (&quot;Warped as a frozen snake&quot;), and somehow manages to still teach an awful lot.  Would definitely recommend."
9431,824928,3.5,2.0,"Forestry was sort of interesting, although Shugart rambled around the subject a little.  He does tell good stories and the exams aren't too bad."
9432,759401,3.0,3.0,It is good to have classes with people from other countries. This is what opens our minds and help us learn about the world. The experiences of South American immigrant refugees are interesting and let us see what they go through in their adoptive environment.
9433,759401,1.0,1.0,I would not take this prof. again because I feel that I am diminished every time I raise a question in class or outside class. I am not impressed with his publications.
9434,759401,1.0,3.0,"He is not respected, he is not inspirational or funny.  He thinks he is above everyone else in the department, and he thoroughly enjoys the benefits of nepotism."
9435,759401,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Pope is intelligent, however he does not appreciate conveniently the neither intelligence of his students nor their intellectual perspectives on the topics commented. He seems kind, open minded, democratic, but do not believe such appearance. He will not tell you that he does not agree with you, he will simply grade you below your merits.  "
9436,759401,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pope expects greatness because he wants his students to be strong enough to succeed as competent writers and thinkers. Some students are used to constant codling from professors, but Pope is the kind who will be honest about what is wrong with your work. Wouldn't you rather know? Improved my writing tremendously."
9437,759401,1.0,1.0,"Professor Pope pretends to be a chill and kindly professor. However, do not be fooled. He has a nasty little streak. He seems a little burned out and maybe should consider retiring. He likes to tell students that their work is &quot;poorly written.&quot; What type of constructive feedback is that&#63;"
9438,759401,1.0,1.0,Pope is one of those who pretends to care for students making everything easier than it is supposed to be. He is tired of teaching the same stuff for years and has become an entertainer of sorts. Should be on his way out.
9439,759401,5.0,2.0,"Pope is a GREAT professor. Go to his office hours! He cares about improving your written and spoken Spanish and is really interesting. Keeping up with the reading is a must. Small group discussions, daily homework, and a midterm and final."
9440,759401,5.0,2.0,"Professor Pope, unlike many of the Spanish faculty, truly cares about his students. He's Chilean, so his accent is really easy to understand. Pope tries to shake up his classes, so its never boring (he loves small group discussions). He's a really easy grader, which is also nice. Overall, just a great guy"
9441,759401,5.0,2.0,"Interesting speaker and lenient grader.  Lots of reading, short weekly responses, final paper and presentation.  Invited the class over for dinner.  Genuinely cares for his students and an overall kind person."
9442,759401,5.0,1.0,"prof. pope is adorable and the who am i&#63; usem was one of my fav classes. medium reading, about 30-50 pgs per week (easy reading though) and 2 written pgs of reponse but they are easy and fun. he is sweet and even had us over to his home for dinner! easy A if you just do the papers--they are just your opinions and not hard."
9443,1660521,4.0,4.0,"Friendly, accommodating, and very skilled in political theory. Be careful if you choose her as a TA for your discussion section because she is a very tough grader."
9444,988782,1.5,5.0,"Unclear, always hand waves. Doesn't explain the concepts behind game theory. He specializes in auctions, but never focuses on that and falters at teaching other concepts."
9445,988782,3.0,5.0,"Ridiculously hard class. It's a math class, not an econ class. He can't make eye contact and that can get annoying. Tests are way too long for the class period. Very few people do well or enjoy the material, and it's supposed to be fun stuff. I can't recommend this class or 402."
9446,2078325,5.0,4.0,"Professor Prakash is a true authority in the field of executive branch law and his Presidential Powers class was a true delight. He is funny, humble, and very down to Earth - it is easy to learn from him and fun as well!"
9447,824951,5.0,2.0,"An AMAZING professor. One of the most knowledgeable people I've encountered at UVA, lectures are incredibly rich and while he does deviate from the syllabus, he's quick to revise and help students along."
9448,824951,5.0,2.0,"Awesome. Professor Ross is so passionate about the subject matter that an hour and fifteen minutes just seemed to fly by. Papers aren't graded too harshly and while the final was difficult, I still managed to get a pretty decent grade."
9449,824951,2.5,2.0,"he did not outline any expectations and oversimplified assignments. i stumbled blindly around this course. to make matters worse, he was terrible about getting papers back so his expectations remained unclear throughout the entire semester. i finished with a good grade but it felt like a total surprise."
9450,824951,2.0,2.0,"Boring lectures and kind of confusing when he explains terms and concepts. The only thing that made me come to class was getting the notes so I knew what he might ask on the test. That and he takes attendance. However, the tests also tend to have random terms that he never went over. Wouldn't say avoid him but if you can take someone else do."
9451,824951,2.5,4.0,"Professor Ross' lectures are really boring, and he moves at such a slow pace that it is hard to pay attention. However, for tests it pays off because a lot of the information he didn't get to in class won't be on the test. He is an extremely hard grader though, and it is next to impossible to get an a or even a b+ in one of his classes. AVOID HIM!!"
9452,644738,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Very considerate, very thoughtful, very approachable. Highly recommended. "
9453,644738,4.5,5.0,"She has a great selection of books and she moves at a very quick pace. While she is a very tough grader, I found her challenging and wanting the class to expand our ideas rather than just getting by. She's very friendly in office hours and is a very understanding person. Take a class with her if you're willing to put in the hard work."
9454,644738,2.5,5.0,"We read a lot of interesting books.  The professor is very intelligent and likes to hear different opinions, but she is a very harsh grader who doesn't really explain her grading system or her standards.  She tries to be understanding, but at the end of the day, she is unhelpful."
9455,644738,3.5,4.0,"She is very interested in what she is teaching and is very open to people's opinions, but she is an extremely tough grader, and does not explain mistakes well. Nice person not the best teacher."
9456,644738,5.0,3.0,.
9457,644738,4.0,5.0,"Feminist Criticism was one of the best and most challenging classes I took.  Too bad the rating system doesn't ask about things like competence, subject matter knowledge, expertise in the field.  Harness, helpfulness and clarity just don't capture it."
9458,644738,5.0,2.0,"This was my first upper level English class and I was kind of intimidated going into it, but Professor Fraiman is definitely now one of my favorite professors at the University.  She's incredibly articulate and intelligent and picks great reading material."
9459,644738,5.0,3.0,"Fraiman is one of the best professors in the department. I recommend taking her even if you aren't interested in the subject matter (attention: dudes.) She makes everything good, you'll see."
9460,644738,5.0,3.0,Great professor.
9461,644738,4.0,2.0,"One of the best classes I ever took here.  Strong lecturer who likes to hear different idea.  She does seem disconnected sometimes, but overall one of the better teachers here"
9462,644738,4.5,3.0,"Ms. Fraiman is a great teacher!  She is very liberal but is open to many different opinions, and she keeps me awake very early in the morning.  I took her class knowing nothing about her, but if you like the subject matter of a course she is teaching, definitely take her! Chooses great books to read, too.  Not a super hard grader, either."
9463,644738,5.0,3.0,No Comments
9464,644738,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor, one of the best uva has and definitely a star in the english dept.  Very willing to help students outside of class."
9465,1226385,3.0,4.0,"It's pretty difficult to understand him, but that's mostly because of the subject matter; he probably does the best one can do.  It would be unwise to take his course without some prior knowledge (or at least interest) in the content... you'll be eaten alive."
9466,1226385,2.0,3.0,He's all over the place. he has great thoughts and ideas but his presentation is so verbose and convoluted; but expects clarity from u.He has a good heart and cares 4 students. He's open w/office hours and passionate about your learning and his teaching; but cares little about rescheduling class and does it annoyingly often. His grading is random.
9467,112278,1.0,4.0,"This class was an asynchronous summer class. This was one of the worst professors that I have ever had at UVA, in his lectures he would go off topic many times and I would lose track of what he was trying to teach in the first place. Whenever he does do a problem he skips many steps and it is confusing of how it got his final answer. DO NOT TAKE. "
9468,112278,1.0,5.0,"I'm shocked at the amount of positive reviews here - Prof Norum is one of the worst professors I've ever had. Tests in this class were very hard to study for, almost all practice was either far easier or far harder than the exam. It was also very hard to tell what was important and what was not in lecture. If you can take with another prof, do so!"
9469,112278,3.0,3.0,"He is a good guy but his lectures were not very clear, especially since they were the most important part of the course. He cares about his students, yet for whatever reason decided it was fine that the grade average was 70%. He skips over derivations of formulas often, which lost most of the class except those who were good at math."
9470,112278,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher, although I struggled (content is hard). He was always really nice and does fun demonstrations. Super nice in office hours and explain things well, but still gets you to figure it out and actually understand it. Not confusing at all as long as you go over stuff in the textbook. I wouldn't want to take the class with any other teacher"
9471,112278,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Norum is a solid teacher in that he genuinely cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. That being said, his class isn't easy. Physics is a tough subject for most people anyways, and he assigns a fair amount of homework (especially if you take it during the summer session as I did). Tests are tough but there is a generous curve"
9472,112278,1.0,5.0,Blaine is unclear and drones on and on in lectures.  He doesn't give practice problems which reflect how hard the tests are.  His tests are designed for a longer amount of time so most people end up running out of time.  Overall horrible professor and the only reason he is still teaching here is because he has tenure.
9473,112278,1.0,4.0,Large disconnect between lectures/book and tests. This guy enjoys scribbling equations and performing unhelpful demonstrations more than articulating the material that he expects you to know.
9474,112278,1.0,5.0,"Avoid this professor, his lectures bored me to tears and he teaches with a very condescending attitude."
9475,112278,4.0,4.0,"I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Professor Norum is that he is a bad teacher because of how the class and tests are structured. The class and the tests are both incredibly difficult (at least in my opinion), but I really like how Professor Norum teaches and how he's always willing to help people outside of class. Give him a try!"
9476,112278,2.5,5.0,"Norum does not provide any useful examples in-class, he only derives equations that you'll use later on your homework assignments and tests. Not only do the derivations not help you with the tests or homework, but 75% of the time, he derived them wrong and confused himself to no end. Amusing I suppose, but a waste of time."
9477,112278,4.5,4.0,"Honestly, he's an awesome teacher.  Don't complain about his class being hard if you admit you don't go to it, and if people aren't following him in lecture, it's their fault for not paying attention.  Great guy!"
9478,112278,1.0,5.0,horrible teacher! class is a waist of time. just read the book. completely confusing! all he does is derive equations on the board! no useful examples.
9479,112278,2.5,5.0,"lectures were useless, couldn't learn anything from it. I can't believe that he's being assigned to teach the intro classes."
9480,112278,1.0,4.0,very very worthless teacher
9481,112278,2.0,4.0,This class is terrible.  The lectures are pretty pointless and not many showed up.  Norum just spends the class writing equations on the board whether anyone is following or not.
9482,112278,2.0,3.0,Frankly this guy sucks.  He teaches directly from the book.  Stay away if you can.
9483,112278,2.5,4.0,Very helpful if you take advantage of office hours!  I found lecture very hard to understand.... My reccomendation is to be prepared to lots of practice problems
9484,112278,2.0,3.0,"The only good thing I can really say for Norum is that he's not Kenneti.  There were two profs availible for this class my semester.  Norum is the lesser of two pathetics.  Sit in the front if you want to hear him and see his examples.  Read your book.  The averages on the tests are really low, so don't freak out, but study hard to beat the curve."
9485,112278,1.5,4.0,"Very bad teacher! talks softly, so u can't hear him anywhere near the back... tests are impossible, last tests avg was a 40% if theres a better option, take it!"
9486,112278,1.5,5.0,"This class is terrible... you don't learn anything in lecture and the tests are really hard, plus the labs are just a pain in the ass. Any interest I had in physics before taking this class was just blown apart. Norum does some interesting demonstrations in lecture sometimes but on the whole it's just boring. I stopped going to lecture completely."
9487,112278,1.0,5.0,The most boring class. Don't go to it because you will get the same grade whether you go or not.
9488,112278,4.5,4.0,"Really tough class, but it was worth the effort"
9489,415384,5.0,4.0,"Professor McLaren is amazing, and one of my favorites at UVA. He's really passionate and knowledgeable about the material. The class is hard, but you will learn a lot and he will help you if you need it."
9490,415384,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mclaren is very knowledgeable about international economics and explains things really well. The research paper is not hard and if you write it in advance, he would look at it and give you some advices. Overall, its a worthwhile class with interesting materials."
9491,415384,3.5,2.0,"Not bad for an Econ course, well-balanced course between math and facts. He stutters a bit during lectures but otherwise the content isn't hard to understand. Research paper is not hard if you prepare in advance."
9492,415384,4.5,2.0,Little weekly work--just skimming a couple of journal articles.  Only real work was research paper due at end of semester that McLaren will walk you through step-by-step if you start asking q's early enough.  McLaren is a good economist and knows a ton. Extremely useful in later economics because class focuses on critiquing real articles.
9493,415384,5.0,4.0,Best Professor Ever
9494,415384,4.5,3.0,"McLaren is a very good professor and the material is very interesting and useful. The class would have gotten an A+ if not for the exams. There are 2 of them and they are 14 questions multiple choice 30% of your grade! The average is low, harder than hw!"
9495,2307748,1.0,5.0,"If you like someone who is rude, sarcastic, and passive-aggressive, this is the professor for you. This man tells you nothing and then gets mad when you don't read his mind. The most he teaches you is one vocab word per unit at best and you're on your own for the rest of the material. It's so quiet in there, you can hear a pin drop."
9496,2307748,4.0,4.0,"This was a difficult, high workload class. At the beginning of the year, it seemed like he expected us to be fluent in French, but as the year went on he got used to the skill level in the class. This is not a class to take if you want an easy A, but I learned more French than I did in four years of high school. He is a cool person as well."
9497,669354,1.5,5.0,"After working with and learning from Prof. Figgins, I do not feel that she should have a place in the Curry School any longer.  I found her examples and methods to be impractical, dangerously naive, and dated.  Listen to your placement teacher and learn from other teachers.  They're the ones who teach in the real world, not Prof. Figgins."
9498,669354,4.5,4.0,"Margo was my absolute favorite teacher at Curry!  I am shocked by the previous posts.  She inspired me, helped me, and remains a friend and mentor. Yes, she was demanding, but I would expect nothing less of professors at UVa."
9499,669354,1.0,5.0,"I really think she has something against male students.  I knew three guys in the PGMT program, and two of them dropped out, and she wanted the one who was left to do a contract or something.  She wasn't even there for our teaching seminar (thank god)."
9500,669354,1.5,5.0,"This was the worst class I have ever take by far. It made me miserable. Assessments were not aligned, assignments were presented in the most confusing manner they could be, there was a lot of useless work, professor regarded students with disdain at times, and it was obvious. Everyone is the class hates it."
9501,669354,2.0,5.0,"Wow, this is the model of a bad teacher.  She gives a lot of work, her directions for her assignments and projects are unclear and verbose, and her classes usually end 5 minutes late.  For some reason, she's become very crabby and rude to her students lately.  Avoid her if you can (DO NOT TAKE EDIS 542 or 540)."
9502,669354,4.5,5.0,"I first met Margo in 1979, she was teaching high school in an inspiring way. She expected a lot from her students then and I imagine she still does. She taught me English, Poetry, Creative Writing and Dance, but most importantly she taught me to open my mind and search for my truth and express it to the world. For that, I will be forever thankful."
9503,669354,3.5,5.0,"Way too much work given and hard to contact. Students rarely know where they stand in her classes. She is challenging and does want us to grow but can be unclear as to how we can do that. If you get on her bad side, you're doomed."
9504,669354,2.0,3.0,No Comments
9505,521899,5.0,3.0,Great Professor!  Couldn't have made econ more understandable and bareable.  Thank goodness Juan Carlos was teaching during my undergrad years to help me through the subject.  What a hunk!
9506,521899,5.0,4.0,"This was definitely the best college class I've had so far! Juan Carlos taught me a lot of new techniques, and really made sure I was always comfortable before trying something new. Couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, and very generous with extra credit!"
9507,521899,5.0,2.0,"This was my first college class, and i took it during the summer prior to my senior year (SUMMER06) and Juan Carlos was definetly always there to help us out in case if we had any problems, though the problem sets are quite easy and there is barely any homework, the exams are somewhat tought. but overall i'd recommend him to ANYONE!!"
9508,521899,4.5,2.0,"JC is a really nice guy and if you get to know him he gets very personable with you. He makes the material look very easy and logical. However, the final is not easy. Relatively generous with homeworks/assignments. Also curves pretty good."
9509,521899,5.0,3.0,"Juan Carlos is great at explaining things! He makes everything so easy to understand with graphs, especially if you are a visual learner.  I hope you have a chance to take him because he relates really well with the students and makes class fun."
9510,521899,5.0,3.0,I took this class with Choi. Hadn't it been for this guy's help I would have failed it.
9511,521899,5.0,3.0,JC is by far the best TA I've ever had. Not only he knows a lot and knows how to explain things really clearly but he is also really cool!
9512,734900,4.0,1.0,"Kind, understanding professor. Material was easy but engaging and enjoyable. Consists of reading responses, 2 major papers (5&10 pages) and a presentation. You will be pushed out of your comfort zone with chants, drumming and dancing, but it can be very fun. Come to class well rested and be open, she expects full physical and mental involvement!"
9513,734900,5.0,1.0,"this class was amazing, so much fun, you dance and sing, almost no work. i would recommend this to everyone. but i hope you like african chants."
9514,734900,3.0,1.0,A great experience of dancing and drumming!  The class turns into one big family and class periods are a blast.  Some of the beats/dances can be hard to learn because of the traditional african teaching style watch and learn.  BUT you still get an A...cool  plus i met my girlfriend there
9515,325303,1.0,3.0,"Booth was dreadfully boring, at least for 3820. Her lectures were full of useless information regarding publication and biological information about authors, and she spent very little time discussing the readings which were covered on the exams."
9516,325303,5.0,1.0,Gothic Lit. I really enjoy Booth's class. The projects are fun and the papers are short. More than just literary analysis. Reading is manageable. I would definitely take another class with her.
9517,325303,4.5,3.0,Professor Booth is passionate about what she teaches  and speaks accurately about the subject. Her class is run like a discussion but she gives talks and is always the master of what's going on.
9518,325303,4.5,4.0,"Prof Booth is so great!!! She is so knowledgeable and passionate about the subject and she finds ways to encourage discussion and keep it interesting. She's very fair. Go to office hours and get to know her. She'll help with your writing. Def NOT an easy A but take her if English is your passion because if you work hard enough, an A/B+ is possible!"
9519,325303,4.5,1.0,"She's really nice and a good professor, but there is WAY too much reading in the course. It's usually 100-150 pages per class (maybe this isn't much... I'm not an English major) and you often have to print it off for yourself. She's a pretty easy grader and the assignments aren't difficult at all."
9520,325303,5.0,3.0,"One of my final classes at UVa after grad. and undergrad., and a *great* way to end that academic career."
9521,325303,5.0,2.0,"Her seminar class this semester was phenomenal.  The small class engaged in fascinating discussions, and she even had us make maps to tie in with the travel theme.  We felt like we were in grade school again, with markers and glue, but it was so much more fun and creative than papers!  Good grader, good friend, best professor I could ever imagine."
9522,325303,5.0,3.0,"The best in the department. Interesting lectures clearly presented. Go to office hours; she's extremely helpful, charming, funny, and challenging. She's everything a lit prof should be."
9523,325303,2.0,4.0,"Boring, picks boring literature, not helpful on how to improve"
9524,325303,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors in the department- take any English class you can with her!
9525,325303,4.0,4.0,"Prof Booth is a wonderful teacher--she's really insightful and helpful in office hours, too.  I would definitely recommend this class, though know this: there's a LOT of reading."

9527,325303,5.0,4.0,very insightful; enjoyed her class immensely
9528,325303,2.0,4.0,No Comments
9529,595650,5.0,3.0,"Cheryl is by far the reason I decided to major in French. She not only is very passionate about her topics, but is genuinely a caring person. She makes herself very available outside of class and gives specific comments and provides areas for improvement on assignments. I have taken four classes with her now and am still amazed at her dedication"
9530,595650,3.5,3.0,"Kind and reasonable. I was never afraid to ask questions, but her lack of organization had me worried all semester. She relies on Collab (which is prone to crashing) a lot, so be sure to save your documents. I definitely learned a lot in this course - in writing and speaking - and enjoyed the positive, interactive atmosphere."
9531,595650,5.0,3.0,An attractive intellectual professor although a bit liberal.
9532,595650,5.0,1.0,"This course is well worthwhile. Preparation is a must because we discuss films in class you need to have seen prior; however, all of the films are interesting to watch. There are not too many text readings, and the professor is amazing! She is also available during office hours and willing to help you. This course is amazing... just take it. :)"
9533,595650,5.0,1.0,"The class is the history of French Cinema. I meak what could possibly be better then watching French movies for a class&#63; Well, not only that but also discussing them in class. In terms of the workload this class is very light, and you learn so much! Definitelly worth taking!"
9534,595654,1.0,4.0,"Yeah so I don't have him for teaching, I have him for advising. This guy sucks. He is rude, does not give good advice, and is not empathetic in any way, shape, or form. I'm putting this on Rate My Professor because I'm sure if you ask for outside help, he will give you the same treatment that he gives his advisees. Just a heads up on his character."
9535,595654,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kozminski is extremely caring. His lectures are very detailed. Participation is very important as the slides have no words. He makes everything very understandable as long as you pay attention to each piece. The test require application rather than memorization, but I have never come across an unfair question. Class was very interesting. "
9536,595654,1.0,4.0,"Professor Kozminkski uses slides that are useless if you are to miss class. They are full of diagrams and studies, not the take-home points. The course has 4 exams, each worth 25% of your grade. The questions on the exam are difficult and don't come from the material presented in class or the text.

Take it in the Fall with Wormington if possible!"
9537,595654,5.0,3.0,"Professor Kozminski can come off as slightly odd at first, but he is intensely passionate about cellular and synthetic biology which is more than can be said about the usual type of professor that are his professional equivalents. You will learn more with him, but it will require more attention to detail to achieve a high grade."
9538,595654,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Kozminski is an amazing professor. He gets a lot of bad reviews, but thats just a reflection of the difficulty and heavy nature of the material. He is very thorough and very talented at explaining concepts."
9539,595654,3.0,4.0,"He seems to be a nice guy, but his lectures are super heavy, and he does not care about your individual grade. I went to him several times and told him that I don't do well with tests, which sucks because he only gives exams, no homework. I would recommend Wormington if you can!"
9540,595654,2.0,4.0,"The tests include small side notes from the text that seem important and tricky critical thinking. He does not curve, offer corrections, or have any other assignments to buffer the test grades. He assigns readings from the textbook every class, which is normal except for the fact that each chapter of reading requires several hours to get through."
9541,595654,1.0,4.0,"Awful person and awful teacher. Chronic liar. Doesn't have clear expectations or a real gradebook. Is not knowledgeable on the subject and is very boring. Messes up a lot in class and expects students to miraculously know things he's never talked about. I don't thinking teaching is the right profession for him, let alone science."
9542,595654,3.0,5.0,"Not an awful lecturer, but goes in to a ton of detail. Tests are extremely difficult. I wish I had waited until this semester to take the class with Wormington."
9543,595654,5.0,3.0,"Lectures were clear and somewhat entertaining, but Kozminski expects a lot from his students."
9544,595654,1.0,5.0,Kozminski's lectures were very disorganized--people often looked around the classroom to see if they were the only ones not understanding--they weren't!
9545,595654,2.0,5.0,"Horrible class. He curves to a C after giving tests where the averages are in the 50's. The class was disorganized and didn't flow together well.  The book sucked.Overall, this class has made me regret declaring a biology major.It's damn near impossible to get a decent grade in here bc even if you do better than average, you can get  C+. :&lt;"
9546,595654,5.0,3.0,"smug & bizarre, but funny jokes... seems to hate and love teaching biology (at the same time). thought he was great and his teaching was good-- dont miss lectures, though!"
9547,595654,2.5,5.0,"Very smart, but not good at relating difficult material to students.  You will have to work a lot with the TA."
9548,595654,3.0,5.0,"A smart man, but his tests are hard and he has no reservations in failing students or giving them low grades."
9549,906950,5.0,4.0,"This was one of my favorite classes ever! It's not easy and will probably get everyone out of their comfort zone, but Ms. Tamarkin made the learning process a lot of fun. She is fair, patient, and kind and overall a wonderful teacher. I just wish there had been more than 2 semesters of this class because I would have loved to keep going."
9550,906950,5.0,2.0,"Kate Tamarkin is a warm and enthusiastic professor. I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in orchestral musicking in any capacity. Whether you are a performer, conductor, composer, orchestrator, instructor or enthusiast, orchestration (and instrumentation) is a class that you don't want to miss out on."
9551,906950,5.0,3.0,"Took instrumental conducting with her. She is an amazing teacher and definitely brought out the best in all of us students. Class is not easy, but very fair. You will definitely learn a lot with her. She is also really nice and helpful. Best class I've ever taken at UVa."
9552,906950,3.5,2.0,"Good teacher, not very flexible with grading, class could be boring but okay if you were interested in music, lots of grades so if you blew one test (I got a C on one) you could still get an A in the class. Very nice and helpful, pretty easy A, especially with prior music experience."
9553,906950,3.0,3.0,"Appears nice, but she's pretty set in her ways. She's got a thing about punctuality so don't be late. I'd like to think she's got an open mind about music but i don't think she does. MUSI104 reeks of intellectual laziness, i.e. namedropping &quot;nationalism&quot;. If you're anything other than a music major, prepare to wince in this class. (pain or boredom)"
9554,906950,4.0,2.0,"nice professor, learn about composers, music eras and listen to music. have to do essays once a week for discussions, tests arent as easy as one would think, it does require some review beforehand."
9555,906950,4.5,1.0,"Easy A. Easy class. Go to class and discussion, and you'll be fine. Prof. Tamarkin is the nicest and sweetest lady ever!"

9557,882378,4.5,2.0,"Ted is a great professor. He's both compassionate and challenging. Musically, he is legitimately a genius and he understands music on a philosophical, spiritual and aesthetic level. Check out his piece blue cycle noise or never ate so many stars on his channel openfrequency on youtube and soundcloud. Really listen, they're brilliant."
9558,882378,3.0,2.0,"Although most of the time he is disorganised, he really enjoys the class. He tries to help everyone. This class is very fun especially if you are good at composing, you will also gain quite a bit from it. The quizes are easy if you listen to the songs week by week, the two midterms and one final are 20% in total, the compositions are worth more."
9559,882378,1.0,3.0,"Ted is a great guy but a truly awful teacher.  I understand the nature of the course makes it very difficult to instruct, but I've never been in a class as confused and disorganized as his.  Looking at the syllabus, I don't know how this class turned out to be as dissapointing as it was, as I was very, very excited about it.  Take it with Burtner."
9560,882378,4.0,2.0,Ted is an awesome guy!  He can be a little disorganized but not really in a bad way because he's fun about it too.  He's really supportive of whatever you want to write but will also give good feedback to you too.  You can tell he's really passionate about the music he teaches which is awesome.  Definitely one of the coolest professors I've had.
9561,882378,4.0,2.0,"T, as some call him, is an awesome guy.  He gives really good feedback, and the quizes/compositions are very fair.  He is an easy grader, as much is about creativity.  He can be disorganized, but he relates to you.  On the topic of pitch serialism, he said, &quot;Let's just finish this up so we never have to think about it for the rest of our lives.&quot;"
9562,882378,5.0,2.0,"Really good teacher.  The class is kind of hard to get into at first since it's avant-garde electronic music, but he really makes you appreciate it and teaches you a lot about the subject.  The in-class composition projects are a lot of fun as well."
9563,734922,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Maus is a super knowledgeable professor that takes time to make sure everyone's on board and understands the material. Theory II involved some difficult topics but the class structure made it manageable: flexible homework dates, a short but helpful reader, and lots of review/exercises in class. Very much enjoyed my time spent in theory II."
9564,734922,5.0,2.0,"I had Professor Maus for both MUSI3310 and MUSI3320 (and will have him for 4331), and he is one of the most caring teachers I have ever had, and his passion for music and students' learning is evident in every lecture. He is always open for communication and assistance, both during lecture and through email. It was a true joy to be in his classes."
9565,734922,5.0,2.0,"This was one of the top 2 classes I've taken; there's a lot of reading and you have to do it all but it's fascinating and relevant far beyond the class. He is brilliant, funny and engaging and the assignments are creative and actually enjoyable."
9566,734922,4.5,1.0,No Comments
9567,734922,5.0,1.0,A very well learned guy who can pull out all kinds of 17-19th century music from his head and play on the piano.  Easy class too since he tells you exactly what to expect on quizzes.  I wish he would teach MUSI 332 but he doesn't...
9568,734922,4.5,1.0,"20th century music was a really great class.  The assigned readings were engaging, and Maus is a very intelligent and interesting lecturer."
9569,710350,4.0,3.0,"She's very knowledgeable about lit. analysis and always picks up on hidden meanings that I would have never thought of. Very nice,but also a little bit tough in terms of grading-takes 1 pt. off for each grammar mistake but that's pretty common at this level of Spanish.Otherwise, great teacher!Good class to prepare you for higher-level lit. courses."
9570,710350,4.5,2.0,"angeli was awesome. knowledgeable, nice, easy-going and willing to help you out. this 50 minute class went by ridiculously fast--she keeps you busy the entire time and she keeps it interesting. really want to take an upper level class with her in the future."
9571,710350,5.0,3.0,"She was a great professor, kept class interesting.  She gave tons of practice for exams, and it was very straightforward.  She made the class awesome."
9572,710350,4.0,2.0,"All the 101/102/201/202 level courses are basically the same in difficulty and structure. Angeli is really friendly and tries to make the class fun, which is a rarity in the language requirement sequence. Would definitely recommend."
9573,710350,3.0,4.0,she speakes way too fast and mumbles.
9574,710350,5.0,2.0,"I really don't like Spanish, but I enjoy going to Angeli's class. She does a lot of activities and things during class (not really any lecturing) which makes the time go by quickly. Spanish sucks, but if you have to take it, I'd recommend her."
9575,710350,5.0,3.0,"Great Spanish teacher who puts in the extra effort to make sure you understand and learn a lot more.  She comes off as a bit intimidating, but she's nice.  She makes the class very active by doing lots of group tasks in class, but not the annoying boring kind.  She's very good at explaining things, but beware, she's a killer grader on compositions."
9576,710350,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class! She was an amazing teacher, came off as kind of strict and a little intimidating at first, but I ended up loving her! We did lots of fun activities in class aside from just classwork, but we got all the material covered without feeling rushed. A+++++"
9577,710350,4.5,3.0,"Rather than soley lecturing and doing dry exercises, she does a lot of stuff like group activities and playing Spanish popular music, which makes the class entertaining. The main problem may be that she's too good at spanish; she talks so fast it can be hard to understand sometimes, but overall excellent."
9578,710350,4.5,3.0,She is a great teacher and is extremely helpful with learning Spanish. She is a native from Chile but has been in the states for a while. Tests and quizzes are not that bad if you study. We listen to songs a lot and do a lot of exercises.
9579,710350,5.0,3.0,"Comes off as a **** at first but is actually really nice and a fun teacher.  She sends out a lot of emails which is kind of a pain and since she's new, she's pretty strict about rules.  But she can speak and teach spanish which is definitely important"
9580,1562319,4.0,3.0,"Professor Rubin was one of my favorite teachers at UVa. Although his classes were often labor intensive  for example, MUSI 4510 required lengthy readings and responses for each class  Rubin was a fair and reasonable grader who always makes himself available if you are struggling with the material.  Definitely a positive educational experience."
9581,1562319,1.5,4.0,"This class is absolutely awful. For a 2000 level class, it is far too difficult and Rubin is so scatter-brained. The TA, however, was far worse. If you get Jean, he is completely incompetent in grading, and he can barely speak correct English! I've received A's on 3000 level papers and got my first D. Bad all around."
9582,1562319,3.5,1.0,"This is a VERY easy class. He gives you a study guide for the exams. The papers are easy and not graded harshly. In lecture, he's very scatterbrained and it's hard to follow what he's saying sometimes"
9583,2455249,5.0,3.0,Really enjoyed this class! Professor Davies was the best! We had a lot of freedom to choose our essay topics.
9584,2455249,5.0,2.0,"My first English class at UVA was taught by professor Davies and I loved it! The class was taught over Zoom, but she still make class discussions interesting and engaging. Most short assignments (&lt;2 pages) were pass/fail, and the only other grades were 2 4 page essays and a group project that were graded fairly. Highly recommend this professor!"
9585,2455249,5.0,2.0,"ENCW 2600 with Cassie Davies was one of the most amazing classes Ive taken. Cassie really cares about her students and works hard to make the class not only helpful, but also interesting. I really grew as a writer through this class."
9586,554737,4.5,4.0,"Haidt is wonderful. His tests can be ridiculously hard, but he is a great lecturer and his class was never dull. I would recommend the class to anyone, just for the experience. However, if you are the kind of person that gets frustrated easily from &quot;low&quot; grades, stay away."
9587,554737,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher, but it was quite a difficult class. Had a huge paper due two days before the final. Still, he was very clear and entertaining in lecture. :)"
9588,554737,4.5,4.0,He's a very fun and engaging professor. I definitely recommend taking his class.
9589,554737,4.0,4.0,"Yes its a hard class, but amazing teacher! If you want a blow off class suggest not taking it but if you actually want to learn something in college this class will do the job."
9590,554737,3.0,4.0,"seemed arrogant at times so i did not always like him, but other times i loved this class. he makes it very interesting. he also gives helpful studying advice (and memory sheets for tests ;) i definitely recommend."
9591,554737,4.0,5.0,"Great teacher, difficult class. His lectures are interesting and he is a great public speaker. Makes good use of visuals to keep the class somewhat entertained. The exams, however, are incredibly difficult despite the memory sheet you are allowed to bring. With no practice problems, getting a good grade is simply blind luck."
9592,554737,5.0,3.0,"This guy is amazing.  Not only is he extremely knowledgeable, but he is fun and makes the class really interesting.  He's very bright and is able to integrate knowledge from multiple areas; I was very impressed by his research."
9593,554737,5.0,3.0,Great professor and great lectures! It's because of him that I want to major in psychology. And one best thing is that he allows memory sheets on exams. So if you study hard and are well prepared its not hard to get a good grade.
9594,554737,4.0,5.0,"awesome class, loved it a lot and learned a lot...that is, until i received my final grade! incredibly hard. but i guess, in the end, it was worth taking. his lectures are gripping and informative, and you cover a fascinatingly wide array of topics."
9595,554737,5.0,5.0,Very difficult class but definitely a must-take.  Haidt is amazing.
9596,554737,5.0,3.0,"He is a wonderful professor, one of the best I have ever had. He is an amazing lecturer. I love his class."
9597,554737,5.0,2.0,He is a vrey nice man. I have found no fault in him. He is just that sweet.
9598,554737,1.0,5.0,He is extremely full of himself. He thinks that everything he does or says is right (and don't question him or he will try to make your life a living hell) I am in E school and took this class for fun - it was the worst idea ever (take the other teacher because this guy is not good and makes way too much work for what it is worth)
9599,554737,2.5,5.0,Truely one of the most arrogant people I have ever met.  His insolent attitude killed my desire to ever take a class in his department again.  He carries himself like he's a cross between elvis and jesus when in reality he is more like a cross between john tash and a televangelist.  His lecture is one long ego trip.
9600,554737,2.5,4.0,I think his cockiness and arrogance invalidates every genuine comment made to describe him. I entered his class wanting to learn and left with no desire to continue studying psychology.
9601,554737,5.0,4.0,"Amazing class and very interesting and funny lecture.  He is very knowledgable but also very opinionated.  This class was insanely difficult and the exams were very in-depth application. If you are a psych major, if you take it, take a more specific psych class before it to decreases the chances of getting a dreaded C-."
9602,554737,4.0,2.0,"Haidt is a god among men. No mere mortal can compare to his utter brilliance. Lectures are immensely engaging, and you will never learn more from any other professor at UVa. This experience will change your life. Sudoku's ROCK and So does Haidt! And don't even get me started on that Memory Sheet, Wow!"
9603,554737,5.0,2.0,"Haidt is extremely wise and effective at communicating his passion and expertise in psychology. if he came off as cocky, it can only be b/c he is indeed at the top of his field and just appeared on the today show!  smart and successful does not equal cocky.  haidt is the best."
9604,554737,2.5,4.0,"I must say that I have to disagree with most of the things said here. I felt that Haidt's cockiness was way too much to handle. The class definitely appeals to first-years so if you're not one and need 101, I would recommend not taking from him. He tried way too hard to be funny and I really just wasn't all that impressed."
9605,554737,3.5,2.0,"Haidt is a great speaker, he is funny with his lectures and always finds a way to break up the lulls in class. The Positive Psyc experiment is a great exercise for everyone. The exams are a bit overdone, and can be confusing, but there are always some interesting to some of the questions."
9606,554737,4.5,3.0,"If any of you is so lucky as to get him for 402 (Flourishing), you'll learn a ton to apply to your life and probably be a different person from when you entered the course. Sntch up the opportuity while you can."
9607,554737,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher, the intro class was broad but still interesting. The lectures are thought-provoking, he likes to extend them to give you advice on life, love, etc. Make sure to do all the readings - tests are tricky but he lets you have a memory sheet (hooray for 7.5 pt font)."
9608,554737,5.0,3.0,"as all introductory classes, this class was a challenge but haidt is AWESOME. great class, very interesting stuff and very funny guy. exams are a killer if you cant make a good Memory sheet but he can help. TAKE THIS CLASS, IT'S AWESOME !!!!"
9609,554737,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor, take his class! There is a ton of reading and the tests are hard, but if you do the readings you will do well on the tests. He gives the best lectures and always keeps you interested!"
9610,554737,5.0,3.0,"Amazing. Funny, intelligent, and gives really entertaining and intriguing lectures. He even encourages questions and discussion in a huge lecture. He assigns a lot of reading, though, which can be tough to keep up with at times. But his class is excellent and totally worth it. Don't take 101 with anyone but him. All you could want in a professor."
9611,554737,4.5,3.0,"I went to class about 5 times during the semester and got an A- for my final grade, so it's not that bad. He lets you make a memory sheet for the exams (3) - as much as you can write on two sides of paper. Worth taking."
9612,554737,5.0,3.0,"Haidt was an amazing professor, I never missed a lecture because I never wanted to. They were always interesting and he always made the class laugh. His tests were hard, but managable, and he usually gives a good curve."
9613,554737,5.0,3.0,Haidt is fabulous. He uses ideas from psyc to help you remember things and he applies the course material to real life. He uses jokes and video clips during lecture.  Tests are difficult but you learn a lot and he curves them. This was my favorite class this past semester.
9614,554737,4.5,4.0,"Haidt is amazing. Lectures are brilliant (don't miss one!) and he's hilarious. The exams are tough, but if you learn from the first midterm how they go you can prepare your memory sheet correctly for the rest. You will learn a lot and be surprised how much you remember."
9615,554737,3.5,4.0,"he is an awesome teacher. lectures are very interesting.. but the class is hard! you definitly have to read and study. it was totally worth it though, i learned a lot"
9616,554737,4.0,4.0,"This class is a great class especially because of Haidt. He is an awesome lecturer and lecture is always interesting. I never want to skip. There is lots of reading and the reading is on the tests. The tests are hard but once you figure out what he is looking for, you will do well. I strongly recommend this class."
9617,554737,5.0,2.0,"JH is a god among men. I took his class solely on the recommendations here and it was quite possibly the best decision of my life. I go to his lectures spellbound, mouth open, starry-eyed, and probably more attentive than I was during Wedding Crashers. The only class I'd never skip, and the highlight of my semester. JH is absolutely magnetic."
9618,554737,5.0,5.0,He is a fantastic teacher however kinda bust a** as far as tests are concerned!!! Be ready to study hard!!!
9619,554737,5.0,3.0,"Professor Haidt is the BEST teacher at UVA.  TAKE HIS CLASS! even if you arent interested in psych, he will make you interested.  His lectures are great, hes hot, and very easy to listen to for the entire class period! i wish i could take his class every semester!"
9620,554737,4.5,2.0,"Makes material very interesting. It's a rare class where you'll be eager to attend lecture and want to talk about its content afterwards. He's knowledgable and funny. Exams are tough. You'll feel stupid afterwards, but there is a curve."
9621,554737,5.0,4.0,Hard exams...Haidt kicks major ass though
9622,554737,5.0,3.0,No Comments
9623,554737,5.0,1.0,"He is by far my favorite teacher so far at UVA. He is awesome, funny, clear in lecture, and on top of it all somehow pretty hot.  I am not a psych major but his class made me want to take more psych classes. if you are gonna take 101 make SURE that it is with Haidt, no other teachers can measure up, esp in the psych 101 dept."
9624,554737,5.0,3.0,"Prof Haidt is the reason why I'm a psyc major. He is hot, smart, helpful and he gives the best lectures! He let students bringing a memory sheet to the tests(front and back 8 by 11 on the tests). Even if you are not a psyc major, take his psyc 101 class!!! You won't regret it."
9625,554737,5.0,1.0,Easy A class nice prof
9626,554737,4.5,3.0,"Awesome, awesome teacher! Take 101 with him and no other professor. He shows a video clip every class which helps you retain the info. I liked his class so much I'm a psych major now!"
9627,554737,5.0,4.0,"The best class I have had, hands down. So worthwhile, hoping he will teach a higher level psych class I could take"
9628,554737,4.5,3.0,AWESOME professor! you will love his lecture every time.  You get to use memory sheets on the tests but they are still pretty hard.  Great class though
9629,554737,5.0,1.0,"He is great!  He lets you take a sheet of paper of any notes you want into tests, which I found extremely easy."
9630,554737,5.0,3.0,"The best professor I have had at UVA, amazing lecturer. It's sad but I didn't ever want class to end. The tests aren't easy, but they are fair. Memory sheets help you learn material, but aren't that helpful when actually taking the test.  It doesn't hurt that he is pretty hot, either."
9631,554737,4.5,3.0,"Awesome professor. WOW! You will love him. He is so funny and knowledgeable of everything. Amazing class! You will really enjoy every class and the text is okay. Memory sheet doesn't help that much. READ the book, not the notes for tests. Tests are Difficult!"
9632,554737,5.0,4.0,he is the best professor ever. Every student should take this class with him!!
9633,554737,5.0,3.0,GREAT PROFESSOR!!! go to the lectures even if you're not in the class.  he's a really good lecturer.  makes the material super interesting (and then you look in the book and it's super boring).  the tests are difficult but the curve and the mem sheet should help you out a lot. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM
9634,554737,4.5,1.0,"I looked forward to going to this class because it was always so interesting. You can have a memory sheet on the tests, and that is really helpful."
9635,554737,5.0,3.0,Haidt rocks.  Great class.
9636,554737,4.0,4.0,"He is the best lecturer I have had at UVA.  They are always funny and lively.  His tests are difficult though, so reading is important.  He'll tell you ways to excel in his class, if you follow them."
9637,554737,5.0,4.0,He will probably be the best professor you've ever had.  Take his course without question.
9638,554737,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor, class flew by! tests aren't easy though"
9639,554737,4.5,4.0,"Awesome class, awesome professor. Best prof I have had here...tests suck though"
9640,554737,3.5,2.0,"Awesome guy; funny as hell.  Workload is pretty light, and exams are fine as long as  you make a comprehensive &quot;memory sheet.&quot;  The only class I truly enjoyed my first semester"
9641,554737,4.5,3.0,"Haidt is an awesome professor.  He is hilarious and makes the lectures very entertaining.  The tests are challenging, but with a curve and memory sheets, most people are fine.  I definitely recommend this class, even if you aren't interested in psychology."
9642,554737,5.0,3.0,One of best purely entertaining professors to ever walk the face of the planet.
9643,554737,5.0,1.0,best prof
9644,554737,4.0,3.0,He's a really good professor.  His class is the only class that I haven't skipped yet and I've never wanted to skip it.  His tests are difficult but he curves the grades so it works out.  Don't let the tests scare you off though b/c you'd be missing out on a great class.
9645,554737,4.0,3.0,"Whoever said he is boring-you're a freaking moron. Prof. haidt's class was the funniest, most interetsing great class I've taken in three years here.  Even if you're not Psych-oriented he makes the concepts easy to understand.  Take this class!"
9646,554737,4.5,3.0,I love his class.
9647,554737,5.0,4.0,"Hard class for a 101, but a great teacher. Interesting lectures and he tries hard to make it fun.  Memory sheets for tests too.."
9648,554737,5.0,5.0,Great guy but really really hard tests.
9649,554737,4.0,4.0,I don't know what these other people were smoking but I thought this class was extremely boring. I can only listen to him expound upon psychology for so long before I start to question where my tax dollars and tuition are going.
9650,554737,4.5,3.0,"great, engaging lecturer. quite biased in his views on some things, so take it all with a grain of salt. tests w/ memory sheets make them low stress, but challenging. great class overall."
9651,554737,5.0,2.0,Memory Sheets for exams. Clear and Interesting Lectures. Fairly Easy Exams. Great Class.
9652,554737,5.0,4.0,"Funny, all lectures are interesting.  Definitely recommended.  &quot;Memory Sheet&quot; allowed for all exams."
9653,554737,5.0,4.0,excellent professor
9654,554737,5.0,3.0,awesome class...adds humor to every subject and often brings class into experiments....tests are fairly easy b/c &quot;memory sheets&quot; are allowed
9655,554737,5.0,3.0,Best class at UVA!
9656,554737,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting - funny, great lectures. Great overview of psycology - tests aren't easy though."
9657,554737,5.0,4.0,"Hard Class, but EXCELLENT Teacher, Made you look forward to every lecture.  Makes you interrested in the topic"
9658,554737,5.0,4.0,"very funny, will publicly humiliate you if you bring a cell phone that rings in class... so beware.  but funny!"
9659,554737,5.0,4.0,"Got me interested in psyc, made me want to major.  Great lecturer; clear and communicative."
9660,554737,4.5,4.0,"Good lectures, but HARD class.  VERY HARD"

9662,554737,4.0,2.0,great prof
9663,554737,4.0,4.0,Here began my interest in psych.  A great teacher.
9664,1890046,1.0,3.0,HE IS THE WORST. DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING WITH HIM. He twists everything you say to make you seem wrong then repeats your original point as correct. He makes everyone uncomfortable and doesn't teach just wants you to debate pointless things with your classmates. He also likes to pick kids out that aren't prepared. RUN AWAY.
9665,2750209,5.0,3.0,"Took ENWR 1510, Beauty and Thievery in the Modern Museum. Lots of art analysis; generally a reading (20ish pages) to prepare for class, and then class discussion or small group work. If you forget to turn something in, she's very understanding and will give you full credit. Often asks for feedback on how to improve the class. She's the best!"
9666,2217734,4.0,1.0,"Very sweet, but if you dont show up to class and she finds out :|  

I enjoyed her class; her midterms and finals ARE HARD but everything else is self explanatory or a guaranteed A if you put in your work :)))"
9667,2217734,5.0,3.0,"Love her. Favorite professor. If you have any problems, talk to her! She wants to help you in any way she can! Just do the homeworks and you'll be fine."
9668,2217734,4.0,2.0,Professor Abyad really cared about making sure her students understood the topics and was always available outside of class to give feedback and to further explain more difficult topics.
9669,2619142,4.0,3.0,"I took this class in 2019. If you have experience in R and SAS, it will be an easy A. However, if you don't have any programming experience, you gotta work hard. All homeworks and tests are all about writing codes, so.. good luck!"
9670,2619142,1.0,5.0,This guy gives a huge amount of code work. He even failed to present us slides of requirements of the code work.
9671,2447116,5.0,3.0,Honestly one of the best professors in terms of pedagogical techniques. Every single module by outlined by objectives so you know what to do since he's so organized with his structure for the class. Accessible without making you feel suffocated but you know he gives plenty of effort and care into the class and wants his students to succeed!
9672,2447116,5.0,2.0,"Best professor even had. The course itself is very hard. But the professor made it really easy to follow along. He writes all the slides, R codes, labs, solutions, solutions in R codes, and organize them so nicely that you can just follow along. Unlike other professors, he puts most of the work/burden on himself and demands little on students."
9673,2504468,3.0,3.0,"The lecture was based entirely on detailed powerpoint slides. It could get pretty disengaging, and I focused mostly on note taking and not listening. Never read the txtbook chapter, only the primary sources for discussion section. Grade is based on discussion participation &amp; essays. Overall- boring but not super hard."
9674,2504468,2.0,3.0,"Every lecture was simply a slideshow that perfectly paralleled the information from the online textbook, and each slide was paragraphs of text to take note of. Class was boring but fairly simple. I found it hard sometimes to pay attention because she was not every engaging. Friendly and helpful TA, discussion section was also not helpful."
9675,2135830,1.0,2.0,I generally believe she graded off of how much she liked you. An unkind individual who does not look out for you or help you grow as a student. Openly admitted that she did not want to be teaching first years.
9676,2135830,4.0,1.0,"Has a very comprehensive syllabus that outlines exactly what needs to be done for a passing grade in the class. Christa is clearly a knowledgeable professor but has a difficult time connecting with her first-year students at times. Definitely not a difficult course, but incredibly important to participate in class and to write the papers."
9677,2135830,1.0,3.0,the woat
9678,2135830,5.0,4.0,She's good
9679,2135830,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors in the art history department. Incredibly bright. Down to earth. You learn a lot.
9680,2135830,5.0,3.0,"Christa is an AMAZING professor!! I took her intro to art history:art and technology course this semester and while it was challenging to get a grasp on both aspects of the course, doing the readings, attending lecture, and participating in discussion really helps! Also, Christa is just a really chill prof who you can just talk to!"
9681,2135830,5.0,4.0,attendance mandatory. not an art history major but i found the class and the way she taught the material so interesting that i ended up trying hard in it (real praise coming from someone who isn't the best student). tests are hard to study for but also fairly subjective and plenty of extra credit opportunities available
9682,1357594,4.5,3.0,"Mr. Haley is an incredible teacher. He assigns a lot of reading, but if you are interested in English at all you will love his class. He makes the classroom environment very relaxed and welcoming so it's easy to share ideas. He also is super helpful if you have questions about paper writing. Definitely recommend taking his class."
9683,1357594,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Haley is a model TA. He articulates his ideas elegantly, will never get impatient with students who constantly seek help, and really wants his students to do well. Hope UVA recruits more grad students like Mr. Haley; doing so will greatly enhance students' academic experience."
9684,759579,5.0,1.0,Very interesting topic with a professor who really enjoyed the topic. Awesome class!
9685,759579,5.0,1.0,you will love him.
9686,759579,4.5,1.0,Fun class all around. Lots of valuable tips and tricks with manageable amount of work. Very flexible with students and wants you to succeed.
9687,759579,3.5,2.0,"He downright tells you in the beginning that as long as you show up to class and participate a small amount you will get a B. I don't think I learned a thing, but as it was a required class I was fine with the easy grade. It was a lot of fun and half the time we talked about anything but the material..."
9688,759579,5.0,3.0,Mr. Gil is a great teacher! He speaks like 18 languages and loves to play pool... And his volume is always on high! DR rocks!
9689,759579,4.0,2.0,"very funny, pretty easy going class"
9690,759579,4.0,1.0,No Comments
9691,1316634,5.0,4.0,"Impressive, enlightening, and occasionally entertaining. Learned a ton. Would like to take a course with this Prof again."
9692,1316634,1.5,5.0,This is possibly one of the worst classes I have ever taken at UVa. His lectures rambled on and were full of useless tangents. On top of that the lectures were never useful for essays or tests. The class is very long and a complete waste of time. The teacher is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate but assumes his students know more than they do.
9693,1316634,5.0,5.0,"Great class. lectures are awesome, massively informative, peppered with pictures. just a bit too early in the morning. TA is really quite good too."
9694,1316634,5.0,4.0,This was a wonderful class. I learned so much about modern India. He has a great knowledge as he has been there over 1 year. I would fully recommend this class and hope that he would have a tenured position.
9695,1316634,2.0,2.0,"This class was worthless. His lectures tended to ramble, and he almost always ran out of things to say. it was really frustrating because I'm really interested in modern India, and I don't feel like a really learned a lot; his lectures were truly terrible, the reading assignments uninspired, the essays graded oddly."
9696,1316634,4.5,2.0,"I really enjoyed this class! I don't know what the last comment was talking about. Not only did Prof. Rashkow have a lot of great insights into India's history, and cover a lot of interesting material in a clear way, I know this was his first time ever lecturing on the subject which is really impressive!"
9697,1316634,4.5,2.0,"I really enjoyed this class! I don't know what the last comment was talking about. Not only did Prof. Rashkow have a lot of great insights into India's history, and cover a lot of interesting material in a clear way, I know this was his first time ever lecturing on the subject which is really impressive!"
9698,1316634,1.0,3.0,"I honestly think this is the worst professor at UVA. Not only were the lectures painful to listen to (uhh, umm, excuse me...) I had no idea what he was talking about half the time even when I did the reading. He is extremely awkward and unorganized. I regret ever signing up for this course. Stay as far away from him and his classes as possible."
9699,1316634,2.5,4.0,"Despite the professor's interest in the subject matter, I found the class frustrating at times.  Lectures could be difficult to follow and I found the reading to be arduous.  My main frustration with the class was that it seemed like more work than the other 1501 classes I've heard about."
9700,1316634,2.5,2.0,"I had Ezra for a Postcolonial Theory class. He was extremely passionate about the subject matter and he grades pretty easily. However, there is a good amount of reading and it seems like he never actually gets what he is thinking out. So class can be a little stressful. Other than that, he's my favorite, and tries to make post-colonialism fun."
9701,1316634,2.5,2.0,"First class felt I'd jumped in the middle, of the course. The vocabulary that he uses, you really need to know the subject matter before hand to understand. Also he makes you keep a vocab book, and take a quiz on the words and make 5-10 speeches on the reading at the beginning of one of the classes, which is complicated."
9702,784160,5.0,1.0,Patricia Click is a great professor and has great personality. She is engaging during lecture and is available to offer help any time. She was very  helpful during my thesis in terms of suggesting approaches to and ideas to my topic. 
9703,784160,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors in the SEAS -- motivating and engaging -- you learn valuable critical thinking and master verbal / written communication skills -- she's the best!
9704,784160,5.0,3.0,"STS Civil War course: Great class, even better instructor!  Some thought the reading was too much, but not for me; it was very interesting material and the class was incredible! Take it take it take it!"
9705,784160,5.0,4.0,"Tough class, but so worth it! -- interesting course material, some reading, and thesis work.  Professor Click makes it all worthwhile; she's engaging and you have to take this class with her!!!"
9706,784160,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Click is an incredible instructor!  She's intelligent, motivating, and thought-provoking...great course!  Definitely take it...so few professors in the SEAS are as wonderful as she is!"
9707,784160,5.0,2.0,"Awesome teacher.  This was an STS Civil War class, very interesting.  A lot of reading and you have to keep a journal, but its not that bad.  Interesting in class discussions.  Papers not to bad, easily get a B."
9708,784160,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor!  By far, one of the best that I have had at UVA!  Definitely take her courses!"
9709,784160,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Click was a great teacher.  I liked having to keep a reading journal, instead of having daily quizzes.  I also enjoyed our class discussions.  I really wish she was teaching 402 in the spring.  Highly recommended!"
9710,1341225,4.0,3.0,No Comments
9711,2766658,5.0,5.0,"Very excellent professor, kind, patient, highly recommend!"
9712,2766658,5.0,2.0,Very good tutor. 
9713,2766658,5.0,3.0,Funny guy and knows the stuff he is teaching. Willing to help if you have questions. I love that he gives you all the answers for the ICPS/quizzes. Pretty flexible if you miss the HW or quizzes. 
9714,2766669,5.0,2.0,"I took her new class in a January term (2 weeks mid-winter break) and she was the SWEETEST professor--so understanding and patient, passionate about her topic which really shines through, and greets everyone with a smile. Her lectures could be a bit repetitive, but I still learned a lot each day. Easy A and an AWESOME PROFESSOR!!! TAKE HER!!"
9715,128854,4.0,4.0,"Maus is a fantastic teacher; albeit, she is a pretty hard teacher as well. The papers in the class are graded fairly hard, but the challenge is a positive factor in all respect. Maus directly gives you the meaning of everything in the play. The papers are also only five pages each. Overall, I highly recommend Maus. Very respected, enjoyed it a lot."
9716,128854,4.0,4.0,"Maus is an extremely intelligent Shakespeare scholar. Her lectures are organized like essays, and the final is pretty much regurgitating two of her arguments and some passage IDs. All of her lectures open up the plays and offer humorous critiques. She doesn't grade anything, so your TA REALLY matters--they can make or break you/your grade"
9717,128854,5.0,3.0,very good introduction to Shakespeare.
9718,128854,2.0,4.0,"not very good lectures, not that engaging. papers are toughly graded. would not take again"
9719,128854,5.0,2.0,"She's intelligent, funny, and enthusiastic about Shakespeare.  Her lectures are interesting and short; it's not unusual to get let out  early.  It's not essential to do all the reading because of SparkNotes, but you should because the plays are fun!  Put in a decent amount of effort and you'll do well.  You can find the plays for free online."
9720,128854,4.5,3.0,Really interesting seminar on Shakespeare's history plays. Great discussions.
9721,128854,4.5,3.0,great class
9722,128854,5.0,4.0,funny and wicked smart.
9723,128854,4.5,2.0,"Maus was a great lecturer and pointed out new ideas and themes that I would not have otherwise noticed. However, she has nothing to do with your success in this class. TAs grade everything. I really liked my TA but she graded very harshly on papers. My writing did improve. The final exam was pretty easy, its designed to help you more than hurt you."
9724,128854,5.0,3.0,Dr Maus is truly an amazing professor. She took my slight interest in Shakespeare and turned it into an obsession. My writing improved dramatically and my analyzation skills are now out of this world. You really cannot graduate without taking one of her classes!
9725,128854,4.5,3.0,"Truly amazing professor; one of the editors of the Norton Shakespeare, and it really shines through in her lectures. She's quirky, amusing and makes Shakespeare relateable and interesting. Grade-wise, one's success in this class has nothing to do with Maus, and attending lecture is entirely optional. A poor TA will ruin this class for you."
9726,128854,5.0,4.0,"Maus is an amazing lecturer: her critical interpretations are just amazing to watch. Going to class was absolutely thrilling. If you can take Shakespeare with her, do it. She's both amusingly witty and intensely intelligent."
9727,128854,5.0,3.0,"fascinating lectures; I had a great TA for discussion section, too."
9728,128854,5.0,3.0,"She is brillant and funny, you should go to class and write down the references that she makes in class, but try not to write essays through her point of view it is always nice to be original (as original as you can be). Take it if you have any interest in Shakespeare or take a small class taught by her becuase it will definitely be enjoyable."
9729,128854,5.0,2.0,"Wonderful class!  She is so much fun, so smart, and made Shakespeare come alive for me.  Go to lecture and write down all the passage references she ever mentions; study them, and they are basically all you need for the final.  And get a good TA!  My GPA is listing because of my TA, but I'm signed up for ENRN 322 anyway because of Maus."
9730,128854,2.5,3.0,"Very interested in the subject, and extremely knowledgable. Her lectures SEEM pointless, but they are not. Very crucial for the final exam.  However, your grade depends entirely on your TA. Your TA can destroy your grade, so be careful."
9731,128854,4.5,3.0,Incredible lecuturer.  Very interesting interpretations of Shakespeare.  She helped edit the Norton Anthologies so you know she's smart.  Funny and witty--I always loved going to class!!
9732,128854,4.0,3.0,"TAs do all the grading, so your grade depends on the TA you get.  Her lectures are clear and interesting for the most part.  Smart lady."
9733,128854,1.5,4.0,"She rarely talked about anything interesting or got beyond plot summary. While I learned a lot, it was through her secondary readings she assigned, which also were not dealt with in class. She came late, left early, and didn't seem to care about the class at all."
9734,128854,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed the lectures very much. However, my TA made taking this class a miserable experience. Make sure you get a good TA!"
9735,128854,3.5,2.0,"A great Shakespeare lecturer. Make sure you really enjoy the subject matter though, as her teaching style makes skipping class really easy. Be aware though, Finals could be killer that way. Otherwise, it's more important in her class to focus on getting a good T.A."
9736,128854,2.5,2.0,"Lectures are interesting but not really helpful.  I've stopped going entirely.  You can get an A in the class by simply studying by yourself.  Obviously, you shouldn't take this class if you don't like Shakespeare."
9737,128854,5.0,3.0,brilliant
9738,128854,4.0,2.0,Fairly boring lecturer. couldn't stay awake. and i liked shakespeare.
9739,128854,4.5,3.0,No Comments
9740,128854,5.0,2.0,"A great Shakespeare professor.  She WROTE the introductions to the plays in the Norton Shakespeare edition.  Lectures are amazing -- she makes Shakespeare seem contemporary, not a literature god."
9741,1709924,4.5,4.0,"Jason is really smart but he expects a ton from students. He is willing to go the extra mile but I donâ??t think he likes grade grubbers. If you take his race matters class, be prepared to work hard. Youâ??ll  learn a ton though."
9742,1333101,4.5,4.0,"Matt is a great teacher who takes interest in his students success, visiting office hours can be truthful because calculus can be confusing.  It is obvious he loves math and he wants his students to succeed and they usually do.  His grades usually turn out much better than other professors.  If possible take Calc from him!"
9743,1333101,5.0,3.0,Very easy to listen to and explained new material very clearly. I looked forward to coming to class.  Highly recommended.
9744,1333101,2.0,5.0,"Matt was not very helpful in class. He would go off on tangents and spend time explaining and proving things that didn't matter, rather than provide more examples. Homework was a joke, and tests were extremely hard compared to the work we did in class. Find another teacher unless you already know Calculus-(Took AB Calc in HS; was still difficult)"
9745,1333101,2.0,4.0,"Disliked this class with this instructor with a passion. His quizzes are okay and the tests are doable. His somewhat of a curve is a joke, because even if you are borderline, it won't help you at all, despite how many e-mails or office hour visits you seek for help. He was very insensitive to students' efforts. Avoid at all costs."
9746,1333101,4.5,2.0,Coming to this class was actually enjoyable. Matt is funny and his passion (could be an obsession) for math definitely rubs off on his students. BEST CALC TEACHER EVER!
9747,1333101,5.0,3.0,"Very helpful, very nice, approachable. Cutie. Class is very managable, not too hard but not easy or boring. Good for someone who has taken calc I in high school and wants a review. :]"
9748,6003,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor! His lectures were clear(he even bothered letting us know why and how the things he talking about are important). His _fleet_of TAs were very helpful. He taught relevant stuff and not arcane chemistry from 1999(cough demas). I wish they asked him to direct the undergrad curriculum(or maybe not, why bug him with petty bureaucracy?)"
9749,6003,4.5,4.0,Great Professor. Difficult class. Not sure it's worth taking it with Pate because second semester with Lehman is a nightmare.
9750,6003,4.0,4.0,"This course is very tough, but Pate manages to take that material and make it accessible.  He's great about getting things back on time, and makes himself available at all hours before an exam or problem set.  Great professor."
9751,6003,5.0,4.0,very helpful
9752,6003,5.0,3.0,Prof. Pate is extremely helpful and clear.  I can't think of anyone better suited to make sense of this complex field.

9754,604021,1.0,3.0,"I dread going to class. Prof sends homework at 7 or 8pm the night before a 9am class, and the syllabus is useless. Doesn't listen to feedback or emails and yells at you in class. Biggest regret is taking this class"
9755,604021,1.0,2.0,"Awful. Extremely condescending and shows major favoritism. Class was a complete joke. Learned absolutely nothing and was a complete waste of my time. She thinks her subject matter is important but literally could get an A without knowing anything. I took more serious classes in middle school, which is also how she treats her students."
9756,604021,5.0,3.0,"I loved phonetics with Prof. Saunders! Very interesting class and great professor! She tells you what to study, and if you study you will do well in the class. If you don't, you will not do well. She will correct your mistakes in order to help you. This is not personal , so I don't understand some of the negativity in a few of these reviews"
9757,604021,2.0,3.0,Wouldn't take this class again
9758,604021,3.5,1.0,Mme Saunders is adorable and very nice to those who show up on time and pronounce things well. The class was very easy if you studies for the tests. My accent improved a ton and the class was fun to attend. She is not clear when she will check the homework so always have it done just in case.
9759,604021,1.5,2.0,"She is painfully boring. The syllabus specifically stated it was &quot;not a lecture&quot; course, yet she talked about 85% of the time. Also, readings were lumped together for three weeks, so it was impossible to tell what should have been done for each day. She also refused to elaborate on the research project, directing us to the unclear syllabus."
9760,604021,1.0,5.0,"Very condescending teacher. She definitely chooses her favorites and it is very blatant. Tests are unfair and alike another post said, even if you're accent sucks, you can still get an 'A' in the class because it's all written. Furthermore, her exams were very long to the point that oftentimes, many students didn't. Avoid at all costs."
9761,604021,2.0,3.0,"she definitely knows what she's talking about, but she's very condescending and picks favorites.  it also seems that once she decides how you're doing in the class, that's it- you can't improve in her eyes."
9762,604021,2.5,3.0,"Horribly, horribly condescending teacher. extremely difficult to be around.BUT I actually learned A LOT. If you can possibly take phonetics from another teacher or avoid the class I would recommend it--though like i said, a lot of it stuck w/me. Its impossible to understand how a TEACHer could play favorites and ignore those who need help the most!"
9763,604021,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed phonetics, and she is really an expert in her field.  She doesn't pick on people, she just helps people correct accents.  She gives you all the necessary tools to correct your pronunciation at home on your own.  Grades fairly."
9764,604021,3.0,2.0,"Wanted to stab myself in the eye with a pencil every single lesson. She does pick on people, plays favorites, sends out emails with hw at 6PM the day before class, and makes you keep a journal (&#63;). Also, she grades &quot;holistically&quot; - essentially, once she determines your grade, it won't change regardless on your performance on tests."
9765,604021,1.5,4.0,"Worst professor I have ever had. Talks down to students and is not very approachable. Phonetics is a completely useless course. You'd think the tests would be more oral but most of the tests were written, so even if you had a terrible accent but were still able to memorize a few dumb rules then you'd still do well. Avoid this class at all costs."
9766,604021,4.5,2.0,"Hmmm, I think she's pretty prompt about e-mail.  She is very nice and helpful if you do the homework and show that you are interested.  In history of French, she doesn't really pick on people (don't know about phonetics, haven't taken it).  I really thought the class was fascinated and taught really well.  She knows her stuff."
9767,604021,3.5,2.0,"I thought this class was an easy A for anyone with French proficiency. The professor tells you exactly what is on the exam and there is minimal homework. The class time went by really fast for me. You really learn how to pronounce French correctly in this class, plus be able to pronounce words you don't know. I enjoyed it."
9768,604021,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this class unless you must. She will pick on certain people all the time, talks down to students, and is not helpful at all. Don't take this class if you also don't want to spend minimum 1 hour per day, 7 days per week on a computer program before you even start the rest of the homework."
9769,604021,2.5,1.0,"She definitely picks one person to destroy, but will treat the rest of the students fairly. The class itself was easy as long as you can handle her awkwardness-I've never heard anything like her phlegmy throat-clearing noise and it pretty much set off a wave of suppressed laughter each time it occured."
9770,604021,3.0,1.0,"Phonetics was interesting if you like to analyze and tear things apart, and you really do learn how to pronounce French correctly....the professor does not seem to understand what email is, I think she is technologically challenged.  She will put everyone on the spot so make sure to do the homework."
9771,604021,1.5,3.0,"I second that Saunders makes fun of students and plays favorites. Oh, does she play favorites. I was really interested in taking this class, however I hated going into class. If you were late, she would pick on you. Outside of class, she was not approachable and even talked down to me! **AVOID THIS CLASS!** You'll regret taking it."
9772,604021,4.0,4.0,"Gladys Saunders was fun.  I liked the material, and the book reinforced what we did in class.  Do your homework."
9773,604021,2.5,2.0,"I heart phonetics, in the way that memorization makes me want to gouge my eyes out with a burning fork.  Actually, it's pretty good once you get the hang of it.  You learn most of the stuff from a little purple book. Good times!"
9774,604021,1.5,1.0,"As my advisor and professor, she NEVER responds to emails or questions.  Makes many mistakes but expects perfection.  She also likes to make fun of kids who mess up and she constantly clears phlegm from her throat.  Easy class though."
9775,825207,5.0,4.0,Marcy is awesome. I never sewed in my life and she makes it fun and approachable. I wish she taught more classes!
9776,825207,5.0,3.0,SHE IS PERFECTION.  No one can compare to Marcy Linton.  She's the only reason I'm still at UVA!
9777,825207,5.0,3.0,Marcy is fricken SWEET
9778,825207,4.5,1.0,"Such an awesome, fun class! Marcy was sooo helpful with anything you needed. She'd go over a difficult step with you a couple times if you needed it, but she never did it for you so you could learn. I came into the class very late and she worked with me so I could catch up and I ended up finishing early. Take it if you have any interest in sewing."
9779,825207,5.0,3.0,marcy is SO PATIENT!  she is very kind and helpful and doesn't make students feel stupid for asking lots of questions.  she gives a lot of personal attention to everyone who needs it.  she's one of the best teachers i've ever had.  take her classes!
9780,825207,5.0,4.0,"very clear and helpful.  Marcy took something that is inherently difficult, simplifying terms into something comprehensible.  She encourages students not only to academically learn a subject, but also produce a beautiful product.  She is a great teacher and craftsperson.  I cannot recommend her enough.  Do yourself a favor - take all her classes."
9781,2094969,5.0,4.0,Great guy and good professor. Sometimes he goes a little fast but will explain further if you ask. Makes himself very accessible outside of class and communicates a lot with students so they know what's going on. Definitely recommend!
9782,2094969,4.0,3.0,Funny guy
9783,87938,5.0,4.0,"I took his 19th Century Russian Lit course, and honestly it might have been the best class I've taken at UVa. He's funny, articulate and really engages the class in wonderful discussions."
9784,87938,4.0,5.0,Russian is hard. Really hard. But Herman makes his classes fun and enjoyable and really a pleasure to go to. Pray for a good TA because your grade depends on it.
9785,87938,5.0,1.0,I cannot help sharing this comment: I heard Professor Herman?s lecture on Pushkin some fifteen years ago and I still remember that brilliant presentation.  Read Russian Literature and learn from the best.
9786,87938,5.0,3.0,"I took a ton of classes with Professor Herman, he is as helpful with language as he is with literature, and is an incredibly engaging lecturer who fully involves the class, from those who are just taking it for the non-western perspectives requirement, to those who spend their free time reading russian lit. I joined the major because of him."
9787,87938,4.5,4.0,My favorite professor ever.  Please do yourself a favor and take his class.  He is a genius and I love the way he speaks about Tolstoy as though he is a personal friend.  I truly loved everything about him and his class and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
9788,87938,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor! Has great insight on all the texts - you will learn a ton. Lectures are invaluable.
9789,87938,4.5,1.0,Great prof!  Everything he says about each text is so interesting and thought-out.  He's a fantastic lecturer.  Take a lit class with him!
9790,87938,4.0,3.0,Really really funny.  I usually didn't mind having to go to class on a Friday afternoon.  Readings are interesting; mostly short stories so diverse amount of texts.  Herman makes them all interesting.
9791,87938,5.0,2.0,"One of the only classes i have ever actually looked forward to going to.  Amazing lecture, very insightful but funny! Do yourself a favor and take any of his lit classes (in the language classes you only see him once a week)"
9792,87938,5.0,3.0,I graduated in '01 and he was by far my favorite professor at the university. Please do yourself a favor and take any class taught by Dr. Herman.
9793,87938,5.0,3.0,"one of the best classes i've taken, its very interesting and amusing and full of funny stories."
9794,87938,3.5,3.0,"Professor Herman is a great lecturer - BUT, the RUSS 201 course is designed so that you see him for 50 minutes per week, and the TA for 150. I too (as was said in another comment) went into 201 in love with Russian, but that has been killed through too much lecturing in English and vocab lists."
9795,87938,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher, fun guy. Knows his stuff. You will know Russian much much much much better after finishing his class."
9796,87938,5.0,3.0,Best class I have ever taken. Ever.
9797,87938,2.5,3.0,"I went into his class in love with Russian - the energy was sucked completely out of the material. Teaching style consisted of giving large quantities of vocabulary words, and giving quizzes on them."
9798,87938,5.0,3.0,"he is amazing, he inspired me to change minors after just one class with him. take any course he offers in russian lit. he is the best professor ive had so far"
9799,87938,5.0,3.0,"Every time from the minute he steps in the class, you will feel his energy immediately. He always loves his stuff, loves teaching, and his students. Most respectful professor ever and will definitely become #1 expert in the field of Slavic literature."
9800,87938,4.0,3.0,No Comments
9801,1210247,1.0,3.0,"This was a required course, as I was a Russian major and love Russian literature, but somehow John Lyles managed to make it miserable. Quite frankly he was a condescending know-it-all. When I went to see him during office hours, he talked down to me and the whole interaction struck me as very sexist. Ick"
9802,1210247,1.0,3.0,He's wrong half the time and his expectations are really unclear.
9803,1210247,4.5,4.0,"Very enthusiastic and passionate about Russian literature and inspires the same in students. He has a great sense of humor and is always willing to clarify on questions or issues. Tests and papers are fair. You need to go to class and do the readings to do well, but fortunately, they're always interesting."
9804,1537929,5.0,2.0,Native french speaker.  One of the few professors willing to also speak in English to help you comprehend a new grammar tool.  Very good for foreign language!
9805,1750922,3.0,3.0,She's very helpful when you go in for help or ask her questions. She does however give a lot of projects and group work. Her projects are only moderately interesting. She focuses pretty much just on systems engineering and the engineering design process for her intro to engr class.
9806,1750922,4.5,3.0,"I really like Professor Donohue. She is very encouraging and wants to see students do well. She is very clear about what is required for each assignment. Her class seems to be one that some people really hate while they are in the middle of it, but are often grateful for it later down the road."
9807,1750922,5.0,2.0,"She is the best teacher ever. The comments below are outdated and irrelevant. She is a kind-hearted, wonderful teacher that obviously loves the students. She does a great job with the material and does not give an excessive amount of writing. She just understands that real engineers have the ability to communicate, as well as build prototypes!!!"
9808,1750922,5.0,1.0,I don't know what everyone else is talking about but Susan Donohue is one of the kindest and most helpful professors I've ever had.
9809,1750922,1.0,4.0,"I have yet to understand the true purpose of this class. I was under the impression that the objective was to design a project, however, there is an unnecessary overemphasized focus on writing. During the final weeks of the semester, she finally starts freaking out over the project that no one's had the opportunity to focus on. Good luck."
9810,1750922,1.0,2.0,"If you love attending pointless lectures, doing busywork, hearing all about cats, and learning absolutely nothing then Susan Donohue's class was made for you."
9811,1750922,1.0,1.0,She is the worst teacher I have had in 13 years of schooling. She would make you think ENGR stands for English Grammar. She makes you do about 20 presentations with little design work. She will care more about a title not being centered than the actual material. She will spend 1/3rd of every week going over the schedule and do nothing else.
9812,841619,1.0,5.0,Terrible dean. I almost couldn't walk because he told me I could take a class during the summer session after my fourth year. Didn't think it was important to also mention that doing that meant I couldn't walk for graduation until the NEXT Final Ceremonies in 2012. Negligent and unconcerned with whats best for students.
9813,841619,1.0,4.0,He is the worst dean.He doesn't regard students as important. Students are goods to him.Don't repeat WILL BARROW's tragedy over.
9814,841619,4.5,4.0,Dean Papovich is one of my favorite professors at the University. The small class got really into the topic by the middle of the semester. His passion for it shows. The class was by no means easy but worthwhile. Go to his office hours. He is so interesting and connects with his students. I would love to take another class with him!
9815,841619,4.0,3.0,"I had Dean Papovich for Native American Lit. He tends to talk quite a bit, but is worth listening to because it is such a nebulous subject. Overall the class proved to be phenomenally interesting, and definitely worth taking, and not especially pedantic in terms of workload (everything was a small paper, large paper, or presentation)"
9816,391059,4.5,2.0,"Savage is a pretty dry lecturer, but he gets the material across clearly and is nice enough.  If you don't work, he won't like you.  If you do work, he will.  I would take PLCP 522-Comparative Budgeting for the content (which is very pragmatic, very useful), not for Savage.  Not a difficult class though."
9817,391059,4.5,4.0,"He definitely made the coursework interesting. He can be hilarious, but also disparaging towards students at times. It's pretty easy for a 500-level class, but you still get a lot out of it."
9818,391059,4.0,2.0,He really knows his stuff and he seems like kind of a big deal. If you're not interested in this stuff it will be boring though. I don't do the readings and it doesn't make a difference. Really nice and accessible guy though.
9819,391059,1.0,5.0,Quizzes are impossible. Class is terribly boring and unclear. Assignments are pointless. Take another class. VERY UNFAIR GRADER.
9820,391059,1.0,5.0,"incomprehensible. Don't take, your GPA will be thankful."
9821,391059,3.5,3.0,"This class was very technical and so it was difficult to understand readings/lectures. Savage does a good job of simplifying material, but it is still difficult to complete assingments such as the midterm, final etc. Lectures can be interesting - if you are interested in budgeting and/or Congressional procedures. Be prepared to do a lot of reading."
9822,391059,2.0,5.0,"THIS CLASS IS AWFUL. The lectures make no sense at all, and are just painful. The midterm is a take home but it might as well be in-class because it is IMPOSSIBLE. The terms quizzes are also RIDICULOUSLY impossible. Two news articles w/ summaries are due each week. They get to be pretty pointless."
9823,391059,4.5,3.0,"Had him in budgeting and as a thesis advisor.  Knows his content really well and really wants students to like it too.  A little hard to get to know, but if you go to his office hours, he's extremely helpful."
9824,391059,4.5,1.0,"Having taken this course a while ago I have only begun to appreciate how excellent this course is. Interesting interpretation of materials, which are themselves interesting if you are interested in pol. history, plus straightforward assignments. And he doesn't talk too much or make things needlessly difficult."
9825,391059,5.0,3.0,Prof. Savage is no savage - he's a nice guy who cares that students actually learn.  I took his class pass/fail and regreted it because I got an A.
9826,391059,3.0,1.0,"Not a very interesting lecturer.  (The best day in class was when he showed us a video!)  Not a very nice or pleasant person.  Avoid his office hours.  One saving fact = easy grader.  So if you don't mind bad lectures and an uncool prof., you can take the class for an easy A."
9827,391059,1.0,3.0,sad person to be around
9828,391059,4.5,4.0,"savage has been an excellent advisor for me. he does not take BS; if you do your work and are dedicated and concise, he is extremely helpful and friendly."
9829,391059,1.0,5.0,"I had him as an advisor.  Biggest ****bag I've ever met, seriously.  Wouldn't shake my hand when I met him, told me to take &quot;real classes&quot; that &quot;real, normal government majors&quot; take, even though I'm a premed.  Told me to get the hell out of his office.  Generally doesn't care.  Avoid him, really."
9830,391059,3.0,3.0,"Lectures were boring, but I only took the class because it was required."
9831,391059,3.0,2.0,"he's very caring, its just sometimes difficult to understand what he's looking for.  if you do your work, you'll be fine."
9832,1185685,5.0,2.0,"Mark Parker is an amazing lecturer. His powerpoints, sample problems and overall understanding of the topic allowed us to apply what we learned in lecture to sample problems and real life. He makes it entertaining, while basically teaching us what is important in a straightforward manner. Definitely worthwhile course!!"
9833,1185685,5.0,2.0,"Mark is extremely straightforward, helpful, and intelligent. He will help you with almost anything and clarify it for you. No troubles on getting a good grade or falling asleep in lecture. His lectures are crucial because he covers so much in such a short time, but you will leave the lecture enlightened and ready for a test."
9834,432024,2.0,4.0,"First few weeks of the class i thought it was going to be easy, but it turned out to be the most unorganized class. I didn't get a grade back since mid october. I have no idea how i got my final grade. Its as if he just made it up and gave everybody a B. Don't take if you care about having a high GPA."
9835,432024,2.5,4.0,"Does not make plans for class, and as such is highly tangential, never covers all of what he intends to, and quickly and consistently loses the students' interest. Fully 80% of the kids in my class spent the whole time browsing fb. That said, a very nice guy in person and a truly passionate wonk about his subject-just not meant to be a teacher."
9836,432024,4.5,4.0,"There was a huge amount of reading, which was hard to keep up with. Besides that, though, I really liked the class! His lectures were interesting, thought provoking, and he loved to engage the students in discussion. My only class where I didn't miss a single lecture."
9837,432024,2.0,5.0,Do not take this professor...ridiculous amount of reading assigments...and don't even think of writing a paper that displays any sort of thinking out of line with his favorites...stay clear. only 2 A-'s in the class.
9838,432024,4.5,4.0,Very smart guy; strikes a great balance in class between lecture and discussion.  Only caveat is he tends to get behind in reading- I've had times where we'll be doing something in class that I hadn't read in a week and a half.  Great sense of humor and very approachable- I've had some excellent discussions with him during office hours.  Very good.
9839,432024,5.0,1.0,"how antiquated is the idea of asking uber-abstract questions about political theory in class and letting 10 people trying to find the intricate answer he's looking for to the expanse of wasting 1/2 of your paid time. And guess what, he's looking for those answers in your papers as weel, which is why only 1 guy could hardly get an A-. Don't take it"
9840,432024,3.5,4.0,"Nice and helpful, but his lectures can be boring at times. Not very good at engaging the students."
9841,432024,1.0,5.0,"i agree with the 1st, he was awful. his ppts were long and full of quotes that he would just read excitedly, then he didn't give enough time to copy. he wants you to read more than is humanly possible. he'd ask a question and fish for an excruciatingly long time for the answer that he wants, because his opinion is the only valid one. don't take him"
9842,432024,1.5,5.0,"The worst professor I've had yet at UVa.  I found his lectures, all of which are driven by powerpoint, to be disjointed and utterly disengaging.  He assigns an impossible load of very dense reading for each class, yet almost never takes the time to go over any of the material.  I would strongly discourage anyone from taking a course taught by him."
9843,432024,4.5,3.0,Super smart.  Super good in office hours and one on one.  Go talk to him if you have trouble in class or don't get some things.  Bad things: he is often late and class sometimes goes over.  A story floating around is once he went an hour over talking about Marx.  I believe it.  I've been in his class when it went 30 minutes over.  You learn alot!
9844,432024,4.0,5.0,SO helpful. gives the most detailed comments on papers and presentations. very interested in South Asia. has interesting stories about the region. is super abreast with the current affairs in the area.
9845,997276,4.0,2.0,He's alright. He's straightforward and clear about the material but he doesn't make it terribly interesting. After the second test I started attending the 1110 lecture to get a taste of what Sherriff was like. It's a whole new ballgame. Class with Gurumurthi seemed to drag on but class with Sherriff flew by even though we often go out early in 1111
9846,997276,4.0,4.0,"He's a dry lecturer, but I still really enjoyed the class.  The material is interesting and if you can make yourself listen to him you'll find yourself enjoying it.  He gave two projects that were difficult but rewarding -- you learned a lot & he graded leniently if it was clear you tried hard.  Good slides, straightforward exams."
9847,2242462,3.0,1.0,"Rebecca's lectures are dry and boring. She mainly reads off of powerpoints that are posted online before class and works through some practice problems with the class. While the class is boring and hard to sit through, she is sooo knowledgable about statistics. She is very smart, this class is just too easy to be interesting."
9848,2242462,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Hehn is really nice, sweet, and good at explaining things. Office hours are helpful and there isn't much hw, just WebAssign each week and lab. A lot of the practice must be done on your own but the exams are similar to the practice problems done in class, more so than the practice exam. She's enthusiastic but students aren't. I recommend her!"
9849,2242462,3.0,3.0,I dont want to be more specific.
9850,882597,5.0,3.0,"Professor Lascurettes is an amazing teacher. He is clear, efficient, and really knowledgeable about his classes. Every class is highly structured, and as long as you show up, you learn!! Take his class! (This is at GW)"
9851,882597,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed his class but he would make his tests to be so tricky. The fact that his tests were so tricky didn't make his class so great, but I did learn A LOT, and he was a lot of fun."
9852,1947566,5.0,4.0,"This class is absolutely fantastic and was my favorite course this semester!!! Prof. Pompano is wonderful and does a fantastic job in relating real-world scenarios through her inquiry labs. The TA's can be hit or miss, but you won't do badly if yours isn't great because the grading is standardized for all TA's. To succeed: KNOW THE ACS GUIDELINES!"
9853,1947566,1.0,4.0,"Lab reports are entirely too picky, and they treat you as if you know nothing, as any facts inputted into lab report HAS to be backed by a source.  Grade depends on TA."
9854,1947566,4.5,4.0,"Before you even write your first lab report for lab, go to her office hours; Prof. Pompano is really nice and wants to help, and going to her will save your ass for the rest of the semester. Go to lecture for occasional in-class assignments. Pre-lab and report rubrics are impossible to predict and lab requires actual work. Grades depend on your TA."
9855,2668465,2.0,1.0,He missed my one on one meeting with him. Very disappointed in this. He also made me run.
9856,2168753,4.0,4.0,"Pease is an engaging professor. Class goes by quickly, and the course material is definitely helpful.   She's really specific with what she wants, and gives a lot of feedback. The unit plan has a lot of steps that will drive you insane. You have to hyper-plan, and sometimes the general methods and your content area have conflicting ideal approaches"
9857,2078650,5.0,4.0,"Great TA, really invested in students' success, gave good feedback- would definitely take another course with her."
9858,2078650,5.0,4.0,"Christian has a very deep understanding and appreciation for European literature, and her passion overflows into her discussion sections. The feedback she gave on essays was extremely helpful for me and helped me become a better writer. She is a tough, but fair grader, and she truly cares about the success of her students. Highly recommended!"
9859,2078650,5.0,3.0,Superlatives I would use to describe her are knowledgeable and passionate for CPLT. She gives constructive feedback on essays which is great because improvement is rewarded in this class - good incentive for hard work. Christian's lectures in discussion were vital for clarification of the texts! It was a true pleasure to have such a fantastic TA.
9860,2078650,5.0,3.0,"Christian Howard taught a discussion section for European Literature this fall, and she is excellent at explaining things. She is understanding, a fair grader, and works hard to help her students succeed. I would highly recommend taking a class with her."
9861,2078650,4.0,3.0,"Professor Howard was extremely helpful throughout the course of taking this class.  She is very knowledgeable, and has a lot of interesting ideas about the texts.  Conversation during discussions is very beneficial.  She also gives out a final review, and grades all your papers, so she's an important person to listen to"
9862,2078650,5.0,3.0,Christian was an amazing TA. I became a much better writer due to her feedback on my papers. The actual professor was really pretty terrible at teaching and Christian made up for it by being awesome.
9863,2078650,5.0,4.0,"When the dismal lectures seemed almost impossible to comprehend, Christian cleared the way for understanding. She is intelligible on every topic and gives great insight to discussions. While she's a tough grader, she gives very constructive criticism. I owe any and all success to her as my TA because I would've essentially failed without her."
9864,2078650,5.0,4.0,She made some pretty impossible lectures comprehensible as my TA. Bit of a tough grader but I definitely got better as the semester went on. Made discussions interesting. Definitely recommend.
9865,2078650,5.0,4.0,I really enjoyed having Christian as my TA for my comparative literature class. She always clarified any questions we had from lectures and was very enthusiastic and caring. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her or choosing her as your TA!
9866,2078650,4.0,3.0,"read aloud every single paper she handed out... which was fine, just super annoying and time consuming."
9867,2078650,5.0,2.0,"Christian is a fair grader, very approachable and very nice. Definitely would recommend taking her class."
9868,2078650,5.0,3.0,"I truly enjoyed this class. Christian Howard is a great teacher who will always be available to answer questions on anything. I recommend this class to anyone who has to take a writing requirement. Her grading is very fair, as she tells you in advance what she expects to see in your writing."
9869,2078650,4.5,3.0,"This class was not what I was expecting (reading literature and analyzing psychotic characters, etc.), but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. We looked at the various approaches to and portrayals of 'madness' across all genres of film, story, and art. Good class, wonderful teacher-always ready to help and give feedback."
9870,2078650,4.0,2.0,"Christian Howard was an incredible ENWR professor. While a fair but tough grader, she aims to make you a better writer and help you improve your skill with each paper.  An outstanding class all around; she created a wonderful and fun atmosphere. Highly recommended. "
9871,2078650,4.5,4.0,"Christian is a great teacher! She's a tough grader sometimes, but very fair. She is also very knowledgeable about the topics she teaches, which makes the class more interesting and inviting.  "
9872,2078650,4.5,3.0,"Christian is a fantastic teacher with lots of knowledge about various topics. I would highly recommend taking a class with her if you are at all interested in the topic, I know that I would take her again if I could."
9873,2635713,3.0,1.0,"He was a really nice guy and gave us lots of support during the COVID semester. However, he is currently two months late on submitting our final grades for the class, which is rather frustrating."
9874,2635713,5.0,1.0,He is a really nice guy who was very accomodating during the COVID semester. I would recommend his class because it gives you a good dive into thinking about aesthetics and relationships.
9875,1333189,4.0,3.0,"I thought Professor Bradshaw was very good at explaining calculus concepts. I took Calc in high school but not the AP, so it was a really easy A for me, but he really solidified the logic of things I had just memorized before. He uses lots of examples."
9876,1333189,2.5,3.0,had him for math 184 he's HOT but if you miss class.. good luck haha he goes by material really fast his tests are tough but if you study/get a tutor it should be fine confuses himself sometimes but its usually corrected 
9877,1333189,3.0,3.0,"Goes fast, tricky quizzes. His lectures do go by quickly though, and he does not waste time. Goes over lots of examples."
9878,1333189,2.5,4.0,"I had him at the University of British Columbia (where he teaches now) for Math184 and he's a nice and funny guy and all, just does not go over material well. More practice and clarification is needed, and tends to go really fast. Midterms are brutal, and you basically have to teach yourself the course or get a tutor."
9879,1333189,4.0,3.0,Good grad student to take applied calc with. must attend lectures or it's easy to be lost!
9880,1333189,3.5,4.0,"Very good at teaching the materials. I would go with Bradshaw again if I had the choice of taking calculus again. He can confuse himself quite often but he always go back and corrects himself. Quizzes are fair - you study, awesome. you don't, yeah. Definitely worth having him for calculus than any other grad student at uva math dept."
9881,1046469,5.0,3.0,"Take her for ANY psych class!  I have now taken her for four of my psychology classes, mainly higher level ones and gotten borderline As in every single one! Attendance is extra credit, so by the end of the semester, if you went to all classes, you would receive a free 100 point test grade. Tests come straight from powerpoint notes that she posts!"
9882,1046469,4.0,3.0,"Easy teacher test reviews can be confusing because most of it is not on the test , but she's really interesting and gives a lot of extra credit."
9883,1046469,5.0,3.0,"Verny nice, Best Psych teacher that I have had yet at Radford. Very Helpful gives a lot of pop quizzes however tons of extra credit. Would highly recommend. She seems to know what she is talking about and teaches well. Really liked her!!! Oh and go to class she offers a make up exam at the end. "
9884,1046469,4.0,4.0,"she's nice but really picky and prissy. She shows dogs, so that should give you an idea of what she's like"
9885,1521622,5.0,1.0,"I LOVE THIS CLASS!!! Hettema is super cool, funny and very understanding. She really wants everyone to do well in her class and actually learn things. The tests were easy and for the most part, I enjoyed the lectures. She showed some interesting videos and was a really great professor."
9886,276445,5.0,3.0,"I love this woman. Looking back I recognize the class was challenging, but at the time it didn't feel like work at all! I would take any class she's teaching."
9887,276445,5.0,3.0,"SPLENDID!! One of the kindest and most brilliant (but also humble) professors I've had. I learned SO much from her and our class discussions were amazing. Every little comment she makes is something meaningful and eye-opening, and though she has so much to teach us, she's wonderful about letting students share all their ideas. Take her class!!!"
9888,276445,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite profs (and people) ever - brilliant, engaging, encouraging, and ultimately the reason why I became an English major.  The sheer volume of several of the books we read (900+ pages) is enough to knock somebody unconscious, which wasn't always easy, but it's worth it."
9889,276445,5.0,3.0,"honestly the sweetest woman in the world. very knowledgeable about Victorian literature, great discussion leader. good at making small ideas into big abstractions about the work as a whole. there's a TON of reading (almost impossible to do it all), so only take the class if you have a very small workload. she's approachable and a great prof, though"
9890,276445,5.0,3.0,She's really sweet and loves what she teaches.  She even brought us breakfast one time.  There's a lot of reading but it's definitely worth it.
9891,276445,5.0,3.0,"She's AWESOME. Adorable, brilliant, enthusiastic. She loves teaching, and she loves learning. There's no one better."
9892,276445,5.0,3.0,"wonderful prof and such a sweet person!  brilliant, yet approachable.  one of my favs!"
9893,276445,5.0,3.0,"Incredible lectures! On the last day of both courses I took, students spontaneously stood to applaud."
9894,1652704,5.0,3.0,By far my favorite professor at UVA.  Not only does he care about his students in their academics but he genuinely cares about us as people as well.  His unique style of teaching without tests or quizzes helps the information stick.  Such an animated and kind person- makes Hebrew fun.  Definitely recommend to anyone- no prior experience necessary!
9895,1652704,5.0,4.0,Zvi is the most dedicated and brilliant teacher you will ever have the pleasure of working with. After being exposed to Zvi's teaching style I can honestly say that is unlike anything else and is the most effective method you will ever be exposed to. Besides his amazing teaching he is a genuinely nice person. ?? ?????!
9896,1652704,5.0,2.0,"Very good teacher. His grading method (No formal tests/quizzes, grade is based on progress) takes the stress out of the class, but you still will have a lot of work."
9897,1652704,4.5,4.0,"Zvi is very focused on his method of teaching.  He is a very holistic teacher, emphasizing that you practice the language often.  Don't know about his grading but he really wants you to learn the language!  Focuses on learning songs, writing compositions, and grammar.  Lord does he love grammar.  This class is tough but very good if you want hebrew"
9898,169957,5.0,4.0,I was a bioethics Minor at UVa way back in the day.  Professor Arras was my mentor.  He uses a makeshift textbook to teach his material.  Extremely cerebral/brainy -- very nice man with a great heart.  6 yrs later and I still keep in touch with him!
9899,169957,5.0,2.0,Do yourself a favor and take a class with Professor Arras. He is incredibly intelligent and keeps students engaged. What you learn and how you learn it are unique to his classes---you are really missing out on something if you don't fight to get into one of his classes!
9900,169957,5.0,5.0,Professor Arras is the best professor at UVa.
9901,169957,4.5,5.0,"I've had Arras for both Research Ethics and his seminar on Global Justice. Each is fantastic. I learned a great deal and he made the material so incredibly interesting. Even if you're not majoring/minoring in these specifics topics, the material is applicable to just about any field. He's not exactly the easiest grader but his classes are worth it."
9902,169957,4.0,4.0,"I've taken both his Death and Dying 100-level and Justice and Healthcare 300-level. Both courses are excellent.  He's the best philosophy professor I've encountered and probably one of the better professors in the college.  He's extremely witty and not afraid to express his own opinions, yet for our small discussion-based course he welcomed debate."
9903,169957,5.0,3.0,splendid
9904,169957,5.0,3.0,"He'll give you some of the most entertaining lines you'll ever hear.  &quot;Leon Cass doesn't believe in the identity problem...he thinks it's just a bunch of philosophers in a circle jerk.&quot;     And aside from the entertainment value (more importantly), he's an amazing professor.  Down to earth, KNOWS what he's talking about.  TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM!!!!!"
9905,169957,5.0,3.0,the old fart's still got it
9906,169957,5.0,2.0,An excellent professor.  Clear and interesting lectures and extremely aproachable and helpful outside of class.

9916,276454,5.0,2.0,"Wonderful Professor! Will challenge you, but is more than willing to help work through readings and concepts. One of the best professors I've had at UVA."
9917,276454,3.5,2.0,"I loved her as a teacher. She definitely helped me learn and was able to meet with students at any time. In class time was not hard, you just had to keep up with readings here and there. The one thing I will say, is that her essay topics were very ambiguous and unclear."
9918,276454,1.0,4.0,Deborah McDowell ruined my life. She'll put on a good face one on one but she'll torpedo you behind your back. She's vindictive and conniving and I rue the day I met her. The best thing you can do is stay away from her. Please don't trust her self-presentations. Please watch your back. You've been warned.
9919,276454,1.0,2.0,"The worst professor I have had at UVa. Class planning was sloppy,we were weeks behind the syllabus. In lectures, she uses (often incorrectly)esoteric language which bogs down any sort of message or theme. Essay grading seemed arbitrary, w/ few explanations.Take this class if you want an easy 300 level course, not if you want to learn or be inspired"
9920,276454,2.5,3.0,She was hilarious in a sarcastic sense! Her teaching style is slightly offensive and she asks a lot in terms of class participation.  Beware of her unorganized manner--she gets off the syllabus and no one really knows what book is being read/discussed after awhile. She also keeps class late almost every time.
9921,276454,4.0,2.0,"She is very interested in intellectually challenging students to think critically.  She asks a lot of probing questions, and expects students to come to the class prepared to actively participate. She can be a hard grader, but only in the interest of making you a better student.  She is very funny at times, and comes across as a REAL person."
9922,276454,2.0,3.0,"I cannot stand this woman.  I didn't like her class and learned absolutely nothing from it...NOTHING!  It was like watching grass grow for an hour and a half, not to mention the fact that all the novels we read had the same theme."
9923,276454,3.5,2.0,"i loved her. she was very flexbile and encouraging. i recommend her to everyone, and would definitely take a class with her again. she assigns a ton and then ends up actually doing half of it."
9924,276454,4.0,3.0,"Very helpful, intellectually stimulating.  Promotes free thought/discussion.  Engaging, eloquent speaker.  Tough grader, but fair and thought-provoking.  Warm, personable, humorous, cares about her students."
9925,276454,1.5,5.0,"Major chip on shoulder, insecure, moody & actively hostile, especially to those who dare to ask questions. OK to audit; otherwise avoid."
9926,1341417,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Costa is very helpful and very clear with assignments. This was online class, quizzes were optional. Four main grades included 2 exams and 2 research type papers. Exams were also papers (only 5 paragraphs per question - 2 questions per exam). Great teacher to take online."
9927,1521644,4.5,3.0,"She's a great TA! Really friendly and approachable. If you're like me and don't like to talk much during discussions, she tries to help by offering you an opportunity to receive extra credit points. She's working towards becoming a professor!"
9928,2619396,5.0,3.0,"Kim is an EXCEPTIONAL professor -- take literally any of her classes and you won't be disappointed! She truly cares about all of her students, and is so smart and teaches her courses in a respectful and easy to understand way."
9929,2619396,5.0,4.0,"Excellent, educated professor who gives lectures that make you think. Learned so much from her."
9930,1890316,3.0,4.0,"Socolovsky himself is a funny guy, he is just confusing when he teaches. A lot of the content I had to clarify myself because his explanations were inadequate. Midterms weren't bad but the final... that was a lil rough."
9931,1890316,4.0,3.0,"Dr. S is a great professor. However, you need to be prepared to read the section before class or else you won't understand what is happening in class. He briefly goes over the section and then we work as a class on a worksheet pertaining to that section of the chapter."
9932,1890316,5.0,3.0,"I was worried to take his class b/c everyone complained about him, but I love Socolovsky. He's funny, patient, and receptive to student suggestions. He's extremely transparent about what's going on in class and will help you through quizzes and group works. He genuinely wants you to succeed, and will match your effort. If you try hard, so will he."
9933,1890316,2.0,4.0,"Professor Socolovsky was not the world's greatest lecturer. So, instead of teaching the subject matter, he goes through practice problems. Every. Single. Day. Be ready to teach yourself the information, or be a regular attendee at his office hours. Socolovsky's one saving grace is his office hours, where he is actually an efficient teacher."
9934,1890316,1.0,4.0,"Dr. S is a nice man. However, his incompetence in teaching, especially at such a renowned university is appalling. He consistently shows up significantly late to a 50 minute class. Does not effectively teach any principles in class. His tests are very hard, as would be expected in calc 3, but he does not prepare you for them."
9935,1890316,1.0,4.0,"He is bad at teaching the material, and the weekly quizzes are not based on what he teaches."
9936,1890316,4.0,3.0,"This professor gets a bad rap, but it seems that people generally not willing to listen enough. You WILL have to read the section before class (which he encourages), which I think some don't understand. He may be a bit hard to understand for some, but is always willing to help you out during office hours. He's super nice and wants you to succeed."
9937,1890316,1.0,4.0,"I had Socolovsky for Calc III or APMA 2120. He is not good at teaching. If you take his class, I recommend not going to class if you don't have to, because he will just make you more confused. Instead, you should spend that time either teaching yourself the material, or, better yet, going to any other teacher and sitting in his/her class."
9938,1890316,1.0,4.0,"When people ask me who my Calc 2 professor is, I say myself. Socolovsky is the most incompetent educator I've ever met and it feels like Eddy and I are learning it together. I've had to teach myself the entire course."
9939,1890316,1.0,4.0,"He was very nice and really interesting to talk to outside of class, but in class, he was impossible to follow. He had difficulty understanding what you didn't understand and made the whole process very similar to pulling teeth."
9940,1890316,1.0,4.0,"Socolovsky is the worst professor I've ever had. His lectures are incredibly scatterbrained and confusing because he has no idea how to teach, and he's always ten minutes late to our 50 minutes class because the printer never works. Trust me if you don't know how to teach yourself hard calculus II, do not take this class. Go to calc III if you can."
9941,1890316,1.0,5.0,"Socolovsky doesn't really teach at all. If you can teach yourself math go for it, but if you need a good professor then take your class with someone else."
9942,1890316,2.0,3.0,I had him for Differential Equations and will say he is extremely intelligent but very bad a teaching a class. His lectures consisted him reading the notes aloud while I tried to decipher them before he finished reading the page and moved on. I don't recommend him since you will learn nothing from him and have to teach yourself everything.
9943,1890316,1.0,4.0,"The absolute worst. His lectures are unbearable and impossible to follow and to understand. His office hours are not any different either. While Calc 2 is not a hard class, if you don't talk to TAs or do work outside of the class, you will not learn a thing.  If at all possible, DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES."
9944,1890316,1.0,3.0,"Can not make it through one example in class. He always made mistakes and would never fix them. He could not answer any question in class. He is in his own world and is a tough grader. A large piece of me died in this class. Dont make the mistake I made, if you have BC Calc credit, take it!"
9945,1890316,2.0,4.0,"Dr. S is a very kind man, however attending class was more of a detriment than an aid. Had to reteach myself most of the material outside of class."
9946,1890316,2.0,3.0,"Dr. S as we call him would be a wonderful Grandfather.  He is cheerful, funny, and quirky and going fishing with him would be a blast.  However, when it come to teaching math Dr. S just does not fill the part.  His lectures are scatter brained - jumping from topic to topic in no reasonable manner.  Things got better when he began to use powerpoints"
9947,1890316,1.5,3.0,lectures are so boring. He is all over the place and doesn't explain any one thing but just mentions different concepts. He is a very nice guy but just doens't make sense
9948,1890316,3.0,1.0,"Eduardo means very well a lot of the time, and is actually a halfway decent lecturer, but he just is totally disorganized sometimes. The class is not much work (he forgets to assign homework) and it's fairly easy. WOULD RECOMMEND 8.5/10"
9949,743440,4.0,1.0,"This class is a joke, I still don't get why we were required to take it, I got nothing out of it. Berger is a cool guy but I'm not sure he knows what hes supposed to lecture about. No text, if you do the final project you get an A, simple as that. Take his section and get an easy start to a not so easy E-school career"
9950,743440,5.0,3.0,LOVE Prof Berger!!! he is so nice and gets to know his students which i appreciated.  definitely my favorite teacher and i have signed up for every class of his i could possibly take.
9951,743440,5.0,2.0,"Such a nice guy! He's def top 3 in the eschool, the fact that he was promoted to Dean proves this.  He goes out of his way to create resources for students so use them (online solutions, video solutions, blog, etc.) He's very approachable and knows his stuff do NOT be afraid to go to his office hrs. Take ANY class he offers he's hard to get!"
9952,743440,4.5,3.0,"My favorite professor at UVA.  He does a fantastic job of explaining really hard concepts, and his class averages are proof of that.  He can be slow to return assignments, but he is very helpful during office hours and his supplemental materials (class blog, video solutions, lecture podcast) got me through a ton of tricky problem sets."
9953,743440,5.0,3.0,"He explains problems very well, and helps students with online notes and even podcasts of problem solutions.  He's also a very nice guy in person."

9955,399377,4.5,5.0,"O'Connell is a thermo legend.  Lectures are conceptual, reading is more in depth, and homework is calculation intensive.  Tests are hard.  Class is a giant pain, but doable.  If you're confused, hit up J-POC and he'll help you out...but only if you're putting forth an effort.  Textbook. Absolutely. Sucks."
9956,399377,4.5,5.0,"JPO expects alot of you. There is no free lunch. You are responsible for understanding even derivations. Easily one of the hardest classes at UVA. If you are mature (and actually know math) and respectable, JPO will help you as long as you have the time. Can't waste his. Very fair. Prepare yourself to enter a new phase in your academic career."
9957,399377,2.0,4.0,"nice guy, but teaches concept instead of applications. the workshops are so pointless and the homework is really hard."
9958,399377,1.0,5.0,"Honestly giving this man zeros is to high, he is honestly the worst teacher I have ever had.  I actually contemplated suicide to escape, hell seemed more bearable."
9959,399377,1.0,5.0,"He assumes that you already understand the material and goes from there. His lectures consist of incomprehensible equations that are put up with no context whatsoever. If you ask him a question, he will either give a vague response or ridicule you. One time when I asked him what a very technical term meant, his response was &quot;Why don't you know&#63;&quot;"
9960,399377,4.0,3.0,O'Connell is an awesome guy.
9961,399377,1.0,5.0,"WORST THERMO CLASS EVER...BOOK SUCKS, LECTURES SUCK, TESTS SUCK...all around bad class."
9962,399377,1.0,5.0,"This class is one of the hardest ever, but not because of the material.  He doesn't teach, book sucks, hw sucks.  Bend over, its going to be a rough ride."
9963,399377,1.0,2.0,"Wow. Stay away if possible. This class was designed for kindergarten kids. Gives classwork such as &quot;Kick your Bad Habit&quot; or &quot;Learn to Manage Your Time&quot;. Makes those who ask questions feel stupid and totally avoids clear answers. Take another ENGR workshop, if possible."
9964,399377,1.0,4.0,"OMG, this guy is crazy.  When you ask a question in class, he ends up making you feel stupid.  And that textbook has got to go.  Not helpful at all, especially for the insane problems at the end of each chapter"
9965,399377,2.0,5.0,"This class has to be one of the worst thermodynamics courses at any university anywhere.  While the teacher is generally caring and understanding, he spends all sorts of time giving us &quot;learning skills&quot; tests and speaking in vague, nonsensical g"
9966,1144865,5.0,3.0,"Tim is the best Calc2 instructor ever. Unfortunately, he's leaving here...'cause he's got the PhD!! Tim is so awesome!! I'm really sad that he's not gonna teach Calc3..."
9967,1144865,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. Funny and helpful. Extremely patient with students.
9968,1144865,5.0,4.0,"Tim is a really good professor and will help you with whatever you need help with. Class gets harder as the semester goes on so it's almost necessary to go to his office hours. Yet, if you just go and make sure to do the work, you'll be fine. Very fun professor, uses awesome words like sweet, groovy, and fun examples."
9969,1144865,5.0,3.0,"Tim is the NICEST guy you'll meet in the math department. He will go over things 500 times without getting impatient at all. If you go to office hours and do the homework, you'll be fine on the quizzes and tests. Him and his wife baked cookies on the day of our exam. Take his class!"
9970,1144865,4.5,4.0,"Tim rules.  He's really into what he's teaching, and really wants his students to be into it too, so he's super clear and tries to crack jokes which go over well sometimes.  &quot;OH okay&quot; &quot;BAAAD&quot; and &quot;Groovy&quot; pop up in my notes quite a bit.  Go to office hours, seriously.  And he's pretty hot for a nerd..I'm always like &quot;Just keep teaching me math!!&quot;"
9971,1144865,5.0,2.0,"Tim is by far the best calc teacher you could have in the 120's series of calc. The written homework is the hardest part of the course. The thing I don't like is that he didnt curve like other calc teachers. But its because everyone does well on the exams. You learn a lot compared to other sections. And go to office hours, he; really helpful."
9972,1144865,4.0,4.0,"Tim is a really nice guy! He gets a little flustered sometimes, but he is always willing to help and answers questions well. Webassign and written homework are easy and help boost grades!"
9973,1144865,4.5,5.0,I'm definitely taking Tim for calc 2. Everyone in the class loves him! Tim's the man!
9974,1144865,5.0,1.0,You don't need any prior experience in math for applied calc 1. People ask the stupidest questions! The exams are somewhat more difficult but partial credit is given. The written homework was the harder but it's not assigned that often. Quizes on Wed. and he loves to make you define terms. You'll hear &quot;Oh OK&quot; and &quot;BAD!&quot; often.

9976,137250,1.0,5.0,"A graduate course only based on his prefenrence.I take 20 hours every week to read bunch of papers, prepare for the course.But,I have no idea why he gaveB-, C+ for graduate if he read all your assignment, or see the stuff you turned in, if he really did. Rather, you never can expect he will remember what you have contributed if he didn't like you"
9977,137250,1.0,4.0,This guy was my advisor. He was such a presumptuous jerk to me. Never treated me with respect though I was always respectful to him.
9978,137250,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Haimes was the best teacher I ever had.  The young brats who have rated him know not what they speak (or do).  He was an inspiration at many levels, and was able to increase understanding at the same time he expanded solutions.  He has had a tremendous career and influenced so many students and well beyond. A legend in his field."
9979,137250,1.0,4.0,"Terrible class, terrible professor, terrible book, terrible TAs.  He insults students on a regular basis and assumes that everyone besides him is an idiot.  Haimes believes that he is the risk expert and there will never be a better expert."
9980,137250,1.0,5.0,"One of the most miserable professors, if not people alive.  I don't care how prestigious he is, he can't teach, and here's why:  1) Not clear 2) Presumptuous 3) Treats students with no respect 4) Doesn't care if students learn the material  Very bad, what's his problem anyway&#63;"
9981,137250,2.0,1.0,i will probably never forget the phrase &quot;pareto optimal solution&quot; after this class.  he confused even himself during his lectures. what is systems engineering anyways&#63;
9982,137250,4.5,4.0,"Good class.  Haimes is well versed and covers everything to be successful, but keeps a suffecietly fast pace that it requires much effort on the part of the student.  I recomend this teacher if you want to learn!"
9983,137250,5.0,1.0,"nice, helpful, experienced"
9984,137250,1.0,4.0,This guy is so bad that I wish he would just retire.
9985,137250,2.0,1.0,"He teaches to us as if we were kindergardners (flicks the lights to quiet us, etc...)  Not all that helpful, but isn't too hard on us.  Tries to plug his life philosophies to us."

9991,1103907,4.0,1.0,"Exceeded my expectations for an econ department TA. His English is fine. He does seem stiff sometimes, but he could be funny. I actually really liked how he used the textbook's powerpoint slides - you don't really need to read the book!"

Doesn't use cold calls, but students talk and find the answers through the questions he asks - so DEFINITELY do the reading and be prepared.  Bonus: he's very intelligent and really hot."
9997,1112103,5.0,4.0,"Paul's pretty flyy. Humorous, nice, fair grading... etc. Get him as your TA."
9998,1112103,5.0,2.0,Very intelligent and engaging. Loves what he is teaching so he is knowlegdeable about the topics. Cuteness is added bonus- reminds me of Seth Cohen from the OC! Great TA.
9999,1112103,5.0,2.0,i loved his class.  he is extremely helpful and really knows what he is talking about.  Fair grader and very straightforward.  Definitely take Paul.  cute too :)
10000,833576,1.0,1.0,Horrible
10001,833576,1.5,4.0,"Cooper is a great and passionate lecturer. You learn a lot from this intro class. You do have to put in the time and effort although it is a ""1050"" class. There are no essays, 3 exams, church visit presentation, and frequent quizzes (depends on TA) that go into your participation grade. The only thing that irked me was that a 95 is an A."
10002,833576,4.0,1.0,EXCELLENT CLASS AND PROF
10003,833576,2.5,4.0,"While I enjoyed much of the material from this class, my opinion of Professor Cooper steadily declined over the course of the semester. She is biased, accusatory towards the Catholic mass, and as a white student I often felt uncomfortable in lecture. She is a picky, difficult grader. I do not recommend this &quot;preacher.&quot; Look for professors."
10004,833576,5.0,1.0,"It's an easy class but I cannot say that I have enjoyed it. She is the most biased and transparent professor I have ever come across (3rd year). God is Black, Blacks still deserve reparations, White churches are not welcoming or fun, and mocks the Catholic Eucharist. Of course I'll seem ****, but I'm repeating things from the source."
10005,833576,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher!  Really nice and a great sense of humor.  Even though her class lasted 2 1/2 hrs long, it never got boring once. Readings are necessary and long, but still very interesting and engaging.  Her class discussions deal directly with the texts.  I learned a lot about Pentecostalism from taking this course and would recommend it to anyone."
10006,833576,3.5,4.0,"Cooper is an awesome teacher at the entry-level classes, but once you get higher into the 300's, 400's and so forth, her teaching style goes down the drain.  She is not very clear, and lets the class direct discussion.  Exams have nothing to do with the discussion, which feels like class is a waste of time."
10007,833576,4.5,2.0,"She is quite passionate about the material... though she deviates from the script a bit and can appear scatter-brained, your grade largely depends on your enthusiasm for the class and the way you're able to engage the material. Readings aren't prohibitive, work isn't oppressive and as a white person, I can say she's anything but prejudiced."
10008,833576,5.0,1.0,"In response to the post about Dr. Cooper's treatment of whites, she is not prejudiced in any way, but explained some extreme position in Liberation Theology.  However she never said she advocated them.  She simply explained how some scholars believed God has a &quot;preferential option&quot; for the oppressed. (Ex. James Cone)"
10009,833576,3.5,1.0,She seemed like an awesome charismatic teacher from the beginning BUT towards the end of the semester she became kind of preachy.  She made seemed to imply that all the white kids in the class were **** and didn't let anyone finish their comment if it wasn't something she agreed with.  Very clear/concise.  Easy tests. Easy A. But kind of rude.
10010,833576,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Cooper is an awesome professor. In contrast to the usual skeptical religion professor, she is a Christian an embaces evangelical viewpoints while continuing to present material objectively. She is awesome and I highly recommended taking her intro to Christian Tradition class."
10011,1103911,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Hudson's seminar on Daoism is a boon for anyone who seeks initiation into the mysteries of this rich tradition. Stellar deities, internal meditations, alchemical elixirs, mountain ascetics- all this and more is covered here in great depth, clarity and humor. A true jewel in UVA's department, take this class if you have the chance!"
10012,1103911,4.5,3.0,"Not only is Prof. Hudson a world class scholar of Daoism, but he knows his Buddhism and Confucianism very well. You couldn't ask for a better guide to the big picture of Chinese religions. He's a nice guy to boot and is more than willing to give you helpful feedback on your papers in advance. Highly recommended!"
10013,1103911,1.5,2.0,TERRRIBLLLLEEE CLASS!!  Gosh most boring lectures I've ever attended.  Required reading checks every single day so I did the readings answered the question in the first 5 minute and left because there was no point.  Join a study guide at the end of the course and do all the readings for the reading check and you'll be fine.
10014,1103911,1.0,5.0,This class is extremely boring. His class revolves around the mandatory questions he makes you ask every night before. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!
10015,1103911,2.0,3.0,Half the class leaves after the mandatory reading quizzes.  Did not learn a thing in class but learned a lot in section. Bring your computer because you will fall asleep listening to him.
10016,1103911,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Hudson is a wonderful teacher- clear in his exposition, willing to field any  and all questions, and solid in his expertise. Highly recommended to the serious student of Chinese religion."
10017,1103911,2.0,3.0,SOOOOOOOO boring that right now I'm playing Mahjong Titans. This class is like a Chinese torture ! don't EVER take it !
10018,1103911,3.0,3.0,"nice but teaching method sucks, just can't keep the class engaged. but he is nice and some readings were interesting."
10019,1103911,1.0,2.0,"SO dull. Bring some Sudoku or your laptop, otherwise you may not make it. He seems like a genuinely nice guy, but he's just not engaging...at all!"
10020,1103911,1.0,5.0,THE WORST!
10021,1103911,1.0,2.0,"The worst professor I've had at UVA. He doesn't know how to teach the material and has reading checks which ensure attendance even though lectures are useless, tangential, and boring. Take the class with a different professor or don't take it at all."
10022,1103911,1.0,5.0,"WORST professor I've ever had at UVa. Monotone, quiet voice. Boring lectures. Dense reading. Sounds like he might know his stuff, but no one will ever know b/c we can't hear him.  Seems like a nice guy but overall a horrible professor. I only survived because I was really interested in the material and forced myself to learn it."
10023,1103911,2.0,3.0,"WORST professor I've ever had. He lectures in a monotone, 2-inch voice. IMPOSSIBLE to pay attention and follow along. Most of the powerpoint and lecture information is useless for testing. Readings are difficult to understand and fairly useless as well. My TA saved my grade. The worst part is attendance is mandatory and there are daily quizzes!"
10024,1103911,1.0,1.0,"This dude the most boring guy I've even considered lstening to.  He defines monetone and people often walk right out of class in boredom.  He posts the notes online, and tests are based on readings."
10025,1120295,5.0,1.0,She really cares about her students and is one of the reasons my first year experience has been so great. Her COLA class also helps a lot with developing critical thinking skills without getting into the nitty gritty components of literature and poetry. They were very interesting topics and I looked forward to class every week. Take her class!
10026,1120295,5.0,2.0,Professor Spaar will encourage you to think creatively and intellectually at the same time.  Her classes are a breath of fresh air.
10027,1120295,5.0,1.0,"One of the nicest teachers I've ever had. Loves to talk, very approachable and if you take a COLA with her you can have her for your counselor until you declare a major and she is awesome!"
10028,1120295,5.0,2.0,The nicest teacher I've ever had.  She is also a genius.
10029,2177067,5.0,3.0,"I've never enjoyed a course as much as Dr. Leonard's &quot;Ancient and Classical India&quot; course. While we cover the subject more or less thoroughly, the class also takes some deep dives into various topics that are all super interesting. I loved this class and this professor."
10030,2177067,5.0,3.0,"This class is the only I've taken so far where the material and discussion is really open-ended. He doesn't shove his view of matters down our throats, though he does insist on reading well. The ideas Dr. Leonard presents are clear, rooted in the books we read, and super interesting. Who would have thought these old books had such great ideas!"
10031,2177067,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Leonard is super interesting. I took ancient India with him. I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but the class went way beyond whatever I thought. All in all, a great liberal arts prof."
10032,2177067,5.0,3.0,"Looking back, I realize how much I learned from Dr. Leonard. I really don't understand what the other student wanted from a history class. I didn't take the class he or she refers to, but presumably in a class on the 1700s, one is going to read documents from that time."
10033,2177067,1.0,4.0,"You will have to read large sections of The Wealth of Nations and 300 pages a week of letters, accounts, ect written in the 1700's. Despite being a seminar, he lectured for the entire two and a half hours and frequently went on tangents. We didn't even start talking about India until October. Good side is that he gives a great study guide for exams"
10034,1767474,5.0,4.0,Leung is one of my favorite professors at UVA and I am so thankful to have had him as my introduction to chemistry.
10035,1767474,5.0,4.0,"Professor Leung cares about his students more than 99% of the professors in the country. His class is very hard, but he tells you exactly what you have to do in order to do well in class. Listen to his warnings, go to class, don't get behind on ALEKS and you will be fine. If you are struggling, help from him and the TAs is always available."
10036,1767474,4.5,4.0,"Read the textbook AHEAD of class. Never pass up on extra credit. Second semester is harder, and he'll punish the class with harder tests which is annoying (no one got 100% on the tests). However, he does give you all the tools to succeed and you just have to put in twice as much effort as other classes to earn an A. (I got an A+, they do happen)"
10037,1767474,1.0,5.0,"As an international student from Italy , I was so excited to come to the UVA. But Leung has made it most difficult and miserable. I think it may be a cultural issue. I do not think he should be introductory teacher."
10038,1767474,1.0,5.0,"It seems obvious that administration has had a chat with professor Leung as he is not as mean spirited as previous students described.  However, many of us in his class struggle greatly, feel little support, and feel like his tests are just a joke.  The tests really should be on the material and not on how many of us he can trick.  awful class"
10039,1767474,4.5,4.0,"People will tell you he's awful and that you won't understand but those are both not true. Make sure to get a good seat. The three tests are hard but the other things really help out your grade. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS, don't bother reading the book, and do a ton of practice problems. The course is hard but what's expected of you is clear."
10040,1767474,5.0,4.0,"If you work hard from the beginning then it is possible to get a good grade. The keys  to success are paying very close attention in lecture, sitting at the front because he focuses on the front six rows, and go to office hours even if you think you know whats going on."
10041,1767474,2.5,5.0,"Leung can sometimes confuse the class with what he sees as ""simplified"" concepts (ignore these), but the TA's will try to clear it up. He's a decent (and funny) professor, but his tests are designed to trick you, with many logic questions so READ CAREFULLY/recheck. To succeed, you HAVE to read the textbook first, then attend lecture and do ALEKS."
10042,1767474,4.5,4.0,Leung actually really cares about his students and works incredibly hard to help you succeed. HONESTLY even if you're terrible at chem - if you do what he tells you to do (do a little of the work every day and go to office hours if you need to) its IMPOSSIBLE to get below a B-. I had metcalf and got a B but then switched to Leung and got an A. 
10043,1767474,2.0,5.0,"Leung means well, but this class is terrible. If you can avoid taking this class, DONT TAKE IT. Chem isn't difficult, Leung is. He made this class living hell. "
10044,1767474,3.5,4.0,"One of the hardest working professors at UVA, he really tries to make sure that you are learning the material and understanding it rather than just memorizing. He is very data driven and every he does is based off of this. Even aleks. If you find yourself struglling, drop by his office hours, he really cares about his students if it comes as a surp"
10045,1767474,4.5,4.0,"I think Leung is a great professor. He definitely wants the best for all the students, and it is easy to see that he is passionate about what he does. Though his quizzes may be challenging, he is always readily available for office hours and help if material is unclear. Ultimately, the student will determine his/her own grade, not Leung."
10046,1767474,5.0,3.0,I think Terry was a great professor! Tough to teach this class but he did a great job and his lecture slides are thorough and cover almost everything you need to know. Seems tough at the time but Terry is very generous with extra credit and wants the best for his students. Always willing to go above and beyond to help students
10047,1767474,3.0,4.0,I took this class over the summer and it seems to be better than during the actual semester. He quizzes you everyday and he'll even put things that he didn't teach on the quiz to make sure that you are reading ahead. He isn't that bad it's just that he expects everyone to know everything when that is not possible.
10048,1767474,1.5,4.0,"Professor Leung.... where to start? He is one of the most questionable professors I have had at UVA. He gives you quizzes on materials that he hasnt taught you yet, gives pop quizzes at discussions which are never mandatory, is really unapproachable via email or in person etc.. One of the worst professors I have had at UVA. Avoid him if you can!!!!"
10049,1767474,2.5,4.0,"Professor Leung is very dedicated in teaching chemistry. There is A LOT of work required for this class. I don't find him approachable, but he has open office hours when you have questions. Though you might freak out about your exam and quiz grades, you will be fine. Participation and homework(completion) grades will create a buffer for you."
10050,1767474,1.0,5.0,"Ridiculous amount of homework with ALEKS.  Very, very hard to understand his English.  Kind of ruined chem for me "
10051,1767474,5.0,3.0,HTL loves teaching and is very approachable. Lectures are clear and concept-oriented.
10052,1767474,1.0,5.0,"Professor Leung should teach at the graduate level and not introductory chemistry.  Chemistry geniuses will like him, but everyone else (pre-med, pre-dental, etc) will have truly horrible experience with tremendous work and C or D grades.  Truly expected more from UVA."
10053,1767474,3.5,5.0,"Leung was an interesting teacher. His lectures are hard to understand if you do not focus. However, he was always 100% there for you in office hours, which really helped. "
10054,1767474,2.0,5.0,"Leung seems to enjoy watching us struggle, though he claims that chemistry is easy if you work at it. I put in more than 30 hours a week outside of class and was not close to getting an A, not because I didnt understand chemistry, but because his tests are more about it you can find the tricks in the questions than if you actually know the material"
10055,1767474,2.0,5.0,Worst experience of my school career. Its ridiculously hard. I worked 20+ hours and couldnt pass. Take it at a community college and transfer in. Homework takes 15+ hrs. And tests are literally impossible. And no curve at the end. Goodbye grad school.
10056,1767474,3.0,4.0,One of those classic UVa professors that designs tests in an attempt to trick you and see how well you can apply your knowledge to new scenarios. Very difficult course. Test averages are always around 65%. Daily work and studying required. More than just conceptual knowledge required. Have to be a very strong Chemistry student.
10057,1767474,5.0,4.0,He's an awesome teacher. He puts in loads of effort and always has office hours. Make sure you stay on top of stuff and you're A-Okay
10058,1767474,2.0,5.0,Just don't.
10059,1767474,2.5,5.0,"Really not a bad guy, he definitely enjoys chemistry and teaching but prefers tricking students by any means possible.  His tests are designed to test your ability to spot hidden difficulties, not actually test your knowledge of chemistry."
10060,1767474,1.0,5.0,Leung made me want to transfer out of UVA. Worst class I've ever taken and I had a good understanding of chemistry. 
10061,1767474,4.0,2.0,He's an awesome guy. He literally tells you exactly how to get an A in his class if you put in 2-3 hours a week. He has open office hours and sleeps in his office because he stays up preparing material for us
10062,1767474,1.0,5.0,He has a very thick accent and does not stick to what is necessary to know for the tests because he is very smart. 
10063,1767474,5.0,3.0,"He is a very nice professor, perhaps a bit too critical sometimes, but he genuinely cares how well you comprehend the material. Just don't get left behind on Aleks. 5 topics each day is enough for homework assignment."
10064,1767474,4.5,3.0,He's is being judged way too harshly in these reviews. He's a really good teacher (and person) who genuinely cares if his students learn and retain chemistry. The comments about his teaching style are extremely exaggerated if not outright wrong and the only trick to succeeding in his class is paying attention and actually following his advice.
10065,1767474,1.0,5.0,"Awful teacher, always lectured on how important studying properly was but then gave homework that took up so much time that you couldn't even study. I barely understood what was being said in lecture and had to read the textbook to learn the material all the time because his teaching was so sketchy. NOT a good experience at all"
10066,1767474,2.5,4.0,"The amount of workload is impractical. Leung loves giving trick questions and assigning unnecessary amounts of work. When we don't do well, he blames it on us and when we do well, he says it because of his teaching methods and HIS hard work not because most students had tough AP chem teachers in high school."
10067,1767474,1.0,5.0,"Avoid if you can - if you are pre-med and can't, be prepared for a year from hell. He loves tricking students and claims we are at THE University of Virginia not some other mediocre school.."
10068,1767474,1.0,4.0,"Even if you have taken AP Chem, this teacher will confuse you beyond repair regarding everything you learned in the past. He is unclear, unhelpful, and seems to take a joy in watching his students struggle. He does not curve and doesn't keep a realistic mentality regarding other classes and work loads. He is condescending and ruined chem for me."
10069,1767474,1.0,5.0,"At first, it seemed that Leung genuinely cares about his students and therefore challenges.After the terribly rude email he sent out, I realize otherwise. He is evil and his tests are impossibly difficult. He assumes we all learn the same way and uses ALEKS which will is the bane of my existence. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."
10070,1767474,1.0,5.0,Terry Leung is more dedicated to telling students how hard he works so they can learn chemistry and letting know students how disgraceful they are at learning chemistry than actually teaching chemistry. The man cannot write a test or quiz which does not contain a blatant typo. His expectations are unrealistic. Let's not mention the accent.
10071,1767474,2.5,5.0,"terrible terrible class, very hard"
10072,1767474,4.0,4.0,"if you're willing to put in the time, terry will be there for you. you can't expect to attend the lectures and get an a. you have to work every day like he suggests, doing the suggested practice problems and aleks. not just once a week, but daily. go in and ask questions. he can be really helpful. also, he has open office hours, which rocks."
10073,1767474,2.5,4.0,"Okay teacher; hard class. Blames students for doing poorly-not his confusing lectures. He's very willing to help students, however, and and  is very enthusiastic. The TAs are useless; to get a good grade, a lot of time outside class studying is needed."
10074,1767474,3.5,4.0,"Overall, this was a hard class. Test questions were very tricky and made you second guess yourself constantly. Tips: NEVER let yourself lose interest during lectures (otherwise you'll become completely lost), read the textbook if you're unsure about something, and don't fall behind in ALEKS."
10075,1767474,3.0,4.0,"Hoitung is willing to help you in chemistry, but it's kinda hard to understand him when he talks to you. You can for study hours everyday and do horrible in this course. Tests are really tricky. When you come out thinking you Aced a test, you'll see a failing grade. Figuring out the right study method for this class is the key!"
10076,1767474,4.5,2.0,"Leung is very caring of his students, but what you make out of this class is ultimately up to you and how much effort you put in. do not buy the $200 textbook what so ever. there's so much resources online that it's absolutely not necessary."
10077,1767474,1.0,5.0,"Terry… Terry Terry Terry… No. Just no. Very unhelpful, tedious, repetitive. Seems like a nice guy, good sense of humor, but I know I'm not alone in saying I have trouble understanding more than 25% of what he says, his accent is just too thick."
10078,1767474,4.5,3.0,"Leung recommended a procedure to follow when taking his class: 1.read the textbook?2.attend lecture?3.do ALEKS?4.ask questions (2&3 can switch, it depends). If you at least do 2&3, you'd get the lecture. His quizzes&tests are tricky, but that's because he doesn't believe in plug&chug. Oh, did I mention OPEN office hours? :) He's VERY dedicated."
10079,1767474,2.0,5.0,"So this is a very hard class, you need to really prepare yourself to read the textbook every night, do ALEKS, attend every lecture, and go to office hours. The average grade for the first test was a 60, and quizzes range from 50% to 70% averages. Leung genuinely cares about chemistry and his students though so he will do anything to help out."
10080,1767474,1.0,5.0,seriously horrible
10081,1767474,4.5,4.0,"Despite all of the negative feedback, I think he's a great professor who cares about preparing students to understand chemistry, not preparing students to ""copy and paste"" information verbatim so for quizzes. If you read carefully and understand concepts/where they come from you will see that the class/assessments are very clear-cut."
10082,1767474,1.5,3.0,"Leung is useless to say the least. He is in love with ALEKS which in my opinion is a giant waste of time. Don't get me wrong, he is a very nice person, he just extremely difficult to understand and his questions don't tests the concepts; they test extraneous tricks that are inaccurate reflections of your actual knolwedge"
10083,1767474,1.5,4.0,"Makes you do a lot of busy-work; this is what will end up saving your grade, his quiz and test questions are all about reading carefully, as long as you do that and have a basic understanding, you should be fine"
10084,1767474,1.0,4.0,"Honestly the worst professor at the University. He can't explain any of the concepts effectively, and then he spends the majority of every lecture telling us how bad we are all doing in chemistry. The questions on his tests are EXTREMELY unclear (because he actually can't speak English). Don't take chem with him. Take it with anyone else."
10085,1767474,2.5,4.0,He means well but his lectures don't prepare you for the tests or quizzes. The averages throughout the year so far have been 60's on everything. ALEKS is a ok homework program but you learn through your mistakes rather than the actual problem process. He doesn't realize that almost all of the students who actually do well have taken AP Chem before.
10086,1767474,2.5,5.0,He doesn't explain things well. He uses strange teaching strategies like the useless item-writing. ALEKS is a pain. He watches 20% get the LearningCatalytics questions right then starts lecturing us about how we don't study etc..attributes the success of his teaching strategies to the top 1% who is doing well. dont take chem with him
10087,1767474,2.0,5.0,"Leung is not a bad guy. He really cares about teaching, and tries to be innovative with his teaching style. That style, however, did not work out this semester; every chem student I know laments taking chem this semester, and is struggling just to pass. Take chem if it is your passion; if not, stay away."
10088,1767474,5.0,4.0,"The class was not easy to say the least. He believes in challenging you at every step and trying to get you to improve. He really cares about all of his students (I mean he has open office hours, he even sleeps there sometimes!)He also believes in teaching the concepts more than the equations(which I really liked). Overall a worth while professor."
10089,1767474,4.5,4.0,"I am speechless after taking this course.  He wants his students to succeed so much, and he is always there for us.  He has open office hours (name one other professor at UVA that does that).  Says that he sees on average of 50 students before a test and will learn every students name.He says he is not a genius, but I beg to differ. Must have prof!"
10090,1767474,4.5,4.0,"During the first lecture he said, ""I will never give up on my students."" I didn't really knew what to take from this, but throughout the semester he proved he meant that statement. He is ALWAYS available for help and he cares about his students. He has made me learn chemistry rather than memorize it. Definitely take Leung. No questions asked."
10091,1767474,3.5,3.0,"FINALLY a teacher that cares about learning. At a big University it is often difficult to find the quality of education that is necessary to succeed later on.  Self-admittedly not the most ""natural smarts"", but promotes value of work ethic and complete understanding. Compared to the caliber of other professors at the university, superior"
10092,1767474,4.0,2.0,"Leung really cares about you, although his teaching methods are a little different, you have to do a little learning on your own else you will do terrible."
10093,1767474,4.5,3.0,"Quiz averages were consistent with other professors but that is not important. The important thing is this professor's dedication to promoting learning not only of the material, but of how to think beyond the stated. Take the time to do your work and attend office hours. excellent teacher with a thorough understanding of chemistry."
10094,1767474,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher. Invested in his students. Expectations are high, but that is only because he recognizes in order to do well, not only does he have to deliver a meaningful lecture, but you must give of your own time to understand the material. Open office hours, always available, pushes students to become critical thinkers and not just memorize"
10095,1767474,2.5,5.0,"Leung's lectures make the content seem simple, but his quizzes are very challenging. In fact, I didn't learn how to do some of the problems that were on the quizzes. He is a funny guy, but was very rude with the students in my section over several emails. Mastering chem assignments are much longer than the other professors teaching the class."
10096,1767474,5.0,1.0,"Class was fairly easy. He was the best professor I have ever had. I would highly recommend him over any Intro to Chem professor. Attend class and work hard on the homework and it should be easy. He also responds to emails very quickly, regardless of time of day."
10097,1767474,1.5,3.0,"He cared about his students, but was not an effective teacher. Whenever I visited him in his office hours I was belittled and was told that I may have a learning disability. I do not recommend taking Chem with Leung."
10098,1767474,3.0,4.0,"Leung is a very nice guy and really devotes a lot of time towards helping his students.  However, his lectures are not all that helpful.  They are not very well planned out and hard to follow.  His quiz averages were much lower than all the other intro to Chem professors."
10099,1767474,5.0,2.0,"Really cares about teaching and learning, very well thought-out lectures, quizzes/tests have a good mix of questions (easy/ hard). Pay attention to the questions asked closely, there are some tricky ones."
10100,1767474,4.5,4.0,"Funny teacher who really wants to help his students.  He has open office hours which is really nice to! Overall, I think he grades fairly even though his tests are difficult (I would say around the same difficulty as Metcalf)."
10101,2799667,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bryce is a great professor. This was my second class with her. She's brilliant and thorough. She grades really fairly. Not an easy class. There were 2 papers and the 2nd one was terrible, but the quality of professor makes up for a terrible assignment. I always learn a lot and enjoy her classes. "
10102,2799667,5.0,1.0,Dr. Bryce is a well rounded professor. She is articulate and knows her stuff. I highly recommend her. 
10103,2799667,5.0,3.0,Professor Bryce is challenging but fair! A wonderful person who makes sure students are engaged and learning. 
10104,2799667,5.0,3.0,"Due to the breadth of excellent content, the three exams were open book/note. The two papers were time consuming yet enriching. Feedback on these five total assignments was invaluable; grading was the definition of fair. Prof. Bryce is hands down the best in our psychology program, knowledgeable, sharp, engaging, sociable, fun. Take her class now."
10105,1562674,4.5,3.0,"Townley's the man. Seriously, this guy could make writing obituaries fun. He's really helpful and exciting, and although there's regular reading, he assigns good stuff. Work hard and expect to improve a ton."
10106,1562674,4.5,3.0,"Extremely helpful! The topic is interesting and he really wants to see you succeed. The class is a lot of work and effort sometimes, but definitely worth the while."
10107,1562674,5.0,2.0,Really cool guy. Seems to take writing a little too seriously but if you try hard you'll get an A. It's a laid back class with a lot of reading and writing. It's not dense material but two 15 page papers along with a bunch of other writing exercises and critiques takes some time. I'd recommend the class but be ready to put some effort in.
10108,1562674,4.5,4.0,A pretty hard class. He is a cool guy but this class is difficult. If you want to learn and become a better person/student take his class. If you are just trying to get your first writing requirement out of the way try and go somewhere else.
10109,505913,5.0,2.0,Love Ran Zhao to death. She was the best professor I has first year. If you get the opportunity to take her at UVA take it
10110,505913,4.0,2.0,He is sooooo nice! I like him! Im sure that I will take his course again if I can!
10111,505913,5.0,4.0,"I cannot say enough good things about Zhao Laoshi. She is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Chinese is an incredibly difficult language, but Zhao Laoshi makes it fun and makes you really want to put in all the work. There is a lot of work! But it is completely worth it. If you work hard you will absolutely earn her respect and do well."
10112,505913,4.5,4.0,"I really really love Zhao laoshi. She's the sweetest lady and always looking to help everyone in the class succeed. The workload, especially for a First Year, is a bit startling at the beginning, but don't let it discourage you because it gets MUCH easier, and learning Chinese from her is well worth it. "
10113,505913,4.5,2.0,I love her!!! she is the best Chinese teacher ever!
10114,505913,5.0,2.0,She's the sweetest teacher ever. You'd be crazy not to take Chinese with her!
10115,505913,5.0,3.0,"Zhao laoshi is the most amazing teacher you will come across at UVA. she is so adorable and such an amazing teacher. Both chin 101 and 102 are a lot of work, but it's worth it. Zhao laoshi is amazing and i can't wait to have her again for chin 401. &#36213;&#32769;&#24072;&#26159;&#25105;&#26368;&#21916;&#27426;&#30340;&#32769;&#24072;&#65292;&#251"
10116,505913,5.0,3.0,"&#36213;&#32769;&#24072; is phenomenal at what she does. Although she expects a lot out of her students, I have never seen her lose her patience or become frustrated. I can't speak as to her higher-level courses, but if you're just starting Chinese(&#20013;&#25991;&#65289;I highly recommend her."
10117,505913,5.0,1.0,"Looks really young, but knows content, easy, understandable, helpful, instruction is clear and straightforward, and you remember the language she teacher you.  Class is never boring, always interesting.  Real sweetie too."
10118,505913,5.0,3.0,"Zhao laoshi is such an awesome teacher. she's very talented, understanding, flexible and fair. although chinese is a tough class to take, zhao laoshi makes it very fun and interesting. a TON of work but she is ready to compromise with you if things get out of hand. highly recommended."
10119,505913,5.0,3.0,"such a cute and amazing teacher! Hard-working, always happy, and really patient. A very fair grader."
10120,505913,4.0,1.0,She's absolutely great. I already knew chinese pretty well and I still learnt a lot from her. She's great but hard.
10121,505913,2.0,3.0,I didn't like it. No good.
10122,505913,5.0,3.0,"Zhao laoshi (&#63;&#63;&#63;) is awesome! She makes learning Chinese seem easy. The class is a lot of work, but Zhao laoshi understands the obsticles that native English speakers must overcome to learn Chinese. Her English is very good, but soon you will just want to listen to her speak in Chinese!"
10123,2504763,5.0,3.0,"Thought he did a great job, very cool guy, would take another class with him"
10124,2504763,5.0,3.0,One of my favorite professors! He uploads recorded lectures and powerpoints onto collab and is very passionate about sociology. So understanding and all the lectures are take home and not difficult - but help you understand the material even more. I'm choosing to minor in soc because of him and I highly recommend taking a class with him!
10125,2504763,5.0,3.0,I love Professor Mullins! He has a clear passion for sociology; it's hard not to feel interested and invested when he is so much so. There are plenty of readings but they are all meaningful and insightful. Professor Mullins is open to feedback and really cares about his students. Highly recommend!!
10126,2504763,5.0,4.0,Very nice and great lecturer!
10127,2504763,5.0,2.0,"Professor Mullins is the BEST. He truly cares about his students. He has structured his course in a way that allows everyone to perform equitably during the pandemic. He has a real passion for sociology. Exams were straightforward and open note/book. You read 3 books, write 3 survey questions with a group, and take 2 exams. He is just amazing."
10128,2504763,4.0,3.0,professor mullins speaks in a monotone but the material he teaches is very interesting and he cares a lot about sociology and his students
10129,2504763,5.0,3.0,My absolute favorite UVA professor! He's always available outside of class and you can tell he genuinely cares about the wellbeing of his students. He gives AMAZING lectures that really make you think. I added sociology as a second major after taking a course with him because I enjoyed it so much. I've taken a few classes with him now &amp; he's 10/10!
10130,2504763,5.0,2.0,"I took Social Problems with Mullins in Spring 2020. Sociology isn't really my subject, however I feel like I learned a lot in this class. I was very impressed with how he responded to the Covid-19 crisis and how we moved online, however. Easily the most accommodating professor I had at the time and showed how he genuinely cares about his students."
10131,2504763,2.0,1.0,"I tried so hard to take him seriously but he really does lecture like he's giving a TED talk-- the class felt like more of a study of a few specific sociology experiments rather than a foundation class for understanding sociology. I did the readings, went to lectures and discussions- I did well, but I got very little out of this class."
10132,2504763,5.0,5.0,Prof. Mullins is one of the best professors I've ever had. I'm on my third class with him now. He picks amazing texts for the class to read- but you absolutely have to stay on top of the reading or you'll have no idea what's going on (a lot of reading!). His classes are always challenging and eyeopening in the best way possible. Highly recommend.
10133,2504763,1.0,2.0,The topics covered in class were interesting but this class would've been a lot more interesting with a different professor. Mullins lectures like he's talking at a TED talk without any technology. No powerpoints or anything. He'll write some words on the blackboard at the beginning of class but no other visual aids so note taking was difficult.
10134,2504763,5.0,3.0,"I really loved his into to sociology class! The material was very relevant to the currant world and was interesting to learn about. The exams are not bad if you went to class and did the reading. They are take home and open note, so really nothing to stress about. There are few homework assignments that are straightforward. Definitely recommend."
10135,2504763,2.0,2.0,He's very boring. He teaches the class like it's a social theory class which is very frustrating. I love my TA and my discussion section though.
10136,2504763,5.0,4.0,He is a great professor who makes class enjoyable
10137,1177665,4.5,3.0,Pilar is an amazing professor. I had her for a class at UVA (3020) and then again in Spain. At first I was intimidated by her because she cold calls a lot. But she appreciates questions and makes an effort to make things as clear as possible. She also gives great feedback in office hours.  Any Spanish major should take her classes!
10138,1177665,4.0,5.0,"She goes way too hard on students with more experience.  It is like she tries to show you that you will never speak as well as her.  Accent gets in the way.  However if you look past that, you will actually enjoy the class."
10139,1177665,4.5,4.0,"I had her while studying in Spain. She was extremely intimidating at first, I wanted to drop the class, but by the end of the semester she had come to be one of my favorites. She's authoritative, but also helpful and relatable. Don't take her unless you have a strong interest in learning Spanish. I'd highly recommend her!"
10140,1177665,2.0,4.0,so help you god
10141,2209865,5.0,4.0,Great prof. Don't need to be a genius just work hard and questions/office hours . Cares about teaching the material the right way. Decent music taste.
10142,2209865,4.0,4.0,I had to work a lot learned a lot of calculus during this class. The professor was well organized and had a lot of office hours. Overall a good class.
10143,2209865,1.0,2.0,Bad teacher doesnt know how to teach :(
10144,2209865,3.0,4.0,Professor Di Plinio is a nice person but his lectures are quite messy. It's pretty easy to get lost in problems and there isn't a ton of class participation. The speed of the lectures was also very rapid at times.
10145,2209865,4.0,2.0,Great professor that will answer your questions after class and is happy to talk.
10146,2676817,1.0,5.0,I think she isn't preparing things well enough and always creating hard questions.
10147,1734751,5.0,4.0,"She is one of the greatest teachers. She's fun, clever, engaging, human, and insanely smart. And fine."
10148,120932,2.0,2.0,"Professor Gorman is a good person, but his class is usually boring. Also, the grades you get on assignments is way too dependent on your TA grader. Get ready for him to send politically biased emails unrelated to the course topic as well."
10149,120932,3.0,3.0,"You can tell he is very passionate about what he is teaching, but the way he teaches could use some work. Most classes, he shows us a video of a different professor teaching the material instead of him teaching it himself. There also aren't many grades in the class so if you do poorly on one assignment it is difficult to get your grade back up."
10150,120932,4.0,2.0,great professor.
10151,120932,5.0,2.0,this guy is absolutely amazing.   makes things so much easier and less complicated .  worthwhile course.
10152,120932,4.0,2.0,"Very nice guys, I really enjoyed this class.  Good way to get sts200 credit"
10153,120932,5.0,2.0,Very bright guy and eager to help students and discuss any topic. Great person to go to if you need academic advice! The course kind of dragged at times but picked up at the end - overall a worthwhile course.
10154,120932,3.0,3.0,"OK, but not great.  He made the class buy his book unnecessairily, and he also liked to sermonize on various issues, even if someone else was leading the discussion."
10155,120932,3.5,2.0,No Comments
10156,120932,4.5,2.0,"He can be a little bit hard to get to know, but once you know him, he is an awesome guy. He is very smart, and his class is fairly easy. He is happy to write recommendations as well."
10157,120932,3.5,2.0,No Comments
10158,2685030,2.0,3.0,"Was tight-lipped and inaccessible as an advisor. Withheld information until after tuition payments were made. I dont think he had bad intentions, but I wouldnt recommend."
10159,2685030,5.0,4.0,"This was the first philosophy class I've taken, but I LOVED it. Both lecture and discussion with the TA were so useful and the readings were useful too. I 100% recommend going to office hours so you can clarify the readings because they'll be useful for the papers! As long as you participate and try, it'll be a really interesting course."
10160,2685030,5.0,3.0,"Intro to Moral and Political Philosophy was a great introductory philosophy course. I went in knowing absolutely nothing about philosophy and ended the semester having felt like I learned a lot. Dr. Adams assigned really interesting readings and the semester's writing project, midterm, and final were very fair. Would definitely reccomend!"
10161,2685030,5.0,4.0,This is the best class and the best professor I've ever had. Philosophy is a hard subject but Dr. Adams is incredibly good at explaining things and is so accessible and kind. I want to be his best friend. This class specifically is also really interesting. TAKE HIS CLASSES
10162,358505,3.0,1.0,Tests are easy and homework is done in assigned projects. Lecture is confusing but tests are open note and much simpler than class. No previous coding required. 
10163,358505,4.5,3.0,One of my favorite classes at UVA.
10164,358505,5.0,2.0,"Excellent professor.  Homework, quizzes, and tests quite easy because the material is explained so well in class.  She also prints all her slides! bliss"
10165,358505,5.0,2.0,"She really knows what she is teaching.  Very helpful in office hours.  Wants her students to succeed.  By the end of the semester, you'll learn a lot!"
10166,358505,5.0,3.0,"She presents a tremendous amount of information in class, but it's all very well organized. She's taught the class many times, and it really shows. The class curriculum has obviously been revised many times and is quite well presented. I highly recommend the class to anyone serious about learning networking."
10167,358505,4.5,4.0,"Very willing to help. Cares a lot about how she's doing as a teacher and how she can help you learn better. One of the best in the E-School. Her tests are a bit tough, though, but that's because she knows we're capable."
10168,358505,1.0,5.0,She was the most unhelpful professor that I have ever encountered.  She tries to cram too much information into each lecture and her tests are very hard and confusing.  I would advise very highly to avoid her and any class that she teaches.
10169,358505,4.5,3.0,"Scribbles all over the board, in all directions until she fills it all up. Lazy with the tests, only mid+final with every point on each test worth a pt/100 on ur raw score b4 curving."
10170,358505,1.5,4.0,"Blathers on endlessly. Uses powerpoint with confusing diagrams. This is a high-level course, it should be general. She takes relatively easy material and makes it difficult. Avoid like the plague."
10171,358505,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. One of the best professors in the department. Her homeworks are very carefully designed to help learn the material. Also, her grade curve is generous."
10172,358505,2.0,4.0,Sux
10173,358505,4.0,3.0,"Respectable professor.  She knows very well about what she is teaching, but her tests are somewhat very wierd."
10174,120939,1.5,4.0,"Prob-Stat was terrible with him. He went way to fast through everything and assumed students understood as easily/quickly as he does. Very little help in office hours. His examples are the super-easy kind, such that when you try doing a real problem (HW) you can't find any similarities and apply the methods."
10175,120939,4.0,2.0,"Excellent professor. Well organized and prepared. He's sort of soft-spoken and can be boring at times, but he's great. His tests are hard though and he gives weekly quizzes."
10176,120939,5.0,3.0,"John Maybee is simply the best professor in the engineering school, and perhaps the best mathematics professor at the university. You have to be very ignorant to miss an opportunity to be in his class. He is extremely well organized and his method of teaching is wonderful."
10177,120939,4.5,2.0,"Good teacher, very clear. I'd recommend him over most of the other APMA teachers. Plus, no mandatory homework is a huge plus."
10178,120939,5.0,4.0,"He is extremely organized and genuinely wants his students to learn. He does tons of example problems and that's pretty much all you need to study. He takes attendance, but I don't think it really affects your grade unless you miss a ridiculous amount of classes. Take his class!"
10179,120939,5.0,1.0,"YOU WANT MAYBEE! He is AWESOME! One of the best prof. I've ever had. I love calc so I'm biased, but his teaching style is very organized and well thought out. He's very willing to help."
10180,120939,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Maybee is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He makes a fairly difficult subject understandable and interesting. He believes in teaching students to learn, not to intimidate. Overall a great teacher and person."
10181,120939,5.0,2.0,"nice teacher, pretty easy class, just study"
10182,120939,4.0,4.0,"If you take a long time to complete tests, don't take this class with Maybee.  His tests were incredibly long....I never finished a test.  However, his notes are clear and well organized.  Will def help you learn."
10183,120939,4.0,2.0,"very organized, nice guy. kind of boring, but a good teacher. tests are difficult."
10184,120939,5.0,4.0,Great teacher!!  This is a really hard course but maybee does a great job of organizing his notes and presenting them well.  He is boring but he is willing to work with you if you need help.  I almost failed it but i talked to maybee and he helped me through it!
10185,120939,5.0,3.0,Most helpful professor Ive had in college probably by a long shot- he really cares about his students and works hard to prepare lessons that make the material understandable.  I had him for 212 also which is a lot harder than 311 but I would try to take any class he teaches he is very good
10186,120939,4.0,3.0,"The best math professor I've ever had. He made Prob/Stat easier to get through. He is an excellent teacher who has developed a methodology for teaching and learning. I don't know how he does it. He makes difficult material easy, and he knows exactly how hard to push you. The homework and tests are all reasonable. The quizzes can get you though."
10187,120939,5.0,3.0,One of the few genuinely good people I know ... actually cares about teaching the subject and the people he's teaching.  Makes himself available for extra office hours when asked and near tests.  One of the few teachers who actually gives a damn about his students.  Really Nice guy.                                       Frame Game Rules!
10188,120939,4.5,4.0,Maybee is a great teacher. He really wants everyone to understand what it is he's teaching. He offered to hold special problem sessions for people who were behind in the class.
10189,120939,2.0,2.0,Very unhelpful for those who were unfamiliar with Calculus--actually suggested that they consider leaving the engineering major in class.
10190,120939,5.0,3.0,Great Professor!
10191,120939,5.0,3.0,"Nice guy, explains well, and has good notes. it doesn't even seem like a labor to goto class. The class schedule is really structured so you always know what you getting into, quizes are at the end of every fourth hour, very straight forward, and the material is the stuff you had just gone over during the fourth hour homework review session"
10192,120939,4.5,3.0,Very easy to understand even with tough material.
10193,120939,4.5,3.0,"His notes are very organized, very easy to understand."
10194,120939,5.0,3.0,"He's an awesome teacher - his notes are well organized and clear, and he's very willing to help you both inside and outside of the class.  He's a really nice man, and I definately recommend getting him if you can."
10195,120939,5.0,1.0,he is such a nice man.very helpful and give people good grade.
10196,120939,5.0,2.0,"no doubt, the best professor ever.  he is nice, smart and helpful. and he can write you a recommandation."
10197,120939,5.0,3.0,"Liked him so much in 111 that i took him again for 212. Not an extremely hard class but if you pay attention and do what he tells you to do, you'll do fine. I liked how he kinda went out of his way to use those confusing symbol things when he could have easily just written it out. FRAME GAMES ROCK!!!!"
10198,120939,5.0,2.0,"amazing teacher and person. very organized, approachable, and helpful."
10199,120939,5.0,3.0,"He is an amazing teacher.  I had him for two semesters, and he truly cares about all of hs students.  He does his best to make a pretty dull subject interesting.  He is my favorite teacher here.  If you have to take APMA 111 or 212, take it with Maybee"
10200,120939,4.5,4.0,"i'm not awesome at math, but I went to him for pointers to help me on tests, and i did soooo much better after!  his advice really helped, and he really wants you to do well.  i highly recommend him."
10201,120939,5.0,4.0,Just a geniunely good human being.
10202,120939,4.5,2.0,"Mr. Maybee isnt the most exciting guy but he is a really good teacher, and he is really good at explaining the material"
10203,120939,4.0,2.0,"Maybee is a great teacher, I had a hard time with the material, but with a some outside help from friends I found it pretty easy to succeed in his class.  Just do the homework and don't be afraid to ask him questions in class."
10204,120939,5.0,3.0,"Very thorough teacher. Gives detailed notes and quizzes aren't so bad. I highly recommend him, and will probably take his 212 class next semester!"
10205,120939,4.0,5.0,"Im geting completely dominated in his class, but I like him anyway."
10206,120939,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, alsways willing to help, and relates the actual math to concepts so you know what's going on."
10207,120939,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher, you won't regret signing up for his class"
10208,120939,4.5,3.0,"Ch17 could have had more examples. Very very good notes, explanations/emphasis on problem solving HELPED. Do the hw, visit office hrs. Not necessarily best calc teacher I've had, but ranks up there. Good job, this was pretty tough material to cover."
10209,120939,5.0,3.0,John Maybee is the best calc teacher I have had. His class lectures are very clear and give you a full understanding of all the material. Tests are very reasonable and studying will get you an A.He has a nice quiet sense of humor that you'll come to love.
10210,120939,5.0,3.0,AWESOME teacher
10211,120939,4.5,3.0,"Mr Maybee helped me understand calculus better than I ever had in the past. If you have to take calc, take it with Maybee!"
10212,120939,5.0,3.0,"Maybee is by far my favorite math teacher at UVA. Pick his class, and you won't regret it."
10213,120939,5.0,3.0,"John Maybee is an awesome teacher. Take him for any class he offers, and you'll enjoy it. John Maybee is the man!"
10214,120939,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite teachers at UVA.  Very helpful and easily accesible.  If you do all the homework and go to class, the tests are not dificult and the class is easy."
10215,120939,4.5,3.0,good dude
10216,120939,2.5,1.0,"Slides are word for word from the book, so it's not very helpful because there's not an extra resource.  Get's confused and doesn't seem like he really knows his stuff.  He seems nervous, too."
10217,120939,4.5,4.0,"I loved Mr. Maybee's class so much that I took him for as many semesters as I could.  He teaches really well and always offers as much help as possible. He'll tell you right where you stand, no matter what."
10218,120939,5.0,3.0,"Class notes and lecture cover everything you need to know for homework. His non-departmental tests are tough, but he does tell you what to expect and offers plenty of office hours/review session time prior to tests."
10219,120939,5.0,2.0,"Extremely clear, very generous with office hours, and if you like methodical, organized instruction, he's great! He teaches to the homework, so you're always well-prepared to tackle the assignments."
10220,120939,1.0,4.0,Teaches by slide and puts to sleep.
10221,120939,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, very helpful and clear"

10223,1259632,5.0,4.0,Really cares about her students and their learning. Works tirelessly to make sure that her students understand and retain what they learn. One of my favorite courses in graduate school.
10224,1259632,5.0,4.0,Excellent teacher; very engaged and committed to student learning. Goes out of her way to ensure that students have ownership in the learning process and that they are exposed to authentic and relevant topics that will benefit their education and training.

10226,2701425,4.0,3.0,"Professor Ross is approachable and wants his students to succeed. He gave us make-up assignments when we did so badly on the exam. The group project was awful, especially when my assigned groupmates had no idea what we were supposed to do and I did all the work by myself."
10227,2701425,2.0,4.0,"On the tests, you get marked wrong for the stupidest things. No partial credit. Homeworks take forever. Don't take this class if you can help it."
10228,2701425,1.0,4.0,"Not a good teacher. Does not go in-depth, does not give helpful material, does not give partial credit, and gives incredibly difficult tests."
10229,1792116,5.0,1.0,Great teacher!
10230,1792116,1.0,4.0,Keith Leitmeyer is literally the worst educator I have ever come upon in my entire life. Do everything in your power to stay away.
10231,907388,5.0,3.0,"This is a change your schedule professor. It takes so much talent to explain complicated material, and somehow she does this in a way that makes the material clear and almost easy. UVA is lucky to have her."
10232,907388,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Morris is the best math teacher I have ever had. I was very worried about taking diff eq but she explained everything in a way that it was almost harder not to understand it. Plus, she is always available in office hours and amazingly helpful. She never makes you feel stupid for asking questions or getting an answer wrong. Take her class!"
10233,907388,5.0,2.0,"I feel absolutely blessed to have taken Complex Variables with Applications, a class last offered in the APMA department in 2014, with Prof. Morris. If you have a good grasp of multivariable calculus and can write decent proofs, you'll do swimmingly! Homework assignments are a breeze and she'll help you if you get stuck!"
10234,907388,5.0,3.0,"Professor Morris has been the best math teacher I've ever had. She's superrrrr funny. It's really quick and witty humor, but when watching her lectures online I'm rofl constantly. She's cute in her own way, and extremely helpful to get you to do well in her class. How she gives notes in class is amazing, you'll see. Exams are a race."
10235,907388,5.0,3.0,Professor Morris is the best Professor I have had at UVA! She is just simply phenomenal. The way she teaches her class kept me engaged and helped me actually do well in an APMA course; something I could not say prior to her class. She is so hilarious and so understanding and is just a real person that understands that her students are too! &lt;3 HER!!
10236,907388,5.0,3.0,"Best Math Professor Ive ever had, Professor Morris makes this class so much easier. She is very patient and clear. She is also very knowledgeable about the class materials. All the in class activities are super helpful for the exams and finals. If you need to take linear algebra, take it with Professor Morris, you will love it."
10237,907388,5.0,3.0,"Without a doubt the best professor I've had. She is incredibly skilled at using examples to illustrate the concepts. If you are in class with your eyes and ears open, it's harder to be confused than to understand the material. Now I just need for her to teach all my other classes... ;)"
10238,907388,5.0,4.0,Best professor I've ever had. Really cares about getting the information across and will try to explain in different ways if you don't understand the first time. Quirky character. Makes the class really enjoyable despite the work.
10239,907388,5.0,3.0,"If you need to take a math class at UVA, take it with Professor Morris. She is wonderful at explaining mathematical concepts, and she truly cares about each student in her class. Seriously, there are only good things I can say about her. If you have the optional of taking a class you need with her, do it."
10240,907388,4.0,4.0,"She is so amazing! She is the only math teacher that I have ever had that is both an effective teacher and an insanely caring person. SO glad to have her as a teacher. She does go through material a little fast, but I took this class over the summer, so that may be the reason why that happens."
10241,907388,5.0,3.0,You should change your schedule to get Professor Morris. She's awesome.
10242,907388,5.0,3.0,The best professor I've had through second year. She's a great teacher and it feels like she genuinely cares about her students learning the subject. She does a great job of highlighting the important things. I had this class at 9am. I was planning on never going. I went because Morris was such a good professor and her lectures were invaluable.
10243,907388,5.0,3.0,"After having Morris, any other professor will be disappointing in some aspect.  She is so incredibly passionate and talented that I am planning my entire math future around her schedule. She is the perfect combination of a joy to be around ( hilarious and down to earth) and an effective teacher ( PERFECT communication). She should be cloned!"
10244,907388,5.0,2.0,"Whatever math class you take, take it with Morris and she will give you all the tools. Best math professor/teacher I've had in my entire life. She writes clear, concise notes on the board and is sympathetic with students. Plus shes kinda quirky which is always entertaining. You won't regret being in her class."
10245,907388,5.0,3.0,"Morris is EXCELLENT. Her lecture notes (on chalkboard) are organized perfectly. She is so caring and you can tell she loves to teach. Questions are always welcome, and she's willing to explain something as many times as it takes until you understand. One of the best professors at UVA, no doubt!"
10246,907388,5.0,2.0,Best professor ever.
10247,907388,5.0,2.0,"She is amazing.  She really makes things clear to her students.  She obviously wants them to do well and understand the material.  I loved her class.  She will go out of her way to help you.  She knows her students names, and makes an effort.  Prof. Morris is awesome, I would definitely recommend her."
10248,907388,5.0,3.0,Best proffesor so far
10249,907388,5.0,3.0,THE BEST CALC TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD. She's SOO nice and caring for each and every student and VERY approachable. You don't feel timid or scared to ask her ANY questions because she's so willing to help and teach esp with clarity. Calc 2 was known to be the most failed & hardest math course at uva but she made this class soo much easier than calc 1.
10250,907388,5.0,3.0,"Morris is THE BEST! Such a sweet woman, cares SO much about the success of her student. Bends over backwards so that you can understand. VERY fair quizzes and tests. She gives you the quiz questions before hand to practice, and that practice helps a lot on tests too. I swear there is not a better Calc professor."
10251,907388,5.0,1.0,Morris is the best!
10252,907388,5.0,3.0,I had her for Calculus 2 and Differential Equations. She is without a doubt one of the best teachers at UVA. I would recommend her 100% of the time seeing as I would not have passed Calculus 2 without her.
10253,907388,5.0,3.0,She is by far the best teacher I've had at the school. She takes the time to teach the subject slowly and carefully and is very funny/quirky!
10254,907388,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors in the entire school! She will go way of her way to help you and make sure you understand all the material and get a good grade. The tests and homework are fair and so is the grading.
10255,907388,4.5,2.0,One of the best calc professors at UVa
10256,907388,5.0,2.0,Amazing
10257,907388,5.0,3.0,"One of the best teachers I've had so far. She's very smart but also explains the material incredibly well. She was so good I didn't even use my textbook til the final. Most homework is online. There is work outside of class, but not too much. If I could take another class with her I would."
10258,907388,5.0,1.0,"Best. Teacher. Ever. Seriously, even if you don't like math, she can make you love it. She always goes out of her way to be helpful and explains everything way better than a textbook ever could. She has tons of office hours and always posts quiz answers ahead of time. If there was one class to take before leaving UVA, it's hers. Highly recommended."
10259,907388,5.0,2.0,By far the best teacher I've had.  She explains things very well and goes out of her way to help students.  She is one of the few teachers who care about her students understanding it rather than teaching by the book.
10260,907388,5.0,1.0,"Diana is the only teacher you want to take Calculus from!! Everybody loves her, and she makes everything so easy to understand. She's one of those teachers that wants everyone to get an A, and is incredibly available if you need help."
10261,907388,4.5,1.0,"by far the best and easiest calc 1 teacher in the department.  DO NOT screw up and choose someone else.  she gives the quiz questions ahead of time, her homework answers are on collab, and she's ALWAYS available for help! if you took bc calc in high school, then this class is a BREEZE!"
10262,907388,5.0,1.0,"Diana is a fantastic teacher. I took BC calc in high school and hated it so when I took 131 I wasn't expecting anything different. BUT Diana has made me love math again. She gives you quiz questions ahead of time and the answers for the homework is always on collab. Also, no need for a text book. I didn't open mine."
10263,907388,5.0,3.0,Very good teacher.  She gives out handouts which you write the notes down on enabling you to actually learn the material as you go along.  Fair tests and she had a lot of office hours if you needed help.
10264,907388,5.0,1.0,"She is a really good teacher.  She gives you all of the quizes ahead of time. If you study, you will do very well.  I would definitely recommend her for this class."
10265,907388,2.5,3.0,She does not teach very clearly at all.  She rambles on and does not seem sure of herself at all when demonstrating examples.  Very often makes mistakes and does not catch them herself; students have to catch them for her.  Thank God I took this class in high school or I would have no idea what is going on or how to do anything.  Not recommended.
10266,907388,4.5,3.0,Very nice and helpful... has office hours five days per week! Definitely recommended.
10267,907388,5.0,2.0,"She is the BEST teacher you could EVER have for Calculus I. She's clear, helpful, and really gets you to understand the material."
10268,907388,5.0,2.0,"She's a GREAT teacher! The sections she taught of 121 had a much higher average than ones taught by other teachers. She's always there for extra help, VERY approachable. She's super nice and wants everyone to do well. There are graded practice tests done in groups of 3-4 people before you take each test, so you know what's coming. LOVE her!"

10270,907388,4.5,2.0,"She is such a sweetheart. She gives you notes and explains everything in detail. She is willing to help and adjust. She grades easy. Out of the math teachers, pick Diana. I was disappointed when I found out she wasn't teaching 122 : ("
10271,907388,5.0,1.0,"Quite possibly the BEST math teacher you could have for math 121. Explains everything VERY clearly, goes over many examples and makes sure everyone understands. She comes prepared and is very nice and has a very flexible schedule. Even if you refuse to learn she will impart calculus into you-thnx to her tests were a joke"
10272,940162,3.5,3.0,Rachna is not the best teacher. She is kind un unorganized and is not the best at explaining. She is very approachable though and willing to help interested students.
10273,940162,1.0,5.0,terrible teacher had to work my butt off to pull off a decent grade.
10274,940162,2.0,4.0,Not a good teacher. Never has the notes online on time. Too caught up in her research to care about teaching. Unorganized. Gets herself confused when doing example problems in class. Often comes to class unprepared and asks to use a student's printed out notes to teach.
10275,940162,1.5,4.0,"Not a very good teacher at all. Very flighty and often confuses herself when trying to teach, then gets upset with the class when they question her because her teaching made no sense.  Assignments and exams often contain material never learned and she acknowledges this fact, simply assuming that we should know as much as her. Also very unorganized."
10276,940162,2.5,4.0,"Rachna is not the best teacher. avoid if u can. if ur econ-minded, you may do well. i was just trying to have some fun and get a basis in econ. take elzinga if u can! i could not fit him in my sched. rachna will get offended if u attack her positions. not good at explaining, pretty unclear. talks/moves pretty fast thru lecture."
10277,940162,2.0,3.0,Not very clear in explanations given and she tends to run on with those explanations
10278,940162,5.0,2.0,Made me interested in Econ. Awesome teacher!
10279,940162,4.5,2.0,Rachna is a very likable instructor. I like her style of teaching. She makes the material very interesting for the class.
10280,940162,2.0,5.0,Easy class if you want to get a good grade not for learning anything.  I believe she does not care about her students. She came the first day of class and she told us about her research and she in way implied that this is where her interests lay. She did not try to explained staff but instead she was going very fast during the entire semester. I m
10281,940162,4.0,4.0,No Comments
10282,940162,4.5,2.0,Rachna is a good teacher her lectures are easy to understand. She is very approachable and helpful outside of class.
10283,940162,1.0,2.0,"Very bad teacher, doesn't make an effort at all even though she's new... quizzes are tricky because of the wording of her questions rather than because of the material. Her lectures are a complete waste of time, sometimes people just walk out while her back's turned. I got a pretty good grade but i wouldn't take her if someone else is available."
10284,489603,5.0,4.0,"I totally forgot to write a review after taking this class. Bux is incredible, take this class with him if he's still teaching it."
10285,489603,4.0,4.0,This was a GREAT class.  It makes many other math classes make sense in retrospect.  Bux was usually easy to follow (he would outline a &quot;machine&quot; for solving each type of problem) and funny.  His tests were hard but he acknowledged this and curved accordingly.  It's a very practical class with little emphasis on theory.
10286,489603,4.5,4.0,"Very nice and funny.  He always answers questions clearly and it's usually easy to follow what he's doing.  His lectures tend to be pretty applied and the homework questions follow them up well.  In fact, he was only minimally theoretical the entire semester.  That's the advantage of APMA over MATH, I guess."
10287,489603,4.5,3.0,"Yes it's a hard class, but Bux is great. He takes a very theoretical approach during lecture, but tests are mostly computational math, with about 2 conceptual q's. Go to his office hours, he's always really really nice, enjoys helping students. Expect to work hard, it's a 300 level math class."
10288,489603,1.0,5.0,"Stay away from Bux. He's really tough and teaches everything theoretically. More than half of the class always gets below a C after the curve, and he is non-chalant about that. Furthermore, he is really concerned about his image so I suspect he wrote the initial rating on this page."
10289,489603,5.0,1.0,Bux is a wild man!  One of the most entertaining professors I've had.  He also has a good sense of humor and knows when students aren't understanding his lecture.  One warning: don't let your cellphone go off in his class.
10290,292996,3.0,3.0,death and dying and holcomb are pretty overrated. the class is 80% boring. he can be interesting at times but from my personal experiences with him he was an a--hole and not helpful. TA was awful. i dont get why so many ppl are on this guys nuts cuz this class really isnt worth the effort required to do well. he assigns way too many boring readings
10291,292996,3.5,2.0,"To me the class seemed a bit overrated. However, he does have interesting examples but talks about his wife too much during lecture. Part of the lecture is interesting but part of it can be rather dull. Do the readings and get into a study group before the exams and you'll do good. Also make sure you are on Holcomb's good side or he will screw you."
10292,292996,4.5,3.0,"Overall a really interesting class. For a professor that doesn't use powerpoint, he really holds your attention. Not too difficult, but the final was graded a bit tougher than the other tests making the grades a little lower than expected. Would recommend though, just study for it."
10293,292996,5.0,1.0,"This is by far the best class I've ever taken! I am a sociology major because of it. Class is interesting; I never wanted to miss a lecture. He's a good lecturer. If you don't want to read, get in a study group before a test and you'll be fine. Tests are easy and final took one hour (not cumulative). Go to lunch with him. BEST PROFESSOR AND CLASS!"
10294,292996,2.5,4.0,This class is for first years who are really anxious to get into academia. I did not like it waste of time a few interesting things but overall I did not learn anything useful. Really a shame could have taken so many other classes what a waste.
10295,292996,5.0,3.0,justin is one of the best professors at UVA and Violence Gender Poverty is the best class i have taken. justin is friendly and open with the class. discussion comes easily in the class environment. im not a soc major and most of the class wasnt either. if you want a class that you will be sad leave at the end of the semester take 338 (or 220).
10296,292996,4.5,3.0,"Wonderful professor! So easy going, friendly, and helpful. He even gave out study guides for the midterm and final. I would definitely recommend taking this course"
10297,292996,4.5,1.0,"Prof Holcomb is the man, he genuinely cares about the students, and his class is easy!"
10298,292996,5.0,5.0,"Got to do the reading! I usually hate going to lectures, but I Iooked forward to Holcomb's lectures. He seems to care lots about students too, which is a nice change."
10299,292996,4.5,2.0,"This class was okay. It starts out fairly interesting, but the lectures became very routine. Most of the reading is boring, except Roach. Prof. Holcomb was very extremely nice."
10300,292996,4.0,3.0,"the class is okay. well it's not that big a challenge and the professor is nice. still, readings are not that easy and some of them get pretty boring. the most important thing is getting into a study group before exams. overall it's an above average class. i think it's overated here a little bit."
10301,292996,5.0,3.0,Justin is the most amazing professor and lecturer in the SOC/RELC department.  Passionate!
10302,292996,4.0,3.0,"This is a good clas to learn about the rituals associated with death, the rise of the funeral industry in America, and Justin Holcomb.  He talks about himself and his wife half the time, when he's not plugging some other class he teaches.  But the reading is somewhat interesting and the paper isn't too strenuous."
10303,292996,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely amazing. Favorite class, super laid back and still really interesting.  Justin is obviously really knowledgable and completely down to earth.  Completely recommend it."
10304,292996,5.0,4.0,"This was my favorite class at UVa.  It's fun, it's not too hard, and it's fascinating.  Do whatever it takes to get into Death and Dying."
10305,292996,5.0,1.0,"great professor, a simply amazing lecturer who captivated me all year with interesting discussions.  He speaks at the perfect pace to take notes, and answers any questions you have.  I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and highly recommend Justin as a fantastic professor."
10306,292996,5.0,2.0,"A fair amount of reading is involved, but Justin's Death and Dying course is fueled by his own passion and interest - which makes it doubly fun.  Don't ever give up this class if you've got the chance to take it - the material's interesting, he's a wonderful professor, and it's just a great experience."
10307,292996,5.0,2.0,"Justin is a great professor. His lectures are very interesting and he's a funny guy. Tests are mostly short-answer, but he gives you a study guide before hand telling you everything you need to know. DEFINITELY take this class if you can."
10308,292996,5.0,2.0,"This is possibly my favorite class, ever. The material is so interesting, and Justin is a great and funny lecturer. You can skip lectures and he'll post them online before the midterm and final, but the class is so engaging that I wouldn't recommend missing unless you have to! Average amount of reading, 2 papers. Take this class!!!"
10309,292996,5.0,3.0,"If you can possibly manage to squeeze Death and Dying into your schedule, do it!  Justin is young, energetic and really helpful.  You'll learn a lot, but he won't kill you with work."
10310,292996,5.0,2.0,"justin is such a great professor - besides being hilarious, the content he presents is all really interesting and i felt like i learned a lot. the readings he gives aren't overwhelming and they're all really interesting! if you have the chance to take death + dying with justin, DO!!!! you won't regret it!!!!"
10311,292996,4.0,2.0,only knows christianity---does not have extensive knowledge on islam and other religions.  he just kind of made some stuff up about how jews were &quot;supposed&quot; to take muslim lands b/c it's &quot;their right.&quot;  wastes a lot of time at the beginning of class talking about his personal life.
10312,292996,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting class. His lectures are usually clear, sometimes a lot of extra info, but neat. Just make sure you PAY ATTENTION (don't talk or read newspapers or he'll call you out). Otherwise, it's a good class.  Takes work and studying, but before the tests GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS with Brian Dunn. They really help!"
10313,292996,3.5,4.0,"Justin is an awesome lecturer and great guy.  He really wants to have relationships with his students which is awesome.  Lectures are always very clear.  However I think as a professor, he is very disorganized.  He doesn't set due dates or makes concrete decisions and leaves it up to students.  Seems like he flops together his classes last minute."
10314,292996,5.0,3.0,"He's a great teacher who wants to get feedabck from the class. If something is bothering you, or if there he assigned too much reading, just tell him and he'll rty to fix it. Good class, very relaxed."
10315,292996,3.5,2.0,No Comments
10316,292996,3.0,3.0,"Interesting class, a bunch of pointless papers and sometimes jumbled info. in lectures.  But not too hard and really makes you think/revise your opinions about death and dying."
10317,292996,4.0,1.0,He's very easy to approach.  INteresting topics.  GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS!!
10318,292996,4.5,2.0,"If you do the readings and go to the lectures and study sessions, the class is a breeze. Plus VERY interesting. Prof. Holcomb is such a awesome guy and a great lecturer. He includes lots of helpful examples and anecdotes. This was definitely my favorite class this year."
10319,292996,5.0,5.0,Professor Holcomb derives much of his power from his eyebrows...his eyebrows and his pectoral muscles.  Tasty.
10320,292996,1.0,2.0,No Comments
10321,292996,4.5,1.0,Holcomb was the quintessential professor for this course.  He established firm guidelines.  H allowed the students to interact with him one-on-one in order to understand the information.  He may be the best professor I've had here; his experiences in the &quot;real-world&quot; and in the classroom are superb.
10322,292996,5.0,3.0,"Vibrant person and you will enjoy him a lot, even though the material was pretty dismal and at times boring.  Came out with a much lower grade than was expecting, but still enjoyed the class."
10323,292996,5.0,2.0,"A professor that genuinely cares about his students.  He's laid back and fun, but brilliant at the same time."
10324,292996,1.0,4.0,Perpetual buzz kill.
10325,292996,3.5,2.0,"Well the class was boring, but if you want a pretty good grade with SOME moderately interesting material, take this class."
10326,292996,5.0,3.0,loved the love-life updates. hilariously disastrous.
10327,292996,5.0,2.0,definitely recommend any of his classes - i took his relg and soc class and he's completely helpful and genuinely a good guy!
10328,292996,5.0,2.0,"This class rocks. The material rocks. The professor rocks...in more ways than one. Definitely take this. Also, Shania Twain rocks...my world."

10330,292996,5.0,3.0,"LOVE him. probably going to minor in religion because of him. definitely take any of his classes. oh, and if you see this, my number is..."
10331,292996,5.0,2.0,good lectures
10332,292996,5.0,4.0,"He gives great lectures and he communicates difficult concepts clearly!  He expects more (with regard to readings and exams) than I anticipated from a 101 course.  The class was challenging for me, but I'd still take any course he teaches."
10333,292996,5.0,3.0,GREAT professor.  Engages everyone even in a large lecture  hall. I would HIGHLY recommend any course he teaches.  Best teacher I've had at UVa thus far.
10334,292996,5.0,1.0,I love the stories and jokes.  Oh!  Your rock band was funny too!
10335,292996,5.0,1.0,great teacher-easy class- TAKE IT!
10336,292996,5.0,3.0,"Because of Justin, I want to major in religion--that being his goal at the beginning of the semester (I was bio major). Thank you. Justin is a dynamic lecturer, giving out tons of information all the while making it appealing.  And he's just so personable"
10337,292996,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, clear and concise lectures with straightforward exams.  I guess I should add &quot;he's a sexy and funny storyteller.&quot;  Sheesh."
10338,292996,5.0,2.0,Professor Holcomb is a great professor.  His stories help ease into class.  His enthusiasm forces students to enjoy the subject.  Not only do I enjoy this class but I am interested in becoming a Religion major thanks to Professor Holcomb!
10339,292996,5.0,2.0,"GREAT teacher, makes religion really interesting, and it's fun to hear his stories!"
10340,292996,4.5,1.0,Holcomb is so cute and down to earth- great stories everyday!  Even in a class of 250 or so he makes it feel small by taking questions and repeating things if necessary.  Very approachable and determined to make the class average a B+.
10341,292996,4.5,1.0,"So sweet and funny.  Great lecturer/story-teller.  Obviously cares about subject matter and students. Tests &quot;what you know, not what you don't know.&quot;"
10342,292996,5.0,2.0,No Comments
10343,292996,5.0,1.0,WOW! This professor really gets you hooked. His lectures and quizes are one of the easiest I know (he tells you what will be on the midterm). He'll start off the class by telling us a story that ALWAYS crack us up. He's cute too!
10344,292996,5.0,3.0,"Professor Holcomb is so nice! His lectures are interesting, and he genuinely wants to help his students achieve good grades. Definitely take a class with him if you get a chance."
10345,473228,5.0,2.0,GREAT class
10346,473228,5.0,3.0,"The greatest teacher I've ever seen. You learn from him every minute, from what he says, and even from what he doesn't say. Very wise, and clearly a genius, he never talks down to you. Always listens and responds where YOU are, not where HE is."
10347,1480856,5.0,3.0,"From my experience, he is the best professor the politics department has. He made the topic extremely enjoyable and relevant to today's world of politics. I would take a class with him any day! 2 and a half hours seemed to fly with him. He is very engaging and interesting! He made each student feel important, which makes a world of difference!"
10348,1480856,5.0,3.0,This class was a great start to politics. It covers several topics but also includes many constructive and in-depth discussions. Professor Russell is a great instructor and really knows the material well. The class is discussion based and he does a great job at facilitating these talks while teaching at the same time. Highly recommend
10349,2447512,5.0,3.0,"Easily one of my favorite professors. She is extremely passionate and caring. Unfortunately, the course itself has lots of annoying hw to do but if you just do it you'll be fine. She is easy to meet with and very helpful. Put the work in and you can definitely get an A. I am taking her again for 1020 and am super excited!"
10350,710811,2.0,4.0,"Iggy is a nice, friendly guy, but he has organized his class around lectures and lectures are not his strong suit. He does know what he's talking about but you're better off asking him in person than listening to him fly through 30 slides. Tends to wax romantic about Nobel prize winners who don't matter. His exams are hard."
10351,710811,5.0,4.0,"Whoever commented below must be a graduate student or something. There was one person in the class who mastered the material like it was a piece of cake (100's on each exam). This class definitely requires attention and hard work for the average student. Great professor though. Completely willing to help you out. Exams were fair, but difficult."
10352,710811,5.0,1.0,One of the best professors at UVA. Really taught some neat things and very engaging. Exams were cake. This class didn't require a lot of work....
10353,710811,4.0,4.0,"Friendly, approachable, clear, engaging. There's a lot of material and conceptual information to know and he explains it very well. One of my favorite professors in one of my favorite courses."
10354,710811,3.0,4.0,He is a nice guy but this is a hard class and he doesn't make it easier.  Its hard material and his test is picky.  Hes helpful though and will sit down with you and explain things.  Also he does make clear what he wants you to really know.  And that stuff you really have to inside and out
10355,710811,2.5,5.0,"He Is not a good proffsor at all, for all of you who feel you don't understand him in the first classes just drop his class and don't waste time, he is not clear, his exmas are super hard, to be fair he has a nice character but if you wanna get good grade in his class you have to study neuro 24/7 if not you'll definetley fail his class!"
10356,710811,2.0,5.0,Didn't like this class at all. I thought the lectures were disorganized and the tests super specific. Text sucked; better to read the alt texts where he gets his images. I recommend recording the lectures since he goes really fast through details. Take BIOL317 instead of PSYC220 before this class or you are at a disadvantage. Large grading curve.
10357,710811,4.5,2.0,"This class was awesome.  Iggy is a great teacher, and makes sure everyone does well in the class.  Make sure to attend, as he throws random one question quizzes at you for attendance.  The material is great, and includes current topics that are interesting."
10358,710811,5.0,4.0,"Iggy rules!  The exams are difficult, but fair.  The material is engaging and Iggy is a spectacular lecturer.  He is easy to get along with and easily accessible.  Take one of his classes if you like the material, it will be worthwhile."
10359,710811,5.0,4.0,"Provencio is kind, caring, funny, and always willing to help a student understand.  His lectures were very clear, and his slides are very clear too.  Study hard for his test: I didn't really study all the details, skipped some class, and lightly skimmed some of the chapters and got a 58% (avg was 76).  The class was definitely worthwhile though! &lt;3"
10360,710811,5.0,3.0,"I can't figure out why others do not like this man. He's smart, personable, kind. What more do you want&#63;"
10361,710811,4.5,3.0,Pretty hard but fair.  He should provide slides before lectures.
10362,710811,5.0,4.0,Conveyed difficult material in a clear concise manner.  He was enthusiatic in his teaching style.  Exam was difficult but fair.
10363,710811,2.0,5.0,Didn't outline the class well at all.  Unfair test.
10364,710811,1.5,5.0,"Started out ok, but went downhill fast. Sucked all the life out of the material and lectured directly from his indecipherable slides. Tested the most ridiculus picky details. Class average for the first test was a D+. Over all, couldn't have been worse."
10365,1480861,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Chien is amazing! She makes the class so interesting and fun. Someone in our class jokingly suggested we skip a class and do yoga, and she booked the yoga room at the cary street gym and we all met there! She is fun, energetic, and hilarious. Really cares about her students. 10/10"
10366,1480861,4.0,3.0,"She's kind, funny, and very knowledgeable about the subject. You're allowed seven absences, given lots of extra credit opportunities (0.5 points added to your final grade), and there are 3 or 4 tests  which aren't too difficult if you understand the basics of the topic. I would take her again, for sure."
10367,1480861,5.0,1.0,"Best teacher ever, she's cool and her class is easy too."
10368,2406557,5.0,2.0,I loved her class! I think she really cares about her students.
10369,1685665,4.5,2.0,"Hands down the best spanish professor at UVA. He's extremely engaging, passionate, and pretty goofy. He loves class participation. The majority of our grade came from papers. I had him for J-term and am taking another class with him this semester."
10370,1513636,5.0,4.0,"Professor Goldblatt was a great professor, and her class was super fun. Lead very engaging discussions, and gave good feedback on papers. Her class was pretty heavy on reading and work, but if you put effort into you can get an A."
10371,1513636,5.0,3.0,"Laura is truly an amazing educator. She is extremely well-versed in the material, easily understood in lectures, engaging during discussions, and specific in her feedback. I found her class to be both incredibly interesting and exceptionally informative."
10372,1513636,5.0,3.0,"Laura is easily the best professor/teacher Ive ever had. While we are graded by a few things (group projects/short papers), she makes sure to give detailed and precise feedback for how to improve for the next assignment. Definitely make sure to take her engagement class if given the opportunity."
10373,1513636,5.0,3.0,GSGS 2559- Global Culture and Commerce was co-taught by Prof. Goldblatt and Prof. Richard Handler. It was a really great class! Prof. Goldblatt is funny and explains things clearly. She encourages questions and comments and reacts kindly to all input. I could never make office hours and she arranged alternate times for me to meet whenever I wanted.
10374,1513636,5.0,3.0,"Laura is one of the best professors I've had. She genuinely cares about her students and gives constructive feedback on papers. She's a phenomenal discussion leader, and I felt that all her assignments were extremely worthwhile. She is brilliant, but also super relatable at the same time, a combination that all professors should strive to attain!"
10375,1513636,5.0,2.0,"I LOVE LAURA! Global Humanities class was my favorite. She is so nice and insanely knowledgeable about all the topics we discusses. Seriously, this class is so good it should be required at UVA. It was eye opening. We studied Kara Walker, Islam, BLM movement, and lots more.  Grading was through three short papers and a final paper."
10376,1513636,5.0,2.0,"She is the BEST! So nice, super funny, and gives helpful feedback on her papers. This class was also really interesting; she pulled from all different types of materials (movies, songs, novels, short stories, poems). Would definitely recommend."
10377,1513636,5.0,1.0,"Love her!! She's so funny and nice, and the class was a breeze. The course was very liberal, and she always respected students' opinions and helped us with papers. There were no structured quizzes or exams, just take home papers. Was my favorite class all semester."
10378,1513636,4.5,2.0,She really did save my semester! I failed one of the three papers that were assigned for this class (I eventually had the opportunity to drop it) and she provided such helpful feedback for my third paper. We had such great conversations in her office hours and she definitely has a refreshingly hip perspective on college.
10379,1513636,5.0,3.0,She is very helpful and will always look over outlines and parts of your paper. She is very good about meeting too if you want to talk about paper ideas. Her comments are very meaningful. Also she is very smart and her discussions are great! I highly recommend!
10380,1513636,4.5,1.0,"Laura is a great discussion leader.  Her comments on papers were very helpful and she is very smart (she was in the Jefferson Fellow).  I would recommend her to any student, especially if you love participating in discussions!"
10381,2676909,5.0,3.0,"Profesora Beveridge is super caring and helpful. If you keep track of deadlines ahead of time and make an effort to participate in each class, you can get a lot out of the course in addition to a fair grade."
10382,2676909,1.0,4.0,"Avoid at all costs. I'm not even halfway through the semester yet and I've had a project, oral assessment, test, and the freaking final project (3-5 page paper) due IN THE SAME WEEK. What kind of monster makes the final project due in week 6 of 14 right in the middle of midterm season WITH NO EXTENSIONS ALLOWED? Please don't take this class!"
10383,2742449,3.0,2.0,talks fast in lecture
10384,39099,2.0,5.0,"SKIP!  ALL LECTURE and INCREDIBLY BORING. Virtually no class participation, yet attendance is mandatory if you want to pass.   He's a VERY TOUGH GRADER who doesn't outline the grading structure beforehand or apply equal standards; all of the 'grades' he hands out are incredibly ambiguous, and for some reason he thinks VERY highly of himself."
10385,39099,3.5,3.0,"Despite having a large class size of 300-400 students, Dr. Sabato makes a sincere effort to make himself available immediately after class and tries to create a personalized connection with students.  His lectures are solid and have many personal anecdotes that maintain interest.  He does not spoon-feed the material."
10386,39099,1.5,4.0,"This class killed my interest in politics.Like the gridlock in DC, Sabato and my TA love to hear themselves talk but say nothing. The TA you get is critical. I hear some care. Mine does not except about hearing himself speak. Little guidance in what to study. Exams are set up to twist and turn meanings. Speakers are great though. Class is not."
10387,39099,4.0,2.0,"The speakers that Sabato gets are great. Readings consist of his books and a text book, neither too dense. 1 midterm, 1 paper, and 1 exam that are not too bad if you go to lecture and do the reading."
10388,39099,3.5,3.0,Nothing pleases Sabato more than hearing himself talk. And every sentence he says he has a freakout. Lectures aren't very important. TA's DO matter though. They do all your grading.  Carah Ong was my TA and she was awesome. Try to snag her if you can.
10389,39099,5.0,3.0,One of the most outstanding professors I have ever had.  Took interest in us in students and is brilliant.  Great ambassador for UVA.
10390,39099,2.5,3.0,Tests are difficult because there isn't enough time to finish them and you still get penalized for not finishing the exam even if NO ONE finished it.
10391,39099,2.5,3.0,"Prof. Sabato is an interesting teacher but he teaches in antecdotes and uses class as a bit of a soapbox. Your TA is the one that grades everything. All the textbooks are written by him, but the TAs do all the grading so you don't have to agree with him. LOTS of reading and lots of work for a 100 level course."
10392,39099,2.5,4.0,"This class was horrible. The tests were ridiculous and the questions were far to specific. There was no direction for studying; my TA was not helpful whatsoever and never had even a vague idea of what was going to be on the test. Going to class is pointless save for the visitors. Unless you plan to major, forget it."
10393,39099,2.0,1.0,Take this class for the visitors. Class attendance is not necessary as the exams come from the textbook. Don't bother taking notes in lecture.
10394,39099,3.5,2.0,"Overrated class. Wayyy too much work for a 100-level class, but alas, it serves as a filter for politics majors. Be sure to read the text. His other books are not entirely necessary, but are helpful. The paper assignment was pretty easy, but I feel as if the TAs are told to grade the assignments with excessive harshness."
10395,39099,2.5,2.0,"Over the semester, I have come to despise this class. Lectures are boring more often than not. The only thing that made the class worth it was the visitors! I would not recommend this class if you are trying to see if you have an interest in politics. It is not helpful! Exams are horrible! There is ZERO direction for studying. Take Ceaser's 101."

10399,39099,2.0,4.0,"I felt betrayed by a grading system shrouded in secrecy: Sabato claimed the course was not graded on a curve, yet..Our TA sent us our final grades, and I and others later went on ISIS only to find that our grades had been lowered! Our TA couldn't explain it, and the Head TA wouldn't explain it-his response to my e-mail was curt and rude."
10400,39099,3.5,4.0,take a small class if you want to interact with him...very busy outside of class so large lecture will only allow class time with him....one on one very knowledgeable...
10401,39099,4.5,5.0,"Great J-Term class, but a LOT of work.  Sabato is very knowledgeable and has lots of insider stories to share.  Try to take a small class with him if possible."
10402,39099,2.5,3.0,"Clearly would rather be in politics than acadamia. Overrated and more interested in running after journalists than teaching and very comfortable in the &quot;old boy&quot; network. Takes time with students who will be helpful to him later. If you're not part of the old boy network and don't want to be, avoid it."
10403,39099,3.5,4.0,"Mixed feeling. On one hand, it's a good subject to know, and Sabato knows a lot. He's been IN politics, and he doesn't lecture partisanly; plus he can be pretty funny. BUT. you have to read HIS books, and they are rambling at times. so much info youre not sure WHAt you need for the tests (answer: all). good guy, but he is definitely overrated."
10404,39099,2.5,4.0,"Get the hell out of the class while you still can.  This was my lowest grade at UVA.  Thanks, Sabato and TAs, for making a decent subject hard for no reason and probably keeping me out of law school."
10405,39099,4.0,3.0,"Sabato is a fascinating lecturer, but be careful about the TAs!!  Some are way more difficult than others, but the hardest one isn't too hard.  Made himself very approachable after class by holding small discussions to those who could spare 45 min. after class...definitely take advantage of them!!  He's really really knowledgable."

10408,39099,4.0,2.0,"He is a great lecturer and obviously very knowledgable.  I did find him intimidating, but I very rarely missed his class and I would highly recommend taking it.  It is still one of my favorites."
10409,39099,5.0,2.0,"He knows what he's talking about, has lots of examples, pretty easy. Not as amazing as I'd imagined, but still glad I took it."
10410,39099,3.0,3.0,completely overrated.
10411,39099,1.5,3.0,"Not available for students, too self-interested.  Overrated by far."
10412,39099,2.0,4.0,I took his class because everyone said he was an amazing teacher. That was definitely an overstatement. He's not available for students and I feel is more pre-occupied with his politicking. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you're interested in taking a class that is &quot;tradition at UVA&quot;.
10413,39099,5.0,3.0,"sabato's a rockstar, and i'm seriously considering becoming a groupie"
10414,39099,1.0,3.0,"Larry Sabato loves himself more than he loves to teach students; his ego obstructs my learning. Pompous and arrogant - he really tries to take the spotlight from everyone in the room. He's a nice guy at heart, but he should ease off the self-centered thing he has going."
10415,39099,3.5,3.0,"he is the most quoted college professor in America.  You have to make the most out of his class, he won't do it for you, but you can learn a lot.  The guest speakers are amazing.  Talk to him out of class.  He is UVA through and through.  He is very busy, so value his time. Politics is a good thing!"
10416,39099,1.0,5.0,overappreciated
10417,39099,5.0,2.0,Larry Sabato is truly an amazing individual. His lectures are so filled with life and interest. This class should be part of everyones experience at UVa. It was one of my favorites.
10418,39099,5.0,3.0,"If you ask this guy for help, he'll give it to you.  He'd give you the shirt off his back.  Take the class.  It's good for a laugh.  He's a funny guy"

10421,39099,4.0,2.0,"He knows everything about American politics and is one of UVA's best professors. Entertaining, interesting class; I enjoyed going. One of my favorite professors."
10422,39099,1.0,4.0,"Pure hype.  He rambles on about nothing relevant to the course material, yet he takes attendance so you have to go.  He is constantly changing the syllabus as well, and the TAs hardly ever know what's going on.  I'm wondering what exactly I learned..."
10423,39099,1.5,4.0,"biggest mistake ever. it's like AP government again, but harder, less clear(Sabato goes off on random tangents, nothing he says in class is on the tests), and harder graders. either take it with Ceaser or avoid this altogether."
10424,39099,1.0,3.0,worst course i've ever taken.

10431,39099,3.5,4.0,"interesting course, awesome guest speakers, sabato is entertaining, not the easiest 101 class"

10433,39099,3.0,3.0,"Pretty pompous...occasionally entertaining lectures, but basically your best bet is to read all 10 of (his) books and either skip class or go to the overflow room."
10434,39099,3.5,5.0,"ok, so he may be a bit pompous, but he knows a hell of a lot about politics.  he is amusing and really knows his stuff."

10438,39099,3.0,2.0,"I was disappointed.  He has each student by nearly 10 books, all written by himself.  While the profits may go to the Center for Politics, Sabato is in charge of the Center, and as such recieves all recognition for the money he raises."
10439,39099,2.0,4.0,"Horrible. The entire class is about promoting himself. I had to buy 10 books and a CD all written by himself, then couldn't sell them back. Entirely overrated."
10440,39099,4.5,3.0,"Sabato is an amazing professor.  A few students do not enjoy the class as they do not meet up to the high standards he sets for his students. Although all books are written by himself, the royalties go to the Center for Politics and not to Sabato."
10441,39099,4.5,2.0,Politics is a good thing!
10442,39099,4.5,3.0,"Sabato is a brilliant professor and political analyst. He teaches everything straight-forward whether you like it or not. I only took his class to have experienced him as a teacher (I tested out of PLAP 101), and it was well worth it."

10447,39099,1.0,2.0,"Terrible!! He does not teach - he just performs. If not for the TAs, it would be a waste of time taking this class. He is just concerned with promoting himself and his books."
10448,39099,1.5,3.0,"Course is pure fluff; 7 books, he wrote 'em all."

10450,39099,3.0,2.0,Slightly self-centered
10451,39099,5.0,3.0,Sabato is the man!
10452,39099,3.0,2.0,going to class is like reading his autobiography
10453,39099,5.0,2.0,"interesting and entertaining, but useless to attend, tangents galore"
10454,1054908,5.0,1.0,having prof sato was great
10455,1054908,4.5,1.0,"Mme Sato is VERY HELPFUL AND a pretty good grader.She is extremely sweet and not at all indimidating.We watched a lot of movies and it wasn't bad because there were english subtitles.Some thought she spoke too much English,but I think that's anyday better than someone bombarding u with superfast french."
10456,1054908,5.0,1.0,Really nice teacher and not a hard grader.
10457,1054908,5.0,1.0,Mme. Sato is a wonderful teacher who will really help with learning grammar and conversation. She is extremely approachable and she makes class interesting. Don't be surprised if you watch YouTube during class....
10458,2742462,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed his class a lot. If you don't have solid background knowledge, don't bother. He starts from the root and makes things easily understandable. He is pretty flexible and knows a lot. He keeps students concentrated in his class."
10459,1808579,5.0,3.0,Debra is amazing!
10460,1808579,4.0,2.0,"Caring, understanding, knowledgeable poet and professor. She offers detailed, insightful feedback for all writers, though can come off somewhat critical. Her classes are slightly under-planned but she encourages student participation in class discussions. Extremely sweet and observant! Highly recommend a class with her."
10461,1669315,5.0,2.0,Dr. Siegler gets more enjoyable once the class goes more in-depth with the unit of warfare further in the semester. Many group projects and presentations that will get you a good grade if you follow the guidelines. Small readings are due to each class but they are manageable if you give them 15 minutes of your time. Would definitely recommend.
10462,1669315,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sigler rocks - the course material was cool, she gave lots of opportunity to perfect your writing before turning in (in class workshops, office hours)."
10463,1669315,4.0,3.0,"She's a good teacher but makes a student co-teach each class, it's not hard and it's good for participation which is a part of your grade. Her papers and textbook are based off wars throughout history. It was boring at first but it gets a better towards the end of the semester."
10464,1669315,4.0,4.0,"She is one of the sweetest professors I've had here. Her office hours are extremely helpful. Some of the content in her class is pretty dry, but once you get into more recent wars, it gets a lot more interesting. She expects full participation and effort, so speak often and go to class."
10465,375000,5.0,3.0,"Fowler is one of the best professors in the English department because her compassion for students steers her teaching. She is kind and patient, and she bends over backwards to help every student learn something and feel good about the semester. She is especially helpful to students who are not English majors, patiently teaching everyone new terms."
10466,375000,1.0,2.0,Fowler is totally disorganized. Class discussions are rambling and unplanned and it's not clear what you're supposed to get from them. Class is almost entirely digression. Horribly unstructured.
10467,375000,5.0,3.0,An incredibly gifted lecturer who assigns an inclusive set of readings. Lectures usually connect pre-1800 writing to recent events while establishing the context in which authors were writing. A surprising number of guest lecturers to introduce students to the department. Participation is 40 percent of the grade but includes weekly written work!
10468,375000,5.0,2.0,"Fowler's class is very interesting and fairly easy as long as you read and show up to discussion. Passage ID's are huge, but aside from that she is very straightforward and offers a lot of extra credit opportunities. Also a very nice person who loves when students come to office hours."
10469,375000,4.5,3.0,"Professor Fowler was quirky and always interesting.  I had no interest in Chaucer prior to signing up for this class, and just did it to knock out a pre 1800 requirement.  Now I absolutely love Chaucer.  She was very helpful and I definitely recommend this class to anyone."
10470,375000,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic, enthusiastic professor with high standards. Makes you want to do well in class."
10471,375000,5.0,2.0,"Incredible professor. So knowledgeable and so willing to help! She really made Chaucer attainable, and I now I absolutely adore him, even in middle english!"
10472,375000,3.0,2.0,"I started out incredibly disgusted and discouraged by Prof Fowler's unclear, rambling style.  However, after a few weeks I got the hang of it, and the material wasn't that hard.  About 30 of us  got A+'s on the midterm, and who knows how many got A's.  You'll do fine, just read everything for the passage IDs and get a helpful TA!"
10473,375000,2.5,5.0,"Her lectures are unfocused and you MUST go to class in order to get the information needed to pass. She is enthusiastic about it, but her voice tends to be monotone/soothing so try not to fall asleep...Good luck...."
10474,375000,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Fowler is great! While her lectures are usually unfocused, she bubbles over with enthusiasm about her subject. Prof. Fowler has also been really    accessible outside of class; she visited nearly every section before the exam. It is tough, but a little studying and you can ace it!"
10475,375000,3.0,3.0,"She loves the material which is endearing but her lectures are completely pointless and very poorly organized--I skipped at least once a week.  However, she does test on rather obscure material, so there is some benefit in going.  Overall, I just can't wait for this class to end."
10476,375000,1.5,5.0,DONT TAKE IT WITH FOWLE..SHE DISCOURAGE YOU FROM BEING AN ENGLISH MAJOR!
10477,375000,4.5,2.0,"Fowler is such a smart woman and it is apparent in her lectures. she is so enthusiastic about the material, it's hard not to be interested. her lectures were sometimes unfocused, but fun none the less. with an awesome ta, this class is great and engaging. (and you learn a ton)"
10478,375000,3.0,3.0,"Fowler is a very smart individual with lots to say even if its not clear what she wants you to take away from lecture. I agree that the fall 04 final was a total ****. I went in with a B+ and came out with a C+, ouch."
10479,375000,3.0,3.0,Fowler is an interesting lecturer (animated and energetic) BUT it's really hard to understand what one is supposed to take away from her lectures.  The final for Fall 04 was KILLER.  If you take this class know EVERYTHING for the final b/c she tests on really obscure poems that we didn't discuss.
10480,375000,3.5,2.0,"Fowler is a fine, quirky professor. I personally enjoyed her class, but some people found her lectures to be cloudy and non-topical. All in all, she is a great professor for those who are confident with the abilities of their TA."
10481,375000,4.5,3.0,"She is incredibly knowledgable about the topics she lectures on, but because she has so much to share and teach, the course moves pretty quickly.  She is animated and fun, and you can really tell that she enjoys teaching."
10482,375000,4.5,3.0,"If you are trying to knock off your pre 1800 requirement, look for a class taught by Fowler. I loved her Chaucer class. She is animated and interesting, and very interested in her students."
10483,2103517,5.0,3.0,"Mathieu is easily one of my favorite profs on grounds; he really cares about his students and often asks about workload and tries to make sure he isn't overwhelming us. Offers review sessions, extra credit, and isn't a stickler about being a few minutes late or needing a little more time to complete an assignment. He made class 5x a week enjoyable!"
10484,2103517,5.0,3.0,A fantastic French professor. Easily one of my favorite professor's on grounds
10485,2103517,5.0,3.0,He's really laid back with homework and projects. He also makes himself available after classes or by appointments if you wanna go over certain things. His French accent is great (he's from Paris) and he's also a stickler on pronunciation in a good way. He makes classes fun with personal stories and french videos.
10486,1816823,5.0,4.0,"I love Nora. She is my favorite teacher so far. She is engaging and sweet in class and guess what, she is pretty too! It is always so fun to see her make all kinds of cute faces while having her class. But to receive an A, 96 is required. It is not an easy A class. I am so sad my schedule doesn't allow me to take her class next semester! :("
10487,1816823,5.0,3.0,Profesora is awesome! She is extremely nice and always helpful! She responds promptly to emails and even made me consider becoming a spanish major! Definitely take this class (101) with her!
10488,1816823,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I ever had.. super helpful. always ready to assist you. Welcoming, not afraid to visit her. I actually learned something and was excited about it. Not to mention she was fine."
10489,1186044,3.5,5.0,"intimidating at first, but once you get to know him, he is fantastic. he does put you on the spot to see if you have done the work and if you can defend your opinions, but he is always open to discussion. he's friendly, personable, and very funny. extremely knowledgeable about many subjects."
10490,1186044,4.0,5.0,hard but worth it
10491,1186044,4.5,4.0,"You will learn. Can put you on the spot but is a not mean-spirited, but you must be prepared for every class.  I got a mediocre grade in 201 with him but took 202 with him because I felt I learned a lot in his class."
10492,1186044,5.0,4.0,"Obiedat is one of the best professors at UVa! He is REALLY funny, super smart, and incredibly knowledgeable. He can be harsh sometimes, but his high standards make students prepare and learn more than professors who baby their students. And he's not too bad looking either! I love this professor, he is wonderful. Highly recommend."
10493,1186044,4.5,3.0,"GREAT professor! Very knowledgeable, funny, and helpful!  He does like to put people on the spot during class and asks questions to keep people engaged. So come to class prepared!  He's FANTASTIC!"
10494,1186044,5.0,3.0,"Professor Obiedat is THE MAN. Period. He is funny, engaging, interesting, knowledgeable, and efficient. I would not change a thing. Obiedat is one of the best language teachers I have ever had."
10495,1186044,3.0,4.0,No Comments
10496,1186044,4.0,4.0,"ridiculously strict, though his structure does force you to learn. is very vague about where you stand grade-wise, even when directly asked"
10497,1677566,5.0,2.0,"Feng Laoshi is the best! The most fun class I had this sem. Most looked forward to it everyday. You learn so much and have to study everyday, but it is so worth it. She is very helpful and so sweet. She grades well and is consistent. The class started from knowing 0 Chinese... now we can talk. And write. And read. &#25105;&#24456;&#21916;&#27426;&#"
10498,825600,2.0,4.0,"Actually, she seems as if she is trying to help you about a topic or problem, but as she explains the topic, you don't understand it. But, you feel bad about asking again. Because she makes you feel that it is such a simple thing."
10499,825600,5.0,5.0,No Comments
10500,825600,1.0,5.0,"I had her as a TA for Phil 211. A nice person but she makes the already complicated material a 100 times more complicated when she attempts to explain or create examples. Made attending discussions really difficult. Unless you truly love or understand Aristotle, avoid having her as a TA."
10501,825600,5.0,1.0,she's so cool
10502,825600,1.0,5.0,"She was a TA for Phil 211, I agree with the other person, saps the fun out of discussions, by always interjecting when others comment.  Also, makes things harder than they should be, as well as having a hard time coming up with examples."
10503,825600,1.0,3.0,"I had her as a TA for PHIL 211, but now I see she's teaching a class, so I write this just to warn anyone who may be considering her as a teacher.  She is a genuinely nice person, but is unable to teach philosophy because she can't come up with examples to save her life, makes things absurdly complicated, and generally saps the fun out of it."
10504,514304,2.0,4.0,"Bad Office Hour, Doesn't know how to ""fairly"" grade you. Class overall hard to understand mostly due to his accent."
10505,514304,5.0,4.0,"This course will determine if you want to be a chemical engineer or not. Carta is the man, but this class is a good display of what chemical engineering is. If you are thinking about switching, do it immediately. The courses only get harder"
10506,514304,4.5,3.0,"Really good teacher.  As long as you take good notes during class, the quizzes aren't bad at all.  His accent is not that difficult to understand.  Make sure you start the semester long project early."
10507,514304,5.0,1.0,"easy class. carta's examples in class are very clear and helpful. homework is long but not too difficult. quizzes aren't bad, but time is a constraint."
10508,514304,3.0,4.0,"good professor, time is a BIG factor in tests. he's a dick during office hours. some people in my class also went to his office hours and thought the same thing"
10509,514304,4.5,4.0,No Comments
10510,514304,5.0,3.0,"you can learn a lot in this class. you have to work fast for the test, time is a big factor"
10511,514304,4.0,4.0,hard class.but he's very helpful.
10512,514304,4.5,3.0,"Good teacher, cute accent."
10513,628998,5.0,5.0,He has a great deal of experience and knowledge that he is willing to share.
10514,628998,5.0,4.0,Loves to hold discussions in lieu of lecture
10515,628998,4.5,1.0,He tells great stories.
10516,628998,1.0,1.0,Waist of time
10517,907531,4.0,3.0,"Rough around the edges, but if you attend class and meet him during office hours when uncertain about a topic, Pryor proves to be an apt, effective teacher. Homework is graded harshly, but he teaches you precision. The curve on final grades was fairly generously; not an easy class, but certainly not as bad as some reviews make it seem."
10518,907531,3.5,3.0,"Dan is actually very logical in his teaching.  He sometimes seems unhelpful during class, but if you see him individually he is super nice and helps you so much. His class isn't an easy A and he grades the homework/tests very harshly, but if you are looking to become a better mathematician, take his class."
10519,907531,1.5,5.0,"Miserable class. I dreaded going everyday because he makes it so boring and difficult that it is impossible to learn anything. Tests aren't too terrible, but he grades them so harshly that you end up getting a bad grade anyway. If I could do it over again, there is NO way I would take this class."
10520,907531,2.5,3.0,"Not a good teacher, he grades harshly, will take off for the smallest thing, he took of 5 points on my homework for not stapling it.  If i had the chance to choose my classes again i would stay as far away from him as i possibly could. NOT A GOOD TEACHER"
10521,907531,3.0,4.0,"As long as you go to office hours, Dan is very nice and helpful. However, his homework assignments were graded like take home tests and were extremely hard. Attendance is not mandatory and he drops 2 HW assignments, which is helpful. Lecture was pretty boring and I ended up learning everything from both the book and office hours."
10522,907531,2.0,2.0,"Makes lots of mistakes on the board, and is generally unhelpful answering your questions (for example, when someone asked when/where our exam was, he smirked and said &quot;check your email&quot;).  Grades homework harshly, twice took points off because I wrote .75 instead of 3/4.  I went to him to question his grading methods, and he just laughed."
10523,907531,3.5,4.0,"Prof. Pryor is a hard teacher, and yes he comes to class looking pretty grumpy. But its easy to do well in his class if you do the work. I heard a lot of people complaining over the semester and they didn't seem to be putting effort into working, just complaining, Also, he may not seem approachable, but if you go to his office he is really helpful."
10524,907531,1.0,5.0,"I agree with 10/31/06, the worst teacher ever. He's confusing and very unhelpful, and seems to care less that his class performs worse than any of the other sections. It's a good decision to avoid him."
10525,907531,2.0,4.0,"This dude is just miserable. He is unprepared for class and just seems lost in his own class sometimes. He isn't the most friendly of guys either. Don't waste your time at office hours, they are just his way of making you feel stupid and telling you to work out the &quot;practice problems&quot; he assigns each week. Avoid this guy."
10526,907531,1.0,5.0,"This will make you hate calculus. Pryor doesnt know what he is doing, always unprepared, makes TONS of mistakes on the board to make you confused. Cant anwser your questions clearly goes around your question to get you to answer (not helpful if your already lost)."
10527,907531,5.0,1.0,"inspirational prof.  Really clear explanations, listens to student questions."
10528,907531,1.0,5.0,"WORST TEACHER EVER.  Please avoid at all costs.  He isn't clear, isn't prepared for class, changes the tests to make them different and harder from other TA's, unhelpful outside of class, the list goes on and on.  Class average is definitely worse than other 121 classes.  STAY AWAY"
10529,1882389,5.0,2.0,"Lewin is a great guy, and really helpful if you go to him. Don't hesitate to ask him for help or to ask questions. Sometimes his 5 minute talks turn into 30 minute talks at the start of class, but usually it's useful."
10530,1882389,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Lewin is awesome. He wants you to learn how to do useful things and think like an engineer, rather than regurgitate facts and do problem sets. And he will put himself out seemingly with no limit to help his students do that. He's truly a mentor if you have aspirations other than your GPA."
10531,1882389,1.5,4.0,he seems to think he is the einstein of 2014 ... i knew more about the subject before he told ushe wa OD
10532,448799,5.0,3.0,I really enjoyed the class I took with Professor Claibourne.  She was quick to respond to emails and avaliable in her office for extra help/questions.  Most of the articles we read were very interesting.  A worthwhile course.
10533,448799,3.0,4.0,"She talks kind of fast, but she makes her expectations clear on the midterm and final.  We read two fairly short books, and lots of articles.  Overall, I enjoyed the class."
10534,448799,2.0,4.0,"Would not advise taking this class. She really is a tough grader, and picks fairly specific material for her exams. Her new style seems to be asking questions almost constantly in class, which looks like the opposite of past classes, but that doesn't make it good.  I'm a politics major, and I found myself dreading going to this class."
10535,448799,2.5,3.0,"Overall, this course challenged the way we think about everyday politics. However, she was a hard-grader and lectures relied heavily on power-points if you like that sort of thing. She's a good professor, there's room for improvement though."
10536,448799,4.0,5.0,this class was rough. the midterm was impossible and the material was dense. but I'm going to Claibourn this. she is a- very funny (at least I thought so).  and b- very respondent to student suggestions.  she listened to us after the horrible midterm and changed the format. she also moved paper deadlines. overall - good kid.
10537,448799,1.0,3.0,The reading is fine--even interesting--but lecture is excruciatingly dull.  Prof Claibourn talks way too quickly to make lecture worthwhile.  She also seemed to be slightly misleading; her promise of an &quot;easy&quot; midterm resulted in an extremely difficult exam with an 81 as the class average.
10538,448799,2.0,4.0,The only reason i am passing this class is because I'm a psych major too.  And what's more Claibourne makes the most interesting stuff horribly boring.  Skip this one kids.
10539,448799,1.0,5.0,"No, I'm not too happy with the class.  If she's going to test us on lecture material, she should actually lecture instead of using powerpoint and then flipping through it at lightning speed.  I studied for her midterm for an entire week and still got a C. She seems like a nice person though."
10540,448799,4.0,3.0,Talks fast but makes lecture notes available so it doesn't matter.  Will take time to answer questions in office hours.  Interested in helping students.
10541,448799,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor.  Sure, she speaks so quick it barely qualifies as English, but shes an awesome teacher and the class is awesome.  Yay for Prof. Claibourn"
10542,448799,5.0,3.0,"She's great!  Relax, think, and have fun!"
10543,1087779,4.5,3.0,Profe Libbey is the perfect balance of strictno-nonsense but fun and understanding. She is very helpful and will go out of her way to help you. 
10544,1087779,4.0,2.0,great
10545,1448230,5.0,2.0,The GOAT
10546,1448230,5.0,3.0,"Professor A. is the goat. He's one of the most laid back professors and his lectures reflect this, and his stories are funny too. I bought the textbook for the Webassign code but never ended up actually reading from it. The lectures will teach you everything you need to know unless you don't have a good foundation from Calc I."
10547,1448230,5.0,3.0,"Ala is the man. Have had him for Applied calc 1 and 2. Definitely take his class if you have to take calculus. He is helpful and kind, and often an interesting lecturer. A bit alternative too, but in a good way. Super chill, and always ready to help."
10548,1448230,4.5,3.0,"Hands down my favorite math teacher I have ever had. He's super funny and relatable to students. Ala is great at explaining things in his own terms and he is always available for help if you ask. Plus, he tends to be a pretty lenient grader which is definitely a plus. Would recommend him as a teacher to everyone. "
10549,1448230,4.0,2.0,He explains concepts in a way that everyone can understand and is very good at clarifying if a student has a question. And he's hilarious.
10550,1448230,5.0,1.0,"He is the best professor ever, really down to earth person. I love his way of teaching, I really wish he was teaching all of my classess. I wouldnt mind seeing him all day."
10551,1448230,5.0,3.0,"I ended up really liking this class. Lectures were hilarious. Homework could be hard, but the labs were extremely helpful, and I wish I'd started going to help labs earlier! Tests were very hard, but the curve made grades decent. Professor was very helpful and nice and made sure to go at a pace everyone could keep up with. This was a great class!"
10552,1448230,5.0,2.0,Really funny and a genuinely nice guy. I enjoy his sense of humor but if you're the type of person who prefers more traditional academic lecturers he might not be your favorite. Very helpful outside of class and keeps the lectures as interesting as I can imagine an introductory statistics course can be. Not too difficult either if you do the hw.
10553,1448230,5.0,3.0,"Professor Abdelbaki is the coolest dude ever. He's so chill, and seems so approachable. I enjoyed listening to his corny grad studentish jokes."
10554,1448230,4.0,3.0,"Down to earth guy. Genuinely wants you to learn. His lectures are useful if you have read the chapters before the class. Webworks (approx. 20q's) are due every Sunday and could take from 1-4hr. Tests are challenging, but if you do your hw and readings, they're no biggie."
10555,1038632,4.5,4.0,"You have to be of a certain intelligence to cope in this class. Most cannot handle it and thus you get the negative comments. If you have a genuine interest in being a well informed being of the world that wishes to have informed opinions and beliefs or you wish to expand your analytical mind and vocab, he's for you."
10556,1038632,1.5,3.0,"smart guy, but highly pompous and very disproportionately focused on topics that he seems more passionate about rather than giving his students a broader scope of the world of political theory.  if you want to do well, just pick your TA wisely and learn everything you can in discussion, because you won't get much out of the lectures."
10557,1038632,4.0,4.0,"It's not about memorization, so you can't learn by just reading. If you hate arguing about  things that have no answers, don't take the class. Need to like to analyze and critique and have a genuine interest in human nature/behavior. Section usefulness depends on TA; lectures awesome but only if you can keep attention (i often caught myself wanderi"
10558,1038632,2.5,4.0,If you do not like political theory do not take this class. There is a lot of reading that is all incredibly dull and boring. The lectures are also very uninteresting. Your TA pretty much controls your grade in this course so hopefully you will get a good one.
10559,1038632,4.5,5.0,"I had him for both Intro. to PT and American Political Thought.  He is an excellent professor  It was difficult to follow in Intro., but in APT he was amazing.  He led discussion well and was a fair grader.  Gave back tones of comments and invited students out to lunch to get to know them.  More lecturing in APT would have been good."
10560,1038632,2.0,4.0,"Read, become TA's best friend."
10561,1038632,1.0,5.0,Boring.  Convoluted lectures.  Pompous.  Avoid.
10562,1038632,5.0,4.0,"I'm in the pragmatism course.  Don't know about his lecture style, but in the seminar he is amazing.  He really knows how to generate discussion."
10563,1038632,1.5,4.0,"Lectures are boring, he uses language no one can understand.  I stopped going to lecture all together in late September and got a B.  Just read the books and go to section."
10564,1038632,4.5,5.0,"I enjoyed this class.  I thought the latter half was much better, but Professor Rogers is great if you go to office hours.  His vocabulary was difficult, but I thought it was great for pushing me to think and expand my own vocabulary.  I really enjoyed this class.  I'm taking his American Political Thought course now."
10565,1038632,1.0,4.0,He seems really eager to teach his students but his lectures are terrible: unclear and unstructured. He also seems pompous b/c of his vocab and manner of speaking. A lot of ppl don't go to lecture or do the reading. Read the intro of each book in order to understand it better. The quality of TAs vary. Class got better towards the end.
10566,1038632,4.5,5.0,"Tough going, but he responded quickly to feedback on teaching.  Lecture style is deep and thoughtful. Paying attention is a must to understand him.  I must say though, it is a difficult but insightful 101."
10567,1038632,4.5,4.0,"I enjoyed this class.  First year student, did well on first two papers, and went to see him often.  I think he is excellent. I recommend the class of those who want to think."
10568,1038632,2.0,3.0,"Possibly the most pompous Assistant Professor I have ever met. The man is brilliant and constantly uses vocabulary half the class doesn't understand. Lectures are optional. Tons of reading. Seriously. 9 books for Political Theory. Overall, he knows his stuff. If you like Political Theory take his courses."
10569,1038632,4.5,4.0,"Going to his office hours is a must!  Doing that made this class very enjoyable for me, although it is still tough going."
10570,1038632,4.5,4.0,Really enjoyed the class.  He knows his stuff! Be prepared to work!
10571,1038632,5.0,5.0,Professor Rogers is excellent and very helpful during office hours.  I really enjoyed his lectures and my TA Greta was an added bonus.  The other people on here just don't want to work.
10572,1038632,4.5,5.0,"I agree others are too harsh.  I think he is a tough but good professor.  He gets a plus from me, especially have adjusting his lectures based on our comments.  I'm taking American Political Thought with him to see how he is in a smaller class setting."
10573,1038632,2.5,5.0,"Professor Rogers is difficult.  But I think the other reviewers are a bit unfair.  If you come to lectures and listen, things work out.  I've done well on papers, although I've gone to his office hours often.  I also know this is his first time teaching a large lecture so I liked the fact he adjusted.  Later lectures were much better than the earli"
10574,1038632,1.5,2.0,"Lectures for this class are extremely boring, perhaps resulting from a lack of passion (I assume at the 100 level). Dr. Rogers drones. Readings are cliche Political Theory books (Locke, Hobbes, etc). If students show up they don't pay attention. I found the papers to be simple and straightforward. No surprises, not difficult, just extremely boring."
10575,1038632,2.5,3.0,"Others are too harsh.Rogers does have confusing lectures for a 101 class, but if you are interested in political theory you would probably consider him a good upper-level teacher. His focus is too critical and analytical for this level but he knows his stuff and seems like a good guy! Oh and it's not a GPA downer if you can write a decent paper."
10576,1038632,1.0,5.0,"Don't take classes from this professor. It does not matter what he is teaching, he is arrogant and you can't understand what he is saying because he talks like a complicated text book, and gives &quot;speeches&quot; instead of lectures."
10577,1038632,2.0,5.0,"This class is a 101 class, but it is harder than any of the 300 levels I am taking! There are 2 papers, a midterm & a final. Most people get a C on the papers. They are IMPOSSIBLE. Papers you would get an A on in any other class, you WONT this class. Lectures are incomprehensible, & the TA's are useless. Want a good GPA&#63; don't take this class!"
10578,1431849,4.0,2.0,"Zach was a great TA for Econ 2020. He explained the topics with great clarity. Good Luck in the future, Zach!"
10579,1431849,4.0,2.0,"One of the TAs for ECON 2020. He's only in his 20's but he's a very good teacher. Explains with great clearity. Grades exams easily which is nice. His grading policy is based on attendance so it's important that you show up. He's very sloppy when using the blackboard though, which can become annoying."
10580,1792301,5.0,3.0,Nathan is an awesome guy. Great teacher and more than willing to help you outside of class during office hours. I am not the best at math but he explains it well and guides you toward what you need to know. He has a personality unlike most math teachers and you won't truly appreciate him until you have another teacher. Great dude.
10581,1792301,5.0,2.0,"Pappas is one of the best instructors you can have! He not only knows his stuff, but is also a great teacher and explains the material well. He also has a way of foreseeing the mistakes students often make and warns you before hand. I used to hate calc, he has sort of changed my mind now. He's also very friendly. Go to office hours-very helpful!"
10582,1792301,5.0,1.0,"Best, most helpful, most clear, and one of the greatest math professors I've ever had."
10583,1792301,3.5,5.0,"Knows his stuff and is a smart guy, but overly authoritative and very difficult. Absolutely wouldn't reccomend him."
10584,252211,5.0,2.0,He is a really nice guy that assigns the amount of work I would expect from a college English class. His choice of books was very good and he continuously tried to keep the course interesting throughout the semester.
10585,252211,4.0,2.0,"Baker is a nice man, his class is all over the place though. He's good to take if you're trying to fulfill a requirement. Easy A, not a lot of work."
10586,252211,5.0,1.0,"Baker is da man!  Awesome, super easy class.  He's freaking hilarious!  Really nice, makes class interesting.  Recommend, recommend, recommend."
10587,252211,4.5,3.0,"Professor Baker is so nice.  If you need help (because sometimes the information is confusing) go to his office hours! The subject itself is kind of boring, but he's entertaining"
10588,252211,2.0,3.0,"STAY AWAY! Baker is a very nice man, sometimes funny, but this is a HORRIBLE class. There's almost no structure, I never knew what was going on, nothing in class pertains to the book. Unfortunately that's what the tests are based on. You will be very bored and confused if you take this class, so stay way"
10589,252211,3.5,2.0,"Very nice guy, very willing to help students. Class discussions, though, are somewhat confusing."
10590,252211,4.5,4.0,"He is too funny.  Really knows his stuff, appreciates student ideas and suggestions."
10591,252211,4.0,1.0,This guy cracks me up! Very interesting class.
10592,252211,5.0,3.0,"Great class! If you're an English or linguistics major or just like words, you'll enjoy it. Prof. Baker wrote the textbook, so you only need the one, and it's good. Mostly memorization and translation."
10593,1104192,1.0,2.0,"barely understandable and intelligible writing, super inconsistent about her timing and the lectures are always behind schedule. I was worried if the class could even finish the course before the end of the semester."
10594,1104192,2.0,4.0,"First Span teacher I didn't like. Not helpful. Unlike other classes, u have NO allowed absences (have to be sick for all with prior notice). Grades trivially with no grading scheme. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! There are a lot better Spanish classes. Tejedo and Rini are great!"
10595,1104192,2.0,4.0,"Really strict and not very friendly teacher.  Grading scheme is totally messed up.  I do not suggest you take her for this class; there are so many nice Spanish professors, this is the first I have not liked. Daily hmwks of translation, but when it comes to grading them, she grades trivially and incorrectly leading u to potentially fail every hw."
10596,1104192,4.5,2.0,Rosa tries really hard to get the class interested in the material and is very open to questions in class as well as outside of class. Very excited to teach and it reflects in the atmosphere of the class (happy and very laid back).
10597,1104192,4.5,2.0,She is a good teacher and a pretty easy grader...Plus she is really hot...I would definitely recommend her for 202
10598,1104192,2.0,5.0,"Difficult, unyelding demanding, strict, and merciless. Good luck if you have her, you'll need it."
10599,1120580,5.0,3.0,"Best spanish teacher I've had and a great person. Class was fun, she really cares about her students and it shows. My class was 9 AM M,W,F and I honestly was not upset about it because of how great she was. I can't recommend enough."
10600,1120580,5.0,2.0,I loved professor Neff she was great and made online learning really fun.
10601,1120580,5.0,3.0,Professor Neff is the best professor for anyone who is taking Spanish for the first time. She is very patient and pushes her students to speak in Spanish in class. She is a sweetheart and always makes herself available to students outside of the classroom. She is very understanding and tries to make the lectures fun at times for the students. AMAZI
10602,1120580,5.0,3.0,Very talented professor who has an ability to be understandable to someone who has never learned a word of Spanish. She is gifted in this sense and it allowed me to be able to pick up on so many parts of the language simply from paying attention to her.
10603,1120580,5.0,3.0,"Professor Neff really taught the introductory course extremely well. She comes to class very prepared and creates a welcoming environment that allows everybody to feel comfortable. Learning a new language can be difficult, but she really helps and allows students the chance to learn. I'm excited to take the next semester with her."
10604,1120580,5.0,2.0,"Professor Neff is by far my favorite professor at UVA. Not only is she extremely passionate about teaching Spanish, she truly wants all of her students to learn and be successful. If you put the effort in and do the assignments, you will get a good grade, both in 1010 and 1020."
10605,1120580,5.0,2.0,She was absolutely amazing for both SPAN 1010 and SPAN 1020.  She goes above and beyond the rest of the intro level teachers to help you understand what she's trying to convey if you're not quite getting the Spanish. She gives excellent feedback and has a variety of in-class activities to make the material more relevant.
10606,1120580,4.0,3.0,I kind of liked this class but I took it on MWF at 8 am which is not  good idea. It's a spanish requirement so it's pretty easy. She will bring your grade down if you miss more than 3 classes so be aware of that. Other than that she's a pretty cool professor. 
10607,1120580,4.5,3.0,"I had Professor Neff while she was at Longwood University, and I felt she was very good with the class, and understood that not every gets the material all at once or right when its taught. She was helpful and was always willing to work anything out if there was a problem. Extremely friendly, I do not regret having her"
10608,1120580,4.0,2.0,It was alright. She's not about to speak to you in English but ever so often she doesn't mind if the entire class is clueless. Doesn't spend too much time on grammar althought she's gotten better as the semester went on. It's just another spanish class. Keep in mind I had to get up for the class because it was early.

10611,1120585,1.0,5.0,"If you want a C or worse, by all means take her section."
10612,1120585,1.0,5.0,Stay away from this TA at all costs!
10613,1120585,5.0,3.0,Great TA!  I don't know how she could have done a better job.  She made things very clear to a point where you really had to ignore her to not get the point.  Four stars!
10614,1120585,5.0,3.0,Great TA!  I don't know how she could have done a better job.  She made things very clear to a point where you really had to ignore her to not get the point.  Four stars!
10615,1120585,4.5,3.0,"Sure, she's a bit nerdy, but c'mon she studies the history of English mathematics. Her sections had wonderful flows to them, and were very helpful in understanding extremely dry material. She grades harshly, but she's not unfair. I'm sure one day she'll be a good teacher."
10616,1120585,4.0,3.0,"Good TA, very enthusiastic and eager to teach. Discerning grader, but not so much that it makes an A impossible. And her incredible nice-ness makes up for high standards."
10617,1120585,4.5,2.0,She was a good TA overall.  She's smart and professional.  Not a hard grader.
10618,1120585,1.5,5.0,Otis is about as helpful as a solar powered flash light.  Do everything you can to avoid this personification of the word &quot;awkward.&quot;
10619,1120585,1.0,5.0,boring sections that made me dread the class.
10620,1120585,5.0,3.0,I thought she did an excellent job in putting the primary sources into context.  She was always on topic and I think her section helped me understand the class.  She was also was willing to help if you had any questions regarding the sources or grading.  If you show up and try to participate you will do fine.
10621,1120585,1.0,5.0,Not that good
10622,1120585,1.0,5.0,"Enjoyed lecture, but I dreaded her section.  The sections dragged on forever with the same boring group work that every other TA does.  She grades pretty hard and there is really no getting a good grade.  Take another TA."
10623,1120585,1.0,5.0,"If you are looking for a good TA, she is not for you."
10624,1120585,1.0,5.0,Keep away.
10625,1120585,1.0,5.0,"Kershaw is a great lecturer, but the subject matter is dry and there is a ton of dry reading.  Otis isn't very good and grades really hard.  Take Whitney's section."
10626,1120585,1.0,5.0,"I enjoyed Prof. Kershaw and this class, but did not like Jessica.  She is not a very good TA.  I should have taken the other TA's section."
10627,1120585,1.0,5.0,Get another TA.
10628,1120585,1.5,5.0,Not a good Ta.  Her sections are boring but you have to.  She grades really hard too.  Do yourself a favor and get another TA.  Avoid!
10629,1120585,1.0,5.0,"Jessica is the absolute worst TA I have ever had.  Her sections drag on and on, and is not helpful.  Also, she far too harshly, with no helpful comments.  AVOID AVOID AVOID!"
10630,1120585,4.5,2.0,"I LOVE THIS GIRL! She's the best, take Calc 121 with her!"
10631,1120585,5.0,2.0,she's great!  very simply put.
10632,309608,5.0,1.0,What a perfect human being. Virginia will miss Herr Sheehan!
10633,309608,5.0,2.0,"Everyone loves Herr Sheehan. He is a great teacher and gives great suggestions and tips for difficult subject matter. He cares about his students and improving their skills. I learned alot from him. He grades fairly and really wants you to learn. He tries to improve your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills."
10634,309608,5.0,3.0,He is a great TA.  Very compassionate & hilarious.  He really works with you if you're having trouble.  He even tutored me in 201 AND 202!
10635,309608,5.0,1.0,"The funniest German teacher you'll ever have!  He makes class interesting and works hard to give everyone good speaking and listening skills.  Very accessible and helpful with clear, concise teaching methods."
10636,309608,5.0,1.0,"funniest teacher ever. makes german 101 (not world's most exciting class) fun and interesting. very comedic, makes jokes a lot. definitely good times. highly recommend."
10637,2398576,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sree is humble, but she is brilliant. She has a lot of knowledge to share and she makes difficult concepts accessible with her clarity and creativity. She won't coddle you; you will get as much from her classes as you are willing to work for. It's worth working for. I'd follow Professor Sree anywhere."
10638,2398576,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sathiamma is absolutely phenomenal. She is incredibly knowledgeable and works hard to support her student's interests. She knows how to connect theory to praxis and encourages her students to do the same. Professor Sathiamma is approachable, teaches very engaging material, and is a great mentor"
10639,2398576,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Sree offers an incredibly valuable perspective to any global studies dept., challenging what it means to be a &quot;developing country&quot; in the &quot;Third World&quot;/&quot;Global South&quot;. Like most classes, you get what you put in  I did the work and walked away with a totally new outlook on how NGOs/Western involvement/+more affect grassroots social movements."
10640,2398576,5.0,4.0,"I took Professor Sree's Social Movements and Development class -- outstanding, engaging lectures and readings. She challenges students to think critically &amp; question (unlike many profs), facilitates learning effectively (good group discussions), and is very approachable. One of the few classes I can say truly changed my perspective on the world."
10641,2398576,5.0,3.0,"Sree is a very thoughtful professor, who puts a great deal of time and energy into providing a perspective that is different from most of the classes taught at UVA. She is an asset to Global Development Studies as she incorporates theory and practice to make her classes both engaging and thought provoking. Discussion is encouraged in this class."
10642,2398576,1.0,1.0,"She is never reay to explain outside of classroom, sometime she is rude."
10643,2398576,4.0,3.0,"Lectures were a bit dry, but Professor Sree is an incredibly knowledgeable person to be taught by, and if you can sit through the seminars you have an opportunity to learn a lot."
10644,2709873,5.0,3.0,"The best, very down-to-Earth. Will challenge a lot of your views about Africa, especially if you took Comparative Political Systems or International Relations."
10645,915828,5.0,1.0,Amazing professor.  He has a vast knowledge of negotiations throughout various countries and his stories are entertaining.  Just show up to class and turn in your work outside of class.  He does have a tendency to cold call you if it looks like you are not engaged in the discussion (i.e. nodding off).
10646,915828,5.0,2.0,Bass is fantastic. Its a very interesting class model-- all your work involved negotiating (once a week) and limited reading. Learned tons and loved it. Bass is SO approachable and so great to listen to...very entertaining stories.
10647,915828,4.5,2.0,"really cool class, not much outside work aside from negotiation cases that you are typically given a full weekend to complete. classtime is generally dedicated to discussion of the cases and main topics in negotiating. bass is very approachable and a delight to talk to."
10648,1423735,4.5,2.0,The TA for the class. The best TA I've ever had. He is really smart and very helpful. He wants students to understand the material and is easily approachable to help explain anything that is misunderstood. Made the class excellent
10649,1423735,4.0,2.0,Lectures are really interesting and it's pretty easy to do well in that class. Readings can be a little dull and there are way too many of them.
10650,932215,5.0,3.0,Professor Loeffler is an amazing professor and an incredibly caring person. I loved taking his class and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a history class 
10651,932215,5.0,3.0,"The class was very interesting. Loeffler does a good job of looking objectively at the issues he is discussing, and also looks at the nuances and contradictions of each topic. Only graded on two papers, participation, and a take home midterm and final (sometimes open book). Worthwhile course, engaging and interesting."
10652,932215,3.5,2.0,"Good professor. Gives a brief outline at the beginning of class, and then attempts to follow it. Can get a little disorganized, but it shouldn't effect your knowledge of key materials. 2 papers, 2 exams. Closed book. Covers main material and won't test on obscure material."
10653,932215,4.0,3.0,relatively easy. take home tests although not open note. 3 papers....make sure you are clear and concise. very nice guy. hit some dull spots but aside from that i would recommend.
10654,932215,1.5,5.0,No Comments
10655,932215,3.5,2.0,"Not a bad class, hit boring spots like any other 2 and a half hour class. Only once a week though and learned a lot about Zionism. Reading is helpful but you can get by without it. Just three papers and attendance make up your grade, and he's forgiving on papers."
10656,1153405,3.5,3.0,"Good professor, wrote the book so no inconsistencies there, but he doesn't give much partial credit on tests, which can be a bummer."
10657,751999,4.5,2.0,Monsieur Shangler is an excellent professor. I had 2 previous years of French before so it was a pretty easy class. I would recommend coming to class prepared (read) as there will be occasional pop quizzes. Mr. Shangler does not prepare for lecture as he just reads from the text. Mr. Shangler is a great professor and I would recommend his class!
10658,751999,4.5,5.0,"Great guy to go to for extra help. This level was over my head so I had a hard time, but he is super willing to stay extra time and help. Fun guy."
10659,751999,4.5,1.0,"Cake class, but he's a good guy.  Likes to play french games during class.  Fastest grader in the history of grading."
10660,751999,4.5,1.0,"French 102 was easy with M. Shangler. He taught things with the book, told us exactly what to expect on the tests, did practice sections of the tests before hand,w e were well prepared for it. Grading was nice for tests and compositions, he answered questions, and if not clearly, he at least tried. I would definitely recommend him for Intro French."
10661,751999,3.5,2.0,"he is a very fast grader and pretty fair. but having never taken french before, it seems like he expects the same level of french from both total beginners and those who have taken years of french before. but as long as you try hard and come prepared, you'll do fine. but do not expect clear presentation of materials in class (but he does try hard)."
10662,751999,5.0,2.0,"Grades consist of homework assignments, compositions, dictees, and frequent tests. Shangler tries really hard to explain the concepts clearly and is always helpful to go further. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Our class was more accelerated and had a higher average than other 101 classes. Class games like hangman and pictionary are fun!"
10663,1685894,5.0,2.0,He is great!
10664,1685894,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! Fair grader. Very straightforward, definitely recommend!"
10665,1210761,5.0,3.0,"I honestly loved this class so much!! I took the Art and Astronomy art history class and there were only 2 papers, a midterm, and a final. It as long as you were attentive in class you would do well."
10666,1210761,5.0,4.0,"I took a Medieval Studies seminar class with him. The lectures and discussions were extremely interesting, as were the readings. He is verbose, but definitely worth listening to. He also goes out of his way to provide constructive feedback and encouragement, and is willing to work with you if you're having difficulty in the course."
10667,1210761,1.0,5.0,I'm an art history major/have taken higher level courses way easier than this. Prepped for the midterm 4 weeks before/managed an A but this required me to teach myself the material on my own. He says the first day he'll tell you the Christian stories but the whole year he'll just reference them like you should know them. Made me wanna change majors
10668,1210761,4.5,5.0,"By far one of the best professors I've had at UVA. I took ARTH 222 and a medieval seminar with him, and both were fantastic. Be prepared to work, but you will learn a lot. He is more than ready to help, and going to office hours is both fun and helpful. Very approachable, and wants his students to do well. Take a class with him!"
10669,1210761,4.5,4.0,"Lectures go very fast, definitely use a laptop for notes if you can. He is a very good lecturer, though somewhat repetitive (&quot;The extent to which...&quot;) and is always eager to help his students. Be prepared for A LOT of memorization and always go to section."
10670,1210761,1.0,5.0,"Um, don't these reviews sound really fake and pompous&#63;  That would be just like the person who probably wrote them.  Judge for yourself.  In the meantime, avoid this man and this class."
10671,1210761,3.5,4.0,"The information is presented in a great deal of detail, the non-superfluous aspects of which are obscured by a mixture of enthusiasm and earnestness. He seems jollier and kinder than he grades--bitter TAs perhaps&#63; I don't believe he has much to do with the grading, but the dour ginger next to me seemed to have a lot to say about people's writing."
10672,1210761,3.0,4.0,"Good guy, passionate about what he teaches but difficult to understand because of his lecture style. He crams in a ton of information (lots that you do not need to know) and speaks with so many dependent clauses and prepositional phrases that it is really hard to get the point. Be prepared for some hand cramps after taking notes during Medieval"
10673,1210761,4.5,2.0,Amazing. Very helpful. All around great guy. He's funny and keeps the lectures interesting.  The class covers a lot of material and the lectures move very fast but he is always available and very willing to help.  BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE HAD. Take any class you can with him!
10674,1210761,2.5,3.0,"One of the nicest, genuine, passionate, and caring professors at UVA.  He makes himself available, is very approachable, and will help with anything. His lectures are a little fast paced, so you have to pay close attention and not miss many. Lots of small assignments but very fair grading. Gives slide lists for tests. Very funny. Take his class!"
10675,1210761,5.0,4.0,"Hands down the best art history professor at UVa. Young, exciting, and passionate about medieval art... just an absolutely brilliant person. His classes are fun, entertaining, and I always look forward to them. Very approachable and helpful at office hours and is always enthusiastic to hear from his students. TAKE HIS CLASS!!!"
10676,1210761,5.0,4.0,"He is very passionate about the subjects he teaches.  He gives you many assignements over the term.  He does not give credit for them easily though.  He sets high standards and expects you to fullfill them, but will help you out along the way.   This man general truly cares about his students too.  It is rare to find a man of such responsiblity."
10677,965011,5.0,2.0,"I think everybody should take Prof Cates' energy class. This class gave me so much to think about, required little work, and was super applicable to everyday life! Plus Prof. Cates is a genius/one of the coolest people I've met. Ask him questions--he'll get all excited and either go full out science nerd or tell fun stories about his life. 10/10!"
10678,965011,5.0,1.0,"Fantastic class. Very good lectures that cover topics that are useful to know and impact us. The readings are interesting, and if you go to class, do the readings, and study for quizzes, it isn't hard to do well. Would DEFINITELY recommend. Also, there is little to no math, which I loved."
10679,965011,5.0,2.0,"This class is awesome. Demos every class, and a very relevant topic to what our generation is going to deal with in the future. I'm pretty sure Cates is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met, and is very fair in his views on controversial topics. Take this class and just enjoy it! Not too math intense and very manageable. Cates rocks!"
10680,965011,3.5,2.0,"Cates is a great professor and really cares about his students. If you go to class every day and study for the finals this class is an easy A. There are 3 problems sets which are the only hard part of the class, but they are do-able. The quizzes and exams are pretty easy. I would recommend this class. Cates is great and it's a pretty easy class."
10681,965011,4.5,4.0,"THE MAD PROFFESA. this guy is awesome. plus he has sweet demos, interesting lectures, and really good notes that he types up and hands out. plus he's really approachable and a nice dude"
10682,965011,5.0,1.0,"Professor Cates is exactly like Dustin Hoffman in every way.  Except that he teaches physics instead of, you know, teaching Literature, or being an existential detective.  He's a little out there, but he's a freakin nuclear physicist.  He's probably got radiation on the brain.  The guy is the man.  Take his class."
10683,965011,4.0,1.0,"Gordon D. Cates is quite possibly one of the coolest professors I've had here at the University.  He prints off all the lecture notes so you don't have to worry about copying them down, he always has a demo to help you understand, and he always makes an effort to make sure you're getting the material. Also, he had few quizzes and homework."
10684,965011,4.0,2.0,"very scatterbrained.  Took a long time to return emails, tests and homework.  Spent 20 minutes every class talking about homework, tests, or going over scheduling.  Class is extremely easy to understand, but beware of tests - How Things Work is easy - physics is not, and he puts real physics questions on tests.  SINGLETARY #44 was in my class"
10685,965011,4.0,3.0,"I liked Professor Cates!  I took him last semester, and sure, he was a little scatterbrained, but he meant well, and you could tell he really loved the subject.  His office hours were extremely helpful, and he was willing to stay until everyone understood what he was talking about.  I do think the class was a bit large for him, he seemed intimidate"
10686,965011,2.5,3.0,"GohDan Cates is a man of many trades. He was able to successfully light himself on fire, slide on a scooter directly into the wall, and put 300 brilliant minds to sleep. His girlish giggle has he watches what happens when you put a CD in a microwave is enough to put a smile on anyones face. When it comes test time though...no one will be smiling."
10687,965011,2.0,3.0,"Miserable.  I agree with everything the poster below me said.  Plus, he takes FOREVER to return hw, which is a big portion of your grade, so you basically have no feedback on how you stand.  One time, he said &quot;um&quot; 157 times in a 35 minute period--yes, I counted.  By the end, he was teaching to an empty class.  Attended every class, got an A-."
10688,965011,2.5,4.0,"You think it'll be easy&#63; Wrong. Textbook makes little sense, professor does not. Lectures scatterbrained and confusing. Demos are funny but do not really help explain basic knowledge needed to pass course. Slow to post lecture slides. Tests seem easy but grades come back awful for all. Secretly wants more than what he assigns/tells you he wants."
10689,1579426,1.0,3.0,"boring, uninspiring lecturer despite interesting course content. doesn't respond clearly to questions or e-mails. can be patronizing. would not recommend religious studies at uva."
10690,1579426,4.5,3.0,"very good professor, makes you question current situations. Very knowledgable in his area hence he manages to increase our enthusiasm and curiosity by just asking the right questions. However the class subject is very clear, stick to the book and you'll be fine."
10691,1579426,3.0,2.0,Talks slow and repeats himself a lot. Reading is very similar to the lectures.
10692,1579426,4.5,1.0,"Class/professor were really interesting. Most professors aren't willing to admit that he/she doesn't know the answer to a question, but Al-Rahim doesn't hesitate to look up a question you have. Exams can be tough, but he gives a study guide. Don't do the tons of assigned readings because he clarifies in class. Take this class for NW perspective."
10693,1579426,4.0,1.0,"Al-Rahim is awesome! I had fun in this class because I was interested in the material. He's not difficult. Grades are based on participation, midterm, and a final (sometimes gives extra credit). The exams weren't hard; he gave a study guide and vocab list. In our class, if you didn't do well, you were probably too lazy to make a study guide."
10694,1579426,3.0,4.0,"The class wasn't hard, but lectures were kind of disorganized or boring at times. The content of the class is worthwhile, though."
10695,1579428,5.0,5.0,"hard, hard, hard and very very very fair."
10696,1579428,3.5,5.0,"If you are going to take a class with Professor Korangy, make sure that you REALLY want to take it. His classes are tough and have a lot of work and he expects a LOT out of you, though you will learn a lot."
10697,973221,3.0,3.0,"There are pros and cons to prof Heldt. His lectures were great, and his stories funny. The material is interesting too. But he restricted us to original ideas for our papers about the material, but would shoot down students' ideas in class repeatedly. It got stressful and confusing. He didn't even return our long papers before the end."
10698,973221,5.0,1.0,"Professor Gus Heldt is a great teacher! I had a wonderful experience taking his class. He was helpful and always willing to work with me whenever I had trouble. He presents the content of the course in a really interesting way, and it was very for me to easy to follow his lectures. The stuff he talks about is also really fascinating!"
10699,973221,4.0,1.0,"Awesome class - even though it wasn't my 'thing'. Was in the class with the 'raise your hand' thing - the guy who posted the comment (I guess) actually looked really lame in class for not having a sense of humor. Everyone else got that it was a joke. Not hilarious, but certainly not worth skipping a great course for. Recommended!"
10700,973221,1.0,4.0,"Heldt was a ridiculous grader. He told us to raise our hands like we were saluting to Hitler. I was shocked to hear this from one of our teachers. He made the comment twice. I went to office hours two weeks in a row because his lectures were difficult to follow and he said ""I hope this doesn't become a weekly thing."" Do not take a class with him!"
10701,973221,2.5,2.0,Awesome.
10702,973221,3.0,1.0,"A bit of an odd guy and difficult to catch even at office hours, but was a fairly good lecturer. The number grade was deceiving; because of the curve, you'll probably end up with a good grade if you attend class and skim the readings."
10703,973221,4.0,1.0,"The class is interesting and pretty easy, as long as you can figure out bungo. First half of the semester was pure lecture of off the hand out, which was pretty boring. Prof. Heldt explained things fine."
10704,973221,4.5,3.0,"I loved his mannerism during class and style of teaching. He was very straight forward with what we needed to know, and had a perfect balance of lecturing plus class dicussion. Take one of his courses if you get a chance! His comments of &quot;fantastically written&quot; and then a &quot;B&quot; on a paper were a little disheartening though."
10705,104874,1.0,4.0,"I got a B- in a 1010 intro to American politics class. How? This should be one of the easiest classes you could take. Prof. Ceaser is terrible, I would leave his lectures with maybe 3 bullet points of notes because the lectures have nothing to do with the material. He goes on random tangents for what seems like hours. Awful lecturer."
10706,104874,2.0,3.0,"Ceasar's lectures are extremely boring and tangential, and often have little to do with the readings. I often find it hard to take notes because he simply stands in the corner of the room and rambles with seemingly no direction. I have yet to see him write anything on the chalkboard or use any form of presentation."
10707,104874,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ceaser is a great lecturer. He sometimes goes on tangents, but he always talks about current politics and tries to keep the mood light while lecturing. There was a lot of reading per week that was necessary for the discussion. Both primary sources and textbook readings were needed for the final."
10708,104874,4.0,2.0,He does tend to ramble in lecture but throws in funny tidbits. He's very knowledgeable. Reading is easy. It's an easy class because it's material you learn in high school civics or just by being aware of your own political system. Overall I enjoyed the class. Some people describe him as a &quot;cute old man&quot;. I missed 50% of lectures and received an A
10709,104874,1.0,2.0,"Professor Ceaser's lectures are incredibly boring, but that's okay because the material is so basic you won't learn anything from them. It's an easy A if you know anything about American politics. Most students skip lecture, and only attend sections which are mostly a review the readings."
10710,104874,1.0,3.0,"I think I went to a total of 3 lectures and still managed to get by with a B. The class should be easy; it's essentially just a review of high school Civ/AP Gov, but the readings are dry and lengthy and Ceaser is getting too old and distracted to keep up each lecture engaged and interesting. Only 2 exams with a lot of specific multiple choice Qs."
10711,104874,4.0,3.0,"Interesting class, and Ceaser is hilarious. He tends to ramble, but if you listen, you'll still hear the desired main points of the lecture. Not the most difficult with two papers, two exams, and weekly discussion sections(go, they help). Overall, would recommend."
10712,104874,1.5,3.0,"Lectures are boring, unfocused and clearly supporting his own right wing ideology. If you know anything at all about American politics, do not take his class. The lecture hall is almost empty because so many students skip class"
10713,104874,4.0,4.0,"Endeavoring to follow the 50-minute ""ramble"" is worth the effort--it normally goes somewhere interesting and, if not, you'll learn something just by being in the same room with Ceaser. VERY good one-on-one and when he's especially into the topic, e.g. the Founding Fathers and Tocqueville."
10714,104874,4.0,2.0,He smiles the whole time! Which makes me smile lol
10715,104874,5.0,3.0,"Ceaser is a wonderful professor who is truly passionate about what he is teaching. Though his lectures may seem boring to others, those who actually pay attention will appreciate his sense of humor and stunning good looks. This class is sure to be the highlight of your semester, for more reasons than one."
10716,104874,4.5,4.0,"I really liked this class. I learned a lot and Ceaser always managed to make things interesting. It was one of the oddest classes I've ever been in at times, but I gained a lot from it."
10717,104874,1.0,3.0,I feel compelled to say- do NOT take this class! Lecture was absolutely worthless...even though I only skipped one class I still learned nothing at all from lecture.  Some days I sat through the whole class and had no notes to show for it.  Want to like him bc he seems nice but only the TA/outside readings helped in any way.
10718,104874,1.0,3.0,never before have i taken a class where i could simply not pay attention in lecture whatsoever.  I would hear the first few words and immediately zone out and forget where i was for about half an hour.  smart guy but his lectures are disorganized with tons of tangents and no outline.  the TA is the only way you will succeed. beware!
10719,104874,4.0,3.0,"A brilliant mind...those seeking entertainment should take Sabato's 101, where everyone gets spoonfed a series of sound bites about the nature of American politics. Listening to Ceaser's lectures IS actually work but yields ten times the dividends...."
10720,104874,1.0,3.0,"Seems lazy, class is painfully boring, so your TA makes it or breaks it for you."
10721,104874,1.0,3.0,"Ceaser is a horrible lecturer and absolutely useless to listen to. He rambles and goes off on so many tangents its impossible to follow his points. Very good class if you like to zone out on facebook, but if you want to learn, find another professor."
10722,104874,3.0,3.0,"i really like this class. he lets his ideology show through in lecture, but as long as you recognize that its ok. some people complain he rambles, but i think he is relatively amusing. he is overshadowed by sabato, but i would rather take plap from him. his tests are hard, but its nothing you cant prepare for. good class overall!"
10723,104874,1.0,4.0,mediocre guy
10724,104874,2.0,3.0,Makes American politics about as boring as possible. I went to every single lecture and found less than a handful of them helpful on the midterm/final. The text is overly detailed and monotonous. TAs were the only saving grace of this course. Last 101 I'll ever take
10725,104874,4.0,1.0,"Disorganized and rambles.  That said, he is very interesting.  You either &quot;get&quot; him or you don't.  He is VERY good one on one.  Interested in students.  Some people like the lectures and some don't.  Not a hard grader."
10726,104874,1.5,2.0,"If you have any background in politics, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  I hated lectures because it was all useless rambling about his obsession with Toqueville and the Founding Fathers.  Going to class is very unnecessary.  I really enjoyed the outside readings, though they were hardly discussed."
10727,104874,3.5,2.0,Ceaser while somewhat odd was great.  Yeah the book is a bit redundant if you go to lecture but it really enforces what he talks about and you need to read to do well on the two reading quizes.  Material is pretty interesting and he presents it well.
10728,104874,3.0,2.0,"Overall he's a nice guy and seems very interested in the stuff he teaches, but there's really no structure to the class.  Either attend lecture or read the book, you don't need to do both since they're basically the same."
10729,104874,2.0,3.0,"What are these people talking about&#63;  Ceaser's lectures are completely useless; he only rambles, leaving you wondering why you attended in the first place.  You better have a good TA in discussion, because that is where you learn everything.  Take Sabato's class."
10730,104874,5.0,2.0,His textbook and lectures follow very closely with one another because he is the one who wrote the book. He is sometimes boring but a lot of times he makes the lecture interesting.
10731,104874,3.0,2.0,"an interesting character.  Test really aren't that tough. Lectures kinda sporadic, most of what you need to know is in your book."

10733,104874,5.0,2.0,"Clearly one of the best instructors at UVA.  Great sense of humor, brillant handling of material.  Respects students and learning process.  Do whatever you can to take get Professor Ceaser before you leave UVA."
10734,104874,2.5,3.0,"one word, BORING!"
10735,104874,3.0,4.0,Take Sabadot instead
10736,104874,1.0,3.0,"a theorist but not a thinker, stopped developing in grad school in new jersey decades ago"
10737,104874,5.0,3.0,Great Professor. Has very clear lectures and is engaging.
10738,104874,4.5,4.0,"Ceaser is one of the finest profesors at UVA, and one of the finest theorists in America. Sabato wishes he possessed Ceaser's accumen."

10740,104874,3.0,2.0,"One of the oddest professors at UVA. He wore black the entire time that Clinton was in office. Black shoes, black suit, black shirt, and black tie. He was mourning for the country when Clinton was President."
10741,104874,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher, brilliant mind, eccentric, funny, helpful and disorganized. Just sitting in his class you can learn so much. Cannot miss this clance if you are at UVA."

10743,104874,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, sarcastic, witty.  Be prepared for a seirous class"
10744,104874,4.0,3.0,"Provides great overview of founding principles. Eccentric, but in good way!"
10745,104874,3.5,3.0,Very historical background on politics.  Almost like broad US Hist. course.
10746,104876,1.5,3.0,"Groner is incredibly intelligent and really passionate about his field, but he just isn't a good lecturer. His classes are disorganized. He gives outlines, and neglects to follow them. Interesting course material, but a very poor lecturer."
10747,104876,3.5,2.0,"I enjoyed this class overall because Groner is a very nice guy who if you get to know even just a little will like you. It got very boring at times, but if you do the readings it is much better and if you talk in class then he will like you and the class will be more interesting."
10748,104876,3.0,2.0,"Honestly, the class was at times very boring.  However, lectures are structured on outlines and those are what you need to study for tests.  Groner is a nice guy, just wasn't my cup of tea."
10749,104876,4.0,1.0,He is a very approachable and kind seeming person. He knows a lot about zen and loves to share his knowledge but his lectures don't ever really seem to have a main point. He tends to talk to the class like as if he were telling a friend some interesting facts instead of trying to teach a specific subject with specific points. Interesting overall.
10750,104876,5.0,3.0,"Groner is such a sweet man. You can tell that he is very passionate about Zen, and he clearly knows a lot about it. Very adorable style of teaching, and extremely approachable. Try to do all the readings, but if you can't; he will definitely go over everything in the lecture, so pay attention."
10751,104876,3.5,2.0,"One of the most boring teachers ive had. if you have trouble sleeping, just go to one of his classes and his voice should solve all your problems. The tests are very easy if you just go over the lectures outlines and do the reading. i almost never went to class and still got an a. disc section is helpful though so you should attend those."
10752,104876,2.5,3.0,"Wow, I haven't had a teacher this uninteresting since Saslaw. I agree with most people, I think it's his voice and slow teaching method. I went to the first few classes straight before I realized everything he taught was already in the book. Bam, my attendance dropped dramatically. The tests aren't EASY, but not terrible if you read."
10753,104876,3.0,4.0,Prof Nemec may be a whole lot more clear but Prof Groner is definitely more engaging and doesn't baby down the course.  The reading is definitely manageable and almost everything I've read for this class so far has been interesting.
10754,104876,4.0,3.0,like ben stein
10755,104876,4.0,2.0,"I proferred Nemec as a lecturer for because of the ease determination to make things accessible. Of course if you really want to learn a lot of details on the subject then Groner is good at condensing and talking up the difficulty of examinations. Spring '07 Groner teaches two sections instead of one and is in control for Relg 104, so Good luck."
10756,104876,5.0,1.0,"I personally preferred Groner's lectures to Nemec's not because they were more engaging, but rather because I learned much more from them.  He makes awkward jokes about how the test is going to be very hard but I think he got us to do what he wanted us to--study harder and learn more!  And despite what some may think, he is an EXTREMELY nice guy!!"
10757,104876,1.5,4.0,"He is the worst teacher.  Expects so much..requires about 3000000 pgs or reading and expects us to read it a few time&#63;  he's extremely boring. this class was also taught by Nemec and the class was great.  however, when it came time to &quot;east asian religions&quot; we got groner, and now i hate the class.  i do no recommend goner at all"
10758,104876,4.5,3.0,"Groner is one of the most brilliant people I have ever known, and so it amazes me that he is able to connect so well with even naive undergraduates.  I always looked forward to his class, because he's very smart and interesting.  You cannot BS this man, however, so don't even try."
10759,104876,3.0,2.0,sooo hard to stay awake in class..the readings are annoying..the tests weren't too hard..if you can get thru the readings youre in good shape..also buy a book thats already highlited..also class notes help
10760,104876,2.0,4.0,BORING!
10761,104876,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Groner is a buddhism expert, but his lectures aren't anything special. Pretty dry and boring - puts a lot of people to sleep. Tough essay-based tests - study the lecture outlines. Overall, a nice guy, but an average teacher."
10762,104876,2.0,4.0,"I was more interested in the class than I am after taking it. He isn't a bad professor, but I have to admit I was one of the people who could not stay awake for the entirety of his lectures. Part of his problem was that a of his TAs was entirely incompetent. Interesting stories about his experiences"
10763,104876,4.5,3.0,"Lots of people fell asleep during his lectures, but that could be because they were at 2pm, peak nap time. I thought his lectures were interesting. He's a really nice guy."
10764,104876,2.5,4.0,"he doesnt give a final exam.  just 3 tests and thats it, and we had the option to do an extra credit paper.  it was awesome.  one less final takes off so much stress."
10765,104876,2.0,4.0,"i can NEVER stay awake in this class, no matter how hard i try!  the topic is very interesting and i learn quite a few things, but i get soooo bored.  i think maybe its his voice, it just puts you to sleep.  lectures are pretty boring, although i do like all the stories bc it helps me understand mor"
10766,104876,4.5,2.0,"Awesome lectures if you can stay awake.  Very interesting but the perfect voice to zone out and fall asleep to.  Sometimes overzealous telling about his political views (as a joke, always, but it gets to be a bit much)"
10767,104876,5.0,4.0,Love this professor.  His lectures are interesting and full of stories that help you remember the material.  Hand out sheets for lectures are great and later say exactly what you need to know.  Tests are not cummulative.

10772,104876,5.0,2.0,Very nice and caring man.  Fair grading system and interesting lectures.
10773,973229,4.0,4.0,"Paul Jones is a great lecturer, especially for this class. It is very reading heavy but the topics can be thought provoking. Personally, I would not retake the course but I would recommend taking a course with this professor."
10774,973229,3.5,3.0,Professor Jones is great! Do your readings. Be engaged in discussion. Talk about the material and really parse it out. The TAs are phenomenal. Talk to them too if you have ANY questions. Really great course. I highly recommend.
10775,973229,5.0,1.0,"I don't think I'll ever love a class as much as I loved this one. The readings were always interesting and fairly short, and the discussions were always thought-provoking. Professor Jones is extremely nice and helpful. He's fine with you going to his office just to chat. I wish I could have this class every semester."
10776,973229,4.5,3.0,"Great professor!  Some of the readings are hard to get through, but he makes them much easier to understand and if you read at least occasionally and attend the lectures, it's easy to feel prepared for all the papers."
10777,973229,5.0,3.0,"An amazing professor with incredible insight. His lectures are interesting and even more so when you actually do the readings. Go to office hours and get to know him!! This course is a lot of writing to start off the college experience with, but it is worth it and a great introduction into how to manage your time, readings, and papers."
10778,973229,5.0,3.0,Incredible teacher and very willing to help. I had him for a Cola class as well as my advisor. He relates to and understands what you have to say. I would recommend him to anyone. He is a refreshing teacher and will brighten anyone's day.
10779,973229,5.0,3.0,"This was my first relg class and jones was a great professor. He is humorous, engaging, and a genuinely warm person.  His lectures are very helpful in understanding the readings & i frequently went back to them in writing the papers. grade was composed of 3 response papers, 2 midterm papers, 2 final paper, & section participation"
10780,973229,4.5,2.0,Great professor! Great lecturer..love the accent! very interesting material.
10781,973229,5.0,3.0,AWESOME PROFESSOR AND CLASS! Professor Jones is a really nice man who is animated and keeps lectures entertaining. The material is also interesting and readings are enjoyable. This is a must-take class in my opinion.
10782,973229,4.5,3.0,"Very good lecturer - easy to take notes on, and helps you understand readings. Well-organized class, very thorough, and extremely interested in students coming to office hours. Knowledgable."
10783,1145274,4.0,4.0,"Archie is a very approachable and probably the most enthusiastic and cool professor I've ever met. However, some of the concepts I found difficult to grasp during his lectures. He's helpful during office hours though, so I found myself going to his office hours a lot. I definitely wasn't prepared for the super hard final."
10784,1145274,2.5,4.0,"Archie knows his circuits, but he really doesn't understand how student learn or how to teach.  I had to teach myself most of the material.  I wouldn't recommend him."
10785,1145274,5.0,4.0,"If you're irresponsible, and you don't like to work hard, then don't take his class, stay away. But if you'd like a great education, Archie is the best. He gives students every chance to get an A. If you are a GOOD student than you will love Archie and you will learn a lot."
10786,1145274,5.0,1.0,Professor Holmes has a great sense of humor and I found his class very enjoyable. He is very helpful when it comes to competition ideas and always had entertaining slides and lectures when not in lab.
10787,1145274,4.0,4.0,"It is clear that he prepares so much for the class and works hard to improve his class. However, he expects much more than what most students who are taking an introductory class can accomplish. His test questions are like 5 times more difficult than the questions he go over in class. He only goes over &quot;easy&quot; questions and will lower your gpa."
10788,1145274,1.0,5.0,"I think i found a teacher worse than metcalf. This teach = fail. No textbook, unhelpful slides. Lectures suck. If you are doing well in the class, don't think you are going to pass. It is a trap!!! The final exam is 35% of your grade. The final is impossible. It will turn your A to an F just like that. RUN!!! RUN FAR FAR AWAY!!!!"
10789,1145274,2.5,4.0,Was the worst professor I've had at UVA.  The HW problems he gave was not stuff he taught us.  Incredibly ridiculus.
10790,1145274,4.0,5.0,"He's...alright. He moves very fast and I think most people get lost. However, he makes up for it by doing tons of examples and is really helpful in office hours/through email. This class does require a lot of self-teaching though"
10791,539072,5.0,4.0,"White's lectures are so engaging and he's really funny. One of the most interesting and well structured classes I've ever taken. Grading can be slightly nit picky and tough, but not so much that it should deter you from taking the class."
10792,539072,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors of all time! His class is fascinating and the reasoning involved will likely challenge some of your views; even so, it is so worth it. Professor White has a sarcastic sense of humor that helps when he presents topics that are normally considered boring or confusing. He offers lots of help; work hard & you'll get an A!"
10793,539072,5.0,3.0,"Professor White is excellent. You can tell he's been teaching the same class for awhile, but its still very enjoyable. White unpacks the readings for you and makes everything make sense. The grading is reasonable and I always enjoyed coming to lecture even though it was mandatory. Highly Recommend!"
10794,539072,4.0,2.0,"While this class is very useful for Politics majors, I found lecture bland and rehearsed (he's been teaching this class for ten-odd years). The exams seemed to be graded with a ""checklist"" mentality. If you missed something, but made a good argument you were still graded down. Saving grace was my TA: Ross is the best!"
10795,539072,4.5,4.0,"A good teacher, and certainly devoted to the welfare of his students. Just keep in mind, though, that his seminars will often focus on weak or anti-ontological thought. Belief in a systematic, reasoned framework is oftentimes looked down upon, especially if it concerns God. This makes gender, race, truth, etc. social constructs."
10796,539072,4.0,3.0,"I really liked this class! White's lectures are very clear and straightforward, and he makes the material enjoyable! (Although he can go on tangents.) Response questions are annoying but ensure that you stay on top of the reading and know whats going on. Section was very helpful for understanding the key points from lecture. Molly is a great TA!"
10797,539072,4.5,2.0,"White is very engaging, and often very thought-provoking. As for grades, as long as you read the material and pay attention in class, you'll do just fine. If you can take this course in the FALL. It's only about 20 people, and is a lot more engaging."
10798,539072,4.5,2.0,"What you see if what you get. Do the response questions, go to discussion, do the small amnt of dense reading, and be conscious during class. And viola, good grade. White's lectures are straightforward and he covers everything you will need to know for exams. Probably one of the easiest political theory courses at UVA."
10799,539072,4.0,2.0,really nice/ funny guy. makes lectures interesting with his weird examples. i highly recommend this class if you are looking for a political theory. very little reading as far as politics goes. short paper due every day but its not too hard!
10800,539072,4.0,1.0,Worst class ever. Such a waste of time. He's extremely biased and the subject matter is insultingly simplistic. A good theory professor will give the views of the theorists and present some common weaknesses and strengths. He just gives a completely simplistic overview and then bashes/exalts the theories based on his own biased views.
10801,539072,5.0,2.0,"Please take this class! Stephen White understands what students want to get out of a lecture, he is straight forward and interesting to listen to and isnt out to trick you with any information. Youll do well on the tests so long as you do the reading (not long, pretty interesting) and go to class. Youll want to go. Great professor and great class."
10802,539072,4.5,2.0,"Everybody should take this, if they want a better understanding of philosophy, history and politics.  I learned so much; the readings are pretty short, the quizzes and tests weren't bad, and I suspect that White is a lenient grader.  Discussion goes all over the place, make sure you read so you can participate."
10803,539072,4.0,2.0,"really good teacher, easy for a 300 ... lets you bring a legal-sized piece of paper, front and back, in for the final exam, plus gives you a list of questions, 1 from which will be chosen for the long essay.  do the readings (light but sometimes dense), go to lecture, & you'll be fine."
10804,539072,5.0,3.0,A very able professor.  Very good at clarifying difficult concepts.  The class isn't too hard if you pay attention in lecture; he really explains what you need to know.  Keeps the class lively and entertaining--interesting and a lot of fun too.
10805,539072,4.0,2.0,Lectures and readings are very clear. He dumbs things down a lot but then tests deep knowledge.
10806,539072,5.0,4.0,"An amazing professor--knowledgeable, interesting, relates subject matter to present-day. However, from my experience, lectures and disc sections did not complement one another. Be careful about what TA you get--mine did not build upon what he presented in lecture & I was not prepared for the exams."
10807,539072,5.0,4.0,"Dr. White is one of the best teacher at UVA.  He is so smart and such a great teacher that if you are really serious about the political science major, you should not go through college without taking one of his classes.  Hes passionate about what he teaches and is really nice."
10808,2324930,3.0,4.0,"Great woman, but when she puts on her teacher shoes, she gets scary. Shows as if she really cares about your well-being, but in reality picks favorites and only likes the smart ones. Be prepared to work A LOT for the good grade."
10809,2324930,5.0,2.0,"TISHA ROCKS! she is so sweet and funny, and really cares about her students. easy if you keep up with your deadlines for quizzes and case studies."
10810,1112519,2.0,4.0,"Siva is very pompous. It is basically a class were you read his books and books by his friends. The lectures are very boring and so are the skype conversations. I wanted to be a Media Studies major, but Siva has single handedly changed my mind."
10811,1112519,4.0,3.0,"Not an EASY class. But if you go to lectures and you skim most of the readings you will be fine. The tests are take home, but dont let this fool you, he wants to make sure you pull from all sources. Also, you wont know WHAT to take notes on in lecture, little hint, get as much of his opinion on paper as possible. Very worthwhile class overall."
10812,1112519,5.0,3.0,"such an amazing class. lectures were very entertaining. i lot of reading, but even the books can be interesting"
10813,1112519,2.5,3.0,"Siva is very knowledgeable about the material. However, loves himself a little too much, and he loves to name drop. I'm not sure why he thinks we would care that he has met the guys that wrote  our assigned readings. His lectures are boring. He assigned 7 books plus a couple hundred pages worth of handouts. . .for a 100-level class."
10814,1112519,4.5,3.0,"Professors like Siva are uncommon because he is both brilliant and approachable. His knowledge of history, society, culture, and media are unprecedented at this University. If you want to take a challenging, rewarding, and provacative course on the critical study of media-- take digital media studies with him."
10815,1112519,1.5,5.0,HARD. NOT FUN. DONT TAKE IT.
10816,539082,4.0,4.0,"Very tough but very fair. You'll want to show up to every lecture for a decent grade. Some of the paper assignments may be a bit ambiguous in terms of how they were graded, but the tests and quizzes are very clear cut. Not the most difficult thing in the world, but if you want good grades, you'll put in the work."
10817,539082,2.0,3.0,No Comments
10818,539082,4.5,4.0,"Let me just say, that if you are a first year, with no art history experience, don't take this class unless you really want to work your tail off. Great, enthusiastic professor though, willing to go the extra mile to help her students! Don't be fooled, the class is still a challenge though."
10819,2095577,4.5,3.0,"Definitely take STAT 2020 with Jessica. She is a professor and Maria is a grad student. The class is easy for people who have taken statistics in high school, but more difficult for those who did not. Go to office hours for help with homework, group projects, and exam review. She is very approachable and always willing to help."
10820,1014238,1.5,4.0,"This class is horrible. Nothing the professor talks about is relevant to physics or the material in the book. The class demonstration are coherent and they always fail. Do not take this class unless you have any prior knowledge in physics, because you will fail!!"
10821,1014238,1.0,5.0,The lectures were boring and confusing and didn't help prepare you for the horrible exams.
10822,1014238,1.5,4.0,"Class was suppose to be easy, and it was...sort of. Lectures were a joke and no one learned anything. However, the test were impossible because all the questions were poorly worded and did not make sense. However, don't hesitate to take this class if you don't plan on attending lecture reguarly and don't mind poor test scores."
10823,1014238,1.5,3.0,"This class was supposed to be easy, but not under Mr. Wolf. Median grade was a B-, tests were not related to lecture at all. Do not take this class expecting it to be an easy A."
10824,326113,5.0,3.0,Professor Mohrmann is AMAZINGGG! I loved loved loved loved her class! Her lectures are so helpful and she has a way of getting you to become so invested in the subject material. She is so easy to talk to and is one of the most caring people I've met at UVA. I highly recommend this class to anyone  and everyone!
10825,326113,5.0,2.0,I adore Margaret Mohrmann. She is one of the most amazing people I have ever met and easily one of the best profs at UVA. The course material is straightforward and the amount of required work and reading is very light. She does expect you to know your stuff when it comes to quizzes and papers. Highly recommended.
10826,326113,4.0,2.0,Very interesting class and she is an engaging lecturer.  Fairly easy if you show up to class and read the text.
10827,326113,4.0,2.0,"TA does all the grading, but the class is fairly easy and interesting for the most part.  Go to class, and it should be a breeze."
10828,326113,5.0,3.0,Very interesting class. If you are a christian and are worried about waht they might say...don't. I am one and nothing she said offended or contradicted my beliefs in any way. She does talk about some odd ball beliefs but just remember it is a history of christian ethics class and some of the beliefs were quite a bit different back then. very clear
10829,326113,5.0,4.0,"I had her for the bioethics internship class, and she is still far and away one of the best professors I have ever had.  She is very intelligent, well-spoken, and fun.  She still inspires me years later after taking her class."
10830,326113,5.0,3.0,An AMAZING lecturer and woman. Her lectures are almost captivating and her passion for the subject shows. She is wonderful to talk to and truly cares about her students!
10831,326113,4.5,3.0,"Definately not an easy class, but the material is so interesting that you just want to learn more.  Prof. Mohrmann has the way of expressing everything so that you understand--and stay interested.  She is a very caring lady, and is prepared to do anything for her students."
10832,326113,5.0,3.0,"Best class I've taken so far at UVA, she knows the material and makes it so interesting.  You seriously will not want to miss a lecture, she's that good"
10833,326113,5.0,3.0,Super interesting.  This woman knows her stuff.
10834,326113,5.0,3.0,"She is fantastic. She is very clear and fair to her students, she really loves the material, and literally gets everyone else in the class to love it too. Go to office hours.  My best class yet at U.Va."
10835,1374700,5.0,1.0,Alex is AMAAAAZINNNGGG!!!!!! And hilarious..and really nice and a really good teacher with great feedback. We got to see him in 2 plays this semester.....and he's also an AMAZING actor. Definitely lucked out getting him as a teacher :D and he's a hot tamale. lol
10836,1374700,5.0,2.0,"alex is the bomb. that's all you really need to know- take the class, guaranteed you will LOVE it. develop a great relationship with such a small class & he's such a great guy but most importantly TEACHER! he's extremely helpful & fun as hell."
10837,1374700,5.0,2.0,"hands down, alex is THE BEST. by far one of my favorite professors (yes, professor) @ the university. extremely knowledgeable in acting & theater AND HILARIOUS! GREAAT personality, understanding- i always wanted to go to class; i never once felt stupid in the class & discovered my passion. PS: MAJOR HOTTIE ALERT, seriously"
10838,1374700,5.0,1.0,I LOVE ALEX!!!!!!! He's a great teacher and a great actor. He's really nice and understanding and is hilarious in class. You can totally get an A in the class if you just show up to class and do your work.. you really don't have to be good at acting. It's more about the effort. Take this class it will be a good time!!
10839,1374700,5.0,1.0,Alex is an amazing teacher! Take the class with him if you get the chance!!! He really knows the stuff he's talking about and is really funny and entertaining to listen to. He's also really hot!
10840,1194493,4.0,4.0,"Lectures are a must if you want to do well. She has a smooth style for lecturing but she speaks pretty fast. The readings are pretty minimal for a history class, so not too much work. Tough grading by the TA's - watch out. Critical thinking is a must. This class is treated much higher than a 300-level."
10841,1194493,2.0,3.0,Lecture is not mandatory as she posts most of her lecture slides.  Just go to section.
10842,1194493,2.0,2.0,"The class covers an pretty broad swath of time; we were expected not only to have a full intellectual grasp of the material, but also its historical context, which was pretty demanding. Her lecture style is problematic. She  is very repetitive and it's difficult to stay engaged with her lectures."
10843,1194493,3.0,4.0,"She is a good professor & really knows her stuff. Lectures are interesting & you have to go to them to do well. The reading is not overwhelming & there is only 2 papers, midterm & final. BUT, I would NOT recommend this class. The test format is TERRIBLE and I did the readings and went to lecture. She gives very difficult passage IDs. Its RIDICULOUS"
10844,1194493,4.5,3.0,"Fantastic class. The reading she selected was great - all historians' books, no huge, dry textbook, although there was an optional one. She's very animated and addresses current events in her lectures. Definitely go to lecture, as it will be extremely helpful for the midterm and final - especially if you're behind in the reading."
10845,1194493,5.0,4.0,The woman is a phenomenal lecturer and really knows her material. The readings aren't bad and are necessary for the two exams and the papers. She really involves herself with her class and actively searches for current lectures and events related to her teaching material. I look forward to what she will teach in the future.
10846,1194493,5.0,3.0,Awesome lectures! Everything is clearly explained and the exams are not too hard. Just pay attention in class and take good notes. You can also find some of her lectures for free on itunes from when she taught at Berkeley.
10847,1702411,5.0,2.0,"Matt is a great Lab TA for 3005. If you get him, you will have a really good semester. He makes the 2 hour lab session painless and sometimes fun."
10848,915988,5.0,4.0,She is very passionate and you can tell in her teaching!! The class is time-consuming but she is very approachable to get help!
10849,915988,2.0,4.0,not smart enough for how rude she is
10850,915988,5.0,3.0,She makes her classes appropriately challenging and always has an amazing attitude!
10851,915988,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Smith is truly a wonderful and inspiring teacher. Even if you are not immediately drawn to the class she is teaching, her great knowledge and witty personality will make the class extremely interesting and worthwhile. Very reasonable in her dealing with students, fair grader and manageable assignments. All around excellent "
10852,915988,5.0,3.0,Amazing! Love her and love her classes!
10853,915988,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely AMAZING professor. She made me want to be an art history major. This was a great class too, very interesting. A lot of memorization, but nothing unmanagable. Tough grading but it's very possible to do well in the class. I recommend ANY class with Dr. Smith!"
10854,915988,5.0,4.0,"I learned a lot in this class, and Dr. Smith is a fantastic teacher. Definitely easy to talk to and very helpful. Lots of memorization for the two exams, and the worksheets took a long time. Other than that, reading is not excessive, and it's usually interesting. Tough grader though!"
10855,915988,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Smith is seriously one of the nicest teachers I've ever had.  Extremely approachable and helpful even with a really large class.  Not too many assignments (2 exams, 2 large worksheets), but they each require a lot of attention and time.  Definitely impressive resume.  Maybe I have a little crush."
10856,481815,5.0,2.0,"Professor Nemec is my favorite professor at Kent. I actually looked forward to attending his class. He had super funny, interesting stories that kept me engaged. As long as you did all of your work and tried, it is an easy A."
10857,481815,5.0,2.0,"John Nemec is one of my favorite professors at UVA. I have taken two of his classes, and I would honestly take a third. He is really passionate about the religions he teaches, and he makes class interesting. I highly recommend him, and it was not very challenging of a course."
10858,481815,3.5,2.0,"Lots of reading that I didn't do all of, learned a lot, lectures get off topic a lot but it's mostly fun. "
10859,481815,4.0,2.0,"Lectures are strictly verbal, no powerpoint.  You have to come to class and take notes in order to have what you need for the exams.  He does a pretty detailed in-class review before the exams and often hints at things that will be on the test.  You don't need to do the readings but the paper does require use of one of the books."
10860,481815,5.0,1.0,"Prof Nemec is great. Explains the difficult in a simple, easy way. Exams are straightforward and as long as you attend lectures and read the assigned readings, you will get an A. He is repetitive though.."
10861,481815,5.0,1.0,"Nemec should get a promotion if that is possible, as long as that still means he is teaching. Easily one of the best lecturers I've ever seen. He has a passion for Hinduism and India in general. He engaged me in a manner that made me want to learn more."
10862,481815,5.0,1.0,Amazing teacher! I am always interested in going to class and he gives brilliant fluid lectures that easily convey difficult concepts. He is funny and energized. TAKE HIS CLASS!
10863,481815,4.5,1.0,"Hilarious and will make you want to come to lecture, which you should do anyway to not miss reading checks! Interesting and really easy, especially if you are interested in religious studies. TAs were great too. Only complaint was that you need to write fast on the tests to get the essays done. I would definitely take a class with Prof Nemec again."
10864,481815,5.0,1.0,"He is a very funny guy which keeps the lectures interesting. Tests are easy (2 essays, one long and one short, 5 ID's) because he really only asks you to know the main concepts and use the smaller concepts to define the big ones. Theres no reason to get lower than a B!"
10865,481815,5.0,2.0,"HOT HOT HOT. Amazing professor: passionate, flexible, great readings, reasonable exams, class is lots of fun."
10866,481815,4.0,2.0,RELH 209 - Great class with an awesome professor! I absolutely recommend this class to anyone! It will make you wanna take another class with this guy---and he's funny!
10867,481815,4.5,3.0,"i am obsessed with this man. literally obsessed. he is so nice and flexible and is willing to change books or take any advice needed. meet with him to discuss paper ideas and write a cohesive paper and you will do well in the class, and he is really cool and has sweet stories and wants to tell you all about his life, so take advantage! the man."
10868,481815,5.0,2.0,Extremely easy. Almost too easy. I kind of felt like he was teaching a bunch of middle schoolers rather than a college class. Pretty entertaining though and made the material a little more accessible than did Groner. still didnt make me feel the need to go to class though...
10869,481815,5.0,2.0,"John is the awesomest thing ever.  He's my academic advisor and I've taken three classes with him so far, and I have to say, he's just the best.  That's all there is to it.  He's the reason I'm a Religious Studies major."
10870,481815,4.5,2.0,"Probably the best professor I will have in college.  He has the ability to make a lecture class of 400 students seem like a discussion with 15.  A bit technologically challenged, which provides a good laugh every now and then, very engaging and definitely knows his stuff."
10871,481815,5.0,1.0,"Makes you want to come to class in order to see what quirky thing he is going to do next. Once said something like this in class, &quot;Hey, I am a pretty cool guy, I watch the Daily Show.&quot; And you also learn some of the context for religion in Asia."
10872,481815,4.0,1.0,"I honestly think he's a little overrated--I heard how great he was and am a little disappointed.  But if you want an easy class that's pretty interesting, this is a good one!"
10873,481815,5.0,3.0,"Very entertaining and you learn so much, maks you want to go to class. exciting but you also learn so much and hes very clear.He really makes you understand EVERYTHING in the course.Although you may understand everything, the IDs on the tests are hard because you have to include almost everything there is. not too difficult to pull of an A on tests"
10874,481815,5.0,2.0,"I'll second everything that everyone else has said - really charismatic, entertaining, and intelligent professor. A fair amount of reading required, but I think you could skim it and do decently. He does tend to repeat himself, but he's cute enough that I forgive him. Having a guest lecturer is the worst part of the class, haha."
10875,481815,5.0,1.0,"I really liked him, but he definitely repeats himself a lot in class which can get boring.  But he is very funny, usually dynamic, and cute."
10876,481815,4.5,2.0,a lot of reading but he's the hottest thing ever!  take it.
10877,481815,5.0,3.0,Great professor!  He really knows what he's doing and makes the class fun to be in!  I would recommend taking any of his classes!  This class/teacher made me change my major to relg studies!
10878,481815,4.5,1.0,"I am a religoion major, so I needed his class for my 3rd concentration.  The sections for the class were virtually pointless; however, lectures were fun and interesting due to the way Prof Nemec teaches.  He is active in getting the students engaged, paying attention, and laughing.  His casual nature is veyr approachable.  He definately knew his material and went at the students' needed pace.  Nemec made sure everyone understood the material."
10879,481815,5.0,2.0,"Nemec is probably the best prof I've had to date, obviously has a genuine interest in what he's teaching, and he tells some slick jokes."
10880,481815,5.0,1.0,"I love this class. John's great, and he's funny. Definitely take this class to learn. It won't stress you out."
10881,481815,4.5,2.0,"Professor Nemec is GREAT.  He's young and lively; class was always interesting.  He was a little bit unconventional in his teaching style that some people might not like, but he gave out really detailed study sheets before the finals; they were really helpful.  Definitely take a class from him."
10882,481815,5.0,2.0,John is a great prof.  He's extremely passionate about the subject and makes it interesting for the class.  His humor makes it more exciting too.  There is a lot of reading but if you do all your work you should be fine.
10883,1063455,5.0,2.0,Miss Claire is very caring and friendly. She chooses very interesting topics to make sure the kids enjoy what they are doing. She makes herself very available and is very flexible with deadlines if you are busy with other things
10884,1063455,5.0,2.0,Great teacher.
10885,1063455,5.0,3.0,amazing
10886,1063455,5.0,2.0,*took 1506 too! My absolute favorite professor on grounds thus far.  She cares so much for her students; if you need a extension on your assignments just ask and she will be more than happy to help you. Just make sure to stay engaged and participate in classroom discussions which isn't hard considering how enjoyable the topics are for her lectures.
10887,1063455,5.0,2.0,"BY FAR THE BEST TEACHER I HAVE HAD SO FAR HERE AT UVA. SHE CARES ABOUT NOT ONLY HERE STUDENTS, BUT THEIR SCEDULES AS WELL. GRANTING YOU TIME ON ASSIGNMENTS AS LONG AS YOU COMMUNICATE AND PUT FOURTH THE EFFORT IN DISCUSSION."
10888,1063455,5.0,2.0,Loved this class.  The topic was interesting and she does a great job of engaging all students in the discussions.  Expectations are clearly laid out.  She goes out of her way to be available if you need her.  She uses COLAB better than any other prof I have had so far.  Highly recommend.
10889,1063455,5.0,4.0,Fabulous!  She cares about each person in the class.  You submit assignments through Collab and she quickly provides grades and very detailed feedback which allows you to improve on future papers.  I believe she has laid a strong foundation that will help me write papers in my future classes. I highly recommend her!

10891,752159,3.5,4.0,"To do well in this class you must spend a long time on the home works and really understand them. Professor Lee doesn't give much guidance as to what will be on the exams, but the questions are pretty close to ones that are done in class or on the homeworks. He is a very smart guy and loves physics. This class is challenging no matter who teaches. "
10892,752159,4.5,3.0,"Really liked the class. The lectures are a helpful supplement to the textbook, but I would recommend reading the text material before going to lecture. Prof explains things clearly and well. Prof has passion for the subject and it is, overall, a very interesting and fun class."
10893,752159,1.0,5.0,"If you can avoid 3210 with Lee, do it. His lectures are difficult to understand, which makes doing the hard homeworks frustrating. Luckily he curves like crazy at the end of the semester. This isn't a class where you're going to get 100% on everything - 70s on the midterms and final will get you around a B (if you do the HW, show up)"
10894,752159,1.0,5.0,"The worse teacher I've ever met! Don't choose this! In stead of giving lectures, he divided us into small groups and make us teach ourselves, then never review his crazy homeworks! Ridiculous terrible way of teaching a advanced course! He's accent and grammar are also terrible, which make the course even more hateful!"
10895,752159,2.5,4.0,"Really nice guy, but a horrible teacher.  The class is ridiculously hard - lectures are boring and hard to follow, textbook is terrible.  Only thing good about it is that he's very available outside of class.  The teacher is  very disorganized.  He didn't know the format or content of the first exam the day before & left town for 2nd."
10896,752159,3.0,4.0,"Lee is a good guy and mechanics is a good class.  However, they don't seem to go too well together.  he lectures are terrible; he's got a heavy accent, uses powerpoint, the lighting's bad and he mumbles. But Lee makes up for by being avaliable and helpful during office hours and also the book is very clear. Mechanics is important, take it anyway."
10897,752159,3.0,5.0,"Terrible textbook, very hard to follow lectures. Teacher moves very fast and can be hard to understand. Homeworks are very time consuming and hard. Teacher makes himself very available."
10898,752159,4.5,4.0,"This guy always makes himself available.  The class is ridiculously demanding but is well worth it.  Prof. Lee does, I feel, a good job teaching.  This is especially apparent when he makes his tests as he demands an understanding of the material via problems involving derivations versus the ho-hum calculate this number.  Good class, but be warned."
10899,752159,3.0,4.0,wrong place and in the wrong profession
10900,596514,4.0,2.0,"GO TO CLASS.  Take good notes.  Exams are super easy.  REALLY smart man.  If you need help, just set up an appointment with him.  Take his classes.  USE A LAPTOP!!!"
10901,596514,4.0,2.0,No Comments
10902,596514,2.5,4.0,Take notes and spit it back at him word for word on exams and you will get an A. The more you write on exams the more likely you are to have points taken off.
10903,596514,2.5,4.0,"He gets off on random tangents.  Lots of reading.  Tough grader, but curves.  Lectures are pretty boring."
10904,1751590,5.0,3.0,I had him for my past 4 semesters he is a great straight forward professor.
10905,1751590,2.0,3.0,"Heavily reliant on spreadsheets, formulas, and wksheet links. Had to create Income Statement, BalSheet, Cash Flow without accting s/w, and had to tie together. Very labor intensive. If calculation error  found near the end, it was too late to revise. No advise from Prof along the way, though he did fist pump  thruout. Must have team participation!"
10906,1751590,2.5,5.0,"Business concentrators are silently boycotting him. Seems to favor young male conservatives, and to have an attitudinal edge against others based on political views and status. Not friendly. Nearly everyone complains. The group homework projects are insane. Some in the program are hoping for a new professor, but feel it isn't safe to say so."
10907,1751590,1.0,5.0,I would rather change majors or even schools than to take another class from this guy.
10908,1751590,1.0,5.0,I can't believe UVA would allow a teacher like him. He is very difficult to talk to and has almost zero understanding of what it is like to be a student. He doesn't understand the material himself which is why he only present materials that came with the teachers edition of the textbook. I feel bad for anyone having to take a class from him.
10909,1751590,1.0,5.0,"Horrible horrible class. This guy doesn't teach as much as he reads slides. He demands way too much work and doesn't give proper or timely feedback. You should avoid him at all costs. Even if you have to change your concentration, you should not take this class."
10910,1751590,1.0,5.0,"This guy does not teach, he reads the slides that come with the book and requires you to do group assignments at the same time as 10 page papers at the same time as personal projects. He is the worst teacher ever and I hope he gets fired soon."
10911,1751590,1.0,5.0,AVOID THIS GUY!!! This is the worst teacher I have ever had. He assigned 20-30 hours worth of work every week. He doesn't explain things very well and is at time rude.
10912,1309230,5.0,2.0,such a nice guy. tells lots of stories of his observation experiences and just overall is a great professor. he posts all of. his recorded lectures from the 2020 school year online. I skipped a few classes and just watched the recording and it was totally fine. best chem/physics gen ed I could have chosen.
10913,1309230,5.0,2.0,"Super nice and easy GPA booster. Very nice and approachable professor. This course only has two tests other than the final and all three tests have only 45 multiple-choice questions. Highly recommend taking this course with him. No homework or mandatory reading at all. As long as you study his lecture notes, you'll be fine. I've heard other profess"
10914,1309230,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Evans was my favorite professor I had this semester. His lectures are clear and organized, he allows time for questions during and after class (you get out early every lecture), is approachable, and adorable. If you read the book and listen in lecture, you'll do fine on tests. If you're taking ASTR 1210, take it with Evans!!"
10915,1309230,3.5,5.0,People here are over exaggerating. You have to study for his tests to do well. I studied for 12 hours each to get an A for the exams.
10916,1309230,5.0,1.0,"If you want to take Astronomy at UVA, take it with Aaron Evans!! He is AWESOME. He wants his class to be entertaining. NOT hard at all. You rarely use the textbook. A few take home &quot;quizzes&quot; in which the answers are SO easy to find...they take 5 minutes. and then you have 2 exams and a final. TAKE THIS CLASS! FILLS REQUIREMENT"
10917,1309230,5.0,1.0,He's a really nice guy. He has fun with the students. His classes are laid back and he posts the notes online so you don't have to copy notes by hand or OneNote. His exams are easy too and he gives you extra credit if you submit sample questions before tests. He helps you understand hard concepts during office hours. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CLASS
10918,1309230,4.0,1.0,"This class is really easy and Evans is a great teacher too. His lectures can be pretty boring but as long as you go to class and at least try to follow along, you will get an A. The 2 midterms were pretty easy as well. The final is a little bit tougher but still easy. Evans is great, really cares about his students, and the class is easy."
10919,1309230,4.5,3.0,"Good professor, genuinely a nice guy. Class isn't too hard, strictly from the textbook and notes. If you don't totally understand the material, he can help during office hours. I would recommend the class."
10920,1309230,4.0,3.0,No Comments
10921,539184,4.0,3.0,"Very knowledgeable- one of the premier researchers in his field. His notes don't really follow a hierarchal fashion, which can be confusing if you're used to that. He doesn't use a ppt, he's old school, teaching what he knows. I entered the class thinking I was going to drop it, and left feeling like I actually learned something!"
10922,539184,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. chooses great topics and encourages participation. Many people, myself included, choose a career path as a result of this class."
10923,539184,4.5,3.0,"AMAZING CLASS...best class I've taken so far. Lots of reading and class is mandatory, but te topics are really interesting and you learn so much...I'm taking his seminar (PSYC 541) and its just as amazing.  Highly recommend this class especially if you are interested in forensic psych or law school"
10924,539184,5.0,3.0,"One of the most interesting and intelligent professors I have had at UVA. The class is amazing, and he is entertaining and informative. I highly recommend this class or any class taught by him."
10925,539184,5.0,2.0,"AWESOME CLASS.  Really interesting topics.  Lots of guest speakers, no tests.  Lots of little papers in the begining though."
10926,539184,5.0,4.0,"excellent class - excellent professor - excellent all around.  take a class with him regardless of your major.  you will learn a lot and will be rewarded for knowing it.  not a very hard grader, so long as you know what you are talking about.  a lot of reading and work, but worth every minute"
10927,1309237,5.0,1.0,take her class!
10928,1309244,2.5,2.0,"Frankly, I enjoyed the class but he pulled some bull stunt right before grades were turned in... he lowered my homework average WITH NO EXPLANATION... that resulted in my A- as opposed to an A.. so he does not respond to emails and I a very mediocre teacher"
10929,1309244,5.0,1.0,"I loved professor Sarazin! Such a nice guy, very easy class, and would recommend it"
10930,1309244,4.0,2.0,"I took the class because it was on some ""interesting courses"" list and lemme tell ya, it's a dumb class. Everyone I talk to who took it said the same thing. Sarazin is a good prof to have though, he's kind of adorable and really enthusiastic. His tests are really easy too, the easiest among all the other 1210 profs. Final was INCREDIBLY easy."
10931,1309244,3.5,3.0,"Though he teaches an intimidating subject, he makes only the homework difficult and the tests relatively easy (at least as far as memorizing equations; only the simplest and most obvious are really necessary). He makes a lot of jokes in class; though most make me facepalm, it's a nice gesture to see from a professor in astronomy."
10932,2660929,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Cook was an amazing and experienced professor. This class is definitely not easy, but also not hard as long as you apply yourself. She gave a few projects during the semester which were intense, but doable. You will be working with groups a lot so be ready to participate in absolutely everything!"
10933,129602,5.0,2.0,"The best teacher I have ever had in all of my years of education.  Helpful, patient, brilliant - always willing to guide and answer questions.  Take a class with him whenever given the opportunity - it will absolutely change your perspective on getting the most out of not only your education, but out of every experience."
10934,129602,4.5,1.0,Everyone's favorite
10935,129602,4.5,2.0,"One of my favorite professors at UVA!! He is a really great advisor and professor, go to him if you have any questions he is always willing to help. Tests are take home and sample answers are given to help as a guide!"
10936,129602,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Maxham is one of the best professor to get to know in Comm school. He loves his subject, teaching, and his students. Little reading, pretty easy takehome tests, and he makes it very easy to participate in class."
10937,129602,4.5,2.0,"maxham is awesome.  super friendly, super helpful, totally passionate about his work.  he simply loves life."
10938,129602,5.0,2.0,"My favorite professor at UVa!  So helpful, he knows his stuff, made comm block interesting!  He loves examples, so make sure you come to class with a few & you're set.  On the tests, use marketing &quot;buzz&quot; words.  I love this guy!"

10944,129602,5.0,3.0,"So dreamy, wonderful to look at, very helpful!!!"
10945,2660931,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Missett was a great professor who seemed to love what she taught. The class itself is pretty easy: go to class, finish discussion posts, a couple of papers, and that's it. She will definitely get you thinking about the course content but you won't be overloaded."
10946,6727,1.5,4.0,"nice enough guy and very knowledgeable, but lesson plans are disorganized, very limited use of power point, tons of repetition, and unclear expectations for tests.  grading is erratic as well.  nevertheless, definitely wants everyone to do well, so i recommend talking to him personally if you're struggling."
10947,6727,2.5,5.0,Really nice and funny guy... I really struggled with the material though.  He really likes to see his students succeed and cares about them so I recommend you talk to him when you have problems.
10948,6727,1.0,5.0,The man is an absolute idiot.  Without a doubt the worst professor at McIntire.
10949,6727,4.0,2.0,"He really cares about his students and he curves his tests so much. He hates it when people get bad grades and are upset or stressed, so he makes sure to NOT give you a bad grade, and he doesn't give all that much work either."
10950,6727,1.5,3.0,Very very very unclear! I thought i would gain some understanding of finance after his class but with each class he progressively confused me even more. If you want to mantain your interest in finance do NOT take his class. He will make you really dislike it!

10952,6727,4.5,3.0,Very up-to-date. take his course
10953,2382407,2.0,4.0,Rude af. I would never recommend him to anyone
10954,2382407,5.0,5.0,"Sean gets a bad rep for being a difficult grader who can seem inflexible and strict in his belief in 100 or 0 spec grading. However, I believe these negative reviews are from students who don't want to put the effort in to get an A in his class. He cares so much about your papers and wants you to improve, which you will if you take his class."
10955,2382407,5.0,4.0,"This class started out hard. The papers were graded 100 or 0, and at first, I wasnt doing great. I didnt understand why I was getting 0s, but after meeting with him, it changed everything. From then on, I knew what was expected. Yes, the class is not a walk in the park, but its fun. He also helped me with some out of class projects too!"
10956,2382407,1.0,5.0,"Don't do it. He seems to find a way to give feedback in the most rude way possible, which not only discourages students from approaching him for help but really hurts the class's confidence overall. He has a very specific interpretation for grading that is seemingly hidden from students. Very difficult class with strict grading."
10957,2382407,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I've ever hard. Sean was such a harsh grader and very stubborn with his class policies. There is a ton of writing involved and all of his assignments were extremely broad with his expectations being very high. Don't take this class if you don't have to.
10958,2382407,2.0,5.0,"Sean's standards are unrealistically high. Very meticulous and tough grader. He purposefully will assign short essays that are either pass/ fail ( 0 or 100, no in between) to serve as a &quot;slap in the face&quot; to improve student's writing. Can be condescending and stubborn to change standards, even if an entire class is struggling overall."
10959,2382407,1.0,5.0,"Despite the reviews on here, I wanted to give Prof Duncan a chance. Unfortunately, I should have listened to the reviews. He gives detailed feedback on assignments, yes, but he is the toughest grader I have ever had in my life. If you sign up for one of his classes, prepare to spend all of your time on his class, because if you don't, you will fail"
10960,2382407,1.0,5.0,This guy is NOT cool and NOT a good teacher whatsoever. DO NOT take his class. He is condescending and extremely rude to his students. Thinks he is a gaming savant but is often unresponsive to emails and shows little empathy for others. I know several people who would completely agree. Takes forever to grade. Honestly guy is a complete jerk.
10961,2382407,5.0,3.0,"Professor Duncan is a fantastic professor who gives a lot of feedback on all your assignments. His class may seem daunting at first as he utilizes a system of grading for some assignments that awards either a 100 or a 0, but it really isn't that scary at all and he gives a lot of space to get good grades in the class. I would highly recommend him."
10962,2382407,5.0,5.0,"Intelligent, strict professor who makes you work. He challenges you to do your best, giving very detailed feedback on assignments and leaving the floor mostly open for students to lead class discussions. He may seem uncompromising initially, but he is really understanding and provides lots of opportunities to learn. I have a lot of respect for him."
10963,2382407,1.0,4.0,"I was excited to take a class on critical games, but was very disappointed in this course. I feel like I didn't learn anything and the fact that Professor Duncan kept us waiting for feedback and grades for so long didn't help me improve in the course. At times, he was condescending and made me hesitant to ask questions. He needs to improve."
10964,1325641,4.0,1.0,"Roscoe is very approachable and relatable, he has made me excited about sociology. He is quite accommodating and always willing to extend office hours to suit your schedule. The course work can be as hard as you make it, but Roscoe does a good job of engaging his students."
10965,1325641,5.0,1.0,"Entertaining, funny, clear, and has a habit of making sexual references. Roscoe is hands down the best TA I have ever had! Taught us how to throw amazing parties. Shows us how sociology applies to the real world in unconventional ways. I'm not a SOC major, but Roscoe made me hooked. Plus holds lots of office hrs. He shows you how to succeed 101."
10966,1325641,5.0,1.0,Roscoe is amazing. Best Sociology TA you can get! You will have an amazing year with him :)
10967,1325641,4.5,2.0,I LOVEEEEED ROSCOE! he made soc discussion fun and interesting. he used examples that were understandable and would explain things the professor didn't. He also talks to students like equals. I would definitely recommend him. I would take soc again if he would be my TA.
10968,1325641,5.0,2.0,Awesome TA! Very knowledgeable and is always there to help. Grades fairly. Reviews lectures and gives study guides. Try get him for soc 223 disc
10969,1325641,2.5,3.0,not good

10971,2210407,3.0,3.0,I was excited for this class but the first few weeks were really reading heavy and 80% of the readings are news articles. A lot of it felt like busy work. The points possible for each assignment are typically very small but that means you have to do everything really well or you're sunk.
10972,2210407,4.0,2.0,"Great class! The lectures are mostly guest speakers, so it makes it really interesting and easy to pay attention to. There is a group project which does require some work, but it is pretty fun and gives you great experience. The final was a short reading response style just to make sure you came to lecture and did the readings."
10973,1882728,5.0,3.0,"Amazing! Love him and his course, he truly cares so much &amp; he makes everyone so comfortable. You will leave his class with so much knowledge &amp; passion for the subject, my only wish is for his class to never end! There are only a few grades in the class, but doing well on them only requires some commitment and effort. Great communication &amp; teaching."
10974,1882728,4.0,3.0,"Professor Cavalcante gave interesting and engaging lectures. He doesn't allow technology, so get ready to be writing all your notes down. He was very understanding when COVID hit, and changed the syllabus to be much less work heavy which I greatly appreciated."
10975,1882728,5.0,4.0,"Professor Cavalcante strikes a balance between strict and easy-going. He starts out very stern, but after hes established his expectations, he relaxes into his fun-loving self. His lectures are very traditional in structure, but his jokes liven them up. Ovwerall, a great, dedicated MDST &amp; WGS professor and friendly person. Highly recommend."
10976,1882728,5.0,3.0,I took this class over the summer and was thoroughly impressed with it. Cavalcante did a great job fostering a classroom environment that was very conducive to learning. We all did a great job of participating and it made going to class a joy. I highly recommend taking a class with him.
10977,1882728,5.0,2.0,"Andre is an amazing professor who really understands the LGBTQ community and is really involved in it. For example, our midterm exam went from being a paper to an actual service project. He's phenomenal. I think his grading was a bit tough, coming in as a first semester first year, but I loved the class. If you have any interest in LGBTQ take it."
10978,1309290,3.0,3.0,Final sucked.Do good in first 3 tests.
10979,735852,5.0,2.0,"Professor Makarova's class is group discussion-based. There is a good bit of reading, but it's worth doing because it's almost always covered during class. The midterm and final had multiple essay questions, but it is relatively low-stress since the material is thoroughly discussed. Participation is important; at least the material is interesting!"
10980,735852,3.5,1.0,"GREAT professor. Interesting class (cities and cultures) pretty easy and straightforward. Lectures can get a little rambly.. but easy class, interesting material. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. if you're looking for a medium workload class that's interesting and chill = BINGO!"
10981,735852,1.0,5.0,Discussions are useless and I never understand what is going on. We just had a midterm and everyone was extremely confused. She thinks we are sociologists but we are just studying the material.
10982,735852,4.0,2.0,"very sweet professor, relaxed about deadlines, and not too tough with grades. readings are interesting and a good amount. she is very into the subject and good at leading discussions, although sometimes the topics are overly obvious and dry."
10983,735852,3.5,2.0,Not the best of lecturer but extremely nice.  Great to talk to during office hours--very helpful.  Good reading material.  I'd recommend meeting her one-on-one.
10984,735852,1.5,3.0,very nice but the most boring professor ever. she's incredibly smart but you wouldn't know it from taking her class. good readings but terrible terrible lecturer!!
10985,760469,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ballinger is hands down the most dedicated professor I've had at UVA. When group projects hit, he'll be right there in the trenches with you and your team. He's a great guy and has a massive heart. Block 1/2 Gem."
10986,760469,1.0,3.0,Bad Professor 
10987,760469,5.0,2.0,"Gary B is probably more dedicated to his students' success than any other professor in the comm school. As the leader of the flagship blocks (1 & 2) I guess you should expect nothing different.  Additionally, his 4th year course (M&L) should be mandatory for all students going into management consulting"
10988,760469,3.0,3.0,The guy would be better looking if he didn't part his hair down the center.  He needs to use gel. He is also picky about answers and some of his questions are unclear.
10989,760469,4.5,2.0,I really enjouyed Ballinger's class and he truly did the best he could considering he is an OB professor

10991,1669782,5.0,4.0,"Professor Raymond's &quot;American Ghost&quot; course prepared me, more than any other I took at UVA, for graduate level work. She approaches material seriously, and offers students the critical lenses and theory necessary to do so as well. I have taken other classes with her before and would do so again. Read the texts, ask questions, and you will do well."
10992,1669782,1.0,2.0,"Professor Raymond's Feminist Theory class was miserable. I expected a class where we would dive into critical subjects related to feminist theory, and instead, we spent the entirety of the class reading three books that were totally unrelated. Professor Raymond is awkward, uncomfortable, and often shut down good class discussion."
10993,1669782,2.5,3.0,"I have never met a teacher who seemed more bored of themselves. She seemed to have a clear knowledge of photography, but managed to make it the most bland version of it's history possible. Reasonably nice person but would NOT recommend"
10994,1669782,4.5,4.0,"I took Women Photographers and the Feminist Aesthetic with Prof. Raymond. She is knowledgable of so much theory and detail it is astounding. Her teaching is great, she makes sure reiterate ideas and use the same terms to tie all of the photographers together. Listen in class and read all of the essays and books to get a high grade."
10995,1669782,4.0,5.0,"The class was interesting, but it was very difficult. A lot of people failed the midterm and I do not know a single person who got an A. Most people end up with a C or B."
10996,1669782,4.0,5.0,"Do not underestimate this class. Fun, but difficult to get a B or A"
10997,1669782,3.0,2.0,I enjoyed the material of this class more than I enjoyed the professor - Raymond seemed nice but sort of passive and awkward. My TA was Paul and I liked the discussion section better - it was like a second lecture. Unfortunately people don't speak up in the discussion because many people take the class since it satisfies Non-Western Perspectives
10998,1669782,5.0,2.0,"Claire Raymond is an amazing teacher! She really knows her stuff and her lectures are clear and easy to understand. The class Women's Photography and Aesthetics was a fascinating overview of several female artists and their work. Class is more of a discussion than anything, but you have to do the reading if you want to participate. Overall, great!"
10999,1661602,3.0,2.0,"Material covered was sufficient, but far from complete. The course lacked examples that could have elucidated the concepts better. Most examples were just pulled from the text. Exam and quiz difficulty was not commensurate with the in-class material. Substantial self-study was required. The class presentation lacked formalism."
11000,1661602,4.0,2.0,"Great professor.  The information that he gave us is easier than the textbook.  Easy to understand (at least much better than my previous prof).  Although webwork is harder than the class examples, but its only a few of the problems.  Overall, I would recommend taking his class."
11001,1661602,5.0,2.0,"He definitely knows the subject matter and can teach by giving clear examples. But his class is not really challenging at first. The problems on textbook and Webwork is much harder than the class example. However, the exam was not too bad though... You need to understand the textbook to do the webwork problems sometime for this class."
11002,1284773,5.0,2.0,I took Health Assessment over the summer with Kathy Haugh. She is a phenomenal teacher! Her lectures were worth while and I could not have asked for a better hands on experience in lab. Her demonstrations were on point and it is clear that she knows what she is talking about. She makes the transition from book to practice easy and understandable.
11003,1284773,5.0,3.0,"Kathy is adorable and enthusiastic and knows her stuff. The class is a lot of material but she gives you plenty of opportunities to learn it (the lectures are clear and thorough, she posts the power points, and the readings in the book rephrase and elaborate on lectures) and the labs really help you practice. Work hard and you'll be fine. "
11004,1284773,5.0,2.0,"I took Health Assessment with her as an RN-BSN student.  Perhaps my previous clinical experience helped, but I felt the assignments and exams were very fair, and that Prof. Haugh's expectations were clear.  The assignments required application of the concepts covered in class (and not just regurgitation).  I definitely learned a lot!"
11005,1284773,4.5,3.0,"I took her physical assessment class.  She is very energetic and helpful.  Her exams are rather challenging, but the material in her class is very useful in the clinical setting.  Her exams involve more application of the material rather than just reciting facts and definitions."
11006,1284773,4.5,5.0,She is very sweet and nice but her class is hard. Therefore you should be studying a lot. Always prepare as thoroughly as you can.
11007,1383085,5.0,2.0,Sean is awesome! Very helpful. Knows how to teach calculus. He knows everybody by name and is willing to help outside of a class. Very clear.
11008,1202864,2.0,4.0,I took language and culture with her last year. It was awful. She assigned an absurd amount of reading and random questions from it showed up on the test that weren't covered in class. She thinks very highly of her own opinion and disagrees with the authors she assigns. Don't take her class.
11009,1202864,3.5,4.0,"Really interesting material - she knows what she's talking about and has a lot of experiences that she relates to topics. However, lecture moves REALLY quickly and assigns a LOT of reading. Tests can be tricky. Discussion sections help a LOT."
11010,1202864,2.0,4.0,"Interesting class from a linguistics perspective. Lots of reading both in the book and online. Quizzes and papers are all submitted on collab, and it can be hard to remember to do them all. I think that Sanchez is a decent lecturer, but she could do a better job of making sure that students understand material before going on."
11011,1202864,1.0,3.0,"Like previous comments have suggested, this woman is truly a bucketload of crazy."
11012,1202864,2.5,4.0,"Sanchez's lectures were sometimes interesting, often boring.  They were often easy to follow as she reads off of her powerpoints, but sometimes she would deviate from the powerpoint, leaving the whole class confused.  She disagreed with experts in the field of linguistic anthropology and used her dog as an example of human linguistic acquisition..."
11013,1202864,1.0,4.0,"Seemed to sleep through classes and chronically made stuff up as she went along-including her vague standards, which she changed between assignments without telling us. Blew up at a student who asked for a five minute lesson on something. Not terrible sure she read my papers-they would have like two comments on them, and one would be impertinant."
11014,1202864,3.5,2.0,"I found this class to be interesting. I learned a lot, but the excessive amount of readings assigned kind of made me hate the class. Overall it isn't that hard. Go to discussion, do the homework, and study exactly what she tells you to study for the tests and you'll be fine."
11015,1202864,1.5,5.0,This class is ridiculous. The amount of reading expected is unreasonable for a 200-level class. Professor Sanchez doesn't know what she's doing! Her grading is completely unfair. Lectures are not interesting and the reading is dull. Studying doesn't help at all. She ruined this class for me. DON'T TAKE ANYTHING WITH THIS PROFESSOR!!!
11016,1202864,2.0,2.0,"This class sucks and prof Sanchez is annoying and unclear. Too much info to cover, too many unnecessary readings, and ridiculous stuff for a 200 level anthro class. Not that hard, but I'd rather take something hard with someone else that something easy with her. NOT A GOOD PROFESSOR AT ALL!"
11017,2300599,2.0,5.0,"Two main things that made this class difficult: the subject and this professor. You have to give 100% of your undivided attention (as you should). However, you have to constantly ask for 1-on-1 help. Lecturing a class is clearly not what he's good at. Barely anyone could understand what he's trying to teach us. Better to go to his office hours."
11018,2300599,1.0,5.0,"He is definitely one of the most brilliant people on grounds. He is also very helpful during in-class activities and WeBWork (weekly online homework). However, keeping in mind this was his first time teaching an APMA course, his lecture style had little to no effectiveness. Barely a third of the class came. APMA 3110 tests were extremely difficult."
11019,2300599,3.0,2.0,"I have mixed feeling for this instructor. On the one hand, I was introduced to a wide range of topics and learned some useful skills. However, he could improve his explanations of new topics. Sometimes he expects us to self-teach, but when we ask questions he looks at us like he thinks we aren't trying."
11020,2300599,1.0,2.0,"I don't even know how to describe this class other than unorganized, unhelpful, and one of my least favorite classes I've ever taken. Maiti seems to have little clue to how to actually teach, and have no classroom management skills. He yells at us for not asking questions, but then yells at us for not knowing the answer to the questions we do ask."
11021,2439866,5.0,3.0,Professor Seu is one of the best professors I've had in college so far. She cares deeply about her students and gives ample opportunities to make sure that they succeed in her class. Her feedback on papers is always super thorough and individualized which shows her dedication to ensuring each student succeeds. Would definitely recommend!!
11022,2439866,5.0,2.0,Prof. Seu is absolutely amazing. She is incredibly sweet and cares about her students. There is no wrong answer in her class. She is the first English teacher that I felt truly read my paper and appreciated my work. The class is essay heavy but nothing I lost sleep over.
11023,2439866,5.0,2.0,Super great professor one of my favourites!
11024,2439866,5.0,3.0,"I loved having prof Seu as my instructor, she cares so much about her student's success and writing/creative development. She was always my last class, but it was always the highlight of my day."
11025,2439866,5.0,3.0,"An incredible professor and an incredible course. It was so rewarding and everyone learned so much about themselves as writers. I have never taken a college class in which such an amazing peer/professor dynamic was established, and it was definitely a product of Professor Seu's nature as a person and teacher. Would recommend to anyone &amp; everyone&lt;3"
11026,2439866,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Seu really made it easy for me to get excited about poetry. This is unlike a normal English class that involves tons of reading. Instead, any reading you do helps with in-class discussion. Prof. Seu is amazing at giving feedback and really tailors it to every student. Get ready to write your own poetry that only gets better as time goes on!"
11027,2439866,5.0,3.0,"Professor Seu is honestly one of the best teachers I've ever had, and the reason I'm pursuing an English minor. The work load is totally doable and she's always available outside of class for questions. She makes her classes fun and really interactive, I was always excited for what she had to teach. One of the best classes at UVA hands down!"
11028,2439866,5.0,3.0,Professor Seu has been one of the most inspiring professors I've had at UVA so far. She always makes each class engaging and thoughtfully planned. She's really changed the way I see poetry and transformed my poetry to another level. Professor Seu gives great insightful feedback during discussions and workshops and creates a community of comfort.
11029,2439866,5.0,3.0,"From the first day of class, Prof Seu worked to build relationships with each of her students. This translates into a class environment where everyone is excited about participating. Her feedback on assignments was thorough, thoughtful, and constructive. She is insanely passionate about making her students better readers and writers."
11030,2439866,5.0,3.0,"I've learned to appreciate poetry through her class. Her classes are very engaging, with many chances for students to express themselves. In addition, she is really great discussion leader, sparking many great conversations in the class."
11031,2439866,5.0,3.0,Professor Seu was the most amazing professor I have ever had. She genuinely cares about her students - helping them to grow as writers (and as people). My writing and creative skills were expanded when I took ENWR with Professor Seu. She is the kind of professor you never forget. I deeply recommend taking a class with her.
11032,2439866,5.0,3.0,"Professor Seu helped me to see writing in a whole new light. Her prompts were challenging but enjoyable and she always gave very thoughtful feedback. She was also always very respectful, understanding, and encouraging of all students. She cared a lot about how everyone was doing in class and strived to make it a pleasant and productive experience."
11033,2439866,5.0,3.0,"She was such an amazing professor. College writing courses were very intimidating, but Prof. Seu helped build my confidence and taught me how to find my own style and grow with it over the semester. The readings and small writing assignments are all super beneficial when it comes time for your big essays. Overall, I had a great time in her class!"
11034,2439866,5.0,3.0,"Entering this ENW I was nervous as I don't think of myself as a strong writer. However, not only did Prof. Seu help me combat my lack of confidence, but she also helped me to explore vulnerable and meaningful topics that left me feeling proud of my writing. Prof. Seu's clever course content and magnetizing personality were unlike any other."
11035,2439866,5.0,4.0,Prof Seu's writing class was my favorite class that I have taken. She creates an extremely accepting environment which leads to engagement without competition. I always looked forward to class and got so much out of her instructing.
11036,2439866,5.0,3.0,"Professor Seu made the class interesting by introducing new reading material that built off of a variety of readings or music, the class was never boring. She also gave very helpful feedback in a positive way that allowed me to embrace the creative aspect of the course. Also she was very supportive of the whole class and cares about her students."
11037,2439866,5.0,3.0,"I was nervous taking a college writing course, but Professor Seu made it extremely enjoyable and encouraged creativity. Her main goal was to break the shell of the structured high school essay format and let us develop as individual writers."
11038,2439866,5.0,3.0,"Prof Seu is awesome! Her class was definitely my favorite when I took it. It eased me into college courses through a comforting classroom environment. I looked forward to class, and I looked forward to the assignments. Prof Seu cultivated an environment of compassion and trust in class through her encouragement. And I loved her enthusiasm! :)"
11039,2439866,5.0,2.0,Prof Seu was wonderful! She made standard ENWR1510 into an engaging class that emphasized creative writing and exploration of personal connections to music. She picked relevant and interesting readings. The assignment prompts were never dull or boring. She led great class discussions and always left detailed but sweet notes on essays. I'd recommend
11040,2439866,5.0,4.0,"Professor Seu is one the best English professors Ive ever had. Her ability to engage the entire class, while providing personal examples and supporting literature from various sources, helped to elevate my writing ability. Professor Seu is caring, down-to-earth, and is someone who has helped me dramatically improve my writing ability. Take her!!"
11041,2439866,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Aimee inspired me to become the poet I am today. Without her, my confidence would have died, but she helped me reach for the next level in my craft and creation... I will forever be profoundly grateful for the impact she has had on my poetry and my life."
11042,2439866,5.0,3.0,I LOVE THIS TEACHER. Professor Aimee is so cool and nice! The class is all workshops but she makes them helpful! Not hard but a decent amount of work.
11043,2439866,5.0,2.0,"I'd never had much experience with poetry before this workshop, but Professor Aimee not only inspired my interest in poetry writing but offered specific, incredibly helpful feedback during class and consistently made herself available to meet one on one. Her class was also a ton of fun, and she's such a kind, funny, down-to-earth person. Amazing!!!"
11044,2439866,5.0,3.0,"As a student who hasn't really had much experience writing poetry, Professor Aimee really helped me cultivate creative writing skills, both by consistent encouragement and detailed constructive comments. Also, her style of conducting class is awesome! I felt that everyone benefited from having group workshops, since you brought amazing energy!"
11045,2439866,5.0,2.0,"Prof Aimee was one of my favorite professors in college so far. I had never written poetry before her class, and after workshop with her, I had a whole new level of confidence because her feedback was constructive and detailed but also encouraging. She also brought an energy to class that was just amazing! LOVED this class! Such creative lessons."
11046,2439866,5.0,2.0,Prof Aimee is super respectful and moderates poetry workshops really well! Her feedback is always very detailed and she always makes sure to explain why she thinks a certain change should be made. I came in not expecting much but the improvement in my poetry has been astounding!!! I always look forward to class- there is so much worth learning!
11047,2439866,5.0,2.0,Professor Seu really helped me improve my poetry writing. She was very helpful with poetry revision during workshop as well as during office hours. I wish I could take this class again!
11048,1653462,1.0,3.0,"This professor/GA's lectures are often disorganized and confusing and he often forgets to teach some material covered on the exams. You never know what assignments are due because he is never clear on anything and just sends out a bunch of random emails. If you have a choice, do not take a class with him."
11049,1653462,1.0,5.0,Worst TA ever. Incomprehensible. Looks down on students. He knows his stuff but he doesn't know how to teach. He has no concept of difficulty. He single handedly ruined my GPA with his quizzes that had nothing to do with the class. He sucks.
11050,1055455,5.0,3.0,"He's going to be a great professor one day. I would definitely advise you to take his class. He's really interested in the subject, and you are going to learn so much."
11051,1055455,5.0,1.0,Extremely  Helpful +absolutly adorable like a penguin peep peep!!! - favorite student:)
11052,1055455,5.0,1.0,great person!Very happy
11053,1055455,5.0,3.0,Jon is basically my favorite person in the world. He is super helpful and his discussion sections are what discussions actually should be. He's extremely nice and definitely tries to relate to his students. Just a great guy all around. He's one of those people who you would love to be friends with. Definitely pick him as your TA.
11054,1055455,5.0,1.0,"Jon is the best TA I've ever had cuz he is super nice, encouraging and eloquent in teaching.His sessions informative and definitely go to his office hours, he's a very nice person to talk to:)"
11055,1055455,4.5,2.0,Wonderful TA! I love Waldner's lectures but Jon is always very helpful in answering any questions you have and clarifying. Definitely go to office hours!! And the fact that he's absolutely adorable doesn't hurt.
11056,383717,5.0,3.0,Makes Economics easy to understand. Also connects well with hus students. Would take hime for every class if I had the Oportunity
11057,383717,5.0,3.0,"He is one of a kind professors who dare to speak about the truth. He loves talking about economics and its application in real life. Especially, he loves to relate topics with Trump and China, and other international phenomenon. One bad thing about him is that he asks everyone to buy his book, which cost me around $120. Attendance was mandatory."
11058,383717,4.0,4.0,Coppock is a passionate and engaging professor. His Public Choice class helped me gain a deeper understanding of our political structure and allowed me to dissect some of the most influential Economics papers of all time. My main complaint is that his grading on the exams in public choice is difficult to understand and thus hard to prep for.
11059,383717,5.0,3.0,"A good sequal to 2010 with Elzinga, although slightly more difficult -- the final in particular. Coppock is a friendly and engaging professor who keeps lecture interesting with useful anecdotes and modern examples. Well worth taking."
11060,383717,1.0,3.0,"He gave me a C+ in this class when I deserved a B- for no reason. He allows a dutch knockout which means if the final is better than the rest of the semester, it just becomes your final grade. What he doesn't tell you is that he unfairly penalizes students for doing better on the final. He curved down my 82 on the final to a C+ for no reason"
11061,383717,4.0,3.0,"This was my first Econ class, so naturally I bombed the first exam but ended up with a B. Coppock himself is awesome. Super funny, easy to follow, and his textbook is actually helpful, so read it. My TA was bleh but oh well. Coppock is a great prof who keeps every lecture interesting and engaging. Even if you are not gonna major in Econ, take 2020"
11062,383717,4.0,3.0,He is a great professor and makes his lecture enjoyable. The material is fun and I would recommend anyone who have the slightest interest in econ to take this class. Tests are not hard and there's basically no homework. But sometimes he goes really really slow and it can get boring.
11063,383717,5.0,2.0,Coppock has great lectures and makes his points clear. Go over the study problems at the back of each chapter and the lecture slides online and you'll be fine. Nothing on the exam is that much of a surprise if you've done the practice problems. I understand why people hate the class if they're not doing well though.
11064,383717,5.0,3.0,"Great, great teacher. I didn't get a great grade in his class, but I think most of the reason for that is because I wasn't studying very well. His class isn't a gimme, but it's so well taught and so interesting that it makes the studying fun. I really enjoyed this class and I'd recommend him to anyone."
11065,383717,4.5,3.0,"PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!! Coppock is a great professor and his book makes understanding the material very easy. His tests are not that hard, and the final was fair if you understood the concepts."
11066,383717,5.0,4.0,"Bio major but wanted to take an economics class since it IS UVA. Even though I had zero prior knowledge of anything economics, I LOVED this class and ADORED Coppock"
11067,383717,5.0,1.0,EXCELLENT PROFESSOR!!  Engages Audience.  Coppock supplements topics with humorous stories that help students understand. His tests are true to his lectures and truly follow the book as he is the author.  You will want to go to class because he really is a great lecturer.  I wish I could take him for all my economics classes.  Very funny.  
11068,383717,4.0,3.0,"Coppock is a great professor and really cares about his students. He always makes time to talk to people individually, whether before or after class or in office hours. He is usually very clear but sometimes slips something in during lecture that will be important for the test, and if you're not paying attention you'll miss it. "
11069,383717,4.5,3.0,Coppock is a great Economics teacher and this class was a great follow up to Elzinga's Micro class.
11070,383717,5.0,4.0,"Professor Coppock is an amazing lecturer. His tests are hard so you have to actually study really hard for them, but they are not impossible. I personally got a B- but i will never change this class with any other one! "
11071,383717,3.5,5.0,"He's a great guy, and great lecturer. However, the tests are very hard. The final was very tricky, and long, which brought my grade down by a letter. Also, make sure you get a TA that speaks English. I had a friend who got a B on a test and talked his way up to an A by explaining what he meant when he said this and that."
11072,383717,4.0,1.0,"Most boring class ever. Don't do the mistake of reading the chapters before lecture, you will fall asleep. Since he uses iclickers, I had to sit through every boring lecture which is based on the book he wrote. The midterms can be mastered if you learn the book by heart. Final is long and tricky though, which brought down my grade."
11073,383717,4.5,4.0,"I did horribly in the class just cause the tests were really hard, in my opinion. But Coppock is seriously fantastic, a great guy, I only met him face to face after the semester was over and seriously wish I had visited him much earlier than that-- he's a great lecturer and a great guy!"
11074,383717,5.0,3.0,"He's the best! Definitely go meet him in person like ask him out for lunch or something, he's super nice and approachable. He is very clear & organized in lectures, make you feel like you've learn a whole lot after every lecture. The tests can be tricky and the final was pretty hard. He also wrote a great textbook which was very helpful."
11075,383717,2.5,2.0,"He's an amusing lecturer. Entertaining and gimmicky, I felt insulted at times as I felt that a college professor needs to teach  adults and not entertain children. He also has a strong right-wing bias and his lecture and vocabulary reflect it-- it's painful. Take this class if it's required, pass it if you wish to learn econ."
11076,383717,4.5,4.0,"His lectures are clear and entertaining.  He's got a good sense of humor.  If you're genuinely interested in econ, you can get a B just by paying rapt attention in lecture."
11077,383717,5.0,4.0,"Engaging and amusing, I highly recommend Coppock to anyone taking any course he teaches.  The one caution is that his tests are not only not easy, but sometimes the answers don't match up logically to the way the questions are posed - a common failure of econ.  This is helped by a multiple-choice exam whose results can serve as your course grade."
11078,383717,5.0,4.0,"Great class, probably my favorite econ course.  Coppock is a great teacher.  Take this class if you are ready for a good challenge--but know that Coppock will help you along the way.  Just a nice guy."
11079,383717,3.0,3.0,"He's a nice guy, and very funny, but students should realize that he's presenting a VERY conservative economic perspective."
11080,383717,4.0,2.0,If you study the right way (meaning you exclusively study his lectures) and understand the concepts both the way he teaches them and in different applications the class is definitely manageable. Final is tricky. Hie wording can be slightly ambiguous. Overall Coppock is a great professor! Definitely recommend this class.
11081,383717,4.0,4.0,"Coppock is really fun to learn from. He is extremely charismatic and really knows his stuff, but I think his tests are unnecessarily hard and graded very toughly. He can move a bit fast at times, but overall I truly enjoyed his lectures. Not so much the tests though."
11082,383717,4.0,4.0,"Mr. Coppock is a really amazing professor, he clearly knows his stuff and seems to try really hard to make his lectures interesting whilst still allowing us to learn the topics taught.  His tests are very difficult, some questions require that you apply the concepts in a way that isn't readily apparent.  However, it's still a great class"
11083,383717,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Coppock really puts time into his lectures, and he knows and cares about the subject material. He also puts the slides up online from every lecture, which is very helpful! Overall, I enjoyed this class a lot, though beware of his tests (they can be obscure...)"
11084,383717,3.5,4.0,"He goes to extreme lengths during lectures in order to make the topic more interesting. These are entertaining but not always helpful. His tests are difficult. He advocates learning while testing. Knowing all the material gets you a B while making new inferences during the test gets you the A. This can be frustrating, but the tests are manageable."
11085,383717,3.0,3.0,"Great teacher. Very big lecture (300 kids) but explains most concepts well. Funny and keeps lectures interesting. Uses powerpoint and e-clickers. Textbook isn't used very often and there is no homework. Exams aren't bad, but they're not easy either. It depends on how hard your TA grades them. Overall, I'm happy with the class."
11086,383717,4.5,2.0,Great professor. This is the class I look forward to the most out of all of them.  Listed as an hour and fifteen minute class but only runs for 50 minutes.  Tests are almost exclusively from lecture notes.  Really does make the material interesting.
11087,383717,4.5,4.0,Coppock is (so far) my favorite professor at UVA! I never thought I would look forward to learning economics every Tuesday and Thursday but he makes the subject and his lectures very entertaining and very helpful. Best ECON 202 prof so definitely try to get him!
11088,383717,5.0,4.0,"Awesome teacher. He makes an effort to get to know students and remembers names if you go to him for outside help even in a class with 300+ people. The final is tough but if you go to every class, you cant go wrong- tests are directly from lecture. i actually benefitted from the dutch knockout"
11089,383717,4.0,3.0,"Coppock is a very interesting lecturer and is always very animated. He is perhaps one of the best professors I have had at UVA so far. People complain about his final, which I find absolutely absurd. It's not as bad as people make it sound like. Coppock teaching ECON202 has made the course popular and in high demand (long run and short run :P )"
11090,383717,5.0,3.0,"Great class, interesting material that is applicable to the real world. Coppock is an excellent lecturer who really works to create an engaging experience. The final was not nearly as bad as some have said and was a fair examination with regard to the course material. The book is purely supplemental as all questions come from lecture."
11091,383717,3.5,3.0,"don't listen to the people who say the final isn't that bad. i did well on the first two exams and bombed the final. i think it's pretty cold hearted of him to give such a hard final every year when he's conscious that most students from prior years don't find it fair in the scope of the rest of the course. Btw, Lee, the bb gun joke was terrible."
11092,383717,5.0,3.0,This class was amazing! You'd be crazy not to take it with Coppock. Don't let the idea of a &quot;scary final&quot; deter you from taking this course... it wasn't nearly as bad as people say.
11093,383717,4.5,4.0,Not necessarily mandatory but not much of the tests are from the textbook... Also he uses clickers so if you don't go to class you won't get those clicker points.
11094,383717,5.0,3.0,"Coppock teaches Public Choice innermost workings of the government in a non wishy-washy, clear-cut way. Take this class if you like common sense, insightful humor, and lean to think of human nature with an element of darkness and cynicism  (otherwise you will be ruined). Math almost non-existent, but please bring your logic and you'll do excellent."
11095,383717,5.0,2.0,"He is hilarious! Awesome lectures which offer me a clear overview of macroeconomics. It is not fair to critique his final too harshly. &quot;tons of memorizations&quot; are just three numbers he told you to memorize before the tests. Get him if possible.Go to the lecture, take notes, and you should be fine."
11096,383717,4.0,3.0,"Coppock is a great in lecture and makes you want to come to class everyday. The two midterms are relatively easy and required a moderate amount of studying. However, the final is HARD and you have to prepare-also keep in mind that the final counts for 50% of your grade. Overall, good class but don't get a false sense of security before the final."
11097,383717,4.0,4.0,"BEWARE OF THE FINAL. The lectures are pretty interesting, he is personable, and the midterms are easy. I went into the final with a low A and managed a C+ thanks to the final. Make sure you study and study hard for it. At 50% of your grade you can't afford to blow it. Overall though he was a good teacher and interesting class."
11098,383717,4.0,5.0,"Everything is fine except for the final. The final exam was ridiculous and some questions did not even make sense. If you care about the grade and want good lectures at the same time, take other econ 202 and go to his lectures."
11099,383717,5.0,2.0,"I LOVED this class. All the lectures were really engaging and Prof. Coppock is SO cute, he's really into economics, of course... The 2 midterms were fairly easy, but the final was, admittedly, quite difficult (which cost me an A...) but I learned a lot and Coppock really interested me in the field of economics! I HIGHLY recommend this class!!"
11100,383717,2.5,4.0,"I enjoyed the material somewhat, but Mr. Coppock is a far-right conservative, and he's not very good at hiding it. I was often offended at his politics being injected into the lecture (or his blog, called long run equilibrium). If it had been a politics class, fine, but this was economics, and politics should have had nothing to do with it."
11101,383717,4.0,4.0,Coppock is indeed very passionate about the subject. Econ 202 was easier for me than 201 because there were so many real applications we study. Now I can pick up a WSJ or The Economist and actually understand the articles in the finance section. He brings up his kids/wife a lot in an endearing way. I really want to take his public choice class now!
11102,383717,4.0,4.0,"While the final did suck, Coppock was an interesting lecturer. He talks a lot about his kids and makes jokes. While in class the material seems clear, the tests are an entirely different story. The important thing to remember is to definitely set a lot of time aside to study for his tests. Do not depend on the Dutch KO to get you through this one."
11103,383717,1.5,5.0,The final was horrible. It was like no test we ever took for his class. There was no curve. It was graded harder than Econ 201. Bought my grade down significantly.
11104,383717,2.0,5.0,"I enjoyed the class, but the material was hard.  The final exam SUCKED it was like no other exam he had given and made me want to cry."
11105,383717,4.5,3.0,"If Elzinga is God, then Coppock is the prophet. Cool guy and a great teacher. Definitely take this course."
11106,383717,4.0,2.0,"Good teacher.  If you took macroecon in high school, take it again with Coppock.  Real-world applications, plenty of material to help understand the macroeconomy and didn't put me to sleep.  If you don't like econ you shouldn't be taking 202 anyways, go take 201 with Elzinga... but I think they are very similar in their respective departments"
11107,383717,3.0,2.0,"Coppock is really interesting and funny, he genuinely loves economics and has a whole repertoire of little anecdotes to relate the topics to understandable situations. I enjoy listening to him in lecture, even though econ isn't my thing. tests are pretty easy."
11108,383717,4.0,2.0,big lecture. Exams are pretty easy. average of class: 90% wording is ok (he's working on it)very interesting since he relates the class to what is going on in the US. does not take question during class. not easy to talk to him.
11109,383717,3.0,3.0,Coppock is a funny guy who for the most part makes things very clear in lecture. Tests are fair.
11110,383717,4.0,4.0,"Interesting lecturer. I actually enjoyed his class more than Elzinga's since you can relate things to the real world and he is clearer. However, his tests (especially final) are impossibly hard (much more than 201) with poorly worded questions and requires you to memorize all these random numbers. Take a smaller class if you want an easy A..."
11111,383717,3.0,4.0,"The lecture wasn't too bad, inly lasted 50 mins instead of 1 hr 15 mins. :)  it was interesting because you could apply some of the stuff to real world applications.  the tests were harder than expected, mainly because of the poor wordings of the questions.  memorize numbers and def. look at his blog."
11112,383717,4.0,4.0,"Mr. Coppock is a great teacher and makes things very interesting. The things you learn about in his class are interesting and applicable to the real world. His tests, however, are a lot harder than you would expect. There are a lot of numbers and details, and questions are sometimes confusing. Good class, but don't expect it to be an easy A."
11113,383717,4.0,4.0,"Good teacher, interesting material, but he tests you on a bunch of useless stuff that has nothing to do with the key points.  Lots of stupid stats like what was inflation over the past 10 years&#63;  50 years&#63;  You learn all about an economist's concepts and then are tested on what year he published his paper.  Worthwhile class though; would take again"
11114,383717,3.5,4.0,"For anyone interested in global affairs and moving on in Economics, it's a great class to take. However, if you are not Pre-Comm and not planning on majoring in Econ, I wouldn't suggest taking this class - especially if you found Econ 201 relatively hard."
11115,383717,4.5,3.0,"I was not expecting Coppock to be on par with Elzinga in lecture but surprisingly found him just as engaging and interesting. DO go to lecture, you don't want to miss out. Coppock loves the numbers and nit picky stuff  so make sure you study those in great detail."
11116,383717,4.0,2.0,"Coppock was an OK, if smug, teacher.  The course material is easy, and he took too long to explain things that were common sense, but his tests were more challenging than I was expecting, especially the final.  His questions are often poorly written and hard to understand (and make sure you memorize all the numbers he gives you in class)."
11117,383717,2.5,3.0,"The lectures were decent. He connected on about half of his jokes (good in baseball not so much in joke telling). The tests were very poorly written and very poorly focused, but since they're on a curve it doesn't matter that much."
11118,383717,3.5,4.0,"Coppock is a very entertaining and interesting lecturer.  However, the tests are another story. Coppock did not know how to construct a test and often would place more emphasis on minor concepts and stupid numbers rather than things we covered extensively in class. THe wording of his tests WERE very tricky too."
11119,383717,4.5,3.0,Mr. Coppock is a great professor. I loved the class and this helped me decide to major in econ. We used his text for half of the semester and it was basically like having a detailed copy of the notes from class so it was very helpful. the tests weren't bad but the final was horrible!
11120,383717,4.5,4.0,"Compared to 201, the class is much easier to relate to the real world, and Coppock does a good job of doing so, which made the underlying concepts easier to understand for me.  Go to lecture!  The readings aren't as necessary.  Focus on the bigger picture, what he really wants you to get out of the class, and he really doesn't test on much else."
11121,383717,4.0,4.0,"It's unfair to say he wants to be Elzinga...I enjoyed the lectures...he explains things clearly and links economic theory to daily life, which makes the course more worthwhile. However, midterms and exams focus too much on random numbers and memorization...which make them hard so STUDY FOR IT...much tougher than 201.."
11122,383717,2.5,4.0,"Coppock is obsessed with 2 things: econ and his kids (jackson is the clear favorite). Unfortunately, I think I learned more about the latter during the semester. Don't study for the midterms, they're more mindgames than exams and you will misread half the questions regardless of your preparation. Dutch KO is crucial for success in this class."
11123,383717,1.5,1.0,"WANABE ELZINGA, His class is very boring, and he is trying to write a text book thus his lecture mimics his 'book' to the word. Therefore if you read his book it makes lecture super boring. His exams are not hard but tricky but the option to make the final exam your whole grade helps (as the final is very straight forward and not very hard)."
11124,383717,3.0,4.0,"nice guy, lecture is actually pretty interesting. his midterms are such bull though, memorizing numbers are almost a 5th of the test.  so take it, get shafted during the semester, then study for the dutch-knockout final"
11125,383717,4.0,3.0,remember random numbers for the tests. tests are vague and tricky.
11126,383717,4.5,2.0,"2 midterms + final as a grade, or just the final. 50 min class. Coppock is a good lecturer and seems like a nice guy. midterms quite tricky and a poor judge of how well you know the material. short answer. final multiple choice.  go to class. taking notes on his lecture is very straight forward. tests on lectures. greg jachno awesome TA."
11127,383717,4.5,4.0,"Coppock is GREAT!  I don't know who could possible say anything different.  His tests are definitely tough, but he's a good lecturer and makes things pretty simple and easy to understand, and interesting!  really great class"
11128,383717,1.5,5.0,"Coppock’s tests are completely unfair. They are a complete crap shoot, because of the large number of trivial questions about minute details covered only in lectures. If you take this class prepare to suffer through the boring lectures and unfair tests. The TAs are even less useful than the lectures."
11129,383717,1.0,5.0,"This class is ridiculous. It consists of an incompetent professor, who by the way can not speak in coherent sentences, and even less competent TAs. The tests are filled with small trivial details from lectures, not major concepts from the book. I took ECON 201 with Elzinga and liked that class a lot better."
11130,383717,4.0,2.0,"First of all, Coppock's lectures are all pretty interesting, especially towards the end of the course. Second, he is easy. Yea, the two midterms are kind of BS but the final is a piece of cake. I can understand people coming on here and hating because they got bad grades but that's your fault for lacking intelligence, not his."
11131,383717,2.0,4.0,Coppock really isnt very good at teaching or being cool or helpful
11132,383717,1.0,4.0,I can curse a hundred pages. But I prefer just to say: Don't take his class if you can. Get in a smaller one.
11133,383717,2.0,4.0,wants to be elzinga
11134,383717,3.5,2.0,"i really enjoyed this class.  it wasn't nearly as bad as i was expecting.  the tests were very easy compared to other econ classes, and the workload was very light.  coppock is a very interesting professor, but he tried a little too hard to be like elzinga."
11135,383717,5.0,2.0,"A genuinely nice guy, who occasionally brings in his kids as educational aids, and makes himself and his head TA into comic relief. Not a bad class to actually go to."
11136,383717,5.0,3.0,"Definately a good, clear, concise, knowledgeable professor; but make sure you like your TA within the first week to clear up any questions you have later in the semester. Don't get Pashchenko as your TA if that helps. Tests aren't easy but are manageable."
11137,383717,5.0,2.0,"If you're going to take econ202, certainly take it with Coppock. His lectures are awesome. Tests are not that hard as some people claim. The material comes straight from the lecture notes. Finally, instead of taking material straight from the book, he applies it to the real world and recent events what makes the course more worth wile than others."
11138,383717,5.0,2.0,"I don't see how anyone can write anything bad about Coppock!! Aside from the fact that he is a nice and funny guy during lectures, his notes are very comprehensive and he makes sure to explain every concept in depth. Tests come directly from lecture notes and are not as hard as people make them out to be! Take this class!"
11139,383717,4.0,4.0,"Class is alright.  Coppock is entertaining because he trys to be funny, but he's a good guy.  I wouldn't hesitate to tell anyone to take this class.  Prepare to be shafted on tests though.  They are unnecessarily hard and long, but you should still get a B.  Text is optional...he gets all of his test questions from lecture FYI."
11140,383717,5.0,1.0,"Very good guy, very easy to talk to if you go to office hours. His class is not very difficult, if you go to lecture you'll get everything you need. Read the book once or twice and you're golden. Don't listen to the dumba**es. Just because they're too stupid to go to class, read, or do any work outside of class does not mean he's a bad teacher."
11141,383717,3.0,3.0,"His lectures tell you all you need to know for the exam but are pretty boring. His tests this year have really easy questions which makes the TAs take of lots of points for anything you say that varies from Coppock's version at all, even if you are right! very frustrating."
11142,383717,2.0,4.0,No Comments
11143,383717,1.0,3.0,"He might be knowledgeable and be a good researcher, but he absolutely can't teach.  This man lectures on material instead of teaching it, this is why it is very hard to learn anything from him.  Avoid at all costs"
11144,383717,5.0,2.0,"Coppock is awesome. People who don't like him are usually just bitter because they didn't do well in his class. Everything on the tests is from lecture or blog, so if you keep up with that, you can do well. He's also very approachable and helpful."
11145,383717,4.0,2.0,"Whereas everyone likes Elzinga, response to Coppock was more mixed.  He's a good lecturer, attempts to connect Econ to everyday life, and practically begs students to come to office hours (and invited me to lunch at his house).  The tests ARE tricky, but there's a curve and Dutch knock-out.  It's a good class for anyone interested in Econ."
11146,383717,4.5,3.0,"This class is smaller, more interactive, and much more laid back than most economics classes, yet it is a must for students interested in government and politics.  Here, the professor is incredibly helpful and insightful while more entertaining of the views of his students than eager to press his views on them."
11147,383717,1.5,4.0,Leftist students may want to avoid him - he actually tells you the truth about the economy(that it is doing VERY well and has recovered under Bush) rather than feeding you the lies of the media(who would have you believe that Bush is bankrupting the country).
11148,383717,2.5,5.0,"Don't waste your time, it is deceptive to think you will do well because you think lectures are a piece of cake, and reading won't help either. Like said already, it is random and on top of that useless to any econ knowledge for your future. Just memorizing current numbers won't teach much.  Take a smaller class."
11149,383717,4.0,4.0,an awesome lecturer but the tests don't reflect the lecture or the book so good luck.  be sure to know random numbers that he might post on the blog and be prepared to answer extremely difficult questions.  the final just sucks.  100 multiple choice questions where he has NEVER even mentioned the material in about 50 of those questions
11150,383717,5.0,1.0,So hot.
11151,383717,1.5,4.0,"Don't be fooled by his lecture.  You'll sit there and feel like you understand everything perfectly most of the time b/c he speaks well.  But when test day comes be prepared to try and answer questions that are unclear and only indirectly reflect what was covered in the lecture.  The book is essentially useless as well, don't bother buying it."
11152,383717,4.0,1.0,"Coppock is a good lecturer, and his tests are relatively easy. But be warned: You have to know some arbitrary useless numbers like unemployment rate, CPI, GDP growth rate, etc of current month. For the final, you have to know these numbers + some quotes from the blog. He ends his class 20mins early"
11153,383717,1.0,4.0,"Coppock is deceptive, plain and simple.  Inserts too much politics into his lectures and the tests don't reflect what we've covered.  And stop bringing your kids to lecture.  That's just messed up."
11154,383717,2.0,4.0,"Coppock is deceiving. Upon first going to his lectures, you think &quot;I'm really going to like this class,&quot; because he IS a good lecturer. However, his one point in life is to trick you on the midterms and the final. Don't try studying for three days; no help. (also,his voice=annoying like Mickey Mouse"
11155,383717,1.5,5.0,"I thought that this guy was just thought of as bad because people compared him to Elzinga. NO. Tests are impossibly hard, requires memorizing of totally random numbers that he may have said once in class. UVA, please fire this guy and give Elzinga his salary to teach ECON 202 in his place."
11156,383717,5.0,1.0,great prof tests are pretty easy sets huge curve so the median is A-/B+
11157,383717,3.5,3.0,"his lectures are nice and outlined, which is great for taking notes. however, on the tests he asks alot about current, random stuff so make sure you write that stuff down in notes and check the weblog."
11158,383717,1.0,5.0,No Comments
11159,383717,2.0,3.0,"interesting class. one of my favorite professors. dont bother reading, just take good notes and study them."
11160,383717,1.5,4.0,"Coppock is terrible. Even his voice is annoying. He intentionally tries to trick you on the tests. Take a smaller class for 202 - it's worth it. He's an ego maniac, too."
11161,383717,1.0,3.0,terrible
11162,383717,5.0,4.0,"Great, well laid out lectures, good speaker.  Tests are a little sketchy, he doesn't clearly define what he wants you to know, but lecture is interesting, especially if you're into econ."
11163,383717,3.0,1.0,laid back easy going crazy curve at the end half of the class got A.
11164,383717,1.0,5.0,"For your own good, please avoid Coppock when taking Econ 202. I'm bitterly regretting it. I had fun under Elzinga but Coppock is a repetition of pointless memories of terms"
11165,383717,2.0,5.0,hot
11166,383717,4.5,3.0,"Coppock was hard, but all you need are his notes. He is very clear, and very enthusiastic. Readings are not important at all. One of my favorite profs."
11167,383717,5.0,3.0,"I think Professor Coppock was by far one of the best professors I've had at UVA. He makes the material very interesting and breaks it down step by step. He has a great sense of humor. If i had to spend an hour and 15 min in a class, I'm glad it was his. It definately kept me awake."
11168,383717,1.0,5.0,"Don't ever take this class from him. He doesn't teach at all. His lectures are just explanation of graphs and definitions, you just end up copying words and definitions and graphs the whole time, not learning anything. His tests are so retarded too."
11169,383717,4.5,3.0,"I found Coppock to be a very good teacher.  Although he does not have as many real-world experiences to teach from as Elzinga, I thought he actually did a better job of explaining the material.  However, to be fair, his tests were hard and the head TA made big mistakes in preparing the answer keys."
11170,383717,5.0,2.0,"I took Coppock for econ 202 and was not completely impressed. However, econ 333 is a different story. He really excels in the small classroom setting and public choice seems to be a forte. He supplements a rather boring book with lots of interesting reading."
11171,383717,1.5,5.0,"Obviously, he will have to take the semester evaluations and build from there. His lectures seemed organized, but when trying to study for exams, you realize you wrote down graphs, definitions and a few lists. I suggest you find the best TA availbale."
11172,383717,2.0,5.0,"new teacher, did ok...kinda hard tho"
11173,383717,3.0,1.0,"With Elzinga as his primary basis for comparison, its hard for Coppock to live up to our expectations.  He's a decent professor. The class really isn't that hard."
11174,383717,1.0,5.0,"This man's face appears next to the word &quot;horrible&quot; in the dictionary, and can also be found in the definition of &quot;unfair.&quot; What a horrible prof. His exams are tortorous and poorly composed."
11175,383717,1.0,4.0,"He may know his economics, but he does not know how to teach it.  He jumps around and is very incoherent in his lectures...If only he knew English, he would know how to write a test.  Also, there is way too much emphasis on small details like definitions."
11176,383717,1.0,5.0,not very good or interesting
11177,383717,2.5,3.0,No Comments
11178,383717,1.5,4.0,"When Coppock sees a bunch of confused stares, he just repeats what he said in a louder tone. The tests are extremely poorly worded, and worse, the key (written by the head TA I believe) does not match the test, and counts off correct answers."
11179,383717,3.0,3.0,"Good professor, he knows his stuff but he's not so good at conveying the material to the students. Tests are horrible, the quality of your TA is essential."
11180,383717,1.0,3.0,"is most likely a good guy, but a terrible professor. fills lectures with energy but no relevant information. tests are hard because no one knows what the questions are asking. get a very good ta and plan to self teach using the book."
11181,383717,2.5,2.0,I love Macroeconomics but wasn't a fan of this class.
11182,383717,4.5,3.0,good teacher...really loves economics and tries to make his students feel the same...however tests are worded rather poorly and harshly graded
11183,383717,2.0,3.0,"vague in lectures about important points. bad tests, places lots of emphasis on minor details. boring class, he has enthusiam, but can't give it to the students. get a good ta."
11184,383717,3.0,4.0,"Hes a great guy, very enthusiastic. He clearly loves econ more than any of us ever could. His clarity improved throughout the semester but didnt ever reach &quot;clear.&quot; Tests are very unfair even if you understand material."
11185,383717,1.0,3.0,the guy was boring as hell and lecture sucked and he made everything more confusing than necessary
11186,383717,3.5,5.0,"Lectures are interesting and professor is enthusiastic, however, tests are unnecessarily hard, poorly worded, and harshly graded. One can study for hours and understand all material but not understand what test questions are asking- frustrating."
11187,383717,3.0,4.0,"He's a great guy but not a great prof.  Tests are poorly worded and hard.  Lecture is everything, actually tends to contradict the book."
11188,383717,4.0,1.0,"We're working to set up our macroeconomic model here.  We'll call the price level, umm, p-100.  Now we're talking about REAL GD-P."
11189,383717,3.5,2.0,Coppock's a stud...its not hard...real world applications such as the supply shocker
11190,383717,4.5,4.0,"He has improved greatly over the course of this semester. He has become more clear and is very enthusiastic about macroeconomics. His tests are difficult, like Elzinga's, but they are curved."
11191,383717,4.0,3.0,"He does love Econ. This class started off rough, but he has improved the clarity and the presentation. Tests can be difficult, but like Elzinga, he is using the Dutch Knock Out system. GO TO CLASS! The lectures are everything!"
11192,383717,3.0,3.0,"Coppock is very enthusiastic about macro, but can't get the students to feel the same.  Calls every class and every detail &quot;very important,&quot; which loses the focus on what really is important.  Tests can be nitpicky, and the grading strict at tim"
11193,383717,2.5,4.0,"Obviously loves what he teaches, but is nothing like Elzinga in teaching ability.  Tests are ridiculously hard.  To do well on them you have to listen to him closely in class, which is quite a chore."
11194,555759,5.0,4.0,"Professor Edmundson is brooding and witty and yes, sometimes a little sarcastic. He is very well-read and well-spoken, though, and I found myself filling my notebook with hilarious little Mark-isms. (Keep an ear out for them!) Most importantly, however, he made me think.. my college experience would certainly not have been the same without him."
11195,555759,4.5,3.0,"Truly a brilliant lecturer. This class changed my entire perspective on Western Lit. He likes to apply ideas from reading to happenings on Grounds, which is always very interesting. "
11196,555759,4.5,4.0,"Passionate and intelligent.  He's obviously an ex(&#63;)-hippie and tends to let students' faulty arguments slide, but his are always well thought out and usually brilliant.  If you get the chance, talk Freud with him because his thoughts on the good doctor are always illuminating."
11197,555759,3.5,2.0,"He is a good teacher, but there are times when he goes on 15 minute rambles."
11198,555759,5.0,4.0,"Please, take a class with this man, if you can.  Two papers, no final.  In that sense, the class was easy. In another, wrapping your head around what he's saying is a different story entirely.  Best class I've ever taken."
11199,555759,1.0,1.0,"Edmundson is a walking parody of an academic. When, occasionaly, he peers down off his pedestal to see whether anyone is listening to him, I suspect he discovers that this is not the case."
11200,555759,1.0,5.0,On a couple different assignments he intimated that I had to consult critical sources for my ideas when they were in fact my own. He wanted to know &quot;who told me&quot; the witty title I gave to an oral report. None of my work was anything less than original-but as a non-traditional student I was required to explain myself multiple times.
11201,555759,5.0,4.0,"Mark trumpets the high call--to read &quot;the best of what has been thought and said&quot; that we might become genuine participants in the world. I felt exhilirated in the presence of this brilliant, altruistic thinker.  It would never occur to Mark to treat literature as anything divorced from real life. He assumed we could sing off his page. So we did."
11202,555759,4.0,3.0,"He made me think.  Bless him, he made me think."
11203,555759,4.0,3.0,His class was like something from the Dead Poets' Society.  Awesome.
11204,555759,5.0,1.0,"Incredibly knowledgeable & deeply passionate about the material and teaching, he sometimes allows poor or just completely incorrect understanding of the material to slide in hopes of having a multiplicity of interpetations. I wish he'd pull out the Whitmanian &quot;Rough&quot; and lay down the law more often."
11205,269039,5.0,3.0,"Ill be honest, I only took his class because he was on Adam Ruins Everything."
11206,269039,4.5,1.0,Prof Nosek is awesome! My favorite class of first semester. His lectures are engaging and fun. If you read the textbook and actually study you will do well on the exams and end up with a good grade! Take this with nosek!!
11207,269039,5.0,3.0,"This was my favorite class of the semester!! Very engaging and fun. The tests are based on the lectures and focus questions in the book, if you do the reading tests are EASY! So much fun!!"
11208,269039,4.5,2.0,"This class was definitely my favorite so far! Prof Nosek managed to keep my attention throughout the entire class. He was hilarious and incorporated relatable, hand-on examples for everything we learned. The exams could be tricky but you can usually get a pretty good grade if you study. Would recommend this class to everyone!!"
11209,269039,5.0,1.0,"He is one of my favorite professors at this university.  His classes were engaging and intellectually stimulating.  He is unusually clear and informative - I still refer to his notes even now.  What's more, I had little interest when I started this course; however, I have taken several additional courses and am considering it as a second major."
11210,269039,4.0,4.0,"If you plan to take Psyc101, go with NOSEK! A stellar, down to earth instructor who knows his stuff! He teaches very well. The only thing I wasn't too thrilled about was the amount of material we had to cover per exam. Alot of reading.And the lectures are only supplementary to the text. Must have a solid studying stragegy that works for you."
11211,269039,4.5,3.0,"This was my favorite class this semester!  Nosek is funny and entertaining, and he shows a lot of good video clips to help explain the material.  I looked forward to every lecture, and reading the textbook wasn't even that bad.  The tests are not easy, though.  Make sure you read and study the study guides that the TA's put out."
11212,269039,5.0,3.0,I loved coming to lecture. Easily the best professor I've had. The focus questions in the reading are VERY important along with examples he gives in lecture. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR.
11213,269039,3.5,4.0,"good teacher really funny, he kept our class interesting with his sense of humor. ALWAYS DO THE FOCUS QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK- i went from a 75 in one exam to a 97 in the next because i did them."
11214,269039,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING TEACHER! he actually makes you want to go to lecture...(almost lol). I personally thought the class was easy however, i love psychology too so... u know how that goes. I heard alot of people say it was challenging...but as long as you read the book you should b good. P.S.- i hate reading and i did fine =]"
11215,269039,4.5,3.0,"Best teacher I've ever had.  I looked forward to his lectures every week, and although some found his tests annoyingly tricky, studying and reading the textbook certainly pays off. take him!!!!!!"
11216,269039,5.0,4.0,Amazing teacher!!!  You do have to read the text book though.
11217,269039,5.0,3.0,Prof. Nosek is a great professor. He is hilarious. Going to class is not neccessary because he puts his slides and notes on the slides online. His curve ensures that 60% of class will get atleast a B. Its a great class to take.
11218,269039,3.0,4.0,Good teacher but the work is very hard. It seems a bit extensive for a 101 class. If you don't like do read don't take his class. I probably wouldn't take the class over if I had the chance.
11219,269039,4.5,3.0,"Engaging lectures and interesting stories. He's a great professor. To do well on the tests, you definitely have to read the book and sometimes the reading can be extensive. But depending on your TAs, they may type up (very good!) class notes, so if you miss a class, you'll be ok on material covered in lecture. A good 1st semester class!"
11220,269039,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've had at UVA. Makes you want to attend lecture everyday. Tests are challenging but not so bad if you read the book. Overall great class! Recommend it to anyone, even if you're not interested in psychology, you will be."
11221,269039,4.5,4.0,"He is a great professor! lecture s are really interesting, but tests can be difficult!"
11222,269039,5.0,2.0,"While this class isn't easy, Nosek is one of the best, if not the best professor in the department. Friendly, approachable, and keeps lectures interesting. Highly recommended if you want an interesting class and are willing to work for the grade."
11223,269039,3.5,4.0,"Great class!  Lectures were always interesting and intellectually stimulating.  However, the tests are hard, so read the book, go to class, and study."
11224,269039,5.0,3.0,"Great class, fantastic teacher! Prof. Nosek is wonderful! He does a good job covering the material and makes lecture interesting and engaging. The tests aren't too bad. Just make sure you do the reading and go to class (a lot of the test questions come from lecture.) Very generous grader! Highly recommended class!!!"
11225,269039,3.5,5.0,"He is a great professor, very engaging and interesting lecture...however his tests are HARD. They are based on applying the information not just remembering and memorizing. Do the reading and go to class!!!"
11226,269039,4.5,2.0,"Incredible teacher!  He teaches you a lot, and you have to read the book, but he always makes it fun and interesting.  He curves so that at least 60% of the class gets a B- or better, so grading is fairly easy.  Don't take him because he is an easy grader--take him because he is clear, fascinating, and very worthwhile!  Lots of real world examples!"
11227,269039,5.0,3.0,Great class! It's the only class that I've ever looked forward to going to in my life. You definitely need to read the textbook but it's not too bad. He uses lots of video clips in lecture and examples to help the class understand the material. Tests are a little bit tough but the class is definitely worth it!
11228,269039,4.5,2.0,Interesting material and interesting lectures. He's more funny than not and the tests are fair. Overall a great class.
11229,269039,5.0,3.0,"This guy is great. Lectures are interesting and clear, throws jokes in his slides and tests, plays music before class, and gives really good examples to help understand material. The class is a lot of info though, but its worth taking, especially with him."
11230,269039,4.0,2.0,"Nosek is a great professor. If you decide to go to lecture, it is worthwhile and occasionally fun. If you are going to take psych, definitely take it with Nosek."
11231,269039,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING professor! Makes lectures extremely engaging, using a variety of sources (movie clips, ads, etc). You'll never want to miss his class."
11232,269039,5.0,3.0,The best teacher I've had at UVA so far.  Also the only class I have ever looked forward to going to in my life.
11233,269039,4.5,2.0,"Having taken his class , I knew that I wanted to major in psychology. Professor Nosek, or Brian as he wants students to call him, is like a stand-up comic slash professor. He rewards you if you improve your test scores for all three tests, which greatly motivated me to do well. TAs were great,too."
11234,269039,4.0,2.0,"Great teacher!  He was funny, interesting, and played music before each class.  Slides and notes from each lecture are online.  I highly recommend this class"
11235,269039,4.0,4.0,INTERESTING CLASS! I looked forward to going bc his lectures were so engaging and fascinating.  Highly recommend
11236,269039,4.0,4.0,"Awesome lecturer...makes class fun.  MC tests are not easy, but class is well worth taking."
11237,269039,2.0,5.0,"He is very engaging, but his test do not relate to lecture.  If you are looking for a class that will make you want to take more psychology this is not it."
11238,269039,4.5,2.0,"Professor Nosek explains everything extremely well and allows you ample opportunities for questions as well as many helpful tools for the tests, such as having all the slides online...oooo yeah!!"
11239,269039,5.0,3.0,"Nosek's cool.  He's funny, too.  Also, attendance in his class was never an issue.  People always come--he's that good."
11240,269039,5.0,2.0,The best professor I've had at UVA so far!
11241,269039,3.5,4.0,"His class was definitely very demanding; lots of reading.  His lectures and the text are both crucial for the difficult exams.  But if you keep up with your reading and especially study the lecture material well, you'll do fine.  ...And he isn't that bad to look at ;)"
11242,269039,4.5,2.0,"Come to class & READ! and not the night before an exam either. Coming to class isn't hard, he makes it interesting with demonstrations and videos. Makes a lot of jokes. Reading is easy too, book is actually interesting. Don't slack off though, it's easy to do. Hopefully TA's don't suck (mine did)."
11243,269039,4.0,4.0,"Good professor, he keeps the lectures entertaining with video clips and experiments.  The tests are pretty hard but with enough reading you should be ok."
11244,269039,4.5,4.0,Brian Nosek is a great professor. He keeps his classes light-hearted and entertaining. His main points are usually illustrated by video or some sort of engagement by the students. Lectures are much better than the material itself or the book though.
11245,269039,5.0,2.0,Amazing teacher. Uses great analogies and makes the class as fun as possible. Good amount of reading but not necessary to do well. Lectures are interesting. He's cute and really wants to help you understand. Take this class.
11246,269039,5.0,2.0,"Very cool professor.  Always has a funny anecdote, and tries to keep things light-hearted during class.  Not a hard prof, as long as you go to class and at least skim the readings.  Really sparked my interest in the field."
11247,269039,5.0,3.0,I never wanted to skip his class. He is young and always has funny relevant anecdotes.  His tests cover a butload of material but if you do the readings your fine.  If your TA's suck then review sessions will be a joke.  He is hot too.
11248,269039,3.5,3.0,Fun teacher that others havent compared to as far as maintaining interest.  The tests are hard and the review sessions are as good as your TA's.
11249,269039,5.0,2.0,It was a fun class and the professor was awesome and very helpful. I loved the class..
11250,269039,5.0,2.0,An extremely helpful and approachable professor! My interest in Pyschology was definitely sparked off by his enthusiasm for the subject.
11251,269039,5.0,2.0,"A fun, funny guy. Easy to pay attention to and not too bad on the eyes either. Class isn't hard at all, I recommend it."
11252,269039,5.0,1.0,"Brian Nosek is awesome! His class is not that hard, and lectures are fun to attend. Lectures are all posted on Toolkit. He played music before each class and really tried to make the lectures entertaining."
11253,269039,5.0,3.0,"Very funny guy. Knows how to appeal to students, even on tests."
11254,269039,4.5,3.0,"Fun lectures with videos, plays music at the beginning of class, really tries to be the cool guy.  Even puts jokes on the tests, which are hard but reflect the textbook and the lectures."
11255,465671,5.0,4.0,"I had Sr. Pellón for Modern LatAm Lit and as my mentor for an independent study. He grades tough on Spanish spelling and grammar, but very easily on literary analysis and argumentation. He really knows his stuff. I've always respected him for how engaged he continues to be with undergrads while also overloaded with several PHD students at once."
11256,465671,5.0,3.0,The best professor at UVA
11257,465671,4.5,3.0,One of my favorite classes I've taken at UVA and one of my favorite professors. Extremely nice and class was enlightening. Highly recommended!
11258,465671,1.5,5.0,"Unfair, takes weeks upon weeks to return papers.  Uncaring. Liked him at first but he screwed me over in the end!! If you're a grad student, do not take!!"
11259,465671,4.5,3.0,"This was the best class I have taken at UVA.  I don't know why other people were so unhappy, though perhaps I was lucky that this class was conducted in English.  Pellon is knowledgeable, incredibly helpful (I have never gone to office hours for another professor more than once - his are the only ones I have ever found engaging), and quite fair."
11260,465671,1.5,4.0,the worst professor I ever had. abandoned our class midway through the semester--just unbelievable. hates certain students for no reason. does not return work and even gave final grades before looking at our papers. unhelpful and condescending.
11261,465671,1.0,3.0,"Love him,he is so nice and I have learned alot from his class Truly an authentic experience. Take his class!"
11262,465671,3.0,4.0,"Enthusiastic teacher, but I don't think I learned that much in his class, but I never minded going.  He engages his students and makes the class interesting, if not substantial.  Ridiculously hard grader, and he takes FOREVER to return papers, but he is ridiculously nice as well."
11263,465671,1.0,1.0,A phony.
11264,465671,1.5,4.0,"LatinAmer Women Poets sounded great, but as is typical of him it devolved quickly into students teaching themselves. He almost always comes to class unprepared, and this is seen again and again in him starting the class with what WE think of the poet. He takes FOUR WEEKS to return 5-page papers. ONLY GOOD FOR UNDERGRADS!"
11265,465671,4.5,4.0,"Excellent, engaging lecturer. Enthusiastic and it shows!  Tough grader, especially with grammar.  He takes one point off per error.  However, though he is tough, he is certainly fair.  Will be a rewarding class for students who make the effort.  Very helpful with the reading assignments, makes reading Spanish easier than you thought it would be."
11266,465671,5.0,4.0,He is THE MAN! Gustavo loves students and his class is fun and academic.  Take him!!
11267,465671,5.0,4.0,"the man simply loves the literature and after his class, you will too."
11268,465671,5.0,3.0,No Comments
11269,1383178,3.0,4.0,"Her office hours are only once a week and it is normally the day before papers are due! She seems very nice and she is very intelligent, however, she is not specific on what she is looking for on papers-very little feedback! Be specific on midterm and final, even when she tells you not to be!"
11270,1383178,5.0,1.0,"Professor Spearing is the best!  She knows EVERYTHING about medieval literature, she's a pretty easy grader, and she's just the sweetest lady ever.  The reading load is pretty light.  Class is really chill, and her lectures are pretty interesting.  2 papers, a midterm, and a take-home final.  I highly recommend taking her class!"
11271,129815,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Mikalson is an engaging lecturer, his knowledge is impressive, and all his slideshows contain pictures he took himself while travelling in Greece. Tests are really straightforward (IDs, straight from lecture); you'll do well on tests if you go to lecture, take detailed notes, and do the reading. Really interesting class if you like history."
11272,129815,5.0,2.0,"Immensely knowledgeable, but down-to-earth and friendly as well. He is very passionate about the subject material, and knows how to make it easy to understand, interesting and fun. Also, plenty of study materials are provided to make our lives easier. No complaints here, awesome professor!"
11273,129815,4.5,2.0,"He knows so much about ancient greece! Very interesting, adorable little old man. He shows lots of pictures that he himself took while in greece. He made me want to major in classics."
11274,129815,4.5,2.0,Great class
11275,129815,3.5,4.0,...
11276,129815,4.5,3.0,"Professor Mikalson knows Greek, and how to teach it, like the back of his hand. He definitely does care about his students; the entire class is structured around getting his students to fully grasp and retain the material. Call it a &quot;formula&quot;, but whatever he does to teach this class, it works! Also, he can be pretty funny if you give him a chance"
11277,129815,2.0,4.0,"The only reason his teaching method can be considered clear is because everything he does is very dry and clean cut. What he writes on the board is exactly what he writes on the handouts with little or no elaboration. Also, he is unfair and does not listen to his students. Seems brusque and uncaring, ultimately a crotchety old man."
11278,129815,4.5,2.0,"Mr. Mikalson made Greek fun.  It's a bit tough to learn, but his formula of notes, quiz, notes, quiz, notes works pretty well.  Come to class and you won't have to read the text book (you still need it for homework), and don't be afraid to ask him questions.  He's very nice and very funny, and he made me want to take GREE102."
11279,129815,4.0,4.0,"I was worried about having Mikalson as prof. after reading some of the comments on here. However, I found them all to be baseless. I loved this guy! He's funny and presents the material really well. Don't get me wrong - the subject is very hard but I'll be taking Greek 102 with him next semester for sure!"
11280,129815,4.0,4.0,"While the class can be boring at times, Michalson is a hilarious and sweet man. He's funny and engaging and I love the guy to death (plus he never yells)"
11281,129815,5.0,4.0,The best Classics professor
11282,129815,4.0,3.0,he's good. he isnt as bad as he sounds here. he's nice (esp if you are a classics major). a cute old guy. lectures very easy to follow.
11283,129815,4.5,2.0,i thought the class was very interesting and made me consider majoring in the classics.
11284,129815,2.5,2.0,"His class isnt exactly hard, but he just isnt interesting..."
11285,129815,4.5,2.0,"Knows his stuff about Greece, but his voice is too soft and can succumb to the whirr of the slide projector if you don't sit close enough. There's no text, per se, but his lectures do an excellent job covering all interesting material in a well structured manner. The classic readings are a nice bonus, in my opinion, and the tests are nothing hard."
11286,129815,2.5,4.0,HARD!! I took this is a fun class (im a science major) All he does is lecture and put up slides of art.  Mumbles and does not make class interesting. The tests are too specific.
11287,129815,4.5,2.0,This class is easy enough to get an A in as long as you keep up with the homework and study for the quizzes. The class doesn't require as much time as he claims.
11288,129815,3.5,2.0,"I was not disappointed in my expectations of the course. Mikalson laid out the guidelines clearly, gives regular Tuesday/Thursday quizzes, and assigns material very appropriate to the instruction.  However, he tends to jump ahead in vocabulary.  Very approachable, somewhat enthused."
11289,129815,4.0,3.0,"Any intro level language class is going to be a lot of memorization, and Greek is even more so than most languages. Mikalson laid out the material in a very organized fashion and made you keep up. I loved his class!"
11290,129815,1.0,3.0,Horrible teacher...substitutes handouts for actual instruction...thinks his **** jokes are hilarious...definitely learned more from the TA than him...just needs to be fired!
11291,129815,5.0,2.0,Very good teacher!
11292,129815,5.0,3.0,I thoroughly enjoyed learning Greek from Prof. Mikalson!
11293,129815,3.0,5.0,"Mikalson gives a handout then he writes the contents of the handout on the board. There is so much memorization in this class and he is far from entertaining. He also is a hard grader, the cutoff for A's is a 92."

11295,129815,4.5,3.0,No Comments
11296,129815,5.0,2.0,"I love him, a great guy who puts on a great slide show"
11297,400157,4.0,4.0,Dr. Bociu although can be a bit intimidating at first is very nice and highly intelligent. I highly recommend attending her office hours as connecting with her will help you be successful in the course. We had at most one homework a week and a you can get by without reading any material which she doesnt enforce too much. Overall very great teacher
11298,400157,5.0,4.0,"In general Dr. Bociu is intelligent clear and interesting.  She upset me today, however, with a pop quiz. There is nothing about pop quizzes on the syllabus.   It felt more like punishment, an assertion of authority, rather than a constructive assessment.  She gave us little time and talked as we worked, as if to taunt us for not knowing it."
11299,400157,1.0,5.0,She can NOT teach! She only does general problems and hardly any examples. She assigns too many problems for homework and her grading guidelines were not explained well! DON'T TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!
11300,400157,4.5,4.0,"Very intimidating, but don't let that discourage you. VERY helpful in office hours and one-on-one settings. Rather funny sense of humor, makes class interesting. Overall, material is tough but if you show any understanding and eagerness to learn it, she'll definitely pull you through with a decent grade."
11301,400157,4.5,3.0,"She knows the subject. However, calc II is very hard so only take it if you need it. And when you do take it, do the homework! And the webwork! It really helps on tests, cause they are hard even when you've studied for them. Do your best. She'll help you if you ask, and don't be afraid to say you don't understand something, she'll explain it again!"
11302,400157,3.0,3.0,"She has a decent personality, but you really have to want to be in the class to do well. I was one of those who did not want to do the homework, mainly because it bored me to tears. It gets easier because you get used to it, but it doesn't get any more interesting."
11303,400157,3.5,4.0,"She can be intimidating and the class is not easy, but she prepares you well for the exam. If you survive the first couple of weeks, you'll be fine!"
11304,400157,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher!!!  She is really concerned about how well her students understand the material, and she schedules office hours according to the most convenient times for her students. She even gave the class candy on special occasions!"
11305,400157,4.5,4.0,"Like the guy before said, she is a really good teacher, but sometimes gets irritated with student questions.  However, that isn't too often, and I wouldnt take 132 with anyone else. Also, don't expect a good grade if you don't do the homework, our average on most of the tests was mid 70 but the people who did the HW always did much better than that"
11306,400157,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor - funny, witty, clear, knows her****, and knows how to get you to know it.  If you deserve an A in her class, she won't have a problem giving you an A, unlike some professors at the university.  I would also definitely hang out with her outside of class.  She rules."
11307,400157,4.5,3.0,"Lorena has a hot Romanian accent and a cute, witty style.  She's usually straight-forward and frank with her students which can turn into sassy, condescending remarks.  But laugh it off because it's worth listening to this bright foreigner differentiate the hyperbolic cosecant of x squared."
11308,400157,5.0,2.0,very nice and always willing to help; really cares if students understand the material; not a very hard grader; was always entertaining; students in her class seemed to do better on the exams than other classes
11309,400157,3.0,3.0,"its calculus so don't expect her to make class interesting, but she's available for help if you have trouble with the material. she's also pretty cute which made class more tolerable"
11310,400157,3.0,2.0,She's a great teacher until the point when she starts getting irritated with her students.  She always has some funny stories to tell..so you'll enjoy that.  She likes helping so go to her office hours and she's a lenient grader which is awesome.
11311,2054952,2.0,3.0,"I had Professor Cavens for his first semester of teaching ENWR &quot;Writing as Multilingual Writers&quot;. I felt as though his prompts and grading guidelines for papers were really unclear, as well as due dates. He also seemed to grade just based on what he wanted to read. Only good thing is that he allowed rewrites."
11312,2054952,3.0,5.0,"Derek Cavens is a great guy, and teaches very well. However, he teaches a 1510 class that he grades like a 4510 class. He is the hardest grader of all ENWR 1510 professors, and my GPA suffered because I didnt know any better. Everyone in our class complained about it. Do not take this class if you want a decent GPA."
11313,2054952,4.0,4.0,"The topic was writing about politics which I wasn't very interested in and the readings were a little dry but Professor Cavens is great about being flexible and he wants you to write about something you're passionate about. Even though the workload was more than other ENWR's, Professor Cavens really did help me improve my writing a lot!"
11314,2054952,4.5,1.0,"Professor Cavens is a wonderful teacher. Super interested in the subject (which was writing about film), and would take time to meet with you about a paper (he even FaceTimed me one day!). He taught me a lot about writing and actually made me enjoy it. Definitely an interesting ENWR and am so glad I took it."
11315,744243,5.0,3.0,"James was super helpful for me. Let's put it this way...I took AP Calc in high school and got a 1 on the test, I took regular calculus in the E school and dropped it because I had a D. James was able to make things clear for me and was always willing to go above and beyond when it came to students. Funny in a really awkward way, and super smart."
11316,744243,4.5,3.0,"Hughes is a good professor and the class is as enjoyable as Calculus can be. There are weekly quizzes, homework, and web work, which make it very time consuming, but I believe that works for our benefit in the exams. Also, he actually baked brownies and shared them with us during class! Highly recommended!"
11317,744243,4.0,3.0,"Calc 2. I enjoyed this class (as much as one can enjoy calc). Hughes is funny and shows lots of examples, plus is helpful at office hours. I have no complaints about this class."
11318,744243,1.5,3.0,His sense of humor stinks. He doesn't know how to teach. Become friends with the textbook
11319,744243,4.0,3.0,Good teacher. He doesn't write the tests-they are the same for all Calc 1 sections but he grades harder than the other teachers. Average on the first test was a 67 vs 80 for another section. He says he will scale the grades at the end of the year.
11320,744243,4.0,3.0,Hated Calculus (and still do) but class was bearable. Easy homework grader and fair on tests. Has extremely dry humor that you can't help but laugh at.
11321,744243,3.0,2.0,"pretty easy grader with tests, very easy grader with homework. he cracks a lot of jokes, most aren't funny but it's entertaining. overall not a bad class."
11322,744243,3.5,3.0,"He nice.  A little nervous, but overall a pretty good class.  Class can be boring, but it's calculus."
11323,744243,3.0,1.0,This guy knows his stuff but has a hard time teaching it.  Very easy class if you can learn from the book.  Does numerous examples in class that go completely wrong...Reminds me of Chris Farly by the way he acts... If you already have a good knowledge of Calculus take this class.
11324,1293108,2.0,5.0,This class is very useless in general but you gotta go to class to get the clicker questions. Try to take at community college/online if you can.
11325,1293108,5.0,1.0,"I usually feel drowsy in his class, partially because lights are dim and his voice is low. Either way, this class barely requires any studying, if you are proficient in math, have good focus while reading, and understand the concepts, you're guaranteed an A in the class. What bugs me is we had to buy clickers for class which we barely use..."
11326,1293108,4.5,2.0,Awesome old man! :) Knows his stuff and is always willing to help!
11327,1293108,4.5,2.0,This guy is one of the nicest you'll meet and really takes an interest in his students whether it be what they're majoring in or how they're progressing in his course. He's extremely helpful and very intelligent. I really enjoyed his class and would recommend him to anyone who can take him. Tests weren't too hard and I learned a lot.
11328,1293108,4.5,3.0,"He's a great professor to have. He's always willing to help. He's available right after class, office hours and even friday afternoons when most profs have gone home. He's very understanding and clear but talks very softly. Very helpful, and very interested in the subject. Not a hard grader, most &#63;s come from the book. HW isn't bad either."
11329,957246,4.0,4.0,Great professor
11330,957246,4.5,3.0,"very smart, knows what he is talking about, sometimes talks quickly, but his cute rear makes up for it."
11331,351042,3.5,2.0,great class
11332,351042,3.0,5.0,computer science is davidsons ****. he rules
11333,351042,5.0,1.0,"Awesome, friendly guy, gives really great prizes in class. Brings food for students during tests. Material isn't too challenging, but don't let your guard down. Always willing to help out, very clear teaching though the class is a bit slow-paced."
11334,351042,4.5,1.0,Davidson &gt; cohoon
11335,351042,5.0,1.0,"Class slow-paced, but somewhat interesting. Awesome, friendly guy who's willing to help. Understanding. Gives prizes away to students too."
11336,351042,4.5,1.0,"never bother to show up to his class, the material just is too easy. if you've never had experience with java i guess he's helpful though"
11337,351042,5.0,1.0,No Comments
11338,351042,4.0,1.0,"Nice guy, def. better than Cohoon... but the class is way too slow-paced."
11339,2153285,4.0,2.0,"Goes through lots of examples in class. Has an accent, but can generally be understood. Would highly recommend reading/taking notes from the textbook before lecture once the class picks up, or else you will be lost. Homework is challenging, but if you go to TA office hours for help, you'll be fine."
11340,187206,2.5,3.0,"I really enjoyed this class, he has the tendency to speak fast but he'll repeat the main ideas of the last lecture in the next lecture. I barely read the text book but the Discussion reading is important especially since the Discussion is 20% of you final grade and the readings show up  on the exam. I recommend this class!"
11341,187206,3.0,5.0,"the professor's harsh.  lecture's okay, he really knows too much about american history.  however, he's pretty strict."
11342,187206,3.5,2.0,"This class was so much fun!  He is a wonderful lecturer and is so passionate about the subject.  There is a lot of reading, but splitting it up over a week makes it manageable.  Skimming the textbook helps, but just paying attention in lecture is best."
11343,187206,3.5,3.0,Really interesting lectures. Great quotes and funny stories. Exams are hard and there's a ton of reading but they're both doable. He tends to switch topics withing the topic so notes can be a little confusing. Go to his office hours! He loves to talk to students.
11344,187206,4.0,4.0,Great professor but the class is frustrating because the tests are on material hardly covered in lecture.
11345,187206,3.0,3.0,Very funny and interesting prof! I learned a lot and actually am a lot more interested in history than before. Lectures get more boring and confusing as the semester goes on...but for the most part they are entertaining and helpful for tests.
11346,187206,4.5,5.0,Kett is a great professor who truly knows American history and gives interesting lectures.  I was surprised how much I learned about US history despite hearing the information so many times in high school. Really glad I took the class- be prepared for LOTS of reading (which you need to actually read) and written exams.
11347,187206,3.5,4.0,"hilarious and really knows his stuff, but I think he knows too much to teach it well. This is probably a great course for those who already have a VERY solid foundation in American history. Unfortunately, those of you who do not already know a lot may find yourselves constantly out of the loop and struggling to teach yourself most of the time."
11348,187206,5.0,3.0,"Great Class, Brilliant prof, and exicting and funny lecture."
11349,187206,3.0,2.0,"His lectures are easy to follow & you can pretty much go from there on the tests. He's pretty uninterested in you as a student, but its a worthwhile class--not tough."
11350,187206,4.5,4.0,"I had the pleasure of being in an 8 person seminar with Mr. Kett.  Not only is he hilarious, he's eager to chat with us all after class. He's fascinating and brilliant, yet laid-back.  I'd recommend him in a heartbeat.  TOUGH paper grader though: I quote, &quot;Good paper, but your prose needs a diet. C+&quot;"
11351,187206,4.5,4.0,Brilliant
11352,187206,3.5,3.0,"I think this is one of those classes that non-history majors, accustomed to the idea of history as boring, find exhilarating because he shouts every tenth word. I found it too scatterbrained and focused on the minutia. The tests represented less a comprehensive understanding than careful reading of certain events. No papers, for what it's worth."
11353,187206,5.0,3.0,He's amazing. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who's remotely interested in US history
11354,187206,4.5,2.0,"Kett is very passionate about history and you can sense it in his voice. He hardly ever looks at his notes, he knows the info and just says it. Every now and then he throws in a funny quip breaking up the monotony. Watch out though, his sudden outbursts take a while to get used to."
11355,187206,4.0,2.0,"The tests in his class are easy. The lectures are very informative, be prepared to take tons of notes. The discussion class is 20 % of the grade, which sucks, because there are always kids there who love the sound of their own voice."
11356,187206,5.0,3.0,UNBELIEVAAAAAAAAAABLE PROFESSOR!!! Kett is one of the most knowledgable professors I have ever met.  I am a Euro History major and so I tend to not like Amer. Hist. but this class was amazing!!! Plus he is absolutely hilarious!!
11357,187206,5.0,2.0,"Kett's class is very interesting. The lectures are purely him talking, so be ready to take tons of notes. But, his passion in the subject makes the course a hundred times better. Also, there aren't any assignments due so you only take midterms and finals."
11358,187206,4.0,2.0,"Kett's a great lecturer.  You won't be bored in class.  Come ready to take notes though, you end up with a good 8 pages every lecture.  Class is a ton of fun though, Kett gets really into it.  Lots of reading, but not really that bad for a history course.  Get a good TA because you won't talk to Kett necessarily.  I had Hatter and he was good."
11359,187206,5.0,3.0,"Kett is an excellent lecturer and treasure for the UVA history department.  He's passionate, knowledgeable, and captivating.  Reading is manageable and exams are easy for prepared students.  Highly recommend."
11360,187206,4.0,5.0,"Hard, but one of the greatest professors at this or any Southern institution.  He's a riot to have in class, and his stories about his life are extremely interesting.  Do not take if you just want an A."
11361,187206,2.5,5.0,No good class for international students...
11362,187206,4.0,3.0,"The class was interesting considering the vast amount of material to be covered.  The reading is not light and there is a LOT of it.  Keep away if you don't like politics.  Kett keeps you from falling asleep in the class with his occasional screaming and cursing.  All in all, I enjoyed it."
11363,187206,2.0,4.0,"I'm interested in history and found it difficult.  I also disagree with the reviews that Kett's a good lecturer.  He tends to ramble and his lectures aren't at all structured around the week's reading.  I eventually stopped going to save my sanity, read the book, and made a mediocre grade..."
11364,187206,2.5,4.0,Very hard class if you dont care about history. An insane amount of reading for the discussions. He is pretty animated in lecture tho. 1 midterm with that is all essays and another midterm that is 6-8 pages. Not recommened if you arent willing to put alot of effort and time into.
11365,187206,1.0,4.0,Complete ****.
11366,187206,4.5,3.0,One time he said &quot;When I was a boy in 1912...&quot; That pretty much sums it up.
11367,187206,4.0,3.0,"I hate history, but I loved his class! He yells and swears and gets into every lecture. A great professor, one I will remember for years to come. Even if you don't have an interest in history, take this course. The readings are great, and again, the lectures are worth going to, just to see him!!!"
11368,187206,3.5,3.0,"Hilarious. Swears frequently in class to get points across, screams and yells a lot. You can't help but laugh. Knows his stuff, but it's not easy. Get a good TA. I had Stephanie Hunter and she's awesome."
11369,187206,4.0,4.0,"Funny and interesting. Lots of reading, and i ended up taking at least 5 pages of notes per class. One of those history teachers that puts himself in the time and place and gets into his lectures."
11370,187206,4.0,3.0,This is my first introduction to a college class and it's turning out pretty well. The exams aren't horrible (but you need to be prepared to do work for the take-home midterm).
11371,187206,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Kett is a barrel of laughs. &quot;An angry old man&quot; fits perfectly, his lectures are energetic and his many digressions keep you interested. No quizes in discussion help and midterms (one being a take home essay) are fair to easy with adequate effort. Highly recommend."
11372,187206,4.5,4.0,"Great class - great lecturer - great outside material, to keep things from being to drab (I got to read P. T. Barnum's biography) - a must-take for every student"
11373,187206,5.0,4.0,"He's awesome.  He's hard, funny, an angry old man who doesn't like anybody but that doesn't matter.  Passionate, energetic!  Made me become a history major and dwell on William James, of all people!"
11374,187206,5.0,3.0,Crazy old guy! Very entertaining :)
11375,187206,5.0,4.0,"It has been years since I've had him, but he continues in my memory as one of the best history professors ever.  (said after two grad degrees)  Loved him in class."
11376,187206,4.0,4.0,"Very interesting introductory course, but don't expect it to be too easy."
11377,187206,5.0,4.0,"great professor and lecturer - very funny and knowledgeable.  tests are difficult, but always very fair.  highly recommend his class for first years - is a repeat of high school history but more indepth - course reader contains varied views on topics"
11378,908104,5.0,4.0,He's my favorite.
11379,908104,5.0,3.0,"Excellent-- You could not find a nicer Professor in any department. The material is thorough, but he makes you WANT to do well. Highly recommended."
11380,908104,5.0,2.0,An amazing and kind teacher. Always willing to help a student to clarify anything. The class also isn't as difficult as the syllabus makes it seem--there's a lot of readings but as long as you take good notes you should be fine. One of my favorite classes--highly recommended
11381,908104,5.0,3.0,"I am a fourth year non-history major. Professor Gilliam is the nicest professor i have had at UVA. He goes out of his way to encourage his students, is understanding and enthusiastic. Even if you hate history, take this class. He is a great teacher and really understands his students. He is the Best !"
11382,908104,5.0,1.0,"One of the best professors I have had.  Takes a true interest in his students, which is rare at a large university.  Great lecturer, and has personal experiences in VA politics that make his lectures even more interesting.  Fairly easy while at the same time highly educational and interesting course.  Definitely recommend this course and professor."
11383,908104,4.0,3.0,"Prof Gilliam is one of the best professors I have had at UVa. He is a wonderful history teacher who enjoys the subject. He is helpful, personable and always available to his students. His was the best class I took all semester."
11384,908104,4.0,3.0,Prof. Gilliam is a great professor who enjoys teaching a subject he is extremly knowledgeable about. While the syllabus is daunting at teh start of the semester it is a failry easy class. He is also one of the nicest professors I have had.
11385,908104,4.0,3.0,"Professor Gilliam is one of the kindest teachers I have ever met.  He takes a true interest in his students and really wants them to succeed. His lectures can be a bit confusing, but he makes up for it in style of tests and readings.  He taught this course as a replacement, but I really enjoyed having him.  He's great! Just work hard!"
11386,908104,1.5,4.0,A pompous ass who likes to hear himself talk. Ask him about how he presnted gifts and held events at his home to wiesel his way into a teaching job.
11387,908104,5.0,3.0,I took this course during the Spring '06 semester.  The professor is a very nice man and I really enjoyed his class.  I highly recommend Gilliam because he is a great lecturer and the workload isn't unbearable.
11388,908104,5.0,2.0,"Gilliam's awesome. He has first-hand experience as a former attorney, party chairman, gubernatorial appointee, and even as a Nascar driver. He knows so many people, and brought in guest speakers, like former Gov. Baliles. Great guy to learn from, and your gpa will approve as well."
11389,908104,5.0,3.0,"He's really nice, and he loves the subject. The only complaint I have is that he calls on individual students at random to give a mini lecture to the entire class. It's a lot to prepare for on short notice, and he could give a much better lecture on the subject. It's also harder to learn from other students than from him. But overall he's great."
11390,1489760,5.0,4.0,"Was very passionate and very helpful. Her criticisms on papers were insightful and class discussions were great. No pretense, no snobbery, just talking about the material. She facilitated class discussion very well and made you want to speak and contribute."
11391,88943,5.0,4.0,"Prof Langsam is a great professor. He does a really good job of explaining things and clearly knows what he's talking about. Your grade is based on four papers, as far as the readings go you only need to read what goes with the essays you want to write. Highly recommend going to him for office hours."
11392,88943,2.0,3.0,"I took PHIL 1710 in Fall 2020 and dropped it halfway through. The class was nothing like the description. Langsam is passionate but all of his lectures are very boring because they are just him talking with no visual aids ever. I would not recommend taking PHIL 1710. Maybe it would have been better if it were in person, but I highly doubt it."
11393,88943,3.0,3.0,"I took his class synchronously via Zoom so take that into consideration. Above I answered that I wouldn't take him again, however, he's not a bad teacher and is passionate about philosophy so I would take him again but ill have to know what I'm walking into. The only required work is two 7-9 page papers and two 3-5 page paper. No other assignments."
11394,88943,4.0,4.0,"This class gave me an understanding of Nietzsche I couldn't have achieved without Langsam's guidance. His understanding is thorough and sophisticated. Many less nuanced treatments of Nietzsche tend to portray his work a contradictory, but Langsam convinced me that he's largely consistent. I do think much is lost on many undergrads. Their fault."
11395,88943,2.0,3.0,"Did a lot of online shopping during lecture. Don't need to read until you write the paper, no tests which is nice but puts a lot of pressure on the papers. Lectures were generally boring and left be more confused. Readings are hard and not clear, too many different philosophers that I felt like I didn't know any of them well by the end."
11396,88943,4.0,1.0,"Your stereotypical Philosophy pHD. Lectures are very repetitive, you never have to read but it might help with papers. No tests, only papers. Not a bad class, if you can get over its ridiculous."
11397,88943,4.5,3.0,"I really liked ole Haid, but a few things bothered me about his course. I took Nietzsche, and he literally assigned every piece of work the man ever wrote- far too much reading. He also talked too loud sometimes. But, I liked that he explained the concepts quite clearly and with great depth. His understanding is superb, and he is supremely smart."
11398,88943,2.5,3.0,Interesting topic and nice professor but very difficult to pay attention in lecture and very easy to get behind on the readings and lost on the subject matter.
11399,88943,3.0,3.0,"Overall, the class is pretty good, but Langsam jumps into the lecture at a pretty fast pace, so keep up with the course packet readings because you'll need to sound competent once when you write the essay assignments. The TAs are pretty chill, they don't grade too hard. Attendance isn't mandatory, but go to class, lecture helps clarify the readings"
11400,88943,2.0,4.0,I was never interested in philosophy and that might explain why I hated the class. There are no exams only papers but your grade depends on how hard your TA grades them. For me it was a difficult subject plus you aren't encouraged to read any of the text since there are no tests and since attendance isn't mandatory and classes you easily stop going
11401,88943,4.0,3.0,I had a really great time in Human Nature. I took it to try out philosophy and ended up enjoying it. Professor Langsam is pretty entertaining and kept me coming back to the lectures. The TA sections helped clarify the sometimes dense readings.
11402,88943,3.5,3.0,"If you're interested in philosophy, you won't mind this class. Personally, I found it pointless to read historical points of view about what motivates humans. Langsam is nice enough, and there are no tests - only 4 essays."
11403,88943,2.0,4.0,"Didn't like the class at all, but then again I never really liked philosophy to begin with. He's enthusiastic but always seemed to talk a lot about nothing. I wouldn't recommend taking this class unless you have to. No tests, only 4 essays so that might be preferable for some."
11404,88943,2.5,2.0,"he's a very nice man, i just happened to hate the class because to me it was entirely useless. it was a lot of talking about nothing. lecture is totally not mandatory because there's no exam; just one big paper and two short ones. just get the notes on your topic and you're set."
11405,88943,4.0,2.0,"I loved this class!! He was so enthusiastic about the subject, and explained things very well. I don't think I missed a single class because he made it so interesting... However, watch for the TAs. I worked my butt off on each of those papers and never got anything better than a B. Stay friendly with them, because they determine your grade."
11406,88943,3.5,3.0,This class was simply ok. It could be interesting and its fairly easy to get a good grade. I didnt do too well on the papers but somehow managed to have a final grade of a B+. You do not have to do the reading because everything you need is covered in the lecture. Recommended if you like phil. and need to fulfill second writing req.
11407,88943,5.0,1.0,"I got an A-. I went to the first class and never went again, except to turn in the two papers, so 3 classes total. I missed discussion twice but went to the rest.I never did the readings except when I had to for the papers. Grading: 2 6-8 page papers for 60% and final assignment is 2 papers 3-5 pages worth 30%. The remaining 10% is from discussion."
11408,88943,3.0,3.0,"Repetitive, excitable, somewhat interesting, tough paper grader, interesting guy.  I'm still not sure if I actually enjoyed the class or not."
11409,88943,3.0,4.0,"He is a really smart and passionate philosopher but unfortunately so boring! Really redundant, which is helpful considering the subject matter but also painfully dull. You don't have to read if you go to lecture. Attendance is not mandatory and grades are mostly based on papers."
11410,88943,3.0,2.0,Good lecturer but does not seem personable... it did get real boring after a while. Not a great glass nor bad.
11411,88943,2.5,4.0,Professor Langsam is a really sweet guy with a lot of passion for the subject of philosophy.  But if you dont share the same passion I don't recommend taking the class.  It was painful to sit through some lectures and a lot of people didn't go. And I also had a bad TA experience which makes a huge difference.
11412,88943,2.5,3.0,"The class started out really interesting, but continued to get more boring as I tuned him out.  Very energetic and can be fun to listen to.  Knows what he is talking about.  Grade completely depends on wether you get a good TA.  I got a horrible one."
11413,88943,2.5,3.0,"don't take this class. it is a huge waste of time, boring, and repetative. i never go to class bc it frustrates me. take something more worth while"
11414,88943,1.5,4.0,No Comments
11415,88943,1.5,5.0,"Langsam is over-repetitive and loud enough to make my ears hurt after class. Do not take this class if you are a cog sci major. He missed a lot of great opportunities to relate the subject to cognitive psychology - what a shame. Class discussion was intimidating, rambling, and didn't clarify points of confusion. He shoots down everyone's opinions!"
11416,88943,3.0,3.0,He really likes that diet coke.
11417,88943,1.5,3.0,This class is definitely not as easy as described in the other ratings.  The teacher is good and it is an interesting class but he is not clear on many points.  It becomes difficult to decipher the differences between the philosopher's theories you study in the class.  An A is difficult to get.  A B is not hard.  Do not take as an Easy A class.
11418,88943,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher; learned a lot from lectures; papers weren't too bad, did have to think :) critically but it was FUN! T.A.s are awesome as well; overall just a sweet class to take--especially if you're scared of philosophy."
11419,88943,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, knows what he's talkin' about and conveys it really well. at times, I got a little lost, but that's why I'm not a phil-major. easy A if pay attention and do some readings for the papers that are your whole grade."
11420,88943,2.5,3.0,"Smart, but not able to clearly state things for students. Many unanswered questions after each lecture. Grade = 4 papers. However, I had no idea how they were graded.  I only got a number, and no comments, no suggestions, etc. If you really enjoy philosophy, take it.  Otherwise, think otherwise."
11421,88943,4.5,1.0,"An incredibly easy class. All paper-based, and the readings are unncessary; he points out the important stuff in lecture (which you only need to attend a few of and go to discussion regularly to still make an easy A or B)."
11422,88943,4.0,1.0,"passionate lectures that are interesting.. don't have to do the readings, he reads the important passages to use in your papers in class.. all papers, and the topics are straightforward, go to class and it's a no-brainer"
11423,88943,4.0,2.0,Really solid teacher; if you like philosophy you'll like him. pretty easy class; i never opened my textbook except to write essays and i did just fine; plus u can easily fulfill your writing requirement with this class
11424,88943,3.0,3.0,"He really knows his stuff, but I'm not entirely sure the students do after he's done talking.  A great philosopher, but a hard teacher to get as much out of as I would have liked."
11425,88943,1.5,4.0,"he seems like he'd be a nice helpful professor, but hes not at all. when you go to ask for help he tells you to look through his lecture notes. this class was awful and a huge waste of time. he's not helpful and neither are the TAs. He butchered a potentially great class."
11426,88943,5.0,1.0,Really engaging. If you go to class you only need to read for the papers. He does explain what evaluative facts are. Maybe the previous raters never went to class.
11427,88943,5.0,1.0,"The best class ever. Langsam is SO passionate.  Still don't know what evaluative facts are, but that's okay.  Very engrossing class, highly recommend it.  Discussions are okay, nothing outstanding.  But prof. is very clear, loud, funny."
11428,88943,5.0,2.0,"his lectures are interesting..you can tell he loves philosophy! people who say that he's hard to follow probably didn't do their reading. i didn't really read the stuff either, but i understood him! if you like philosophy, this is a good class.  no tests, just papers!"
11429,88943,4.0,2.0,"great class, a nice guy, if you go to his lectures and take good notes, the only readings from the course packet you have to read are the ones youre planning to use for your papers."
11430,88943,1.5,2.0,Lectures are a waste of time - he talks for the entire class without ever saying anything. Likes to use the words &quot;evaluative facts&quot; and no one seems to know what he means by it!
11431,88943,1.5,1.0,uses the word evaluative facts every day in class and not even the t.a.s know what he means by it
11432,88943,5.0,2.0,"A very engaging lecturer, well worth taking the class, material is very clear and interesting.  Grades based on essays, topics are very straightforward and help is always avaliable."

11434,39798,3.0,4.0,"Don't take this class. He's really boring and the tests require you to know which verse came out of which book in the Bible. If you absolutely have to take this class, don't pick Chris as your TA. He gives pop quizzes and isn't very approachable"
11435,39798,5.0,2.0,"Gamble is great!  Easy lecturer.  He might be a bit boring, but if you listen to what he says it's VERY interesting.  He reminds you of an old grandfather teaching his grandchildren about the bible. Pretty easy class too.  Reading isn't terrible.  Homework assignments vary based on the TA, but ours were very easy.  I recommend it - you learn a lot!"
11436,39798,4.5,4.0,"Interesting class. Not always exciting, but definitely worth while."
11437,39798,4.0,3.0,"He is the cutest prof I've ever had, in a bow-tie wearing, perfect grandpa kind of way. Class is hard if you don't go to lectures and it's hard not to since he's so knowledgeable and approachable."
11438,39798,3.0,4.0,Harry sounds like a preacher...it's pretty funny. I found the class pretty boring but studying for the final really brought all the material together. I suggest having study groups--very helpful.
11439,39798,5.0,3.0,HARRY GAMBLE!!!!  Nothing else to say.
11440,39798,2.0,4.0,"this class sucked. it's sad when he makes even my own religion hard to learn. unless you want to memorize the new testament, TAKE ANOTHER CLASS. Gamble isn't bad...pretty nice....but so BORING. plus, my TA was such a pompous JERK. his name was matt...don't get matt if he's still there."
11441,39798,3.5,4.0,"i think this used to be an &quot;easy course.&quot; No more. midterm was 50% quotes to label adn describe which can shoot you down. No chances to bring grade up. only midterm and final. attendance opt @ lecture but absolutely mandatory @ disc. lectures make me sleepy but u feel bad bc he is so genuince/nice. good subject, hard tests, sleepy teacher"
11442,39798,4.0,2.0,"definitely knowledgeable in the field.  in a nutshell, the class enables one to use profound evidence to rip the bible to shreds.  many people were offended by his methodology, but it's hard to overturn.  overall good guy."
11443,39798,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, don't be afriad to ask questions."
11444,39798,2.0,3.0,"I couldn't help myself falling asleep in class everyday.  However, i forced myself to learn -thats the only way i kept afloat in this class.  take at your own risk"

11448,39798,4.0,3.0,class can get boring but a nap in class won't wreck your grade
11449,2743160,1.0,3.0,"Professor White spent the entire semester bragging about his accomplishments instead of actually teaching us what was promised on the syllabus. While the class was titled &quot;Religion, Violence, and Warfare,&quot; we learned nothing about these topics as a group. Instead, we had to research on our own, learning only about White's philosophies in class."
11450,2743160,1.0,3.0,"When I saw Jerry White is a Nobel Prize winner I was extremely excited to take his class. Unfortunately, this course completely revolves around his connections to other guest speakers, and the actual teaching content is completely useless. This course taught me soft skills that are laughably unrealistic and was a constant annoyance in my schedule."
11451,752507,5.0,2.0,"I'm a 4th year and Megan is by far one of my FAVORITE professors. She's so kind. This class fulfilled the second writing requirement so of course there were books but they were all short and interesting. Classtime was devoted to discussing the book, usually with people around us. She's a kind grader and willing to help. 10/10 would recommend her."
11452,752507,5.0,3.0,"I've had Megan for an ENLT and as a TA for ENGL 383 and she was PHENOMENAL in both settings. She expects quality work and thought, but is totally fair in grading and bends over backwards to be helpful and accommodate your schedule. Any chance you get to learn with her should be taken!"
11453,752507,5.0,3.0,"She is not easy grader on paper, but her feedback is very helpful. I recommend to discuss with her before you start writing a paper. She is very approchable person, even bringing some goodies to class!"
11454,752507,4.5,4.0,"Megan as a teacher is very encouraged. Her office hour or any small question through email is always opened. Although she is not easy on grading papers, her feedback to revise is extremely helpful. I would recommend to discuss with her before you actually start writing paper. Megan is very approchable person, even brought some goodies to class."
11455,752507,5.0,3.0,Great teacher! She strikes the perfect balance between making you think really hard and not overwhelming you.  She spends so much time on the class/papers and really cares and wants to help.  The class is one big discussion and very informal but you definitely learn so much through her prompting and other people's opinions.
11456,752507,4.5,4.0,"I love Megan! She is so helpful and so WILLING to help you if you ask for it. SHe's great for leading discussions and will take what you said and expand on it and help you understand whatever you're talking about even better. She's very soft spoken, v. nice. You must do the readings to be prepared to discuss or else it's not lively. Megan's awesome"
11457,752507,5.0,2.0,"Megan is an awesome teacher and as long as you follow directions, you should be fine. She passes out quite a few readings and you probably don't need to read them. She might be a little tough on papers, but her feedback is real helpful (often a page long). She made American Through Film an awesome class for me. Sometimes brought in snacks too."
11458,752507,4.5,3.0,"megan is not an easy grader, but I wouldn't call her so tough. she's very willing to help you out with anything- very open to meeting with you, and doing whatever it takes to help you succeed. very non-judgmental in discussion- i loved how she let everyone have their own opinion with insisting upon a &quot;right&quot; interpretation of literature."

11460,752507,4.5,3.0,"Nice prof.  topic (Amer. ID) was very abstract at times (ex. express AmID in realtion to a space), but she was very helpful. tough grader, but u have 2 drafts so u can really perfect ur essays.  sometimes she has trouble generating class disc, but maybe that was just us being up at 8am. overall, she'll make enwr easy b/c she helps u."
11461,752507,4.5,4.0,"Most of the class is easy (reading, discussion, some worksheets) but she's a very tough grader with papers. She's soooo helpful though (always there to answer questions, meet with you if you're having problems) and VERY nice."
11462,998270,4.5,3.0,"Extremely clear in conveying class material. Not a lot of coursework, but always an interesting discussion during class periods."
11463,998270,2.0,4.0,"Boring class. He is obviously really bright, but didn't bring the material to life for me. I didn't like philosophy prior to this class, and still don't like it much after this class. He is kind of disorganized with the readings. Pretty tough for a 100 level class with a lot of readings. The classes were mostly lecture instead of discussion based"
11464,998270,3.0,4.0,No Comments
11465,998270,2.5,3.0,"i had him as a TA and he was not so helpful. said at the beginning of course that we could email questions instead of having to speak in class (my discussion was at 9am on friday) and he never emails back. also, he tended to drag on with a few people's questions and ignore others."
11466,998270,1.5,4.0,"Not terrible but is confusing at times. If you ask him to explain one thing, he'll explain everything else before daring to touch the topic you asked in the first place. Has a really nice side but rarely exposes it. Overall, intelligent but not attentive."
11467,2734981,3.0,2.0,"He is an okay professor, he is friendly and vibrant. His teaching is confusing and this class requires lots of background studying. He assigns a lot of things and you will never be reminded in class so check the syllabus often. He does not provide a lot of help and resources. Do not take this class if you are not already decent at Spanish."
11468,2259859,4.0,3.0,"Professor Ceraso was really understanding. She understands that for many people this class is their first English course. She is incredibly accessible, and I never felt any fear of judgement if I had questions about my writing.  I really learned how to write in this class instead of using a stringent structure like the one taught at my high school."
11469,48020,2.0,4.0,"He is interested in teaching his students but that does not mean he is good at it. I loved 1110 with Sherriff, but this course is very disorganized and not properly planned. Horton struggles to hold the attention of the class. He takes about 10-12 weeks to grade each homework assignment. If you have prior programming experience it will not help."
11470,48020,3.0,3.0,I love tom horton
11471,48020,3.0,1.0,"No point in going to class if you have a bit of prior programming experience. Homeworks take extremely long time, 2 tests and a final were decently hard. He's VERY disorganized and will likely not grade half your stuff as he won't have time"
11472,48020,2.5,1.0,"If you have prior programming experience you will breeze through this class. On the other hand, all my friends without experience really struggled. I would take the easier version (1112) if you have no experience. HW can take some time, but decent CS class"
11473,48020,2.5,5.0,"As a lecturer, Thomas Horton does not do a very good job. The TA's are either unapproachable or simply incompetent. This course cannot be taught in a 500 person lecture format. Horton is a nice guy though, but sadly, that doesn't matter. Overall, I regret taking the course."
11474,48020,3.0,3.0,"He tries really hard to make sure we understand, but CS 101 is a hard class! the homework assignments are HORRIBLE, you WILL have to go to office hours to complete them, or just spend an entire week trying to do it yourself."
11475,48020,3.0,3.0,"Tries hard, but CS is just an intrinsically tough class. Class should be more hands-on then lecture format. Explanations were often vague & confusing but he is an approachable guy. Tough assignments, manic office hours. You WILL have to go to office hours to complete the assignments. Better to take it in the fall than the spring."
11476,48020,4.5,4.0,"Could have been worse, he's genuinely interested in making sure you understand the subject. Lectures are boring and the class requires a lot of work; don't expect it to be easy."
11477,48020,2.5,3.0,"Annoying, boring, obnoxious grin.  Confused me on things I had a clear understanding of PRIOR to taking his course.  Nice guy, but he shouldn't be teaching this class OR he needs to revise his entire approach to teaching this class."
11478,48020,2.5,2.0,"Super disorganized, but you can use this to your advantage and get all sorts of exceptions. Silly and amusing, but will probably drive you nuts. Never used the textbook."
11479,48020,2.5,3.0,"Smiles at ALL times, talks thru his smile; accidentally funny.  Hws can be hard, tests are ok.  Class is BORING; bring laptop!  I went to know what topics we covered/participation credit but needed laptop to stay awake.  Learned nearly everything from the three exam review sessions in the sem.  Not a very substantive class, it's &quot;mushy&quot; you'll see."
11480,48020,5.0,3.0,Great professor.  Has a quirky sense of humor and really cares about his students.
11481,48020,3.5,4.0,"He is quite an easy going professor, while tests are not. Classes are somewhat disorganized, but he is always eager to help."
11482,48020,5.0,2.0,"He is a good lectureer.  But will get behind on returning stuff.  Perhaps a bit disorganized, but he always has a great slide set and exam review. Forgiving on grades."
11483,48020,5.0,1.0,You rock!
11484,48020,5.0,1.0,Helpful!
11485,48020,4.5,2.0,Class could have been a lot worse
11486,48020,4.5,1.0,Great class! Great guy! Take it!
11487,48020,4.0,3.0,"Not the best lecturer, but not the worst either. Very friendly, caring, and understanding of students."
11488,48020,3.5,4.0,Very organized with lectures. The lectures are very good but not exciting. He is a nice guy though and cares about his students.
11489,48020,3.0,2.0,"A nice guy but really disorganized, which can get frustrating. The class time that actually was spent on learning new material was well-used and he was very forgiving about grades. Go see him during office hours."
11490,48020,3.0,2.0,the class is impossible to teach in a large lecture style. plus the range of abilities of the students makes it even harder. he was entertaining but the class was horrible
11491,48020,3.0,2.0,disorganized but helpful
11492,48020,1.0,2.0,"Seriously the worst professor I have had at the University, and I've had some questionable ones.  Completely disorganized and didn't seem to care about the class - weird, since he is a teaching faculty member."
11493,48020,1.0,1.0,"Very useless class.  It is boring, and he is slow to grade/return assignments.  We got our first grade back 2 weeks before the final, and it had no comments."
11494,48020,1.0,1.0,"cs 305 was a terrible, useless class.  He doesn't make up real lectures and he's NOT funny, regardless of what people say!"
11495,48020,2.5,5.0,Please do not be like Prof. Sullivan
11496,48020,1.5,2.0,The computer science department is week to begin with.  You can't teach basic program in a lecture format.  The course itself should be more hands on.

11500,48020,2.5,4.0,"It's a 400+ person computer science course, enough said...i say lectures are optional though, since sleeping through them is almost unavoidable."
11501,48020,3.5,3.0,"Overall, good professor...subject matter is difficult to learn through lectures with 400+ people!  Will fall asleep in the class!!!"
11502,48020,3.5,5.0,"He's funny, and nice, always been willing to help me. I agree that it's a hard class, not his fault."

11507,48020,1.0,4.0,Very unclear lecturer.  Speaks a lot of jargon.  Nearly impossible to stay awake
11508,48022,5.0,4.0,Dr. Peter Norton is the greatest professor to have lived and taught at the University of Virginia. Taking one semester with him will change your life forever. He deserves full tenure!
11509,48022,2.0,2.0,He was extremely disrespectful of students and unprofessional in general. I would avoid taking any classes with him.
11510,48022,1.0,3.0,"The worst professor I had. He lowered my grade for &quot;Behavior&quot; when I brought up that this has never happened to me, he mocked me (I have the email) &quot;If neglect of class policies is fine, maybe I'll save myself some time and have no policies. Or grades, for that matterthey're a hassle. Oh yes, I'd get fired. Never mind.&quot;"
11511,48022,2.0,4.0,"Was extremely rude to me over an assignment and overall left a bad taste in my mouth.  There are lots of STS teachers, so should be easy to find a different one."
11512,48022,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've had during the Engineering program at UVA. Doesn't force you to think, but motivates you to do so."
11513,48022,5.0,4.0,One of the best engineering professors in the E-school. Definitely the best STS instructor.
11514,48022,5.0,3.0,Dr. Norton's class is thought-provoking and informative.
11515,48022,5.0,3.0,"Took him for STS 2500. Loved the class, so took him for STS 4500 (Thesis). He deserves to be teaching in front of a hundred people. His lectures are well prepared, he connects with almost all students, he encourages participation by asking questions that most people have experiences with, and almost no answer you give him can be wrong! Take him."

11520,48022,5.0,1.0,"The best prof in E-school, ofcourse.  If you want to do well in your thesis, he'd be the one u'd go for.  Many of his students won the best thesis prizes a lot.  This is the one class I never miss, the best discussions happen here."
11521,48022,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've ever had, and I'm a 4th year. Most professional, intelligent, and well spoken individual I have ever encountered."
11522,48022,5.0,3.0,Great professor.  Extremely interesting. You don't have to write long papers but the class still requires work.
11523,48022,5.0,2.0,"Arguably best professor in Engr. school (tied w/ David Evans). Very smart, interesting, but expects a LOT. Gives out only a few A's, but his lectures are so interesting and he really encourages asking questions and coming to talk to him outside of class."
11524,48022,4.5,4.0,Good teacher... knows his material but expectations are a little too high. I had a tough semester so I found it a little hard to cope with his class. But lectures are very interesting and very well put together.
11525,48022,5.0,2.0,"if youre taking tcc 101, take norton. will probably be your favorite class of the semester. he contacts class regularly by email, knows your name, and you will get the grade you earn"
11526,48022,5.0,4.0,"You'll love him and his class.  There are a lot to read and grading is tough (hard to get A or B+), but it is an enjoyable class."
11527,48022,5.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher - will make you love his class. Lots of reading though. Sometimes has sarcastic humor, kinda funny. Knows everyone in the class by name, and treats everyone like a professional. Very nice guy, very down to earth."

11539,48024,4.0,4.0,"Fair but hard. Disorganized and frequently missed class due to speaking engagements. His wife would substitute and as good as him. GA was a waste of time. Practice and follow his methods and the course will be easy. Try your own way, and you had better know what you are doing. Great prof, understands the decline of education in the USA."
11540,48024,1.0,5.0,"This guy is an elitist, thinks most people are below him. He knows his material but does not know how to teach it. One last thing, if you hate the U.S. so bad, why don't you just go back to Europe&#63;"
11541,48024,4.5,2.0,"By far the BEST math professor i've had. He does half of the HW, as examples in class. Makes sure that everyone understand the material. Tests are very fair, straight from the hw. Class is never boring, he is witty and great at teaching! I'd take any class that he tought"
11542,48024,1.0,5.0,strong accent. not helpful. mean. the average on our first test was about 40% and he said he doesn't mind failing everyone. also rude and impatient. do not take his class if you have a choice.
11543,48024,1.0,3.0,"He is the rudest teacher (or say person) I have ever seen!!! and right, he will insult you and make you cry!! He gave unfair grades, strong accent, don't care about his students at all. He is not reliable, not organized, bad temper. Never go to his office hours! I hate this man!!"
11544,48024,2.0,3.0,"strong accent,euro pride. hard and unreasonable tests,lots materials unseen from notes nor lectures. hard to study for the class. gives all these unknown symbols and variables, then never explains them. not very patient nor helpful in office hours"

11547,48024,1.5,3.0,"Very rude, thinks everything is elementary, and that u should have a PERFECT understanding of what he teaches.  beware"
11548,48024,1.5,4.0,"unflexible, will like u if u r perfect"
11549,48024,4.0,3.0,"he's a funny guy, diff eq is easy, and he does a pretty good job explaining it.  sorta quirky, but entertaining"
11550,48024,5.0,2.0,Possibly one of the kindest and THE most approachable professors I have had. If you understand the examples he does in class you will get a good grade
11551,48024,5.0,2.0,Great professor. Very clear explanations and really cares abot the students
11552,48024,1.5,4.0,"He's a mean man, will insult you and make you cry."
11553,48024,1.5,3.0,"strong accent, euro-pride, bad book"
11554,48024,4.0,3.0,Funny accent and once in a while he throws in a good Italian joke or two.
11555,48024,5.0,2.0,"Great explanations, funny italian anecdotes. Expects students to work tho."
11556,48024,4.5,3.0,he's great for diff eq; really really knows his stuff and cares that you do well
11557,48024,4.0,2.0,"nice person, really knows what he is talking about"
11558,48024,4.5,1.0,Very Good!  Presents things clearly and in good format.  Funny too.
11559,48024,1.5,5.0,No Comments
11560,48024,3.0,4.0,"not a ""people person"". despises students. decent lecturer. don't phone him!"
11561,1432486,4.0,3.0,"Had her for 303 and 404, she is the bomb. Only bright spot in the Planning dept unfortunately, but one you don't want to miss."
11562,1842092,1.0,4.0,"Have her for a TA and she is absolutely terrible. Nice lady, but should not be teaching. She has poor hearing, which may explain why her responses to students are confusing and completely off topic. I'm sure she is a very smart woman but she does not know how to facilitate discussion or create an environment conducive to learning. DO NOT TAKE."
11563,596909,5.0,4.0,"A great lecturer who made cell bio interesting. Lots of note-taking and reading, make sure you come to class prepared to type. Make sure to take the readings and hw assignments seriously. But he is a great professor and very interesting. He curved the grade brackets and gave bonus HW assignments for a grade boost."
11564,596909,4.0,5.0,"Wormington is a really approachable person and a good lecturer, but the exams are so hard. You actually have to memorize everything put on the slides and every word that comes out of his mouth. I would say put in about a week of studying in order to get a good grade on exams which I absolutely didn't do and should have done"
11565,596909,3.0,5.0,"Wormington is one of my favorite lecturers I have had here; I looked forward to going to his class despite it being at 9 AM. However, he gives &quot;homework quizzes&quot; that are 5 questions each that will take you a significant amount of time. His tests are also extremely difficult for a class that is already so hard to grasp. Do all the extra credit."
11566,596909,5.0,3.0,"Cell is the most informative and applicable class I've taken, and Wormington has it down. He is incredibly well spoken on highly complex topics (and sprinkles in a lot of hilarious dark humor), and is always accessible out of class. Exams are hard but very reasonable, which was what I expected. Study at least 3-4 days out, you'll be fine."
11567,596909,4.0,4.0,"This class is potentially the most informational class I took at UVA. Beyond the grade, it will serve your career well to learn everything he teaches, really. He is the face of tenure and will not budge on shoddy questions. Learn to play the game, especially if you are a pre-med. Cancer lecture was possibly my favorite lecture in all 4 years."
11568,596909,3.0,5.0,Lectures are difficult to follow. One &quot;homework quiz&quot; per lecture that are somewhat tedious. Exams are extremely difficult.
11569,596909,3.0,5.0,"Lectures are useful but he tends to test on details and his exams are difficult. Additionally, he seems to think certain default grade brackets are too forgiving and actually curves certain grade brackets down, which is odd behavior for such a difficult class. He's also been known to respond rudely to student emails."
11570,596909,1.0,5.0,he did very much bad and is not very good too!
11571,596909,4.0,5.0,"This is the most I've ever gotten out of class, really interesting and taught well BUT Wormington talks way too fast during lecture and they're very densely packed. Record every lecture, transcribe them, and don't buy the textbook. Also, he gives you 4 bonus homeworks throughout the semester so don't worry about getting bad homework grades."
11572,596909,5.0,5.0,"Dont buy the textbook. There are technically readings assigned, but you should not do them. Record every lecture. Memorize (almost) every word that comes out of this man's mouth. Mike is a legend. He's been teaching Cell since 1992, and he knows his freaking stuff. Very knowledgeable and very funny. His exams are hard; study a week in advance."
11573,596909,2.0,5.0,Cell bio is a hard concept; with that being said the professor should have done a better job with all of the ppt. They are practically useless and I ended up studying by reading the textbook for 20+ hours a week. For a 3000 class it is unnecessarily hard
11574,596909,3.0,4.0,"The class is very very hard and took a lot of my time outside of class. You'll need a week to study for the tests, because it's pure and straight up memorization. Wormington is not that approachable, but that being said, he's still a good lecturer. No curve but grade brackets can be adjusted in the end. Grade is exam-heavy so be prepared to study."
11575,596909,5.0,4.0,"Honestly, he's the best professor I have had at UVA and probably will have. The material he teaches is a hard concept, but he's very good at making it more understandable, especially if you go to him for extra help. He's also super funny, and really just loves biology and wants his students to as well. 10/10, great guy, even if the class is hard"
11576,596909,4.0,5.0,"Very difficult class, Wormington is helpful when you go to him and ask questions, but be sure to record the lectures and take notes and study well. The tests are mainly the whole grade and they are super tricky. Homework is graded, but you have open notes for homework. GO TO OFFICE HOURS AND STUDY LOTS."
11577,596909,4.0,5.0,"Wormington is a great person, his lectures are awesome, and very approachable in office hours. The TA is also pretty helpful. HOWEVER- DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS LIGHTLY. His tests are very tricky so make sure to listen in lecture, and study the homework questions. Also, if you understand everything in lecture, the textbook is not needed as much."
11578,596909,3.0,5.0,"This is a hard class. Go to every lecture, record and listen to them. Make sure you take a lot of notes and memorize them all.  Our TA was useless. The discussion usually lasted an hour or so, where she just went over the homework questions. The test are hard so study for it ahead of time."
11579,596909,5.0,3.0,"Go to office hours. Such a great guy. Very challenging course. Office hours is where I did all of my learning. Our TA sucked and the discussion section was just reading our completed hw questions, which you can do yourself, so I don't know why people are saying to go to that. Mike is the man. Easily the best in the bio dept."
11580,596909,4.5,4.0,"One of the best classes I've taken at UVA. Wormington is a very clear, thorough lecturer- if you go to class and listen to the lectures (and record & relisten to them of course) you won't need to bother with the textbook. You DO need to put in a lot of work to do well, but the tests are very fair & test only what he's covered in class."
11581,596909,3.0,5.0,Tests are extremely difficult--a lot of memorization. Questions are about applying multiple concepts at once to experiments. Going to lectures and the discussion section is a must.
11582,596909,4.0,3.0,"One of the best biology professors and the best core professor. The class is challenging, but fair. The lectures and weekly review sessions are more important and useful than the textbook. As long as you stay on top of the lectures and don't wait to study at the last minute, you should  be okay."
11583,596909,5.0,4.0,"Awesome class for bio majors! Wormington explains even the most complicated concepts brilliantly. 4 Tests total. Book helpful, but no homework or papers except to study. DO NOT wait till last minute to study for tests."
11584,596909,3.5,5.0,"He's a nice guy, but this is a really difficult course. I spent a lot of time studying for this class (you DO need the book), and only got a C overall. Once I started putting about 20-30 hours into each exam I got B's. Go to class and listen. Exams are hard! He adjusts the grading scale 1-2%, but it doesn't help if you have a solid 75%. Good Luck!"
11585,596909,4.0,4.0,This is a hard class be prepared to focus ALOT of time on it. Material can be interesting and wormington is a good lecturer. save urself the money and forget buying the textbook its useless.
11586,596909,3.5,5.0,go to discussion and take really good notes!!! he basically tells you what's on the test if you memorize what he says.
11587,596909,5.0,5.0,"Clear, enthusiastic & makes complicated topics interesting. Emphasizes the relevance to human disease. Best of the 3 cores."
11588,596909,5.0,3.0,"Probably one of the best professors in the Biology Department. Read the book once and only once; record his lectures and you will be fine. Crystal clear in office hours. GO TO THE DISCUSSION SECTION, IF YOU DO YOU WILL GET AN A IN THIS CLASS."
11589,596909,5.0,3.0,"This guy is the man. He flies planes for God's sake. I highly recommend office hours. He wants to get to know his students and genuinely cares about them,, but it's hard in a class of 300."
11590,596909,4.0,4.0,Go to discussion
11591,596909,4.0,4.0,nice
11592,596909,2.5,4.0,"For those of you interested in cell biology and biochemistry, the material is relatively interesting."
11593,596909,2.0,4.0,TYPICAL UVA BIOLOGY CORE
11594,596909,2.5,4.0,Run. Just because you post pictures on a slide doesn't mean that you are a great professor.
11595,596909,3.5,3.0,The material is extremely dense and complicated.  The class is uncurved and is the quintessential UVA biology core.  Good luck - study hard and be prepared to dedicate some serious time to this class.
11596,596909,3.0,3.0,Do yourself a favor and drop this class while you still can.
11597,596909,1.0,5.0,Be prepared to do a lot of reading - I am not sure why everyone says that this is an easy &quot;A.&quot;  Be prepared to work your butt off.
11598,596909,5.0,2.0,Great professor and class. 4 exams each worth 25%. No curves on the exams. Exams are pretty straightforward and you don't really need the textbook.
11599,596909,4.0,3.0,"Best bio class out of all the cores. Awesome prof! Good, clear lecturer and his tests don't pull any punches. Provides old exam questions for practice too. I hope to take another class with him."
11600,596909,4.5,2.0,"Very good class. Use the study questions to study for the exams. textbook is not needed. The lectures are easy to follow, he makes the topic interesting. =)"
11601,596909,4.5,1.0,"Easy class, straight foreward and predictable test, good teacher"
11602,596909,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Wormington is eloquence personified, he teaches a complicated material so clearly there is no use for the book (save urself 130 bucks)...i.e. coming to class is kinda important!! Tests are multiple choice, hard but fair concidering that many questions are very similar to the practice questions from discussion....All in all super dooper prof!!"
11603,596909,5.0,3.0,Wormington was a great professor! He taught complicated material in a clear manner and seemed to really care about his students doing well. Study the problem sets because a lot of the same questions appear on exams.
11604,596909,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors I have ever had!
11605,596909,4.0,4.0,Not an easy class but he is a very good lecturer. He does his best to make some very confusing topics clear and to work in interesting new developments in the field. The tests are hard but fair. Be sure to study the practice questions!
11606,596909,5.0,3.0,"One of my fav professors at UVA - he's an enthusiastic, clear, and interesting lecturer.  You can tell he cares about his students truly understanding the material.  Go to his office hours because he is extremely nice and helpful. Tests require dedicated preparation but as long as you put in the time, it's not hard to get a good grade."
11607,596909,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wormington is one of my favorite teacher's in the bio department...nice guy, extremely helpful and his tests are reasonable if you put the time in."
11608,596909,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, engaging lecturer, very well clear in explanation of ideas. True, the tests are difficult, but Professor Wormington compensates for that in the grading system. Enjoyable and very interesting teacher."
11609,596909,5.0,1.0,"Awesome teacher, really interesting in class and almost always relaxed and laid back (except for one really really random day when he freaked out)"
11610,596909,5.0,2.0,"Very nice guy, very interesting class"
11611,596909,1.5,5.0,"Mike Wormington sucks! Anyone can paste pics from a book onto a powerpoint,a cocky teacher who loves you to kiss his ***. His tests are ridiculously hard, long, specific, Beware! Do yourself a favor & wait for another teacher to take this class if possible."
11612,596909,4.5,5.0,"He's a nice guy and his lectures are easy to follow, but his tests are crazy!"
11613,506802,5.0,3.0,"I was a grad student of Ms. McKinley's & must respond. While her pronunciation is imperfect, her command of French is excellent. Her scholarly work written in French is well respected. She is a generous, caring professor who makes her subject more interesting than I had ever imagined it could be. Ignore these superficial comments. She is stellar."
11614,506802,4.5,1.0,"Prof. McKinley is just about the kindest, most helpful people in the French department. She works very hard to help the DMP students do their best. I have emailed her so many times with questions and she is always responds quickly with a thoughtful reply. Never makes me feel stupid for asking. Her French isnt as bad as these people say."
11615,506802,1.0,3.0,"Take heed: the previous angry post is not a personal grudge. Her pronunciation of anything that rhymes with &quot;lire&quot; or &quot;dire&quot; is nothing less than grating. Half the class dropped after the first day, and I wish I had too."
11616,506802,5.0,3.0,This was one of the best teachers I ever had.
11617,506802,2.0,4.0,"BEWARE of this class! Totally hypocritical- can barely speak french herself, but will rip you a new one for not having &quot;le langage elegant&quot;. Grade not based on merit, but on her caprice. My biggest headache this semester."
11618,605107,3.0,4.0,"Definitely a boring professor. The exams are pretty tough, and the homework assignments are tedious. You'll have to do a lot of self-teaching outside of class."
11619,605107,3.0,4.0,"Really easy to get a B, not reasonable to get an A. Great guy, loves to teach and help, but lecture is often super boring. He puts all the lecture notes online, so if you really have to mis class all you have to do is talk to him. Otherwise, though, you should go to class since he often counts attendance as participation."
11620,605107,4.0,4.0,"Not the easiest class, but certainly a very interesting one. Two midterms and a final, along with weekly online homework. You can find answers to similar problems on Google, which helps a ton with homework. The tests are pretty tough (half concept understanding and half calculating stuff) but definitely doable with a lot of studying."
11621,605107,2.0,3.0,"I found his teaching method frustrating. He spends most of his time directing  reading assignments instead of actually teaching. Maybe it's just me, but I can't just sit at home and learn from textbooks without any instruction."
11622,605107,2.0,4.0,ENGR 1520 is a dual enrollment class designed mostly for high schoolers. It's probably not what you expect it to be. Expect a lot of busy work with confusing instructions.
11623,605107,5.0,2.0,MSE is an interesting class and Professor Groves teaches it very well. Homework is by far the worst part but tests are open note and open internet and open book etc. Definitely recommend.
11624,605107,5.0,3.0,Great professor that will go out of his way to help students.
11625,605107,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Groves is professional, knowledgeble, and respectable. He expects high-quality work but is a fair grader and easy to talk to.  One of my favorite professors; recommended."
11626,605107,5.0,2.0,Thought this class was gonna be horrible but it really wasn't that bad. Very helpful. Kept trying to get his point across even though his lectures were on the boring side. Fairest grader on campus.
11627,605107,4.5,2.0,Very helpful and extremely fair when it comes to grading.  He tried to make a boring subject more bearable.
11628,2669510,5.0,1.0,"Really nice guy and has a passion for engineering. Understanding of students' individual situations and gives many opportunities for student choice. It would've been helpful if he provided more guidance throughout the semester-long project, but other than that, great teacher. Also great as a first-year advisor."
11629,1752012,1.0,5.0,"Avoid this class at all costs. This will be the hardest and most stressful 1 credit course that you will take. In the lab, you may see Maksim one or two times with the TAs being the ones to ""lead"" the lab. The graders take off points for everything possible even if you do have the correct information in your reports. I agree with the other reviews."
11630,1752012,1.0,5.0,"This was one of the worst lab professors I have ever had, he is so demanding and assigns so much work for a 1 credit class. I had more work in this class than my actual lecture class. If you can avoid him please save yourself. "
11631,1752012,1.0,5.0,"Maksim Bychkov has been the worst Professor I have had so far. TA's who grade your reports are not the one's in class helping you out. I've been through several weeks of illnesses, anxiety, depression, ocd attacks, insomnia, hospital visits, and a medical leave. Maksim was not forgiving at all. He ignored my SDAC accommodations on several accounts."
11632,1752012,1.0,5.0,"Maksim Bychkov was the worst professor I ever had. Not only did I received a bad score due to an error on his end, but he was also not willing to correct it for me or 40 other students in his class. the TA graders were also harsh. I received assignments back and when I attended office hours, I was never given a clear answer. No one likes Maksim"
11633,1752012,1.0,5.0,"Maksim Bychkov has been the worst professor I have EVER had. Not only is he not willing to accept errors HE made that affected my grade, but he also bullied me into accepting my fate. Not only this, but all of his TAs are harsh graders. I went to office hours to understand why I had so many points taken off for my labs and I never got a good answer"
11634,1752012,1.0,4.0,An alarming lack of compassion and sympathy from this guy. Tried to guilt trip me when I was sick and couldn't make a lab. Unbelievably miserable person.
11635,1752012,1.0,5.0,This is the worst class at UVA. Easily 8 Hours of Homework a week for a 1 Credit Class.
11636,1752012,1.0,4.0,He has specific &quot;graders&quot; that grade all the lab reports and they grade harshly and refuse the correct their grading even after they admit that they were wrong.
11637,1752012,1.0,5.0,Harsh grader. Responds to essay length emails with just a few words. Ignorant and oblivious to the fact that students take classes other than a 1 credit physics lab. worst professor I have ever had at uva.
11638,1752012,2.0,4.0,"Good grades are attainable in this class but it often felt needlessly hard, especially for a 1-credit class. I put more time into this lab than I did the lecture. The postlab questions were harder than anything else in the class which was very frustrating. You won't fail if you work hard, but I don't plan on revisiting physics after this."
11639,1752012,1.0,5.0,"this physics lab is so hard for no reason, like dude, this is only a one credit class, why would you make us doing so much work, like what. And also we are doing this online, which makes it even worse."
11640,1752012,2.0,5.0,"The lab class was very tough online, and Professor Bychkov seems to really enjoy giving students way, way too much work for a 1 credit class and really seems to like making us suffer. Go to your TA office hours, it will probably raise your grade in the class by at least a couple of percentage points."
11641,1752012,1.0,4.0,"Awful professor. Shocked that other people say he's helpful, he literally refuses to teach. If you ask a question he asks you to answer it. I wouldn't be asking if I knew. When I got it wrong, he randomly called on someone else in the office hours, who also didn't know. This continued for 30 minutes until someone looked it up online."
11642,1752012,1.0,5.0,"This guy is absolutely horrific. He doesn't explain anything, his workload is insane for a lab, and all of the work is extremely difficult. Do not take him under any circumstance."
11643,1752012,1.0,2.0,This is coming from a student with an A in this class. This professor is terrible. He is blatantly disrespectful in any and every circumstance. His automatic answer is &quot;that is not my job&quot; and does not try to help in any way. What is he payed for? Terrible professor.
11644,1752012,5.0,3.0,"Professor Bychkov is brilliant, he puts a lot of effort into the labs so that students can learn the physics concepts step by step. People who hate this class are usually the people who haven't done any reading or ever tried to understand the material. These labs are set up for people to explore the concept and learn, not just be told the answers."
11645,1752012,5.0,5.0,"Get ready to WORK! Maksim is by far one of the most engaging professors that I have ever had. His labs are tough and he will specifically call on random people to answer questions. Most students get A-s or an A in the end, if they put the work in. Despite his bluntness, he truly cares about your learning so stop complaining and get back to work!"
11646,1752012,1.0,4.0,"Literally the worst class I've taken at UVA to date. The labs are vague and uninteresting, the post-labs are barely related to what was done in the lab, Maxim isn't very helpful, and can randomly just decide that he thinks too many people are getting A's and change the grading criteria. Overall unenjoyable, avoid if at all possible."
11647,1752012,2.0,4.0,"The class isn't tough at all, but the TAs are there to unnecessarily tank your grade. Maksim isn't helpful at all, and he does absolutely nothing to help your grade, even if you work very hard to get it. Get 100s on quizzes and homework, don't worry, because the TAs will reduce your grade in the lab reports. Definitely a case of grade deflation."
11648,1752012,5.0,3.0,"This class was tough, but very rewarding. Professor Bychkov takes the time to teach you things as long as you ask. Dont be intimidated! He is actually a really interesting person and very smart."
11649,1752012,1.0,3.0,"Feels very poorly planned. One lab will be straightforward and short, another you'll be trying to decipher the problem for an hour and a half before they just say what they actually wanted isn't indicated. One lab report could be half a page, another could be 3+. One prelab will be a video and 6 questions, another will be 50+ questions."
11650,1752012,5.0,4.0,He's great. You have to put in the time and effort. He's great at explaining concepts when you ask him in person- take the time to do that.
11651,1752012,1.0,5.0,Very disrespectful to students. Try to ask any questions about make up labs or the lab itself and he brushes off your question and gives a very sarcastic and snide response
11652,1752012,3.5,4.0,"He's really hot. Makes you buy the text (because he has written it). Comes around during lab to help you out if you're having trouble with the equipment. Can be funny. Nice guy, also really hot."
11653,1752012,1.0,5.0,"He is useless. He only make sup rules for the course, the TAs do all the work. As well, they like to hurt your grade."
11654,1752012,1.5,3.0,"russian body builder.  Knows physics. Doesn't really run the class, but he will answer questions during lab if you ask him."
11655,1752012,1.0,5.0,"All he does it think we have too high of an average in lab, so he makes the TAs give us lower grades for no reason."
11656,1063889,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Erickson was a great professor. She explains things extremely well and if you read the textbook it also helps. I would definitely recommend this class, just the tests are extremely difficult due to the difficult nature of the material. Be prepared to study. "
11657,1063889,5.0,4.0,"It was one of my favorite classes for the first semester - definitely a nice way to start off commerce. The tests are doable, even easy enough to get an A if you work hard for it. Careless mistakes are costly, and aim to do well for every exam. I flunked my first one by a large margin, and had no way to make up for it."
11658,1063889,4.5,3.0,"She is a very helpful professor.  The content can be tough, but she is great at explaining things.  Attendance is not mandatory, but if you want to do well, you should at least skim through the chapters and pay attention in class."
11659,1063889,5.0,3.0,"AWESOME TEACHER, super clear. Homeworks can be pretty challenging but overall you learn a lot from them"
11660,1063889,5.0,3.0,"3 exams, assignment. Erickson's explanation is very clear, and exams are fair because they cover core material that she teachers, so note down every word she says in class. She is a great resource for out-of-class questions about accounting in the real world. Accounting is not a breeze, but practice helps! I will get A/A- for this class."
11661,1063889,4.5,4.0,Accounting isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. You must take the time to study the concepts and actually understand them because the tests will require you to compute numbers in a different way than the examples she gives but if you can do that then you're fine
11662,1063889,2.5,5.0,Professor Erickson is very approachable and helpful. Her lectures are very concentrated so you have to remain focus throughout the entire class. The class average can be higher because international students in the class who have taken acct are scoring higher on tests. Overall a very challenging course. Don't take it unless precomm/interested
11663,1063889,2.0,5.0,This was one of the hardest classes that I've taken at UVA comparable with STAT 2120. Erickson is a good teacher but her lectures can be very boring. You have to go to class or you will really feel like you're lost. Each exam increases in difficulty with the final being almost impossible. I ended up with a B- but that took a lot of work.
11664,1063889,3.5,5.0,"She is a great teacher. She is very knowledgeable about accounting.  She will help with any questions you may have. SHe even prints out notes for you so when you go to class you don't have to write as much.  As for the class, its tough, but make sure you stay on top of your reading and you should be okay."
11665,1063889,4.5,4.0,"Great professor, somehow able to make a dry subject moderately entertaining.  Pretty funny, cares how her students are doing.  Lectures are very well done.  Class is not easy, second half is harder than first half."
11666,1063889,4.5,5.0,Erickson was a great teacher. Tests were really hard but they were fair. Tests seemed easy once she went over them. Go to lectures because she gives you examples from past exams that are more helpful. The book is horrible and very hard to understand. Overall great teacher and hard exams but she curves your overall grade a step up.
11667,1063889,5.0,4.0,"Yes it is a rather hard class. She is the only teacher teaching COMM 201 right now. Great teacher very clear and knows her stuff. I would say that lectures are more important than the book, so definitely go to every class. Otherwise study hard and you will do fine."
11668,1063889,4.5,2.0,shes a cougar for sure. tests arent bad and shes easy(ya dig)
11669,1063889,4.5,3.0,"She was a great professor, her class and Wilkie's took the same exam and we consistently scored higher. If you do the WebAssign yourself and try to understand it it'll prepare you well for the exams."
11670,1063889,3.5,3.0,"Lecture is boring/unnecessary.  Just read the book, do the homework with friends, and go over the clicker questions (she posts them on toolkit) before tests.  The one good part about going to class:  Erickson is a cougar."
11671,1063889,5.0,1.0,"Although this class isn't easy, Erickson is great at explaining the concepts during lecture. Attendance at lectures is a good idea, since this isn't the easiest class. However, her tests are fair and she spends a fair amount of time discussing exam topics."
11672,1063889,5.0,4.0,"Go to class, read the book, do the WebAssign, and you'll do fine. As long as you don't fall behind, it's a tolerable class. The lectures are boring, but that's to be expected in Accounting. Erickson does her best to make the class interesting, and she's overall a great teacher."

11675,1063893,5.0,1.0,"Took ""Great Historical Speeches"" with Prof Patterson. The course was very interesting and Patterson was a great professor. He's very straightforward and relaxed, which made class enjoyable and spontaneous. Take a course with him if you can!"
11676,1063893,5.0,1.0,He is practically a stand-up comedian. Extremely helpful for ICE projects and assignments. Very nice guy. Try to get into his block if you can.

11678,343008,5.0,1.0,Literally the easiest class I've taken at UVA. Scored an A+ on the first exam by cramming the night before. I went to 75% of the lectures and got notes from my friends and was fine. Two exams and a paper. Regurgitate word for word what he says in class and you'll be fine. You'll use the textbook.
11679,343008,1.0,5.0,"Enjoyed Professor Bateman's class until I received my exam grade.  I memorized every single note top to bottom, attended every single lecture and paid attention.  However, after walking out the exam confident that I got a 95 or above, I was smacked down with a 78.  Incredibly discouraging experience simply because his grading is so laughable.  "
11680,343008,2.0,5.0,"Avoid this class like the plague, worst class I've taken at UVA. The textbook is a incomprehensible nightmare and Bateman spends the lectures talking about himself rather than narrowing down the 700 pages of nonsensical babble."
11681,343008,3.5,4.0,"Bateman is a great lecturer and really funny. The exams are on things that are the tiniest details from lecture (going to lecture is a must) or outside reading that is assigned. Half of the lecture is talking to your neighbor which is nice to meet new people, but also a huge waste of time because nothing that is said is going to be on the exam."
11682,343008,4.5,3.0,This class is so great! Bateman is a really cool prof and the guest speakers really are interesting. I look forward to this clas. The tests are hard but not too bad if you study hard you will get a good grade
11683,343008,3.0,4.0,He's a great teacher and he's funny. But i agree that there's a lot memorization in his tests. Papers are easy tho. but I just don't know how his grade is gonna like. we ll see
11684,343008,5.0,2.0,"Greatest professor ever! He's funny, engaging, and the class is really interesting. Some people just don't get the topic of leadership- it requires you to be open minded. Class teaches you a lot about people and yourself. Bateman is a great person to get to know too! Take this class!"
11685,343008,4.0,2.0,"Cool guy, funny, nice person.  Information in class is random and often bizarre.  Then the tests are short answer and specific.  Papers = easy.  Tests = hard!"
11686,343008,1.5,4.0,"His class is worthless... content is light and interesting for about one week. Tests are impossible, be prepared to memorize lists upon lists of useless information made up by the professor to regurgitate it on the test. YUCK!"
11687,343008,2.5,3.0,He's nice and funny but what do you actually do in his classes other than read cute case stories&#63;  His tests are also annoying because they only test on memorization of specific nonsense.
11688,343008,3.0,2.0,"good personality and interesting teacher, material is completely unfounded and has no substance, I learned nothing except that people matter"
11689,343008,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bateman is great.  He's knowledgable about management, he loves teaching, and he's fun."
11690,343008,5.0,3.0,Bateman's really smart and a great guy.
11691,900087,1.0,5.0,"Horrible. Zirkle is extremely unclear and terrible at teaching basic concepts. Although the exams are just harder versions of the questions from the textbook, Zirkle almost never explains how to solve even the easiest problems. Would not recommend."
11692,900087,2.5,3.0,"The course is not terribly difficult, but Zirkle's inability to lecture cohesively leaves you feeling lost. The tests are relatively easy and more or less come straight from the book's problem sets. Overall, Zirkle is a nice guy, but he lacks the communication skills to make lecture attendance worth-while."
11693,900087,3.0,1.0,"His class is EXTREMELY EASY. There is no point in going to class. He just goes over the same info as the book. The tests just has basic problems. He is a nice guy, but he isn't the greatest at explaining concepts."
11694,900087,1.0,4.0,"Zirkle is terrible at explaining concepts. He starts off with an equation without telling you what he's doing, so its easy to get lost. Uses unnecessarily complex equations to explain simple concepts. Skips steps in explanations and makes calculation errors in class. Exams test on obscure material rather than what we covered in class."
11695,900087,4.0,2.0,Zirkle was actually a really great prof.  One problem set everybody messed up on and he listened to the class and changed everyone's grades accordingly.  Makes lectures interesting.  Would take any class that he took.
11696,900087,1.0,2.0,He is an awful teacher. He is unable to communicate or relate with his students. He tries to teach everything by deriving his functions and then he will mess them up. He never tells you where you are headed. He never explains anything with number or problems. He doesnt post the answers to the homework. Do yourself a favor. Dont go to class.
11697,900087,1.5,5.0,"Could possibly the worst teacher I have ever met.  I can tell that he know a lot about Economics, but I know for sure that he does not know how to teach it.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
11698,900087,1.0,5.0,"He's a nice guy. Very friendly. BUT DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. He is a miserable lecturer and the tests are tricky, harshly graded, and no one finishes in time.  Never take this class."
11699,900087,1.0,5.0,"AVOID AT ALL COST. Worst teacher I have had at UVA. Very unorganized, lectures are useless because he makes material more confusing than it should be, the book was possibly even worse, not clear about his expectations, tries to trick you on tests, cocky attitude."
11700,900087,3.0,4.0,"He is funny and very willing to help if you ask. His 301 class, however, was difficult and heavily math based. If you like math and econ, he is fantastic."
11701,900087,1.0,3.0,He is very smart. BUT cannot explain clearly at all. Reading your text book will be more helpful than asking him questions because he cannot convince you. He likes to complicate basic math in econ and turn an econ class into a 300 level math class. He is not made to be a teacher.
11702,900087,1.0,5.0,"WORST TEACHER I HAD IN MY LIFE. HE'S A WASTE OF UVA'S MONEY. I WANT MY TUITION BACK, HE DESIRES TO WORK AT MCDONALDS."
11703,900087,5.0,3.0,"Very good grad student teacher. Macro is the fundamentals of anything related to business, and now that I learned solid macro I'm well prepared for all my econ classes later on. Tests are all based on lectures and book, no tricky questions, great class great teacher, take econ with him and you won't regret it."
11704,900087,4.5,1.0,"As long as you are real clear with your graphs and explanations, the class is easy.  Zirkle goes real slow and explains the material in great detail.  Originally, I regretted signing up for this since I hated macro, but Zirkle's micro class was great. (unlike the acct I took at the same time which was impossible to understand)"
11705,900087,1.0,5.0,He has turned me off to taking any more Econ classes. He's a very smart man but he just cannot teach. I feel like I haven't learned much and I dreaded MWFs because I had to go to Econ.
11706,900087,1.0,5.0,I highly discourage you from taking this class. He is an extremely intelligent teacher but seems to have difficulty in accepting the fact that we are JUST learning about the subject of economics. He incorporates a lot of advanced material that  my friends in the 300 level econ courses are learning. He doesn't help you and teaches poorly.
11707,900087,1.5,4.0,I strongly dislike this class. Pop quizzes given (multiple choice). Tests are free response only. Grading is capricious and test material is often on lecture material not found in the book. Be very precise in graphing.
11708,1530873,4.0,1.0,"I had her for an ENWR class on The Oscars. I'm a terrible writer, but it was really easy to get an A in the class. She breaks it down and takes it step by step. I think she's one of the better ENWR teachers."
11709,2587644,5.0,3.0,"Amazing prof. Looks out for students and minimizes overburdening. It is hw heavy. Believes that if students perform poorly, it's his fault. Takes, and reflects on, feedback. He makes the class and subject enjoyable, and moves at a good pace. Too many good things to say. His class is possible to do very well in."
11710,900093,2.0,2.0,Hated his boring lectures.
11711,900093,5.0,4.0,"Fun class. The grading is a lot harder than I expected, but the TAs grade the exams. Schaeffer is a great professor, so I definitely recommend his class to anyone interested in Buddhism or Tibet."
11712,900093,5.0,3.0,"Professor Schaeffer is passionate, helpful and always engaged. His class was fascinating, he is funny, loves to get to know students and is very encouraging to all those to talk to him. Highly recommend."
11713,900093,4.0,2.0,"His class seemed fairly laid-back. Basically he'd tell people to come in with questions about the reading, and then he'd spend the period answering the questions. It made it REALLY obvious if you didn't do the reading, though, and there was a lot of it for every week (200pg).  50% participation, 50% final paper (12 page summary of the book we read)"
11714,900093,2.5,3.0,"Class is kind of boring. The reading/film schedule was very disorganized and unclear. Tons of reading. My advice is to always finish the book a week before the film is shown, so that you don't get stuck doing too much at once. A single-spaced response paper for every work and a 12 page final is required. However, he is pretty lenient about grades and as long as you participate and turn in your work you will get a high grade."
11715,916486,4.5,3.0,"Professor Johnson was hands down one of the nicest and caring professors I have ever had.  Her class is very unique, she wrote the textbook, and she tries her best to make sure everyone is engaged and is learning.  "
11716,916486,4.0,1.0,"Professor Johnson wasn't bad, but the class itself was really boring and pointless.  That's STS though . . ."
11717,916486,2.0,1.0,"Ethics for Engineers.  Easy class, but useless and boring. Prof should have stopped try to lead discussions in a 300 person lecture."
11718,916486,3.0,1.0,"This is one of the most useless classes ever. It's required for engineering, and isn't difficult, but it was the biggest waste of time. Avoid if possible, but if you have to take sts 1500, pick Johnson"
11719,916486,3.5,4.0,"Our topic was &quot;Computers, Ethics, and Policy&quot;. Very interesting topic, and she actively engaged our class. A little inconsistent in her grading in my opinion, but fair overall. I would seek her as my STS401 teacher if I could."
11720,916486,3.5,3.0,"Class discussion, papers, oral presentation. Professor was helpful. The class was good."
11721,916486,3.0,3.0,"The tuesday lectures are insane i dont know what the heck the professors are talking about, although some of the material makes sense and is relevant.  I wouldn't take the course again because I find myself BSing everything I write; there is a lot of writing!  Johnson is nice, cool and helpful, although she is often scatterbrained. She grades easier as the semester gos on."
11722,760841,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic professor. Skilled at teaching. Extremely down-to-Earth, helpful, friendly. Taught one of my favorite E-school courses."

11725,547860,5.0,4.0,"Marshall sensei is an incredible professor. If there is any way for her to help you understand the material more easily, she will do it. Tests are hard, but there are opportunities to improve your grade. She goes above and beyond for her students, her feedback is detailed, and she is extremely organized. Easily one of the best professors at UVA. "
11726,547860,5.0,4.0,"Marshall Sensei is one of the best professors I've ever had at UVA. She is genuinely so caring, and wants to see students succeed. This is reflected in the way the class is graded, it's heavily participation and homework based. However, if you don't put in effort in the beginning and fall behind, your grade will suffer. Don't skip class, either."
11727,547860,2.5,5.0,"This class was insanely hard in amount of work. I had almost no time to do any other homework around this, especially since it was 5 days a week. Not for the faint of heart or the inexperienced!"
11728,547860,5.0,5.0,"She is a great teacher. Her class is a lot of work, and you will have to spend some hours on it per day, but you learn a lot in the process. If you need help go to her office hours and she will help you with anything you need. She might seem intimidating but she is really nice once you get to know her."
11729,547860,4.0,5.0,"Marhall-sensei is fair, funny and a very effective professor.  She intimidates me greatly, but is helpful in office hours. I was very relieved to find out that she makes all of the red marks on everyone's papers and not just mine.  I enjoyed that there were a lot of grades in the class and it wasn't solely weighted upon tests.  Better than Sato."
11730,547860,5.0,3.0,SHE IS NICE AND FUNNY
11731,547860,4.5,5.0,"Marshall-Sensei is a really good teacher, but scary sometimes. Compared to the other language teachers, she's the best and the least scary, but she's really hard core about attendance and turning things in on time. Unfortunately, she's good at weeding people out of the Japanese program that are in it just for a lang. req. Super Fun projects though!"
11732,547860,5.0,5.0,"Tough, but fair.  She's good at explaining concepts and the &quot;why&quot; behind the labrynthine grammar of the Japanese language.  Her classes will eat your life and your brain, though, so you probably won't do well unless you're *really* interested in Japanese."
11733,547860,5.0,4.0,"You have to get used to her at first, but after u get to know her, shes real nice and helpful and very fair. she challenges you and helps you and really wants u to get better :)"

11735,1735702,3.5,4.0,Lectures are very off and on.  Sometimes he is clear and explains the topics well while sometimes he goes off in a random tangent about the Schrodinger equation or other higher level topics.  Very helpful in office hours though.
11736,2055192,1.0,2.0,"awful professor. was never prepared for class, and always forgot the hw so u ended up having 5 worksheets due on one day. was really bad at explaining concepts, and his accent and god awful handwriting didnt help either. pretty terrible experience with him & this class overall."
11737,2055192,1.5,5.0,"This man does not know how to teach calculus.  Horrible handwriting and accent makes him difficult to understand.  Classes are pretty pointless, but he gives pop quizzes a lot. Avoid at all costs."
11738,1932319,2.0,3.0,I do not recommend online course with her. The projects are difficult to understand and there is little to no structure around the modules. Average grade on test was 31/56.
11739,1932319,5.0,3.0,"She is awesome! She gives you very specific feedback and lot of helpful material (handouts, articles, etc.). She is super sweet and you learn a lot with her! Instead of a textbook we used articles, but that does not mean that you only have to read a few articles, no no! you will end up with tons of pages to read (interesting readings, though)"
11740,1014829,5.0,4.0,"He's awesome! take his class, you never regret it!"
11741,1014829,5.0,2.0,"Ari is the best French instructor I've ever had. The atmosphere was relaxed enough that I wasn't worried about making grammatical mistakes, but his passion for the subject is infectious, and his sense of humor and personality are engaging on a personal level. The papers weren't hard at all and he grades leniently but fairly."
11742,1014829,4.5,3.0,"M. Blatt is obviously quite knowledgable and enthusiastic about the material. The papers aren't bad at all, as he's quite liberal about letting you re-write them. Has a very Gallic demeanor."
11743,1268782,5.0,3.0,Prof. Hagerman has the most engaging lectures I have seen at my time at UVa. She always wants to hear feedback from students so you have a chance to give your opinion as well as listen to those around you. She assigns a few readings for each week and a journal. The readings can be pretty hefty but nothing too bad. Take this class!!
11744,1268782,5.0,3.0,I have taken so many of Professor Hagerman's classes because I really love the way she teaches! Her lectures are really engaging and interesting. There's a lot of reading but I find them relevant and interesting. Her exam style can be frustrating but it's very fair. She's become more understanding about absence and mental health since the pandemic.
11745,1268782,4.0,5.0,Very funny and engaging! Gives a lot of work though and could be more understanding about mental health.
11746,1268782,2.0,5.0,"I took this class and was super excited with the subject. However, that quickly changed. Two two hour movies a night plus 2 x 2-3 pages of writing and additional readings of most of the time 30+ pages. Every night. Then, a 36 page paper due at the end of the two weeks....I mean come on. Two days to complete this because I had no time with the HW."
11747,1268782,1.0,3.0,"She seemed cool in the beginning of the semester, but she literally expects perfection w/ no human error. She expects you to prioritize her class ALWAYS and never miss or need help with anything. Also don't raise your hand bc she'll treat you like an idiot for having an opinion different from hers but class participation is part of your grade:)))"
11748,1268782,2.0,3.0,"Bonnie seemed like a cool prof at the beginning of the semester until I missed one class and all hell broke loose. She has this in-class reactionary paper that she doesn't give any heads up for and if you miss that class, you get a 0. It's looking like I'll have to drop this class, one i otherwise liked. She has no sympathy for human error. Sad."
11749,1268782,3.0,4.0,"I took WGS 2100 with Bonnie Hagerman this summer. It was a very interesting class, and I enjoyed it overall. However, there are some drawbacks to the class. First, she is a very harsh grader overall in terms of essays. You need to be an extremely strong writer if you want to get an A. Work is randomly collected. Participating is part of your grade."
11750,1268782,1.0,3.0,"Hagerman is the laziest professor I've had. Most of her PowerPoints are made up of memes, and I didn't learn anything in this class that I hadn't already read on the internet. She relies almost entirely on class discussion to fill up lecture time. She also assigns busywork that is collected randomly, making it impossible to prioritize your time."
11751,1268782,4.5,3.0,"She is a great lecturer and class discussion was always so interesting, she's a tough grader so don't necessarily expect an easy A. I took 2100 and loved the format of the class and thought it was very insightful. Attend class, participate, and do the readings and you should be okay, though!"
11752,1268782,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Hagerman is great to work with. She's very interesting, and willing to share her views. That being said, she doesn't force her opinions on the class or into the lectures. Unless you are adamantly anti-feminism, you will likely agree with most of what she says or suggests."
11753,1268782,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, extremely helpful, and very kind. I would highly recommend taking a class with her. I took WGS 2100 with her last semester and plan on taking another class with her next semester because she is just that good."
11754,1268782,4.5,4.0,"Passionate about the subject, grades papers like we're all English majors. Interesting class, but not an easy A."
11755,1449012,5.0,2.0,Introduces students in a time line manner in philosophy of medicine where physical concepts are introduced as a function of classic and non classic mechanics. Gains interests through both oscillating time line of discoveries and theories and determining empirical data. Targeting complexity of Nature and its purpose.
11756,1449012,4.5,3.0,"Awesome Professor.  He's a brilliant biologist who has lived through both old (Watson and Crick) and new (Human Genome, etc).  Very interesting guy to have a conversation with.  Uses primary literature-based papers as grades, which is a great way to learn!"
11757,1449012,1.0,5.0,"Lectures are really disorganized. He just gives a bunch of random facts everyday, I don't feel like I really learned anything new or interesting. The papers you write will only vaguely be based on lectures. When you write a paper, he'll say &quot;great job, I really liked how you...&quot; and give you a mediocre grade. Worthless class."
11758,1940546,5.0,3.0,He's a great teacher. One of the best teachers in my life. In just one semester I improve my English multiple times.
11759,1940546,4.0,3.0,"Maceyko-sensei makes it very clear what will be done through his comprehensive schedule given at the beginning of the year. However, he also expects you to check it every night, as each homework assignment is laid out there(and there's quite a bit of homework as well). Overall, a great class to take if you have any interest in learning Japanese. "
11760,1940546,4.0,4.0,"Maceyko-sensei is a very energetic and interactive teacher, and focuses strongly on participation and pair-work. He has lots of hands-on experience with the Japanese language. He is a picky grader, but it helps.  Attendance is graded and recommended There is usually homework every night, about 30 minutes-90 minutes."
11761,588868,4.5,1.0,It's a weird class that is taught but the guy is really smart and he can answer your questions.
11762,588868,5.0,2.0,"If you have a chance to take his class, take it. If you have a chance to even talk with him, do it. He is helpful, knowledgeable, amiable, cordial, and honest. Don't turn down his class. I really value this as one of the best experiences of my first year at UVA. (oh, and the barbecue at his house was delicious!)"

11764,588868,5.0,2.0,"Very nice guy!  Invited all the first-year Rodmans to his house for dinner.  He's interesting, but his voice may make you fall asleep in class."
11765,588868,5.0,3.0,You know you love it. Yeah. Nice facial hair. Smooth talker.
11766,752710,4.0,4.0,"The class emphasizes on self-study and self-motivation. The class meeting is lengthy and does not value so much as off-class reading. If you do the reading and really think about the issues Mr. Khare brings up in class, the paper-writing and the study process would be pretty joyful."
11767,752710,2.5,3.0,"The class was kind of boring. He really does have a monotone voice, even though he speaks very slow and clearly. I feel that while I did learn some things about India, I didn't really learn as much as I wished I had because of the class structure."
11768,752710,2.5,2.0,"very boring, monotone speaker.. dont have to really do the reading.. only two papers in the class, but you have to choose your own topic.. basically its up to the class to make the class interesting"
11769,146510,5.0,2.0,Paxton is a very good teacher and a wonderful person. Very helpful and engaging toward his students. Very approachable and friendly. The projects you do in class are a great learning experience.
11770,146510,4.0,1.0,"Paxton is a great teacher and person but this usem is basically an outside project. going to class is very difficult because it is boring guest speakers everyday.  I really liked my project, but the class was hard to sit through."
11771,146510,2.0,4.0,"Do not take this class. If you're interested in changing the environment do it through a student organization. USEM consists of guest lectures by individuals who have any relation to environmentalism, but they are usually far too specific and dry. waste of time"
11772,146510,5.0,1.0,Excellent professor!
11773,146510,2.0,2.0,"Good guy, just an OK USEM. Your grade consists of one big service project of your choice about sustainability.  About every other class you just talk as a group about each person's project, which is tedious because everyone says the same thing each week because they make little progress.  I would not have taken the class again."
11774,146510,4.5,3.0,GREAT class!
11775,146510,5.0,2.0,"WOW! Unlike any professor I have ever had. He Hates to give tests, prefers projects (you learn more).  Willing to give recommendations.  Every second of this class was well worth the effort."
11776,146510,5.0,2.0,Very chill & laid back. Great guy. Very very helpful. The best!!!
11777,146510,4.5,3.0,"He was the professor for my ENGR 162 class, but didnt really do too much teaching..that was generally left to the TA..but from what I saw, he is a caring, knowledgeable, and welcoming professor."
11778,146510,5.0,2.0,Excellent
11779,146510,3.5,3.0,"A genuinely nice and concerned individual.  Very easy to talk to. However, he isn't very specific when he assigns things, and is a little disorganized.  Also is a pretty tough grader."
11780,146510,3.0,3.0,"I only had him as a dean, but he is the most helpful dean.  He will bend over backwards anytime for you.  A true student's advocate.  I left E-school to the college, but I still love him.  And he has the coolest name: Phineas Paxton Marshall.  I mean, come on, is that not cool"

11782,146510,5.0,1.0,I love you man&gt; YOu are the Phenaus of all coolios
11783,146510,4.0,2.0,"very friendly and fun, cares a lot about the students.  his class isn't b.s. but it isn't hard and he's incredibly helpful.  definitely one of the best ee electives to take :)"
11784,146510,1.5,4.0,Bad attitude
11785,2251855,5.0,4.0,"Excellent lecturer, expert in his field, tough grader. One of the best and toughest classes I took at UVA."
11786,2227283,4.0,2.0,This course was generally easy if you have an interest in Kinesiology/medicine. I paired it with BIO 3410 and the course aligned nicely and often overlapped in material.
11787,2227283,5.0,2.0,"Really enjoyed this class, though the TAs did most of the teaching, they did a great job! There are several weekly assignments and lots of group work but the material is straight forward and easy to understand. Put in some effort and your grade will be great. Won't kill your grade to miss days here and there either. Never got &lt; 88 on tests"
11788,2227283,4.0,3.0,"Intro to Kinesiology is a great class, especially if you're looking to major in it. It's a great overview, and pretty easy overall. The TAs are awesome and Dr. Saliba is really cool. I would definitely recommend."
11789,1719385,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely the worst class available at UVA. The professor is incredibly rude, puts down those who have varying opinions, is an especially tough grader, and is overall completely unworthy to be considered a professor. Avoid this class if you have any dignity."
11790,1719385,4.0,4.0,"Give the course a chance. It was very enjoyable, though she grades a bit critically. The workload was fair, just about as much as I'd expect from a second writing requirement course. Professor Kim is very eloquent and knowledgeable, and honestly wants her students to do well and succeed not only in the course but in life as well."
11791,1719385,1.0,5.0,Didn't learn anything in the class. Grades way too harsh and the workload was crazy for an elective class.
11792,1719385,5.0,4.0,Dr. Kim is great! She's very articulate and passionate about the material presented in the course and always does her best to make students understand everything. She'll even look at your paper topics ahead of time and give you suggestions on how to improve it. Her classes were some of the coolest at UVA so be sure to try some of them out!
11793,1719385,5.0,3.0,"She is very articulate, and substance of the course is phenomenal and eye-opening. She is extremely helpful and kind with students, and I have high hopes for her as the new director for Korean studies in UVa. She is what UVa has been waiting for, and my semester with her was one of the best I have spent with a professor. All my classmates agree."
11794,588896,4.0,2.0,"Great teacher, fun and interesting subject, clear, relatively easy"
11795,588896,5.0,1.0,"I loved Prof Rood! He's kind of quirky, but he keeps the subject fun and interesting, and he's really nice. The tests are difficult, but he curves them quite a bit, so it's not that bad. You don't really have to read to do well."
11796,588896,3.5,2.0,"he's definitely an oddball. the name of the class is more interesting than the material ended up being- while there were some good parts, i also wanted to fall asleep a few times. also the final paper and exam are much easier than the first two tests which was great."
11797,588896,4.0,3.0,"After you get passed how wierd he is, you really like him.  He keeps everything interesting and you can tell he has experience in the field.  He can give you those interesting facts that you couldn't know unless you were involved in the subject.  All in all i loved the class."
11798,588896,4.5,4.0,No Comments
11799,1899618,3.0,4.0,"Bulent is a good teacher and is very caring. He actively encourages students to come to his office hours every day in class. But, the tests were weighted very heavily. The final exam was 40% of our final grade (though I believe he curved it)."
11800,1899618,4.0,3.0,"He's a great teacher who seems to really care about his students' success.  He makes it very clear that he is accessible outside of class.  He is always open for questions, he even encourages it.  I would definitely take him again."
11801,1899618,3.5,3.0,Bulent is a funny energetic and helpful professor. He writes everything on the board so it is easy to follow along. Asking questions is easy and if things are still unclear then he is very accessible and helpful in office hours. 
11802,1899618,5.0,3.0,"Bulent was enthusiastic, very helpful and clearly cares about his students. Very intriguing lectures. Open to questions and actively encourages kids to come to office hours. The way he put his course is interesting."
11803,1899618,5.0,3.0,Amazing
11804,1899618,1.5,3.0,"Very unclear and made simple concepts confusing. Tests were not a portrayal of the in-class problems or textbook problems. He does not give webwork, so the grade is dependent on the un-curved tests. Encourages asking questions but either doesn't answer them or says it is obvious. One plus, the class overall was curved."
11805,801905,2.0,3.0,Awful teacher. Terrible man.
11806,801905,4.0,2.0,Material is not difficult and Miksad teaches it well. VERY nit-picky on tests.  Make sure to do all the notation and do things his way or you will lose lots of points.  Wants all eyes on him during class and isn't afraid to tell you so.
11807,801905,4.0,3.0,"Very good teacher for fluid mechanics. Will call you out for falling asleep or doing other work in class. Read the book, do the homework, do example problems and you will do fine on his tests."
11808,801905,3.5,1.0,"Although the class was extremely easy, I actually learned a lot about working in teams and making power points.  He really tries to get us interested in engineering, and he's a great guy.  Very easy, but fun class if you make it."
11809,801905,1.5,2.0,"I thought he had a lot of insightful things to say.  BUT..  Myself and a partner were behind the successful design proposal, and lead many students in group work and class discussions only to receive lower grades than those classmates.  He is not a very fair person.  All other comments are accurate as well."
11810,801905,2.0,1.0,"Class was boring and focused a lot on civil engineering instead of an overall intro. he is a bit of nutcase and gives very little instruction. and he loves powerpoints. i was giving a presentation and he wasn't even paying attention. i overall disliked the class, but if you showed up to class and did the work, you will do well in the class."
11811,801905,1.5,2.0,biggest waste of time ever...never take this section...class is very easy b/c no tests or final...but entire course is about machu picchu...enough said
11812,801905,1.0,1.0,absolute waste of time...all we did was make some power points and listen to him talk about his glory days as an engineer.  no studying or work needed for the class but u lose points for not wearing a tie to make a presentation which he doesnt even watch...
11813,801905,2.0,3.0,"He's kind of a nutcase. Like others said, he focuses A LOT on civil engineering and the effect of it makes you wanna not have anything to do with civil engineering ever again. His lectures are pretty much pointless. You can see that he's a great guy and really passionate and he's definitely good (was the dean of e-school), but not very good overall"
11814,801905,3.0,3.0,Pretty weak class.  Doesn't exactly help anyone choose a major other than making them want to avoid civil engineering
11815,801905,2.0,2.0,"This course, focuses more on civil and mechanical engrineering rather than an overview of all types of engineering."
11816,72823,4.0,4.0,"Great professor. Cares very much about students, office hours very flexible and numerous, very resourceful. Forms of Reasoning course very hard, difficult to get a high grade, but very interesting material, would take again, even though may not help GPA. Passionate professor."
11817,72823,4.5,4.0,"He's a great professor with a great mind. Very sharp and wants you to be, too."
11818,72823,4.5,4.0,i really loved this class. tests are take home. they take a long time to do but aren't too bad. cargile is a great professor and genuinely cares about his students understanding the material. the material is difficult but manageable
11819,72823,3.5,3.0,"Cargile is very knowledgeable in the subject matter. He is very smart and knows what he's talking about, but then again he is kinda old and tends to digress every now and then during lecture. Personally, it didn't bother me =P He can seem confusing at times but I think that's only the case if you don't pay enough attention to what he's saying."
11820,72823,3.0,5.0,"THE BEST! very helpful, especially in office hours, but the class itself/the material is very difficult...he is a wonderful old man, though. truly caring and someone who wants you to understand and will help you get there if you make the effort, too!"
11821,72823,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Cargile is simultaneously the the kindest and most amusing professor I've ever had.  Yes, he meanders from time to time.  Logic is difficult, and even a master can get lost.  That's one of the main lessons of this class.  It's hard, but he will work with you until you get it.  You only fail if you can't admit you're having trouble.  The best."
11822,72823,2.0,5.0,"THIS CLASS WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORSE CLASS ON THE PLANET. I'll lay it down straight. Cargile is a very caring professor, but lets get real we are at this university to get A's or grades close to that and it is impossible if you are not doing well in his class. If you do not need to take this class DO NOT!!!!!!!"
11823,72823,2.5,5.0,"Seems like a nice man and funny at times, but this was the worst class I've taken here. The book was extremely opaque, and the professor's lectures were meandering and unhelpful. Only those with background in CS and math seemed to comprehend the subject. I wouldn't take another class with him again and I've lost any real interest in symbol logic."
11824,72823,3.5,3.0,"Great guy, hilarious, totally adorable, love him. But most of the time I had no idea what he was talking about. Part of it is that logic is just weird and hard. If your prepared, you can get by, but this class is tough. However, I would do it again. I learned a lot, and Cargile is really sweet and helpful in his office hours."
11825,72823,3.0,5.0,"I ussually rate teachers liberally, but i disagree with the other comments here.  I thought me made concepts unclear in class and didn't always grade fairly.  He is however, very helpful and approachable outside of class.  The class is challenging but interesting and you have to be dedicated to get a good grade"
11826,72823,4.5,4.0,Great professor teaching great material. Readings and homework are not mandatory and not that necessary. However his tests are difficult but take home. So if you understand it and can think logically you can do very well with minimum daily work.
11827,72823,3.5,4.0,"Cargile is a very intelligent and kind teacher. The class itself makes you think in a different way and work hard. It is definitely not an easy class, but I thought it was worthwhile. The tests are take home and he is helpful in discussion. Don't take it expecting an easy A though, you will have to work."
11828,72823,2.0,5.0,"Very smart man, but very frustrating to talk to. It's very hard to actually learn the reason why you have difficulties. I regret not having dropped the class the first day."
11829,72823,4.5,4.0,"Cargile is a hidden treasure at UVA! He runs a very old-school style classroom, so with his high expectations comes a devoted teacher who will teach you a lot. He truly cares about you as a &quot;student&quot; in a grandpa sort of way. Best in office hours!"
11830,72823,5.0,4.0,Cargile is my favorite prof. in 4 years at U.Va. Take any class with him (I took 3) but be prepared to work hard. He's also one of the most caring people you'll meet and truly loves teaching and his subject. Very knowledgeable and intelligent.
11831,72823,3.5,5.0,good teacher relly wants you to do well...a little too tied to the seminar concept though
11832,72823,4.0,5.0,"When I showed up late for the final (I'd studied all night and overslept), Mr. Cargile took my slobbering-with-tears self to the philosophy dept. library and said, &quot;Take your time.&quot; How awesome is that. His class made me a better English major."
11833,72823,4.5,4.0,"One of the best professors at UVA, but this is def not a walk in the park class...prepare to be challenged"
11834,72823,5.0,3.0,Cargile's just plain awesome.
11835,72823,5.0,3.0,"I'm now a philosophy professor, and Professor Cargile will forever serve as the standard against which I measure myself. Insightful, challenging, and helpful, he more closely approximates the Platonic Form of Professor more than anyone I've ever met. He's best during office hours, so take advantage of them!"
11836,72823,5.0,5.0,Whew!!
11837,72823,4.0,5.0,"A very hard class, and professor Cargile doesn't know the material any better than the smarter students who have read the book. He genuinly tries to help you to understand the material as he learns it with you. Just do the work on time(there are no deadlines) and you'll do well"
11838,72823,5.0,4.0,very very worthwhile course. a must if you want to go to law school
11839,72823,5.0,4.0,cargile rules... absolutely take any class by him--he's amazing
11840,72823,2.5,4.0,Class was sort of disjointed.  Cargile is mildly intimidating.
11841,72823,4.5,5.0,"Prof Cargile is the MAN.  He learns everyone's name by the second day of class and really cares about each of his students.  Incredably interesting man, but dry material.  Also:  I came into the class with a 4.0.  let's just say i didn't leave with one..."
11842,72823,4.5,4.0,"Incredibly smart professor; logically infallible.  Learned a ton, but take-home tests are very hard."
11843,72823,3.5,4.0,he's not going to hold your hand.
11844,72823,5.0,4.0,"Insanely smart, perhaps one of the best profs the university has to offer"
11845,72823,4.5,4.0,"awsome man, probably the smartest i've ever met - great class"
11846,2055291,4.0,3.0,"Great and engaging professor, really knowledgable about his subject and happy to answer questions. Format of the class is loose, so asking questions throws discussion off a bit. Might benefit from a more rigid content-lecture connection, meaning he doesn't give you any handouts."
11847,384126,2.0,5.0,"Very bad experience. Took the class because I am genuinely interested in the subject, and up learning absolutely nothing, as well as working extremely hard for a mediocre grade. Extremely disrespectful to students, and commonly went on tirades about how GMU students are lazy, entitled, incompetent, etc. instead of actually 'teaching'"
11848,384126,5.0,3.0,"He's the most misunderstand teacher ever. People that don't like him or rated him poor are people who just look for easy A's. He's not that. What he is is super brilliant and articulate and kind, and will help you grow and forces you to think. He really challenges you. Idk why it says UVA though he teaches at GMU in Fairfax. "
11849,384126,4.5,4.0,"I highly recommend Dr. Sachedina if you are interested in learning about Islam.  He is a true scholar with numerous publications, he speaks a ton of languages, and seems to know everyone.  The class won't be easy.  Expect to work very hard.  Worth the effort to learn so much.  One of the best academic experiences at GMU.  "
11850,384126,5.0,3.0,"(GMU) He is great and would recommend him to anybody.  He is the nicest man and takes an active interest in your success.  Midterm, final, and one paper that if you study can do well on.  He truly left me with many thoughts on the subject and changed my way of thinking about religion.  Take him, you will greatly enjoy his teaching."
11851,384126,4.0,3.0,"Sachedina is an GREAT human being, professor, & mentor. He's very knowledgeable & truly cares about his students. Lectures are mandatory but he kept them engaging, & amusing sometimes. I've learned so much from him! The coursework is challenging, lots of reading, 1 paper & final-but nothing unmanageable if you're interested.(GMU)"
11852,384126,1.0,4.0,"He is the worst!Dont take him. He judges you, even though he doesnt know you."
11853,384126,2.0,2.0,"You can basically absorb the religion of islam by looking at him and listening to him talk.  But don't expect to actually learn from his lectures all that much.  He isn't the clearest explainer, and this really hurts when talking about a subject inscrutable as islam.  Reading the books and wikipediaing the terms is the best way to go"
11854,384126,3.0,4.0,"I was stoked to take a class in Islam, but this was way more than I expected. It's a great class and a good learning experience, but Sachedina expects a lot out of his students. The reading load is pretty extensive, and while I was interested in the subject matter, the voluminous amount of required reading (and it is REQUIRED) made it less fun."
11855,384126,1.5,3.0,"This was by far the most boring and worst class I have ever taken at the University. The professor rambles on aimlessly, schedules 2 hour &quot;make up&quot; classes at night when he misses class, and yells at students. The readings are just as cryptic as the professor. Never take this class."
11856,384126,3.0,4.0,"This guy is AMAZING. As proof, I don't even go to UVA, but whenever I email him with questions regarding his expertise, he responds to me both fully and passionately. I can only assume he must be a great professor."
11857,384126,5.0,4.0,"Professor Sachedina is an AMAZING professor who truly cares about his students and about teaching them. All he really wants you to do is learn, so he gets upset when people don't care. But he is always willing to help; when some people got bad grades, he let them redo the assignment (including the mid-term). I adore Prof. Sachedina! I also took 311"
11858,384126,3.5,4.0,"Passionate professor who really absorbed you in the subject. Exams are rough, papers were pretty low-key. Will chastize people not paying attention in class, beware! Readings are 100% NECESSARY to succeed in this course. All in all, great professor who is enthusiastic and scholarly."
11859,384126,4.5,3.0,"I am definitively a greater person for hearing his tangents. Take the class and listen to his tangents. Now. Then you can try to get a good grade in the class, but the latter is less important."
11860,384126,4.5,4.0,"Probably the most brilliant man I will ever meet. He's clearly passionate about his subjects, which makes the lectures much more interesting. Goes off on a lot of tangents, but all of which are interesting and help relate class to real examples. Reading is tough and boring, but helps a lot understanding difficult subject material. LOVED this class"
11861,384126,1.0,5.0,"Easily the worst professor I have had at UVA. He was often condescending, and his comments on papers were mean-spirited, not constructive criticism at all. His lectures were really disorganized, an he often stayed on the first slide of his ppt the whole class and went off on some tangent. He went over time frequently (once by 15 minutes)."
11862,384126,3.0,5.0,Professor Sachedina is a classic example of an academic. He has a passion for his subject and can make the material come alive with his level of emotion. Tests are straightforward; reading is long and extremely difficult to digest. Study groups are essential for success in this course. The reading is critical in providing substantive exam responses
11863,384126,4.0,3.0,"By far the best academic experience I have ever had. His perspective is so unique and interesting that I would have loved the class even if I would have failed... the reading material he assigns can be quite challenging, but the tests are straight-forward."
11864,384126,3.0,4.0,The most intelligent man I have ever/will ever meet in my life.  You will be moved by him just beign in his presence. Do the readings and attend lecture and you will be fine. Taking this class was an experience I do not regret.
11865,384126,4.5,3.0,He is one of the most amazing teachers I have ever had.
11866,384126,3.5,2.0,Do not take this class if you do not want to do the reading (anywhere from 100-150 pages a week)!
11867,384126,4.0,4.0,"An excellent professor. The man is absolutely brilliant and the material is very interesting. There is a lot of reading however, but you can get by as long as you figure out what is important and make sure to read it. Two exams and two short essays, this class wasn't bad although some of the material is hard to digest. The lectures are excellent."
11868,384126,3.0,3.0,"I was very excited to take this course, but ended up being somewhat disappointed.  He is an exceptional speaker and is passionate about his material, but the lectures never directly pertain to the readings and sometimes they ended up being almost rants.  The exams were mostly from the text, almost nothing from the lectures."
11869,384126,2.5,2.0,I'm halfway through his class so far and I've been fairly disappointed.  I'm a third year religious studies major and I've taken MANY more interesting classes.  He seems like a nice guy...he's only yelled at one kid in class once and he was sleeping in the front row.  He gets off of topic a lot in the lectures and ab 1/2 of it is irrelevant.
11870,384126,4.0,5.0,"Prof. Sachedina was my favorite professor at UVA. The class was incredibly interesting, and he was extremely engaging. As a Muslim, the class was a great opportunity to examine my religion from an academic perspective - it truly transcends Sunni v. Shia differences."
11871,384126,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Sachedina is a nice man with a charming accent; LOTS of reading.  He occasionally yells at people in the class, but you can avoid this by following some basic politeness guidelines.  If you're talking in class, sleeping, whatever -- you deserve to be yelled at.  His class is fascinating, definitely an interesting one to take."
11872,384126,3.0,3.0,"Super enthusiastic professor.  Very kind. Very interesting class.  Lots of reading and analysis.  Be sure to participate a lot in discussions.  DO NOT TALK during lectures, he hates that!  Definitely a worthwile, but challenging class."
11873,384126,3.5,4.0,"I found it very difficult to understand his lectures, and though discussion was interesting and engaging, the readings were very long and difficult as well, and discussion/participation didn't count for any part of the grade! Tests were hard to study for -essays- but not that hard to take. Grading is 30% essay midterm,25% 5pp paper, 45% essay final"
11874,384126,4.0,4.0,"Passionate and knowlegable about what he teaches Cares about every one of his students. High standards for grades and student behavior. Do not disrespect him by talking, eating, or sleeping in class. He will call you out on it in front of everyone. He chastises only the students who deserve it. It's kinda funny when he yells at them in Farsi."
11875,384126,5.0,3.0,No Comments
11876,384126,5.0,2.0,"If you try to approach this class typically, then you will fail.  If you can prove that you understand the overall message and tie it to readings and history...you will do fine."
11877,384126,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Sacehdina is an emazing professor. He cares about his students and if he yells at them ( which he doesn't do often) it's because they talk in class. He knows what he's talking about. I loved his class. But let me tell you something, you will do a lot of reading which is worth it at the end."
11878,384126,1.0,3.0,"This guy sucks. He's not helpful, and he likes to yell at students. He also gets in bitter e-mail wars with people that the whole class can see. AVOID."
11879,384126,1.0,4.0,No Comments
11880,384126,4.5,3.0,"Professor Sachedina is a truly amazing man and professor. If he yells at someone, which he rarely does, they deserve it. His lectures are fascinating. He assigns a lot of reading, and demands a lot from his students, so if you're not into that, go to another school. Probably my favorite prof."
11881,384126,4.5,4.0,Sachedina is a good prof. He only yells at people when they are disrespectful; so they deserve it.  He genuinely cares about his students and what they are taking from the class.  He does NOT have a radical agenda.
11882,384126,4.5,4.0,"While Sachedina does occasionally yell at students, it is not without cause.  He has only done it to students talking during his lectures.  He is an intellegent man and knows what he is talking about.  I've learned so much from his course and plan to take his other classes in the future."

11884,384126,4.5,3.0,"Great professor! Clear, very interesting lectures. He also really cares about his students. It is almost like highschool in that way."
11885,2366593,1.0,4.0,"Walked into lectures feeling good, walked out feeling more confused then when I walked in. The best lecture we had was when we had a substitute professor come in."
11886,2366593,2.0,4.0,Linda was not great at explaining things. The overall setup of the class sucked and she constantly made mistakes with the logistics.
11887,2366593,2.0,4.0,"I stopped attending her optional lectures because there was nothing fruitful happening during them. The workload is heavy and confusing for this course, and they make things hard to understand for no reason. I really disliked the structure of this class."
11888,2366593,2.0,4.0,"I took this class with Columbus because I heard amazing things about her, but I was wrong. Whenever we don't understand something, she quickly looks it up on Google. Common things she says are &quot;this answer looks like goobly gook&quot; if its incorrect rather than a complete explanation, annoying laughs if we have a question, and never responds to emails"
11889,2366593,5.0,4.0,"Columbus truly provides an environment where she wants to see each student reach their full potential. She is a visionary that has rebuilt the framework for this class using an active-learning method, and it is fabulous. Even more, Professor Columbus is a highly regarded individual within the academic community and is an advocate for each student."
11890,2366593,4.0,3.0,Took both the 1410 &amp; 1420 course with Columbus. Class is setup differently from traditional college classes; online reading/questions before lectures and then group assignments following lecture. Basically flipped classroom - not a bad thing. The difficulty is nothing too bad as long as you keep up with the weekly reading.
11891,498832,5.0,3.0,Burton is Awesome. One of the best econ professors I have had and super knowledgeable and connected in the field. Take him if you can.
11892,498832,4.5,4.0,"By far my favorite economics professor at UVA. Extremely knowledgeable and approachable. Ask him for lunch and you'll see his generosity firsthand.   With regards to grading -- yes his tests are hard, but he does that to break the cheating-off-of-last-years-exam-test cycle. Actually learn the material, it's useful."
11893,498832,2.0,4.0,Most boring lecturer: he goes off topic and rarely covers the material that will be covered on the exam. He is not available for office hours on grounds and has not been a resource outside of that.
11894,498832,2.0,4.0,"One of the easier electives even though it is probably the most frustrating. The TAs don't speak English and grade exams randomly and with little explanation. There is little to do for the class. Exams are relatively easy if you can summarize the articles. Burton is an annoying old man so avoid lectures as much as possible. Get the grade, get out."
11895,498832,2.5,4.0,"Lectures are pointless, just read his book."
11896,498832,1.0,4.0,Took financial markets with him.  The topic is interesting but he is not.  He lectures are worthless and his book is very confusing.  He offers ZERO help if you ask him any questions outside of class.  Very arrogant person that doesn't care about nexting.  He spent one class talking about his convervative views and the Virginia legislature.
11897,498832,1.5,3.0,"Not too difficult of a class especially if you're interested in the subject material. He's definitely incredibly full of himself however, not willing to help you with logistical problems, and forgets conversations, and also hates on Comm Schoolers. Definitely overrated."
11898,498832,4.5,4.0,"Amazing professor, great class. Take the class only if you're interested though; you probably won't enjoy it if you're only aiming for the grade. Keeps you really up-to-date with what's going on in finance."
11899,498832,4.0,4.0,"I think it's very hard to have a economics professor who has so much practical experience in the finance world. If you want to keep yourself up to date about Wall Street, take his class!"
11900,498832,4.5,3.0,"Professor Burton is spectacular! I have never met a professor so eager to meet his students.  He genuinely cares for every student he has and will go out of his way to help them in any way possible.  Take this class, it is extremely interesting and you will learn A LOT about finance!"
11901,498832,1.5,4.0,"1) Interesting class, knowledgeable individual 2) Won't meet with you if it inconveniences him at all. 3) Sketchy with girls. 4) Mumbles way too much, can't understand what he says. 5) Grading is terrible (not grader's fault he tells them to defile our tests). 1+1=2 would somehow get points deducted.6) If you're a HUGE suck-up you'll do well."
11902,498832,1.5,4.0,No Comments
11903,498832,1.0,3.0,"One of the worst classes in the Economics department.  Lectures can all be condensed to five minutes, tests and grading are random, and Professor Burton couldn't be more overrated. Please, don't waste your time."
11904,498832,3.0,3.0,He's creepy but also very smart. Half of lectures are about his conventions and travels. The whole hot girl rumor is definently true. He'll also try to play golf and tennis with you. Tests are medium difficulty.
11905,498832,5.0,2.0,"Easy going professor.  Be prepared to learn a lot, he is very informative and thorough.  He's a great teacher and has a lot of knowledge in the field, and a genuine interest in keeping the class engaged.  No slacking here! Keep good notes and study if you want to get a B or an A.  Take advantage of your study time!  He likes all the pretty girls!"
11906,498832,1.5,4.0,No Comments
11907,498832,2.0,2.0,"Decent professor but fits a 30 min lecture into 75 min (boring).  Little full of himself but the stories are interesting.  The tests are graded fairly easily, but you never really know what's going to be on them.  I never read and did pretty well, so if you don't mind reading you shouldn't have a problem at all."
11908,498832,5.0,2.0,"This guy is awesome, take his class.  But you do have to do all the readings, and his test are somewhat difficult."
11909,498832,1.5,3.0,"Hopefully you're a pretty girl.  If not, don't bother with the office hours."
11910,498832,2.0,1.0,"What a waste. Lectures are full of opinion, not fact. Arrogant. Also, his well-known &quot;attention&quot; that he lavishes on pretty girls is creepy. Only reason to take this class is to pad your GPA."
11911,498832,2.5,4.0,"very pretentious. likes pretty girls. tests are kinda random, but class is very interesting. def. take if interested in finance, but be prepared to study for his tests!"
11912,498832,1.0,3.0,No Comments
11913,498832,2.5,3.0,classes are full of very useful and fundmental materials. he's a bit full of himself.it's better to write him emails about questions than going to office hrs cuz he is very busy and talks on the phone alot. his tests are sometimes ambiguous even u study for it.read books is more important than class
11914,498832,4.5,2.0,Awesome Professor. Makes you want to go to class. 434 is better than 303. roughly 1/3 get c's 1/3 b's and 1/3 a's in both 303 and 434. Always takes students to lunch. take b4 comm school.Very open with students. And is known in the Fin. world great intro to Fin Markets. The Friedman book in 303=bad.
11915,498832,5.0,2.0,Amazing teacher... really take it for him !
11916,498832,5.0,4.0,One of the best teacher of the entier ECON department...
11917,498832,2.0,4.0,"Burton's class was very disorganized and his lectures were all over place, not relevant to the tests at all. The Friedman book was absolutely horrible reading. The tests aren't that bad, but overall, the class is just drawn-out and boring."
11918,498832,3.5,4.0,"good class,learn alot about financial mkt.Lectures not very organized cuz too much info and too many meterials to cover. U have to learn alot on your own thro reading (Friedman book is very challenging). Lot to memorize for tests"
11919,498832,4.0,3.0,"A decent class, not too rigorous. A good introduction to financial markets. You use his text, which is helpful. His lectures are good, and he uses slides. He lifts answers from his old exams, which are available. Burton is pretentious, though, and a little full of himself."
11920,498832,3.5,4.0,"this class has great stuff about the financial mkt! u can learn so much. but hard class,tons of readings(Friendman book is a killer, but u do learn a lot). He is good prof and certainly very experinced in the field and knows the stuff. Make good effort to know his students."
11921,498832,2.0,3.0,"The class is ok, not too hard but not that easy. He takes the whole class to talk about something that can be finished in 15 minutes. The book, Friedman and Schwartz, also sucks and is a horrible read."
11922,1318043,2.0,4.0,Shes enthusiastic about math. Shes moves rather quickly through the material. The way she teaches is very conceptual based as well as based off the book. I feel like I'm trying to teach myself math....
11923,1318043,1.0,3.0,"If you can't teach the material to yourself, find another teacher."
11924,187551,1.0,3.0,"Seriously awful professor. The grading curve is lenient at the end, but he is incredibly boring and his exams consistently average 55-60. I lost all motivation for the class because of how awful it was."
11925,187551,3.0,3.0,"Definitely a nice dude and super intelligent. His tests are hard and consistently have a 60 average or so, he even said this was true for like the last 20 yrs. If you read the book you can pull a 70 pretty easy, which should be an A with the curve. He always talks about how he's friends with all the scientists in the book, interesting guy."
11926,187551,1.0,4.0,This class is blatantly unfair and Saslaw should not still be teaching. His tests are extremely difficult and everyone in the class fails them. He is unable to teach and you basically have to teach yourself from reading the book. Please do not sign up for this class if you would like to keep your sanity.
11927,187551,3.0,1.0,"Saslaw gets a lot of heat for being an old and boring lecturer, but if you actually listen to the things he says and not immediately write him off, he's incredibly interesting.  Loves teaching about astronomy, and has tests that are almost word for word questions from the book and sometimes lecture.  Very generous curve, so if you read expect an A."
11928,187551,2.5,5.0,He's a nice guy but doesn't explain anything and puts very esoteric questions on the exams. 
11929,187551,1.0,5.0,"Good grief I should have looked at this before registering for this class. I now find it hard to enjoy looking up at the night sky. I'm relieved that his curve is enormous, but I am not happy that UVA billed me for such a fraud of a class. They clearly know how poor he is at actual instruction. "
11930,187551,1.0,5.0,He is more useless than murphy. He cannot teach at all and he looks like a sloth. 
11931,187551,1.0,5.0,"Professor Saslaw is easily the worst professor I've had. His lectures often deviate from the material and become too difficult to understand. You have to do the reading, but the 3 tests are way over everyone's heads and are the only grades. Also, he does not make himself available for help if you need it. Take this class with a different professor."
11932,187551,1.5,4.0,"Do not take ASTR 1220 with Saslaw. You can go to lecture and take extensive notes and also read the chapters assigned and you will still not recognize many of the terms on the test. The test averages are usually around a 60 and he claims they ""should be rounded at the end of the semester"". This is not a class that you can take for fun! "
11933,187551,1.0,5.0,"Professor Saslaw is absolutely ridiculous. He is clearly very intelligent, but there is no reason he should be teaching this course. The lectures are the most boring I have ever sat through, and the averages on our tests are between 50-60. The only silver lining is that the information is incredibly interesting and the textbook is very good."
11934,187551,1.0,2.0,"WORST professor at UVA. He's super old doesn't understand technology and doesn't understand how to teach. He might understand astronomy, but he has no idea how to help YOU understand it. Lectures are boring and you may as well not go. Just read the textbook and you should be fine. There is a generous curve. I got a good grade and understood NOTHING"
11935,187551,1.0,3.0,I reccommend that you do not take this class with Saslaw. The only reason I passed is because most of the material I knew from high school. He is too old and too much of a scientist to be a decent lecturer.
11936,187551,3.0,4.0,"If you're not comfortable with Astronomy then find a different teacher. Saslaw can be difficult to learn from as he follows the textbook exactly or goes way off-topic in class. He seems really interested in the field though. Besides that, the class is difficult, but the curve is generous. I had D's on almost every test but passed with a B."
11937,187551,3.0,2.0,My feelings for this class are neutral. Professor Saslaw defiantly knew the material. However his lectures were extremely boring. The class average on exams were consistently in the low 60's upper 50's. On average 50% of the class was present at the lectures. If you are taking this class read the text book before the exam and you will do fine.
11938,187551,4.0,2.0,"I think that Professor Saslaw was a great teacher. He always laugh at my jokes. If you come to class and read the book thoroughly, you will do better than the average. The class is curved so you will not fail unless you're a poor student.  I was on point and passed the class with a decent grade. I can't say so for some others."
11939,187551,1.5,5.0,"Please pay attention to the comments you see from people about his class. I thought it would be fine, it wasn't. I hated this class. Its nothing interesting like astronomy you see on discovery channel its mainly a physics/chemistry class. ONLY take this course for credit/no credit. NOT for a letter grade. Thats the best advice I could ever give"
11940,187551,1.0,5.0,"Please do not take class with this instructor. I read comments on Ratemyprof and thought it wouldn't be that bad, but I was wrong. This guy might be a good scientist, but not a good teacher, he should be confined to some kind of lab, not here teaching. I am greatly disappointed by him, and I suggest everyone to avoid him, and take astro with a diff"
11941,187551,1.0,4.0,"Don't take this class... it'll just be a waste of your time.  Attending lecture is quite unnecessary (though I always did, hoping it would eventually get better... fail). It doesn't much matter whether you work really hard or not, you'll still probs not do super great.  Saslwa is just incredibly monotone and hard to follow, tests are hard.no good."
11942,187551,2.0,2.0,"Bad teacher. Unclear and not engaging. Class is easy if you read EVERYTHING in the chapters. Interesting material nonetheless, would recommend taking this class with a different professor."
11943,187551,5.0,1.0,He's a cool guy i guess.
11944,187551,4.5,4.0,":D he may be slow, but sometimes that's what students needs in order to conjure up their thoughts about the topic before he moves on to greater details. a simple equation defines the class: you have patience- take it; no patience- don't take it. I would classify this guy as &quot;old reliable&quot; and, frankly, gives very intelligent answers to questions."
11945,187551,1.0,4.0,"Try to avoid taking a class with him, he is very difficult to understand (quiet, mutters) and is not very helpful when you ask him questions. As long as you read the book GREATLY in-depth you can do well in the class. Don't go to lecture. You may think you're failing but the curve is usually about 20-30 points."
11946,187551,1.0,5.0,"this class is absolutely horrible. Lectures are so boring they will drive you mad. I stopped going and read the book intensely and got F's on the tests (I am an A or B+ student) however, although i got F's.. I got an A in the class because i got higher F's than others and the final grade is curved."
11947,187551,3.0,4.0,"You guys are being wayyy to mean to Saslaw. He is such a nice little man. He has a nice little laugh and an awesome hairdo. So stop grieving over yourselves and get some lives. Also, yes the class is boring."
11948,187551,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT take a class with him! it was so so so boring!!! the textbook costs way too much, and it's just not a good class!"
11949,187551,1.0,5.0,he is horrible basically all you can do is read the book because it is literally impossible to understand him cuz hes so freaking old. he seems like a nice guy however im pretty sure he doesnt no how to work a computer... he doesnt use toolkit and im pretty sure he doesnt have an email address.
11950,187551,1.0,4.0,"Horrible professor. Would have been a good class if he wouldn't have been the one teaching it. I'm not at all interested in this subject now, and i associate some of it to him. I was miserable through the whole class and he was not personable when i went to him specifically either. Wasn't worth the hour three times a week it wasted."
11951,187551,1.0,4.0,"OMG DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! although i still got an A, i had to work my ass off for this class. professor's lectures are absolutely incomprehensible and seems like his mind is far far way in some galaxy."
11952,187551,2.0,3.0,"going to classes were not useful, except for the 1-2 questions on the exam that he mentioned in class. read the textbook and u will score."
11953,187551,1.0,4.0,"Saslaw is, quite frankly, the absolute worst professor I have ever had. He never responded to my E-mails, he was a totally un-engaging lecturer, his tests were far harder than they should have been (students averaged 60% on each one), and he made an interesting class immensely painful to go through."
11954,187551,1.5,5.0,"RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS MAN!! If you have ever had any interest in astronomy, science, or just... learning, it will be instantly taken from you by this class! Class attendence does you no good, because the tests are still impossible. NOTE: This is not a bad class, just a VERY BAD professor."
11955,187551,2.0,5.0,No Comments
11956,187551,1.0,2.0,"OH, dear Lord...I WAS an astrophysics major when I first came to UVA...this man is half of the reason I'm now going pre-law. He must be the most useless and unclear teacher I've met in my life. He mumbles, doesn't know what his notes or slides say, and even had two trick questions on the first exam! This class is easy enough if you teach yourself.."
11957,187551,1.0,2.0,"Please, for the love of god, do not take this class. Saslaw is a very brillant man, but a HORRIBLE teacher!! His lectures are completely random and usually about nothing. The class isn't hard if you read the book but prepare to teach yourself. He is a horrible excuse for a teacher. Sorry."
11958,187551,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Saslaw is undoubtedly brilliant.  But while he is certainly an accomplished scholar, the same cannot be said for his teaching.  He's not exactly engaging- if you're interested in the subject it's fine, but as I was not, I attended fewer and fewer lectures as the semester moved on.  If you read a lot you should be fine for the exams, though."
11959,187551,1.0,4.0,"HORRIBLE!  PLEASE SPARE YOURSELF FROM THIS AWFUL PROFESSOR.... He does not prepare any notes for his lectures, nor does he present any lecture material on his exams.  Reading the textbook doesnt help because his exams questions are insignificant, trivial facts.  I suggest you stay far far away from this professor."
11960,187551,3.0,3.0,"Saslaw will only keep the Astronomy buffs engaged. The mystery of time and space that intrigues the CLAS students enough to attempt to use the class as their Science/Math requirement will not be satisfied. Fortunately, lectures are not required to pull a decent grade in this class. Rather than attending lecture, read the textbook."
11961,187551,1.0,4.0,"he is an idiot. he treats any questions you may have as if they are not worth answering, and will argue with almost anthing you say. if i decided to go to class, i usually left early because the only thing i could concentrate on was his obscene combover. it made me want to punch a baby."
11962,187551,2.5,4.0,The class is more difficult than you would expect for a 100 level class. The lectures are boring. The questions on the test are detailed and sometimes very obscure.
11963,187551,1.0,5.0,What a failure he is as a professor. He opens the book to scan to see what he should be lecturing about. I studied a good deal for his tests and its as if I was given a test in a completely different subject. There is no correlation between his &quot;lectures&quot;/book and the tests he gives out. He should have retired- 20 years ago. He doesn't use toolkit.
11964,187551,3.0,1.0,"The man is by far the most brilliant person I have come into contact with. That being said, his lectures' semantics are a bit rough at times and his tests require a good amount of studying. However, if you ask questions and study and come to class, you can pull an A in the class. Only people with an appretiation for the intellect should take this."
11965,187551,1.0,5.0,I blew this class off like whoa.Literally. My best friend and I skipped this class to go buy $13 cartons of generic cigarettes from Smokin' Joes.Listening to him lecture is like being inside an autistic person's head.  He just recites facts in no relevant or organized manner.
11966,187551,1.5,3.0,"Wow...don't take a class from this guy.  He rambles, doesn't publish the dates of the tests, doesn't seem to know the meaning of the internet, and his lisp will drive you crazy.  He does have an awesome combover however."
11967,187551,1.0,3.0,"Prof. Saslaw is very knowledgable on the subject, but is a conveyor of his knowledge. The lectures are very disorganized and the tests ask about minute details compared to important concepts. Not a hard class, but boring. Just read the book."
11968,187551,1.0,3.0,"Saslaw may very well be a great astronomer, but as an instructor he is a resounding failure. His &quot;lectures&quot; are without direction or merit; he literally will open the book and flip through it to see what he's supposed to be talking about. I didn't go to class except for the tests, it was that bad."
11969,187551,1.0,5.0,"AWFUL, do NOT take a class with this professor. he does not teach and your grades on the test will demonstrate that."
11970,187551,1.0,4.0,"Awful, absolutely awful, read the text to do well on the tests b/c his lectures are completely pointless you won't learn anything of use in class"
11971,187551,1.5,5.0,"I will forever hate astronomy b/c of this man! If you enjoy being put to sleep, 20 sec pauses after every sentence said, and being tested on trivial facts rather than concenpts...then this is the man! If you have any interest in astronomy, avoid this man at all costs."
11972,187551,1.5,2.0,"Saslaw exudes knowledge about the field of astronomy, as his Cambridge degree implies; but his lectures thoroughly disinterested me.  He averaged 1/7 of his class on any given day.  He did explain key concepts, but the tests seemed intended to trip you up.  There must be better for this course."
11973,187551,1.5,4.0,"This guy's lectures are as dry as they get, and he lectures off the top of his head so half the time he's rambling.  The exams don't necessarily test for a good knowledge of the material-a lot times they're just trivial facts.  He ruins an interesting material; never have a class with this teacher!!"
11974,187551,1.0,4.0,Avoid this class like the plague. I'd taken 121 the previous semester and really enjoyed astronomy. Saslaw killed any interest in the subject I had. His tests were all based on picky facts from the book.
11975,187551,1.0,3.0,DO NOT take any astronomy courses with Saslaw.  His wicked comb-over is the only funny thing about his class.  Tolbert is a better option.
11976,187551,1.0,4.0,"Saslaw is by far the worst professor I've ever had. His lectures bored me so much that I had to stop going to class to save my sanity. However, his tests are straight forward and taken directly from the textbook. I suggest taking someone else for Astro."
11977,187551,1.0,4.0,"WARNING: Prepared to be put to sleep. This was the most boring class ever, I just stopped going. Please take it with someone else. I wish someone had told me the same."
11978,187551,4.0,2.0,"I thought he was pretty good. A little dry sometimes, but his jokes are so bad they're funny. The tests are easy AND on a curve, I think he's a great prof and that it's a great class."
11979,187551,1.0,3.0,"Way too quiet to lecture to such a big class and lectures not important for test preparation; all questions come from chapters in the book.  If you like astronomy, take it from another professor."
11980,187551,1.5,3.0,"He is a horrible teacher! His lectures put me to sleep, he doesn't believe in e-mail so none of his notes are posted online, and you can't get in touch with him at all.  Take this class with someone else, or better yet, pick another science class to take."
11981,187551,1.5,2.0,No Comments
11982,187551,2.0,2.0,"Not very good, but his tests were straightforward and graded on a curve, so the class was not too hard."
11983,2317473,5.0,2.0,"I took Sean's Intro to Poetry Writing last semester and it was an amazing experience. He is a great speaker and listener; he challenges you to do your best without being overbearing. Class was always enjoyable, lighthearted, and constructive. Be ready to spend time writing and discussing your poems. Really awesome class and teacher!"
11984,2317473,5.0,2.0,"Great class, even better professor"
11985,2317473,5.0,4.0,"Sean is an excellent professor. Created a great environment for students to share their poetry, which is impressive considering how personal this activity is. Would definitely take his class again!"
11986,2317473,5.0,2.0,Sean is really knowledgable in his field and engaging his in class (and outside of class--he is very approachable). He facilitates workshop in a manner that encourages participation and thoughtfulness. He truly wants his students to learn and succeed. Would recommend taking this class and/or another one of Sean's classes!
11987,187555,4.5,4.0,"I took several courses from Dimberg and enjoyed all of them.  It's not easy to get an A in the class, but it is relatively easy to get a B.  Attending the lecture and paying attention is about 75% of the work you need to do."
11988,187555,4.0,3.0,I don't know how to get an A in this class other than going to his office hours and sucking up. It should be an easy class but Dimberg makes it arduous and plays favorites. Stay away; there are easier/more fun history classes elsewhere
11989,187555,2.0,4.0,the syllabus is easy but he is a ridiculous grader. there's no way of telling what he is looking for on the quiz and the essays. the only way to make an A in this class is to kiss his ass
11990,187555,4.5,3.0,"Dimberg is a good lecturer and he knows and loves the subject. He is very knowledgable and speaks slow enough to type his lectures almost word for word, which is great! He lectures are organized and efficient. The course is not too hard and I would definitely recommend taking any of his classes."
11991,187555,5.0,1.0,Fairly easy class as long as one attends lectures and takes notes. A good introductory class to the History department or just to get the requirement done.
11992,187555,5.0,3.0,"He definitely knows his stuff when it comes to Korean History. I've always hated history but I did well in his class. The key is to PAY ATTENTION during lectures--he will give you all the info you need for the quizzes. Got A's on all his quizzes, B on one essay and don't know about the other, got an A-."
11993,187555,3.5,2.0,"Lectures were interesting although it is pure lecture, there is no powerpoint or anything to help outside of a few key terms for the day. I had no prior knowledge of Korean History but honestly feel like I've learned something. He grades fair and is helpful in office hours. I recommend this class."
11994,187555,5.0,4.0,"I hate history, but I really enjoyed coming to this class. Dimberg is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about Korean history. It's important to attend class and pay attention though, because he will talk for the entire time and does not provide any sort of Powerpoints/anything like that."
11995,187555,5.0,3.0,"I adore Professor Dimberg. He is incredibly knowledgable on the subject and is very approachable and friendly. If class ever starts to get boring he throws in jokes about his wife or his cat. You don't have to do the reading as long as you take good notes in his lecture Be warned: not an easy A, but it is worth it!"
11996,187555,4.0,3.0,"he is hilarious. his class was confusing at first because the terms are unfamiliar but it gets easier as you go along. you don't have to read anything, just go to lecture and you'll do fine. he tells lots of funny stories too! great guy!"
11997,187555,4.0,4.0,"I enjoyed Dimberg's Korean History class, which I was taking to fulfull non-western prospective, so much that I majored in History with a focus on East-Asia."
11998,187555,4.5,4.0,"Do not underestimate the quizzes. They sound easy (explain significance of 10 of 16 terms), but you have to give significance, not simply ID them. Overall, a very interesting and well-taught class. If you want to learn about Korea, a must-take."
11999,187555,5.0,3.0,"Professor Dimberg is a great professor and the class is very rewarding, if you pay attention and go to his lectures. He has a few grammatical pet peeves one should ask about in advance - they will affect your grade negatively no matter how good your ideas are. Also take his 403 and Neo-Confucianism classes if offered."
12000,187555,5.0,3.0,Exceptional teacher.  I only took a summer course with him and in that tiny amount of time I feel like I learned an incredible amount about the subject and somehow he still had time to talk about baseball and such things.
12001,187555,5.0,3.0,"Lectures are definitely more important than the readings in this course.  He's a good professor and very helpful, but his quizzes can be hard to do well on.  You have to write the most important information for an ID in a short amount of space, and things like dates aren't very important, so make sure you're clear about what he wants."
12002,187555,4.5,2.0,Nice guy who is really laid back and truly cares whether his students understand the material.  He often cracks jokes and even told us to come to office hrs to talk about the NFL or MLB seasons with him!  I agree with the advice below that going to lectures is the key to doing well in this class.
12003,187555,4.0,2.0,"go to lectures and take good notes, then it's an easy A.(unless you really mess up the final project)"
12004,187555,5.0,4.0,"The man loves his subject (East Asian History).  Great lectures.  Modern day Confucian scholar.  VERY funny, too.  Seems to love being a prof and helping people understand him rather than hearing himself talk.  Good guy.  Take anything by him, but visit him, too, and you'll get more out of class."
12005,187555,5.0,2.0,I like Prof. Dimberg.  He knows what's important in history and what's not.  He wants you to get the big picture and that's what makes his class a different kind of history class.  One word of advice: do not miss lectures.  The quizzes are lecture-heavy.
12006,187555,5.0,3.0,"Dimberg is an awesome professor. He loves his topic (Korean History) and that definitely shows during lecture. He is also one of the most helpful professors I have had at the University. All-in-all, Dimberg is GREAT!"
12007,187555,2.5,4.0,"Prob. the most boring class offered at the University.  Korean History, if taught properly should not be as boring and bland as Dimberg made it.  Suggestion, do not take this class."
12008,187555,4.0,4.0,No Comments
12009,187555,5.0,2.0,"He's a really great teacher, very spirited and funny, he keeps class interesting"
12010,187555,5.0,3.0,"Great character, very knowledgeable about his subject, makes class a wonderful hour with his subtle humor"
12011,187555,4.5,4.0,Dimberg cares about his students and overall is a good professor.
12012,1072292,2.5,3.0,"He is an all around alright teacher, difficult to understand at times. Has a hard time answering questions directly and if he doesn't understand a question he will simply avoid it."
12013,1072292,4.0,2.0,"He was a good TA. Sometimes it is difficult to understand him, however he is really nice and goes over the text."
12014,1227949,1.5,4.0,"horrible. he makes you come to discussion bc his tests for the discussion grade are random. That isn't so bad, but when nobody has questions he insists on lecturing the entire class on useless practice questions. Avoid at all costs."
12015,187566,1.0,5.0,"Alexander is the worst professor I had in all 4 years at UVA. Make sure you don't get sick (I had to spend a week in the hospital for a severe infection when I took his class), because he will not provide any accommodations. He even asked for medical documentation to prove my illness which my dean later told me he was should not be asking for. "
12016,187566,1.0,4.0,"I would not recommend taking a class with him if you receive SDAC accommodations. He was ableist when I met with him over Zoom to discuss my accommodations with him, saying they wouldn't be valid for his class."
12017,187566,3.0,4.0,"Amazing professor. The reading is dense, but really ties in with the lecture. Grade was based on two papers (with REALLY long, confusing prompts) and one final exam."
12018,187566,4.5,4.0,"Great professor! His lectures are incredibly fascinating and he explains his stuff really well. He's not easy and the class has a ton of dense reading, but he does a great job of explaining it and bringing it to life. I really learned a ton in his class. Found him very inspiring. Definitely a must if you're willing to work."
12019,187566,3.0,3.0,"I thought Alexander was a great lecturer. He has a narrative style, which is helpful to understand the aggregate material. But the professor himself is arrogant. I went into his office hours three times, and each time was traumatized by his rude behavior. I you plan to remain anonymous to him, it's a good one. And useful for a focus in CP."
12020,187566,1.5,4.0,"Take this class if you are a FOOL. Hated every single minute of this class (lectures are boring/talks too fast/only he knows what he's talking about), readings are too dense, structure of class is horrid. Worst class and worst professor in the Politics Dep. Do yourself a huge favor and AVOID THIS CLASS!!!!"
12021,187566,5.0,2.0,"Really really good class. He makes the subject matter clear. You have to study and read, but you have to do that to excel in any class. Took this class as a first year without any previous politics courses and i'd recommend this class/professor. Engaging lecturer, interesting subject matter. No trick questions, information is straightforward."
12022,187566,1.0,1.0,Strident and sarcastic.  Rarely permits or respects other points of view in the classroom
12023,187566,4.5,5.0,"He?s an awesome professor, but if you?re not willing to work hard don?t take his class. Readings can be long and often require serious thinking. Weekly essays are a challenge. Prof. Alexander expects a lot from his students, but if you put in the work you?ll get more out of his class than any other at UVA. Think about it."
12024,187566,2.0,3.0,Not a great lecturer.  Just go to section.  Fair grading.  Do the readings and you will be ok.
12025,187566,5.0,4.0,"Alexander is incredible! Fun guy, and great material. This course is reading intensive, but 6 2-page essays with exception of 15-page final are easy to get A- on. Word of caution, if you are Jewish, this course has material and students, that defend offensive theories of the Holocaust."
12026,187566,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher. Take his class. Lots of work, but worth it"
12027,187566,4.0,4.0,"Requires a well-thought argument and if you put time into papers, it works.  Not all readings are necessary, just those mentioned in class and TAs do expect a lot.  Overall, an interestign course but make sure you have the time to put into it."
12028,187566,4.5,5.0,"Hands down one of my favorite professors at UVA. I was impressed in lecture and even more impressed when I spoke with him outside of class. He absolutely does demand excellence from his students. I disagree that he refuses to change his viewpoint; the trick is that you have to have a valid and supported point. Take the class, be ready to work."
12029,187566,4.5,2.0,Really cares about the subject.  A great class but lots of readings.
12030,187566,1.0,5.0,DONT TAKE THIS CLASS! I dont know if he has high ratings or not but he is a horrible teacher. He only listens to his own opinions and if he doesn't agree with you you might as well throw in the towel. Essay assignments are hard. TA's grade hard. Class is uninteresting and has too many readings.
12031,187566,4.5,4.0,"Half of the readings are beyond the grasp of the average undergrad, while the other half seem to relate to the material only after careful explanation.  Lectures are interesting enough and extremely clear."
12032,187566,3.0,5.0,"Argued today, 15 minutes, why forming group study guide was like stealing music off Napster. Papers graded harshly by TAs. Very extensive tedious readings. Makes very few people chuckle. His minor lisp on G, CH, and SH comes from trying to speak too hard and fast. Bring a laptop and type fast. If you don't accept his ideology you might not do well."
12033,187566,4.0,5.0,"The readings are long and dense.  Reading responses are expected weekly on most of these readings.  Papers are short, but graded harshly.  Passionate lecturer, but speaks a mile per minute.  I went from typing 25-30 wpm to probably 35-40.  Proceed with caution..."
12034,187566,2.0,3.0,"The high recommendations for this guy are absolutely wrong.  I don't know anyone in my class this semester who thinks he is a good teacher.  Repeats himself way too much, gets way behind in the lecture schedule.  Readings are overly intellectual and there are way too many of them.  Unless you want to bang your head against a wall, don't take him."
12035,187566,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor!  Really engages students in the material.  A lot of reading but definitely doable.  Papers are short and graded harshly because he's looking for a very specific answer in them (but if he sees you improving over the semester he grades up!) Highly recommended!
12036,187566,3.5,3.0,"He is a very fast speaker, but his lectures help in clarifying the readings.  The readings are very long and extensive, but they are not all necessary.  The papers are not too difficult to write but are graded very harshly."
12037,187566,2.5,4.0,"It's true that he's a very energetic speaker. if by energetic you mean it sounds like the man is running on doses of speed at all times... he speaks faster than you'll be able to write unless you bring your laptop with you. EXTENSIVE reading. Essays are graded harshly, beware."
12038,187566,1.5,3.0,signs off on paperwork - but not helpfull as an adviser...
12039,187566,4.5,3.0,"Really excited and interesting teacher. Makes politics come alive. Cracks jokes, runs around, bashes France now and then. There is a lot of reading but its not all necessary. His papers are kind of hard but they dont take a lot of time and he is available to help."

12041,187566,5.0,4.0,Very riviting teacher
12042,187566,5.0,4.0,He rawks.  Very energetic and gets you motivated
12043,187566,5.0,4.0,"He is an amazing professor.  Always willing to help sutdents out, funny lectures, really smart man... take his class!!"
12044,187566,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor who is extremely clear and knowledgable.  His class is actually fun to go to and is never boring.  Be prepared to work really hard on the 2 essays during the semester.
12045,187566,4.5,3.0,"LOVE this guy.  He's my advisor (chose him after I took this class).  He's great - interesting, knows his stuff, awesome, highly reccomended!"

12047,187566,5.0,2.0,"Politics of Advanced Industrialized Nations. Good course, funny guy, knows his stuff, energetic. Boo-ya."
12048,187566,3.5,4.0,"Funny, only 2 papers, graded by the TA so get a good TA, European politics rocks my world, I kind of want to have Thatchers babies. Take the class, FOOL"
12049,187566,3.5,3.0,"Also took GFCP/PLCP 311.  A somewhat aloof guy, but he knows his stuff.  Doesn't require too much writing for these courses."
12050,949423,4.5,4.0,"Definitely my favorite and best professor. He is incredibly interested in the subject and very enthusiastic about the students' thoughts. He often becomes facsinated by what someone says. A bit scatterbrained and open to whim, he care very deeply about every decision made and is a very fair grader who puts forth a huge amount of extra effort."
12051,949423,4.5,2.0,Possibly my favorite professor at UVA.  Incredible nice and interested in his students well being.  Loved my writing and gave me great grades.  Also looks like ben linus from lost.
12052,949423,3.0,2.0,He was a pretty cool guy
12053,949423,5.0,2.0,"Trust me, he is the best STS professor ever!!!! My English Sux, but I still like his class. He is so polite and nice to everybody"
12054,949423,4.5,3.0,Awesome teacher a little awkward at first but very funny and very interested in the stuff he teachers.  Probably one of my favorite teachers so far and probably far better than any other STS teacher.. go see him at his office hours and he will really help you with your papers!!!
12055,949423,5.0,3.0,Dougie is one of the best teachers at UVA! His comments in class are interesting and he keeps you involved in every subject topic he presents.  P.S. add him as a Facebook friend.
12056,949423,5.0,5.0,"Doug Jerolimov is a saint. Him and Fulgham are by far my favorite professors at UVA so far. Make sure you read your articles before so that you can participate (huge portion of your grade, 20 percent). His discussions about engineering topics and purposes are really intriguing and help show what exactly engineers do. He is really funny also."
12057,949423,5.0,3.0,"DEFINITELY the most well-rounded STS Professor. Laid back, helpful, interesting, and knowledgeable . Keeps the course focus and the main ideas behind the readings in plain view. The readings can get large, but the papers aren't too bad. Grades fairly, and likes to help you if you're struggling. His &quot;awkwardness&quot; and jokes keep the class entertained"
12058,949423,4.0,3.0,"Best STS 101 professor. The workload is the same for everyone but Doug's class is slightly easier, and he really gets the points across in the discussions. Sometimes the readings are a little much but you don't have to read all of them (just hope he doesn't call on you). He's an awkward guy, but a nice guy."
12059,949423,4.0,4.0,"Absolutely an awesome and extremely entertaining teacher!  Makes a boring class comical and fun.  There are a lot of readings and papers to write, but it's all manageable."
12060,949423,2.0,5.0,Absolute disaster of a course.  Heavily structured style leads to closed minded discussions.  Avoid like the plague.
12061,949423,4.0,3.0,Jerolimov isn't a great public speaker but a fairly nice guy and helps you out whenever he can.
12062,2563247,4.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed her class, but found it difficult to get an A (ended up with an A-). I enjoyed going to class and reading more than I have for any other English class. Book selections are good"
12063,523446,5.0,3.0,"Opere has been teaching Spanish for a while and is very good at it. She always makes class discussions actually interactive and is very friendly! Grade in this class mostly comes from 3 exams and 3 papers. There is less annoying busy work in 3010 than other classes, although there are readings most days. Gives good essay feedback."
12064,523446,4.5,2.0,"I switched into Alicias class at the beginning of the semester, and I'm glad I did! Alicia is an amazing professor I would take her class again if I could. Beware though do the readings because she does notice if you participate or not. Other than that its a pretty easy class as long as you do the work and pay attention in class. "
12065,523446,4.5,3.0,Good for 330! I've heard other teachers were much harder.  Alicia made the class fun and interesting (though I like literature) and is helpful outside of class.  She has a spanish accent but is easy to understand
12066,523446,4.5,2.0,she is great !!
12067,523446,4.0,1.0,"Really nice teacher, really easy class.  She's from Spain, so she really can teach you a lot of random but useful spanish."
12068,523446,3.0,3.0,"makes learning spanish really easy.however, she can be really condescending and gets mad when people don't participate in class."
12069,523446,4.5,4.0,"ROUGH CLASS!!  Lots of busy work, and she tears up your grammar like none other.  She is a great teacher though who wants to help.  As a suggestion:  only take a morning class with her if you are a morning person...she doesn't like a lack of participation--AT ALL!!"
12070,523446,5.0,4.0,No Comments
12071,2727096,4.0,2.0,Class is not too bad as long as you stay on top of your work. 1000 point system and in some cases points can be taken away for weird reasons or even no reason at all. The test is solely memorization and there are some instances of oddly specific questions. Attendance is taken for a grade each day as well. Do the work and you should get an A.
12072,2727096,3.0,4.0,"Professor Hoopes had really interesting lectures but gave SO much homework to the point that it felt unnecessary. Very little feedback was provided on the assignments, and so often there was no way to know why you didn't receive an A. Tests often focused on random details, so make sure you pay attention in lecture and takes good notes."
12073,2727096,3.0,3.0,"This class is pretty straightforward. As long as you attend lecture, do the homework assignments, and prepare for exams its a pretty easy A. There is a lot of busy work but it is nothing challenging. The homework assignments and in class assignments can seem pointless, but it definitely gives you the opportunity to boost your grade in the course."
12074,2727096,1.0,4.0,"I hated this class and Professor Hoopes was horrible. I say suck it up and take it if you are Pre-Comm, but if you aren't sure about Comm don't take the class. Hoopes is horrible and her tests are very hard and focus on small, irrelevant details. She gives a lot of homework and is a very tough grader with no explanation for the grade."
12075,7353,5.0,4.0,"Terrific professor, a real scholar AND teacher."
12076,7353,3.0,2.0,"Genuinely nice guy, very helpful!"
12077,7353,5.0,3.0,"He is a great teacher, brings his dog Chico to class (adorable)  He is a great guy who really is concerned with the fact that your Spanish improves.  Tough but makes sure no one falls between the cracks"
12078,7353,4.0,3.0,"I have never felt more ambiguous about a human being in my life. He can be nice, but be prepared to have your intelligence insulted on a daily basis. oh and try really hard not to laugh when he teaches you words for arrogant because he'll be describing himself. Otherwise, great guy!"
12079,7353,5.0,5.0,"His Larra class is a ton of reading, and you will learn about Larra for sure. Gies's enthusiasm is inspiring, but there should be a limit on how much students teach. He is paid to teach grad students, not mediate our conversations. He basically stops teaching after week 2. He grades final papers fairly and will work with you."
12080,7353,3.0,3.0,"Nice guy, great class, yet disorganized.  I feel like my Spanish is better, yet I was frustrated with feeling lost with his expectations."
12081,7353,5.0,3.0,"A great class, all spanish majors should try to take it at some point.  However, don't take it if your command of Spanish is bad or if you are a sensitive person, because he is tough and will constantly critique you.  Great guy though, has everyone over to his house for dinner."
12082,7353,5.0,3.0,amazing!
12083,7353,3.0,1.0,"This class was the easiest, and most superficial.  If you want not to work at all, take his cinema class."

12085,1170618,1.0,4.0,Do not take a class with Professor Gordon unless you must. She is disorganized and unfocus both in lecture and in her assignments. I feel like I didn't learn much in this class. Assignments were consistently confusing and unclear. The class had a 'chill vibe' to it but the assignments were anything but chill. Left me frustrated and disappointed. 
12086,1170618,1.0,5.0,"I was not impressed with the academic aptitude or regard for student progress, compared to others on campus"
12087,1170618,2.5,3.0,"disorganized.  assignments and due dates not always clear.  Prof appears to be incredibly knowledgable, but the best practitioners and scholars don't always make for the best teachers- two different skill sets.  Personally, she is very nice, but I felt the material was WAY too scattered for such a high level course.  Material should be more focused"
12088,1170618,1.5,2.0,"ay ay ay.... She admits pridefully attending a college where there were neither tests nor grades... this is who's making my exam!&#63;!... runs powerpoint slides containing no real information... i only did well in the class by reading unassigned parts of the book, and lots of help from wikipedia..."
12089,1170618,2.0,3.0,Disorganized and fairly useless lectures. She never started class on time and wasted a lot of my time with &quot;musician&quot; guests and rambling recaps of pages of the text. Save your time and money and just buy the book and CDs -- I learned way more from those than anything else in the class. Don't think I would recommend this one.
12090,1170618,1.5,4.0,"gordon meanders through the subject aimlessly. the curriculum is unfocused, and she likes to subvert the course to talk about female musicians - sure, they're important, but she spends a third of the time on the subject, leaving composers like brahm and tchaikovsky untouched. also, she likes to test the most obscure stuff. be warned."
12091,498875,2.0,3.0,"It is a useful class and provides many useful information that would help when making financial decisions. However, I never felt comfortable approaching her for questions. She had the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid when you have no reason to be."
12092,498875,4.0,2.0,"She is very rude and condescending, but overall the content learned in class is useful. The final is very lengthy. Beware of her attitude and mandatory attendance of this 8AM class."
12093,498875,4.0,2.0,She is rude as people mention but I think it is more a cultural thing. She really is a nice woman if you talk to her one-on-one but I don't think she knows that she is like that. Final exam is not on memorization but on learning how to calculate things that you would need later in life. So pertinent to life!  MUST TAKE!
12094,498875,1.5,1.0,"Not only was this class boring and pretty useless, but if that didn't make me not want to show up to class, Professor Bonding was rude and routinely mocked students after she cold called them to answer questions in class.  If you know ANYTHING about finance (like what a credit card is), you know too much to take this class."
12095,498875,4.5,2.0,Prof Bonding is a fiery lady who teaches as here second job and is a personal finance consultant as her main job. While sometimes a bit &quot;rude&quot; the stuff she teaches will help you soooo much down the road. Attendance is required which is the only down side since it is an 8am
12096,498875,3.0,1.0,Extremely overrated.  Bonding is unpleasant and unapproachable.  The midterm was mostly memorization and just plain silly.  I could have learned just as much reading a good finance book.  I wish I had never taken it; NOT worth getting up at 7:30 twice a week.
12097,498875,5.0,2.0,"I recommend this class to everyone at UVA.  Regardless of you major; Bonding teaches what everyone needs to know.  She is exciting, and you look forward to her class."
12098,498875,5.0,1.0,This class is so helpful for the future and gives real insight into financial planing.  You would be stupid not to take advantage of this class.
12099,498875,4.5,3.0,badass
12100,498875,5.0,2.0,"great teacher - it is worth waking up at 8am, i promise (and i'm the guy who slept through a ton of classes during my four years)"
12101,498875,4.5,3.0,"Always an 8a.m. and can get boring, but will actually teach you something you can use beyond your 4 years of school.  Average grade is an 89."
12102,1465533,4.0,3.0,"Very enthusiastic about her course materials, discussions were interactive and a comfortable setting. Professor Goff really knows what she's talking about, and will help you out if you ask. Not an easy grader, but if you do what she asks you can do well. If you're interested in American Studies, take a class with her!"
12103,1465533,4.0,3.0,"Pretty interesting class. Readings can be heavy at times, but manageable. Most of class is just discussion and your grade is primarily papers and the final. Goff is passionate about the class and welcomes accounts of personal experience and real life examples that relate to class topics."
12104,2153678,4.0,2.0,He is very laid back and lets the students take charge a lot. The class mostly consists of group projects. Only drawback is there are hardly any grades and he takes months to grade the few assignments you actually do. The semester is almost over and I have zero graded assignments handed back and am still clueless as to what my grade in the class is
12105,2153678,5.0,3.0,"Lawrence is an old goofball. Definitely one of my favorite professors in the BME department. Knows his stuff, but is still interested in learning from his students. Grades fairly and makes his exams based off his ppt slides. Not an easy A if you don't have any material science background, but not a hard course. Highly recommend as a BME elective."
12106,1531091,5.0,1.0,I absolutely loved taking Calculus from Jameson. He was incredibly helpful and was always there during his office hours. This was by far my easiest class of the semester and I attribute that to him. Just do all of the homework and prepare for the quizzes and your grade should be fine.
12107,1531091,4.5,3.0,"Mr. Graber did an admirable job of teaching Honors Calc 3, considering all that he had to deal with (cough, Sasha). His first few lectures were a drag, but he really shone once he started teaching multivariable calculus. He definitely has the potential to become a fantastic professor; he just needs a few more years of teaching experience."
12108,1531091,5.0,2.0,Mr. Graber is probably the fairest professor that I've ever had. He is very mindful of concerns that students have and is extremely willing to make changes accordingly. His priority is to make students understand the material; he doesn't want grades to be an issue.
12109,1531091,5.0,2.0,"Graber is the best! However, (and I know I'm hijacking the post), if Sasha aka Aleksandr is the TA, under no circumstances should you ever take this class.  But Graber is amazing!"
12110,1531091,5.0,3.0,Graber is a very fair professor who is clear in his lectures without being too dry and boring. Very likable because he is so nice and willing to help even the most reluctant math student.He also provides ample opportunities for the students to meet with him to work through problems and answer any questions. Great teacher!!!
12111,105684,1.0,4.0,"Be prepared to have an opinion, as long as it matches with hers, you will be fine"
12112,105684,2.5,3.0,"Mintz has a forceful manner in the classroom. Some find it abrasive. While many of her theories I think are nonsense, she has a point on some things. I would have preferred it if she allowed us to draw our own conclusions rather than trying to force her views on us. She can also be vague about directions."
12113,105684,3.5,4.0,"There's a line between constructive criticism and rudeness. Unfortunately she crosses that line more than any teacher should be comfortable doing, even if it is at the college level."
12114,105684,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Mintz is amazing. She knows EVERYTHING, her classes are fun and engaging, and she truly cares about her students. True, it might take a while to warm up to her (she can be quite intimidating), but if you act like a reasonable, mature adult in her class, she's not going to be mean to you. An amazing teacher."
12115,105684,4.0,3.0,"Doesn't mess around, honest, straight forward, presents all the tools of the trade and works to make sure you know all of them thoroughly before you pick and choose what's right for you in your future career. Can be sarcastic, but that's her sense of humor, learn to roll with it. A very in-depth course, very rewarding, but lots of work."
12116,105684,5.0,3.0,She's a wonderful person and teacher.
12117,105684,5.0,3.0,"This teacher is the reason that I stuck with the education program. Though she sometimes seems distracted, she will go out of her way to help you. She is also very knowledgable. (To comment on earlier ratings. College classrooms are NOT high school classrooms. The same models do not apply and students of this class should not expect them to.)"
12118,105684,1.0,2.0,"The worst professor I've ever had- lies on the syllabus, lies in class, is all-around horrendous. Expectations are vague, grading is arbitrary, and content is boring and completely useless. Stay away- take anybody you can to avoid her."
12119,105684,1.5,2.0,"Does not model the teaching methods she advocates in class (e.g. demands that teachers provide justifications for grading, but refuses to do the same).  Abrasive to students who disagree with her.  Brags about missing class for Mardi Gras.  Very knowledgeable, but occasionally rude, condescending and hostile.  An ironic classroom experience."
12120,105684,1.5,1.0,No Comments
12121,105684,1.0,3.0,"Absolutely the WORST teacher i've ever had in any setting. She is rude, and does everything one learns NOT to do in the classroom. frankly i don't know why she is teaching."
12122,105684,3.0,2.0,Rough around the edges but is extremely intelligent.  Seems to get upset with someone disagrees with her viewpoints.
12123,105684,1.0,1.0,worst professor I've ever had in numerous years of being in the classroom.  A model of What NOT to do maybe&#63;

12126,105683,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Railton is amazing. He lectures and runs the discussions. This means he listens and cares about what each and every student has to say about each book. It also means he grades your papers, not a TA. One of the best professors I have ever had. Take a class with him before you graduate!"
12127,105683,3.5,4.0,"This guy is really personable and he makes all of his students feel comfortable in a discussion setting. I learned a lot and if I missed reading for a day, it wasn't a huge deal as long as I caught up later. My lone complaint is that I saw him in office hours TWICE each time before turning in my papers and still got a B on them."
12128,105683,5.0,4.0,"This was a great class and this is a great professor. You can see his passion for his subject and he spreads it to his students as well. I truly enjoyed the class, though it was quite demanding. After all, it is an upper level seminar. I recommend taking a class with this man before you leave UVa."
12129,105683,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Railton is wonderful. His Faulkner class has changed the way I think and how I look at the world, especially the South. He is an amazing &quot;lecturer&quot; - he never needs to look at his notes, so keeps a very natural, interesting flow, but always has a direction and offers great insight. He lets you disagree and grades fairly and not-to-hard."
12130,105683,4.5,3.0,"I've taken both American Renaissance and Faulkner with him and they are both phenomenal classes.  His grading seems a little capricious as is natural for an English teacher, but he encourages every person to come talk to him about grades and papers and anything you want.  I am an English major because of this man.  Great guy, great teacher."
12131,105683,2.0,1.0,"Professor Railton was uneasy and insecure in his presentation. More often than not, he wanted the &quot;discussion&quot; to ratify his own somewhat hackneyed opinions on Twain, the subject of the class."
12132,105683,1.0,5.0,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! Totally unclear what his expectations are on the essays. Pushes his own agenda in class instead of letting students talk. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!
12133,105683,1.0,5.0,"When I went to talk to him after class, he acted like I was president of the Future Bank Robbers of America Club, and he's was going to be called to testify. My interest in Dreiser notwithstanding."
12134,105683,5.0,3.0,"wow! what an engaging lecturer. also, the small discussion setting was a great supplement to the lectures--Railton brilliantly facilitated them rather than dominated them. He's a very fair, almost too lenient grader, and he's very approachable. Not very much work for the given level of the class."
12135,105683,4.5,4.0,"The best thing about Railton was his application of literature to real life. As I near 40, the class I remember best was the day he explained how Freud felt we're the sum of the roles we play. In his Railton drawl and bow-tie, Stephen faced his young audience. &quot;You know,&quot; he confessed, &quot;when my family goes out of town, I forget who I am!&quot; Classic."
12136,105683,4.0,3.0,"This guy blew me away, showed up for lectures in a powder blue tux with puffy pirate shirt and a pipe and told us about making love to his wife on a beach and then segued into other ecstatic experiences in American Literature.  I'd never seen anything like him, before or since.  A dazzling speaker/just a great guy, been in love w/ am lit ever since"
12137,105683,5.0,3.0,"I'm so thrilled that I took Railton's class.  I learned so much about how to interpret texts and how to respect books and their authors.  As weird as that may sound, it makes sense once you take the class.  I had never enjoyed an English class at all before this one, and this was my favorite class of the semester."
12138,105683,5.0,2.0,"Took 3 classes that changed the whole way I thought about Lit. Absolutely incredible teacher, one of the best ever. If you have any interest in reading and life in general, you will like his classes."
12139,105683,1.0,5.0,"Wow...HORRIBLE teacher. Avoid him like the plague! Too much reading, no structure to class, &quot;discussion&quot; is just him obsessing over some small pt. in the text; if he doesn't agree with you then you're wrong. VERY unclear about what he wants for the essays. I love English but this class was the worst"
12140,105683,2.0,3.0,Bad.   ignores the themes of the texts and just pushes his own agenda.
12141,105683,5.0,4.0,"Enthusiastic, intelligent teacher who takes the time to listen to his students and make sure he understands their comments.  Class discussions are fun and he does a good job of encouraging students to contribute."
12142,105683,5.0,2.0,Very knowledgeable and well-prepared. Very good lecturer and very helpful during office hours. Concerned with his students doing well and understanding the material. One of the best professors I've had.
12143,105683,3.5,3.0,"good lectures, and helpful and friendly at office hours. what he wants on the essays is unclear (or maybe its the TAs grading), but all in all a good class"
12144,105683,5.0,4.0,Prof. Railton is a passionate teacher who wants students to get a lot out of his courses.  He is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful in facilitating discussions.  One of the best teachers I've ever had.
12145,105683,5.0,1.0,"Outstanding, lectures are insightful and not set in stone. Too bad the class is at 9 am. Keep up with the reading, listen and think, and write the essays...and you're set."
12146,105683,5.0,3.0,I had Railton for 3 classes as an undergrad.  Great lecturer: does not rely upon a yellowing outline; speaks very articulately; always draws a personal connection to the lit.  Very helpful & friendly when you visit him during office hours.  My fave prof.
12147,105683,3.0,3.0,So-so
12148,105683,4.5,3.0,"Great knowledge of subject matter, but was pretty uppity, no matter how many classes you had with him. He did liven things up, though."
12149,105683,4.5,3.0,"Very student-centered.  Laid back classroom atmosphere. Perhaps, a bit more arrogant and hard on students, than his outward appearance leads one to believe.  STILL a GREAT teacher."
12150,105683,2.5,3.0,"Funny, I can see SR being a great undergrad teacher, but as a grad prof. came across as arrogant and unhelpful. I made a point about Thoreau one time and he either intentionally or un- totally blew it off quite  publicly  ...obviously i never forgot! ;)"
12151,105683,5.0,3.0,The best teacher I have ever had.
12152,416986,5.0,3.0,This was a fantastic course on Book XI of Vergil's Aeneid. Professor Woodman is one of the smartest teachers I have ever had the pleasure of taking a course from. I whole-heartedly recommend him!
12153,416986,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Woodman is the best. He's so smart, and hilarious. Class was so fun. His outfits are amazing, and he's just adorable. Plus he curves his exams a lot, so everyone does fine. He's rad."
12154,416986,4.5,3.0,"Mr. Woodman really knows his stuff.  He's extremely helpful, and he's a great guy to boot.  Don't be afraid to ask questions, Mr. Woodman will do his best to answer.  His exams are generally short and straight forward, just make sure you do your translations.  His anecdotes are also top notch."
12155,416986,5.0,4.0,He's extremely nice!
12156,416986,4.5,3.0,No Comments
12157,416986,5.0,3.0,Mr. Woodman is the best teacher in the Classics department hands-down.
12158,416986,5.0,2.0,I love Woodman! What an awesome chap!
12159,416986,5.0,2.0,"Excellent teacher, extremely helpful!"
12160,2522331,1.0,3.0,The class was basically taught by TAs. She was absent quite often. The projects were pretty overkill a majority of the time. She's also a pretty unhelpful and incompetent advisor.
12161,2522331,1.0,4.0,"The worst professor EVER. Course: intro to engr, BME focus. Never teaches anything. Not an exaggeration. Brings in other people to teach and dips class. And these other people don't even teach relevant material. Grades based on what is never taught. Email her, she treats you like an idiot. Students have been to more classes than her."
12162,2563293,5.0,3.0,"Roger is fantastic. He is native French and only teaches at UVa for half of each school year, but when he is here you should try to take him. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of French-American history and literally has his own Wikipedia page. He grades tough but because of that his letter grade brackets are adjusted accordingly. Talk in class!"
12163,2563297,5.0,1.0,"Laura is from Murcia, Spain, and she loves to teach Spanish. Although UVa's Spanish department generally sucks, she is really good at doing her best to make it liveable. She fosters great class conversations and as long as you listen to what she tells you study, you will get a great grade. Very fun and nice person!"
12164,933091,1.0,3.0,"This class was a nightmare. Arbitrary, no technology allowed (though that's the future of Higher Ed!  No food allowed 4 this 3-hour grad class. More interested in publishing; has clear favorites. Treats doctoral students like Highschoolers: can't B trusted to do reading. Also Masters + undergrads in this class. DO NOT TAKE IF U DO NO NOT HAVE TO!"
12165,933091,4.5,3.0,Brilliant and very helpful. Equally a strong lecturer and discussion leader. Take her if possible.

12167,933091,4.5,2.0,"If given the choice, I would not want to take this class. However, as it is a required course, I really had no choice. The class was extremely confusing for me...until I went and spoke to the professor. She realizes the class isn't necessarily fun, but she's really helpful and willing to help. She's also brilliant and organized."
12168,933091,3.5,1.0,really easy class. lecture is pretty boring and can be confusing. overall not bad
12169,1776872,5.0,2.0,"David Corlett is a great instructor. He sets very clear expectations and he uses a lot of multimedia to keep things interesting. He has a great sense of humor and does everything he can to help his students succeed. If I have the opportunity, I would take another one of his classes. Sign up for his class, you will be glad you did!"
12170,2252012,5.0,4.0,"Professor Sackett was an amazing professor, but the class itself seems impossible. I didn't survive any of the assignments without working with my classmates or going to office hours. He is so patient and understanding, so go to office hours. He will spend as much time with you as needed and never judges. Workload is insane."
12171,2252012,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Sackett delivered a well organized lecture series in Statistical Mechanics.  His delivery was engaging and easy to follow.  His homework assignments were challenging, but not impossible to do in the time allotted.  He is very willing to help outside of class and responds quickly to emails.  I enjoyed his class!"
12172,998638,5.0,1.0,"Dr.Kirchgessner was the perfect professor for Intro to Nursing. He brought so many people in to speak from various aspects of the nursing fields, all of which are very interesting. Class is great when he teaches as well- great stories and nice guy. Readings were boring but are helpful when read. =)"
12173,998638,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Kirchgessner gives interesting lectures, and has a lot of good guest speakers.  He's also very helpful with the final paper/project."
12174,998638,3.5,1.0,"Mr. Kirchgessner is a good teacher. He has many guest speakers come in and talk to the class about various nursing fields. There is a big class project, but it is not that bad.  The worst part is the timing of the class, especially on Fridays because attendance is a factor in grading."

12178,269560,2.0,3.0,He's aight. He is better than Guler. Makes easier exams as well. But the course is just still not much better with him compared to Guler. Be prepared to do most studying on your own in this 400+ student lecture. I don't get the hype. He prefaces what he teaches with too many warnings/notes and it gets annoying.
12179,269560,5.0,2.0,"Professor Taylor is an amazing instructor who gives engaging lectures and makes the science content accessible to everyone (he even relates many topics back to UVA). One of my favorite professors. Your grade is composed of clearly worded, fairly graded multiple choice tests, a few easy homework assignments, and a group paper. Highly recommend"
12180,269560,5.0,2.0,Professor Doug is one of the sweetest professors ever. He genuinely cares about students and their feedback. highly recommend taking a course taught by him!
12181,269560,5.0,1.0,Love him to death
12182,269560,5.0,2.0,"Good guy, good professor. I took 'The DNA Revolution' and it was my favorite class all semester. Two weekly lectures (which are super interesting), no readings, almost no homework. Class grade is based on 3 (multiple choice) tests and a 2000 word paper (group project). He is also very caring, accessible, and open to feedback."
12183,269560,4.0,2.0,"It's clear that Prof Taylor really cares about the subject and his students. The material is really clear and not hard to grasp because it's designed for non-majors and he always keeps that in mind. He tries to make things fair by giving back points, which is good because sometimes his test questions are confusing."
12184,269560,3.0,3.0,"He's a fine professor, but his exams didn't represent what we learned during the lectures. Therefore, the tests were very difficult. I will say that Doug tries very hard to retain the interest of the class. He often asks for feedback and surveys the class' engagement. I think that makes him a good professor, but the tests made me dislike the class."
12185,269560,1.0,4.0,.....
12186,269560,4.5,2.0,Great professor. Really seemed to care about his students. GO TO OFFICE HOURS- he was more clear there than in class. I liked him the best of the 3 core profs.
12187,269560,2.5,3.0,"The best of the three profs for the 302 section. Tends to talk fast, so it is best to record the class on audio. Tries really hard to make fair questions, but the wording on the tests can be tricky. Really enthusiastic about the material!"

12189,1113337,3.0,4.0,"He is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet and he means well, but he is not great at teaching calculus. He seems perhaps too smart, like a juggernaut of calculations- he starts an example and finishes it without explaining the steps, so it is easy to get lost. Personally, I would want Mr. Wells as a grandpa, not as a lower level math teacher."
12190,1113337,1.0,4.0,He doesn't know what he's talking about and needs about 4-5 students to catch his errors per problem.  His class has no order: his lectures are two weeks ahead of the homework and the quizzes are two weeks behind.  He also uses phrases that have not been used since 1954.
12191,1113337,1.0,5.0,"Don't bother getting help from him, he doesn't know what he's doing.  He makes mistakes and then when someone catches it he tries to tell them they're wrong.  HW IS mandatory even on weeks of tests.  Also during weeks of tests you will still be given the weekly quiz!! He will not let you redo a quiz or a test or turn in late work."
12192,1113337,3.0,2.0,"Pretty good prof, but moves fast and can be unclear at times. Class lets out early quite often which is nice, and homework is not mandatory, which is awesome, it really lessens your workload."
12193,1391869,4.5,3.0,"Kátia is an amazing teacher. She really cares about her students and is very knowledgable about the subjects she teaches. I highly recommend taking her class. It won't be necessarily easy, but if you put work in you will learn a lot about Spanish culture."
12194,1391869,5.0,2.0,"Katia is great. On the first day I was nervous about being expected to speak Spanish all the time, but she actually frequently speaks English to enunciate her points and make sure everyone is on the same page. She's incredibly smart and I'm so glad to have had her as a teacher."
12195,1391869,5.0,3.0,"Katia is amazing. She not only helped me improve my spanish writing skills, but the class is almost like a literature course -- she has interesting perspectives on the readings that you would not be able to understand from reading by yourself. She's really nice and really smart."
12196,1391869,1.5,3.0,"Ms. Sherman knows her stuff but her teaching is unhelpful. She speaks spanish too rapidly which makes it hard to grasp 70% of spoken words. She follows brief, poorly taught concepts with fast-pace examples. self-checking resources is slim to none. Plus she interrupts students and corrects wrongly spoken spanish words constantly. totally unhelpful."
12197,1211659,4.0,4.0,"Perederin is a tough TA: she presses hard for critical thought in discussion, and demands intensive work on essays. It's tough, but if you're willing to participate critically in discussions and work hard on essays, the class can be both though-inspiring and beneficial to your writing technique."
12198,1211659,2.0,3.0,I do not recommend taking this class.  She gives you useless work and never clearly answers questions.
12199,1211659,3.0,5.0,Painful discussion section. I LOVE Shakespeare but I could barely get myself to go to this discussion because it's never fun. She manages to make me and everyone else feel like an idiot no matter how well thought out our comments are in section.
12200,1211659,2.0,3.0,"The topic itself is really interesting. Compared to other ENWR teachers she is somewhat hard, but if you just try you can end up with at least an A-.  The way she expects you to write is sometimes hard to understand but it is very specific. Overall not that bad of a teacher. She gives quizzes on the readings sometimes too."
12201,1211659,5.0,2.0,I learned a lot.

12203,1211659,2.0,4.0,She teaches Love and Marriage for ENWR 110. I thought that the class would be interesting but she makes it so boring and useless. Very hard compared to other ENWR's offered. There are four papers and she is obsessed with reasons and evidence. By the third class you sort of just want to give up. Dont recommend it
12204,482589,5.0,2.0,Loved this class.  Learned a lot in Latin that I had lost in high school.
12205,482589,3.5,2.0,She's spunky  and clear
12206,482589,4.0,2.0,"Prof. C. is wonderful. She's funny and friendly. She loves to go on interesting tangents about her dog, Roman festivals and Classics events. Rest assured, she still stays on target. It's a great class. I recommend everyone who is in need of a fun, interesting and meaningful class to take it! :)"
12207,482589,4.0,4.0,"Hard class, I wouldn't advise taking Latin if you're not good with languages. Take French or Spanish to meet college reqs. Class basically depends on which TA is the best and if you have that TA."
12208,482589,4.5,3.0,"Crawford is the coolest person. Very easy to understand if you pay attention. Always do the homework it is a free 10 points! Lots of small quizzes, and 3 one hour long tests. Really knows her stuff and is very helpful, but expects you to try. Definately take this class!"
12209,482589,4.5,4.0,funny
12210,482589,3.0,4.0,"A seminar class with her was hell.She must have thought that we all regarded are GPAs as jokes, because the midterm was so ridiculous that maybe three kids finished it-and her response was &quot;if you don't like your grade, make it up somehow.&quot; She could also make unconstructive and downright rude comments during class discussion."
12211,482589,5.0,3.0,"You HAVE to take at least a thousand classes with Prof Crawford. She's hilarious and adorable and brings cookies and muffins to class sometimes. At least an hour of work a night, but if you put that much into it, the quizzes and tests will be very easy. Plus, I mean, this is a language...what were you expecting&#63;"
12212,482589,4.0,3.0,"I started college when she came to uva and even in her first semester here, she just got it! awesome teacher, awesome person...she wrote me a nursing school recommendation and it was by far the best in my batch!  get to know her!  shes a really nice lady and great teacher who loves classics"
12213,482589,5.0,1.0,"This class was awesome. You learn something interesting every lecture, and Prof. Crawford is always so full of energy. Quizzes and tests are easy if you put in a consistent level of hard work throughout the semester. Expect to do about an hour a day of Latin in order to do well. A bonus of the class is you get cookies on Roman and Greek holidays:)"
12214,482589,5.0,3.0,She is my sunshine.
12215,482589,5.0,3.0,HILARIOUS! her sense of humour rox my sox
12216,482589,4.5,3.0,"She did a great job with our intro level latin class. She's also hilarious, I would recommend her."
12217,482589,5.0,3.0,She is awesome--and absolute blast. You will love her jokes and cheer from day one.
12218,482589,4.0,2.0,She is a good teacher and is quite perky (which can get annoying since you have some form of Latin in the first level everyday!) but she is nice and definately wants her students to succeed. You've got to keep up with the class but that is how it is with any language!
12219,482589,5.0,2.0,"Professor that wants to see her students succeed. She provides so many points in the class that if you mess up a couple of times, it's just fine"
12220,482589,5.0,3.0,No Comments
12221,482589,5.0,1.0,Makes the class interesting and actually seems to care about engaging with students. Querky sense of humor makes having class everyday pass faster. Tests aren't bad either and she reschedules them around football games...which is amazing!!
12222,482589,5.0,3.0,"If you have the opportunity to take Age of Augustus with her, TAKE IT! She obviously knows exactly what she's talking about and communicates it clearly to the class.  She's a bit quirky, but in an interesting way! Her tests can be tricky, but she;sthe nicest prof you'll ever meet!"
12223,1883423,5.0,1.0,"I took Cola 1500 and I LOVED this class. She brings food to almost every class and both the readings and the homework are very interesting. There's an easy quiz before each class, if you have done the reading it's pretty simple. On the last day of class we went to a restaurant! Totally recommend her, she's one of my favourite professors"
12224,1883423,5.0,3.0,"Lisa's class was amazing! She is an excellent lecturer and is extremely knowledgeable. Discussions and lectures are so interesting you will want to go to class. If you aren't ready to do the reading, then don't take this class! Every day there is a short and super easy homework quiz (easy if you've done the reading!)."
12225,1883423,4.0,2.0,Shes very friendly and wants to have a relationship with you. I took her Food and Culture COLA and she brought food to class almost every week for everyone and took us on field trips to food festivals. Her readings are interesting and her quizzes on them are super easy. One of my favorite professors
12226,2284833,5.0,3.0,"Landis was a co-teacher for my class, and she was absolutely great, So sweet, passionate, and helpful. She also teaches very well and the way she thinks and explains her ideas is very helpful in understanding on a deeper level."
12227,2284833,5.0,3.0,"Landis is the most wonderful, sweet, and insightful woman Ive had the pleasure of learning from."
12228,2284833,5.0,3.0,"Landis is an incredible teacher. It's so clear through her discussion of poetry that she holds such a vast knowledge of the subject, and such a joy for it as well. She can answer any question, brings in countless outside examples to add to the discussion, asks thought-provoking questions, and gives excellent, specific feedback on poems. Love her!!!"
12229,2284834,3.0,4.0,"Michael is a really fun professor. He does a great job in getting you acquainted with poetry and elements of poetry, but he, by no means, is an easy teacher and he isn't always fair. Don't take this class unless you're good at poetry. Even if you put in a lot of effort, if you aren't a natural at poetry writing, be prepared to be disappointed."
12230,2284834,5.0,4.0,"Michael is one of the best/most inspirational professors I've had at UVA. His love for his subject is so urgent and visible that he makes every student want to feel what he feels for the words he is reading. Also, he is one of the best readers ever. Such a lovely voice. Gives extremely helpful feedback, is accessible, is an incredible human bean."
12231,56626,5.0,3.0,Professor Engers has a very strong Mathematics background and is able to explain Microeconomics using math applications. His lectures are very important and helpful. This class is one of my favorite classes at UVa.
12232,56626,4.5,4.0,"Material is challenging, but the curve is extremely generous.  He understands that the students taking 311 are those that would have gotten A's in 301, and grades accordingly.  If you have a serious interest in economics, this is a must-take class.  Tests are very notes-focused."
12233,56626,4.0,4.0,"Good class. Great professor. Very knowledgeable/ approachable. Material can be a challenge, but half the class gets an A/A-"
12234,56626,3.5,4.0,"Clear in class, unclear on tests.  Stay away if at all possible."
12235,56626,4.5,2.0,GAME THEORY.  DONKEY KONG FOREVER!
12236,56626,4.5,3.0,He's pretty hard. You have to know your stuff but he does make everything very clear in class. I personally liked him and will be taking his 401 class next semester.
12237,56626,1.5,3.0,No Comments
12238,56626,2.5,4.0,"I am sure he is extremely knowledgeable in his field, but his ability to teach this material is lacking. I'd like to echo the earlier comment of rude as well."
12239,56626,5.0,3.0,"very sharp guy, great 401 class"
12240,56626,4.5,4.0,"One word: AMAZING! I had him for econ 311 and 401. I think I learned more econ from him then from the other 6 econ classes that I have taken so far! You don't need to read the book, just listen in lecture and know your notes and you will do great!"
12241,56626,5.0,4.0,great teacher. my best econ teacher so far~
12242,56626,4.5,4.0,"Very thorough, great lectures, very insightful.  Loves theories of economics.  Very enthusiastic."
12243,56626,5.0,4.0,No Comments
12244,56626,4.0,5.0,"Hard but rewarding, both for one's education and the job market."
12245,56626,1.5,5.0,"Rude to students, takes himself and his subject way too seriously"
12246,56626,4.5,5.0,Good prof.  Killer problem sets and amazingly hard tests.
12247,1949005,5.0,2.0,Great professor who really cares about her students and makes an effort to get to know you! There was a good amount of reading for the class followed by a discussion post each class but overall a reasonable amount of work.
12248,1949005,5.0,2.0,"This class isn't exactly an easy A; you have to work for it.  That being said, Ann puts in a lot of effort to help and if you put in the work by reading and doing assignments in a reasonable amount of time, there's no reason why you shouldn't do well.  You should be prepared to read A LOT and write a discussion post for every class."
12249,1949005,5.0,3.0,"The previous rater was spot-on, as I have never met a professor who cares more about their students. Dr Mazur is fun, passionate, brilliant, and yet so down-to-earth and very easy to talk to. She also clearly puts a lot of time and energy into preparing for class discussions, and gives very helpful feedback on papers; she lives for her students! "
12250,1949005,5.0,2.0,"A truly great teacher who really cares about her students. Class consists of 3 papers and a presentation. For each paper you have to turn in a rough draft and she gives you feedback. For the final copy as long as your make her suggested changes you will get a good grade. She is very approachable, helpful and gives great comments on essays. "
12251,1998158,3.0,3.0,"Milov is cool, her lectures are somewhat difficult to follow, she moves quickly and sounds as if she's reading from a research paper. She assigns SO MUCH READING, but you do not have to do it all. You can get a B+ without doing any of the weekly readings. The TA Lauren is AWESOME but SUCH a hard grader, beware!!!"
12252,1998158,3.0,3.0,"Milov is a great modern professor. The grade was  only based on papers, however, she is so helpful throughout the whole process. If you go to office hours and ask for helpshow that you are trying, she will definitely provide you with great sources! Also, I worried about my participation grade but don't stress it as long as you try and prepare!  "
12253,2620770,5.0,2.0,"One of sweetest professors I've had. Had 1 hw assignment each week that was similar to codes and exps he taught that week (highly recommend taking good notes during lecs). We had 2 exams and a group final project (no final). He was a great lecturer, understands that most students have no prior knowledge of R, so he repeats concepts multiple times."
12254,2620770,5.0,3.0,"Honestly my favorite professor of college so far, and I'm not even interested in stats or programming. Also, he organized the class really well so I was able to follow along and understand everything. Just make sure to take good notes during lecture and you'll probably get a good grade."
12255,2620770,5.0,1.0,"Really kind, interesting anecdotes, and an interesting intro to statistics."
12256,2620770,5.0,3.0,Professor Afriyie is a very good professor. His class isnt too difficult. He is also very accessible and his exams arent too bad either.
12257,2620770,5.0,3.0,He is the best!
12258,2620770,5.0,1.0,"Professor Prince explained topics very clearly and made his lectures fun. Not much homework every week. Fair exams with only things he has covered. We had one group project, but he decomposed it with different parts due through out the semester so I didn't feel very stressed."
12259,482661,5.0,1.0,The best professor at McIntire period.
12260,482661,5.0,1.0,The most enthusiastic professor ever. She makes the material sound so lively and interesting with her passion for consulting. She has tremendous energy and such a positive attitude.
12261,482661,5.0,1.0,"Best teacher I've ever had. Super exciting lectures, funny stories, really great teacher. Take all her classes!"
12262,2178404,5.0,3.0,"Prof. White taught a very good class. Cares a lot about the subject, lectures clearly, and sometimes will make you laugh."
12263,2694515,3.0,4.0,"lectures are clear and organized, so are the readings. quiz before every class is overkill. everything is graded by the TAs who all have different guidelines. spent way more time decoding what the TAs wanted from the exams than I did going to lecture or reading. TAs handed out bad grades when there was obvious confusion and poor expectations"
12264,1154421,4.5,3.0,"Great professor.  Keeps the class engaged, and knows exactly how to get the students to think deeper about the issues discussed.  Highly reccomend this professor!"
12265,1154421,4.0,3.0,"very insightful, won't let class get too far to the right or the left, offers a more comprehensive view, lots and lots of reading, but it is used in seminar format"
12266,597370,5.0,1.0,"Nice guy, knows his stuff. Class was one group project aimed at developing a blast-proof vest for soldiers. He structured it like an actual real-world problem, gave us a chance to visit a lab and talk to experts. He treated us like adults and gave us necessary real-world experience. He really was a great professor. No tests, just lots of essays"
12267,597370,5.0,1.0,He wasn't bad
12268,597370,2.0,1.0,"He's a great guy and has interesting stories, but you never really know what you're supposed to be doing."
12269,597370,1.0,1.0,"Absolutely THE WORST professor I ever had. This class was really easy, but I practically wasted my time for this class, I learned nothing. Whenever I ask questions, he doesn't answer my questions but rather rambles on and on about something else. He's a really nice person, but being nice doesn't count. Don't take this class."
12270,597370,2.0,4.0,"He does spend LOTS of time deriving equations. He's a very nice guy though, and he is a bit more helpful/clear in office hours than he is in class. I actually have never heard him answer a question with a &quot;I dont know,&quot; so he may have improved a bit since 2005. The textbook was pretty bad, but we didn't use it that much."
12271,597370,1.5,4.0,"Spends way too much time deriving equations without explaining what the real meaning is or where it applies.  Gives no real world examples to make the class interesting.  Also, needs to be more prepared for class and not apologize for not being able to answer questions."
12272,597370,1.5,3.0,"He really needs to learn his stuff a little better, so he doesnt have to say &quot;i dont know&quot;.  He needs to be prepared for class, finish within the class time period, and check out the homework before he assigns it....."
12273,1121668,5.0,3.0,Professor Setear is awesome! He's hilarious and lectures were always interesting. He's a nice guy and I'd recommend just talking to him if you're having any problems during the course but it's not a difficult course! Just show up and engage.
12274,1121668,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, currently taking j-term with him, he is a very good lecturer and knows how to engage students in all kind of topics."
12275,1121668,5.0,3.0,"Took the J term class, found him very entertaining. Definitely has a good sense of humor, plus he rarely makes any topic for discussion boring. Lots of interesting random thoughts, which I think is indicative of his high IQ. Would recommend his class to those interested, I did not regret it and was able to make it out with a solid grade."
12276,1121668,4.5,3.0,"Anybody who spends some time with him quickly realizes he's a genius. While it's clear that he's bored as someone with his IQ would be, he reduces even the most difficult legal concepts into such basic 1-2-3 logic that you learn a lot very time efficiently.  He also creates his own books that read like casebooks and hornbooks so you save $. "
12277,1121668,5.0,4.0,"Professor Setear is  wonderful. He really cares for the students and really likes his job. Students can tell when a professor sees them as an ""inconvenience"" or a pleasure . Setear loves his students. He has a great sense of humor, very kind , and extremely smart. I would take all my classes with him if I could. Go Professor Setear!!!"
12278,1121668,5.0,3.0,All-star unconventional thinker who passes a love of holistic education on to those students fortunate enough to take his classes.
12279,1121668,5.0,3.0,"Great professor.  One of the very best UVa Law has to offer.  Tremendous energy, dedication to students.  Outside-the-box thinker with a quirky sense of humor."
12280,728456,1.0,3.0,Professor Demas is the worst professor I've had at UVA. The seminar is a complete waste of time. The instructions to his useless assignments are vague and unhelpful. I tried to contact him multiple times through email and even his office phone for clarification. He never got back to me and didn't give me credit although I redid it many times.
12281,728456,3.5,2.0,"While Professor Demas did not really teach this 1-credit seminar, he hosted a number of speakers on topics for chemistry majors, including lab safety, graduate school, and career opportunities. I thought most of the speakers he chose were excellent. The assignments he required for the class were fairly easy, but meaningful."
12282,728456,1.0,5.0,Will not help. Explains nothing. Would almost recommend changing majors if you're thinking about majoring in chemistry. Seriously.
12283,728456,1.5,4.0,"Gives way too many assignments (5 in one week!) and is completely unorganized and difficult to understand. Office hours are at 8 am, which makes him hard to reach. Labs are okay though, not too difficult."
12284,728456,1.5,4.0,Extremely unorganized and unapproachable.  Doesn’t usually know what’s going and will send out mass emails about corrections to labs that he’s been teaching for the last few year.
12285,728456,4.0,3.0,Guy is whip smart and passionate for getting the idea through. He can be hard to understand when introducing concepts because he is so advanced in his study. Big Bonus is that he was one of the rare professors who gave any thought to helping undergraduates. He actually gave me directions to his home so I could turn in my final exam a day late.
12286,728456,1.5,5.0,doesnt have office hours. Useless TAs

12288,728456,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher.  Nice, affable guy.  Knows his stuff and wants you to learn.  Big movie fanatic."
12289,466346,4.0,2.0,Professor Gertler does a great job of explaining philosophy in ways that are really easy to understand. She goes over topics again and again to reinforce her message. I found that the class was not very hard and did not require much time a week- maybe 3 hours a week at most unless there was a paper due (there were 3). Grading was not too harsh.
12290,466346,3.0,3.0,"Gertler is highly knowledgeable about the material and the course only features 3 essays and a final. The main issue is that your TA decides your grade, and each of them grades differently. As long as you are okay with that, the class will stretch your mind and serve as a good intro to Philosophy"
12291,466346,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed this course. The lectures were clear and interesting if you have any interest, but you must attend because she will not post anything. There is reading for almost every class but it is usually less than 10 pages and she explains it in class. There are two tests and two papers. Overall the class is fair and makes Phil accesible."
12292,466346,2.0,3.0,"I cannot understand how Gertler has received all of these positive ratings. She refuses to respond to objections or to encourage anything but blatant repetition of her views. She does not explain her expectations for papers or her short summaries. She is largely unhelpful, even rude in responding to questions as well. Take Metaphysics instead."
12293,466346,5.0,3.0,Very interesting subject. Great professor; explains concepts extremely clearly and raises questions that really make you think. Helpful in office hours and with paper. Readings are easy to read and structure the class well. Highly recommend both class and professor.
12294,466346,4.0,4.0,"As previously stated, attending class is pretty important: Gertler is intent on not posting her slides online. Overall, she attempts to cover too many topics, but then again, it was an introductory course. She's truly interested in engaging students in discussion and has her pupils' best interest at heart."
12295,466346,5.0,2.0,"SHE IS AWESOME! Very clear, emphasizes the most integral points of various philosophical views. I hardly came to class or did the readings and still got a B+ (if I'd atteneded more, I'd have gotten an A, and I really wish I had gone to more)THIS CLASS MADE ME DECLARE A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR. Absolute best class I've taken :)"
12296,466346,2.5,4.0,Boring class that attempts to cover way too many different topics. Its important to go to lecture to take notes b/c slides are not posted on the internet. Midterm and final are primarily essay and IDs; all essay choices are given in advance. Grade in class depends on the TA you get; mine was very hard. I wouldn't take this class again.
12297,466346,3.0,3.0,"Class was rather boring. What's important is impressing your TA. The readings were interesting, but in class Gertler just confused me."
12298,466346,2.0,2.0,This class bored me to death. Gertler doesn't help much.
12299,466346,4.5,2.0,"Very knowledgeable, willing to help, easy to follow during lecture, and invites discussion."
12300,466346,3.0,1.0,"The class is really easy, but it can be pretty boring if you, midway through the semester, realize you don't like philosophy. But nonetheless, she's a good professor and really knows her stuff."
12301,466346,4.5,2.0,One of the best lecturers I've had at UVA! I was never bored during class because she could keep my attention the whole 50 minutes. The tests and essays are cake if you take good notes. The readings are optional if you come to class because she sums up everything important. Do no hesitate to sign up for a class with Gertler- she is amazing.
12302,466346,3.0,2.0,"This class was really annoying to me, mainly because I realized I don't like philosophy... but you MUST go to lecture or get someone to send you the notes because that is what the only two tests are based on and she doesn't post slides online. if you have the notes, it's easy though."
12303,466346,4.5,2.0,"I found this class very interesting.  Good introduction to philosophy.  Brie goes over everything in the book so reading is completely unnecessary if you attend lecture.  grades based on 2 papers, midterm, and final (both essay-style).  Easy and enjoyable."
12304,466346,4.0,3.0,brie gertler is a wonderful orator who really knows her stuff - this class is very abstract but if you internalize the readings lecture is very rewarding and fascinating. this was my favorite class fall semester! if you are into philosophy you will probably enjoy it.
12305,466346,2.0,2.0,"This class was incredibly boring. Either do the reading or go to lecture; doing both was a waste of time. Discussion section was a string of awkward silences and repeating what Professor Gertler had already said five times during lecture. Her examples are helpful and she knows her stuff, but this class went painfully slow."
12306,466346,4.5,3.0,"She is a great prof, really knows the material. That said, the material is boring and the TA was horrible: he was very knowledgeable but couldn't teach it. I don't want to blame him but my grade would be better if he was more engaging. I thought I liked philosophy and the prof is amazing. VERY correct about the second part. :-)"
12307,466346,2.5,3.0,"this class was really boring! she's really repetitive and the material is quite dull unless you really understand the topic- tests were ok...but graded by the TA who knows alot but cant teach it well- discussions were boring- i never participated. overall, dont take this class if you dont have to"
12308,466346,5.0,4.0,"Wonderful, engaging professor. She is passionate about philosophy and makes an interesting subject even better. Highly recommended."
12309,466346,3.5,2.0,"Easy class, very boring.  Its a good idea to go to lecture once every two weeks or so because you only need to attend one lecture to write each paper.  She is a jerk however.  She will call students out in class for reading a paper or slipping out a few minutes early.  And she seems to need the IT guy's help for every other class."
12310,466346,4.5,3.0,"Professor Gertler REALLY knows her stuff - she explains very well, never overloads the students, and has a genuine passion and interest in philosophy. Be careful of which TA you get though, they can ruin the class for you ..."
12311,466346,3.5,2.0,"very repetitive, but that just allows for better understanding of material. Exams and papers pretty easy. As long as you come to classes and take notes, not a hard class and pretty interesting as well"
12312,466346,2.5,3.0,i hated this class! dont take it unless youre absolutely interested in philosophy bc it sucked. very boring & hard to stay awake in class. readings were extremely long & difficult to understand.she goes thru the lectures EXTREMELY fast & hard to understand too. only grades are 3 essays & essay final
12313,466346,4.5,3.0,"Very good teacher, very clear and precise."

12317,753110,4.5,4.0,"This class is hard, I took it as a first year which I would not recommend. However, McCurdy is extremely talented -- for such a dense topic, somehow his lectures aren't boring and he brings in such interesting details. He just might be the smartest person at the university."
12318,753110,4.5,5.0,"GREAT class. Very challenging, but an A is doable. Class attendance and reading is a necessity!! McCurdy is one of the best professors at this university!"
12319,753110,4.5,5.0,"This class is EXHAUSTING but it is a wild and exciting ride.  McCurdy speaks faster than any professor I've had, but it has been well worth the extra effort to hear his thoughts on the subject.  Just don't miss a lecture, or you'll be kicking yourself for the rest of the semester!"
12320,753110,4.5,4.0,"Amazing professor. He has the almost surreal ability to take something as convoluted as American legal history and turn it into an incredibly engaging narrative. Never miss a class if you want to dream of getting a decent grade, and bring a laptop because he goes lightning-fast. Regardless, class is worth it if you have even the slightest interest."
12321,753110,4.0,5.0,"This is the hardest class I have had at the University, but also quite possibly the most interesting.  There is a LOT of work and reading but it is fascinating material and the professor and TA's do a GREAT job explaining it--I highly recommend this class for anyone with any interest in law and/or US History, but be ready to work!"
12322,753110,4.5,4.0,"McCurdy is an AMAZING professor.  This class is hard, a lot of work, a lot of reading; but if you do all the work and keep up, you'll do great.  The TAs are extremely helpful too.  Lectures aren't mandatory, but you need to go if you want to do well.  My favorite class at UVA so far."
12323,753110,2.5,4.0,I sometimes felt I had to be a courtroom typist to keep up with this man. But other than that he leads you on a very in-depth journey through American legal history. Be ready to read and discuss in sections since the TAs use cold calls. A great class if you want to work!
12324,753110,4.0,5.0,Highly recommend this class to anyone interested in American legal history. The class is not easy at all: There is an a great amount of reading (which you really should do) and lectures are mandatory (If you want to pass the class with a decdent grade). Professor McCurdy is really helpful and he has brilliant TAs to help you with the materials.
12325,753110,3.5,4.0,"Let me warn you this class has a lot of reading, and it is not that easy to do well in if you're trying to have a social life at the same time, this class is not that fun unless you really love law, you'll learn, but you'll work and whine the whole time."
12326,753110,4.0,4.0,"very interesting lectures, goes very fast and is sometimes hard to even take notes fast enough to keep up, but at least i have never been bored in his class! be careful, cause its really hard to miss a lecture though. overall highly recommended"
12327,753110,5.0,4.0,"Best professor I had at UVA.  Take the class-its hard, but its worth it."
12328,753110,5.0,4.0,"One of the best classes I've taken at UVA.  Challenging, but very interesting, and if you do the work you're definitely rewarded in the end. Professor McCurdy is top in his field, and a GREAT lecturer.  If you're even slightly interested in this class, TAKE IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT!"
12329,2268632,3.0,4.0,"He is a good professor. I took him for calc 3. He is definitely the most manageable professor. He wants you to succeed. His tests are straightfoward and very similar to the homework questions. Lectures can be kinda hard to follow, but that's b/c calc 3 is hard."
12330,2268632,3.0,4.0,"Nice guy with a sharp sense of humor. Nevertheless, I often found that the textbook was far more interesting and easier to understand than the lectures themselves. The concepts aren't too difficult to comprehend, but it's mostly up to you to figure them out on your own. Exams are pretty tough, but the only way to fail is to leave questions blank."
12331,2268632,3.0,5.0,"Funny guy, but lectures are so dry and plain that it is hard to comprehend even the most basic concepts in the class. As long as you do the homework and do &quot;well&quot; on the quizzes (you either get a 100% or a 0%), you'll be okay. Tests are much more harder than homework problems and trying to prepare is even tougher."
12332,2440667,5.0,2.0,"This was my favorite class I ever have taken at UVA. It is structured so well, the perfect balance between in class things, homework, and tests. Tests are presented in a very low stress manner, and the material is very interesting. Professor LeBaron is such a great lecturer and makes coming to class more fun than a chore."
12333,761314,5.0,3.0,One of the best teachers I've ever had.
12334,761314,5.0,1.0,She is a great fiction writing professor.  Her advice is spot on.  She creates a safe environment where writers can share their stories.  She is encouraging and very willing to meet outside of class to give story tips and advice.  She was extremely helpful and gives excellent feedback.  Not a tremendous amount of work.  Loved it.
12335,2653671,5.0,3.0,"I loved this course! Professor Al-Samman is incredibly intelligent and well-spoken, and she's also very nice. The class is discussion based, so you have to do the reading, but 90% of the books are really interesting and I would read them again. Your grade is based ONLY on the midterm and final papers, but she prepares you for them well."
12336,2653676,4.0,3.0,"Professor Laugelli is nice and his lectures are easy to follow. I thought the readings for the class were super interesting but the lectures and class discussions were kind of boring. There's tons of group project work, including for the final, so be ready for that. Overall, cool class, good guy."
12337,1785337,1.5,5.0,"Avoid at all costs.  No time in between assignments, so either you write the new essay without knowing how you did on the old- or you are stuck waiting the day before the new one is due... Not clear on what she wants, you will finally catch on at the end.  Do not take, even if the topic sounds cool."
12338,1785337,2.5,5.0,Do NOT take a class with this TA.  She has ridiculous expectations for papers and grades very harshly.  She is not helpful if you don't understand something and class is not interesting.
12339,2743804,1.0,4.0,"Worst professor I have had at UVA. When I had him last fall he would refuse to post lecture notes so if you missed class even for an emergency he would not share them. If you asked he'd instead say to ""ask a friend"". Class was not interesting.  He was not good at explaining the material, also not helpful or sympathetic to students. Don't take him."
12340,2743804,1.0,3.0,"How this guy became a professor is beyond me. He got mad at me for taking this class because I've taken a stats class before. THIS IS A REQUIREMENT FOR THE PSYCH MAJOR SO I NEED TO TAKE IT. Was never helpful during office hours, you're lucky if he even shows up. Reads straight off powerpoints during class and goes off topic a lot."
12341,2743804,1.0,4.0,"He should not be a professors. Doesn't respond to emails, cancel office hours at the last minute, doesn't provide and practice problems or resources for studying, and says something bad about UVA every class. Stay away from him."
12342,2743804,1.0,4.0,"Attendance is mandatory since he gives random quizzes for your participation grade (15%). He has fill in the blank notes/powerpoints and literally just reads them verbatim during class. Every time I've raised my hand and said I was confused and asked him to explain again, he read the slide again and made me feel dumb. Also rambles off topic a lot"
12343,2743804,1.0,3.0,He doesn't give ANY practice problems to study with despite the fact that this is a math class. He wouldn't let me see my past exams because it's his &quot;intellectual property&quot; and was not accommodating whatsoever when I had COVID. I obviously couldn't come to class so my participation grade tanked even though I had a legit reason.
12344,2743804,1.0,4.0,He is quite literally a mess. Also he never answers emails.
12345,2743804,1.0,4.0,"He is very disorganized. If you can, take this class with any other available professor."
12346,2743804,4.0,2.0,"very disorganized but u can cram the night before the exam and do fine, u don't have to pay attention in lectures u just have to complete fill in the blank notes and then teach yourself, also no hw and 85% of the grade is based on 4 exams then 15% is participation"
12347,2743804,5.0,3.0,"The professor makes the class as easy as possible for the students. It is clear that he truly wants to see us succeed. He makes an effort to answer any questions during class and also encourages office hours. The material is not tough to learn and tests are directly translated from the lectures. If you work for this class, you can do just fine."
12348,2743804,1.0,4.0,"As someone who usually struggles with math, I found this class VERY frustrating. Options for study materials are useless- he recommends you do the questions from the textbook, but the test questions look nothing like that. Lectures are posted incomplete and you can't see what test questions you got wrong because it's his &quot;intellectual property.&quot;"
12349,2743804,5.0,2.0,It is very clear that he wants everyone to pass his class. He basically makes the class idiot proof with fill in the blank notes. He is very clearly knowledgable and experienced in the field. Despite his effort students seemed to be very disrespectful towards him.
12350,2006533,5.0,1.0,"I really love Professor Donovan. He is so understanding and he will understand if you need an extra day or two to turn in your essays, just let him know beforehand. He doesn't grade harshly in my opinion, but even if he does, he allows you to rewrite essays to get a better grade and it does work. He's very caring a kind professor. Take his class. "
12351,2006533,5.0,3.0,"Prof Donovan is great. He truly wants you to have a takeaway from his class and become a better writer- to which I did. The class can be tedious in the topics you talk about, but he is still worth taking. You don't exactly know your grade throughout the semester, just a general idea w certain feedback. It really depends on your final portfolio."
12352,2006533,5.0,3.0,"Professor Donovan was a fantastic First Writing prof. Genuinely felt like he cared about every student in the class, and he was super receptive to whatever manner in which you wanted to approach an assignment. I took Contemplative Writing and would absolutely take his class again if I could. A fair amount of writing but it never felt like too much."
12353,2006533,5.0,3.0,I cant say enough about how caring Donovan is. His transfer ENWR class was truly inspirational and helped me learn so much about myself despite me not taking the class seriously at first. Theres a strong focus on revision and growing as a learner and the class isnt difficult in the traditional sense because theres so much freedom in the assignments
12354,2006533,4.0,4.0,"The class topic was Writing as Mindful Practice. It was a lot of BSing your way through the class at the beginning but less as it went on. Papers were interesting to write once you understood the prompt but fairly difficult to get to that point. If you're looking for an easy A for your First Writing Requirement, look elsewhere."
12355,2006533,5.0,3.0,His topics for his ENWRs are really applicable to every day life and writing - not super specific topics like some other ENWRs. Donovan really stresses discussion and making every student feel valued in class. Great guy who has a vision of how he wants his students to improve.
12356,2006533,2.0,4.0,"Prof. Donovan's class does provide inspirations for writing. However, if your intention of having a writing course is to fulfill requirement, I do not recommend you to take his course for the workload is heavy. Also, discussions are usually tedious and sometimes become arguments between two and three students."
12357,2006533,3.5,3.0,"He's a decent instructor. Could be worse. On the other hand, could be much better. Lectures are painfully boring at times. He's not very good at posting assignments at least three assignments were posted very late the night before they were due. Overall, I would stay away from him unless you really need a writing requirement."
12358,2006533,4.5,3.0,"Professor Donovan was awesome! He was very flexible and accommodating to what the class' needs were, and he was totally open to new ideas. He was very invested in us and wanted everyone to do well, and loved hearing about people's opinions. He was always prepared with new, interesting readers and is a great at paper feedback. Would recommend!"
12359,2006533,4.0,3.0,"Topic: The Art of Persuasion This class  will make you think. It isn't as easy as writing a boring and traditional English essay. He wants you to understand why you're arguing what you're arguing; why anyone should care.  Class discussions can be a bit hard to grasp, but they always tie back to how to authors can make an effective paper. "
12360,2375177,5.0,3.0,"I loved Leopold! He is super accessible outside of class and I highly recommend seeing him during office hours. There is a lot of homework, mainly to make sure you are doing the reading. The exams aren't too bad as long as you understand the basic concepts. Group projects and your DL are important, so make sure to focus a lot on the discussion!"
12361,2375177,5.0,3.0,"Professor Leopold always tries to create an enthusiastic, positive, and open environment. He is kind and patient when answering questions and fixing arising problems. Although there are some long readings, if you have good study skills, everything is realistic. He brings his experiences from Capital One and Circuit City City to enhance the course."
12362,2375177,4.0,4.0,Lots of homework and the multiple choice tests are hard! But he's a good lecturer and a really nice guy!
12363,2375177,3.0,3.0,"Professor Leopold is a great and knowledgable guy. It is clear, however, that he is over qualified for teaching an introductory commerce class. The lectures are hardly helpful as you can download the slides after class. I enjoyed the subject matter but a lot of the course's work seemed to be busy work"
12364,2375177,4.0,3.0,"Although some lectures seemed useless, Leopold is a very good prof. Gives lots of engaging stories and is really fun to talk to outside of class. The midterm is tricky and yes some questions are a bit annoying, but if you understand the concepts, do the homework/reading (which honestly is minimal compared to other classes), you'll be fine."
12365,2375177,1.0,4.0,"Super &quot;engaging&quot; but the second half of the syllabus was useless. In general he just loves testing in a way that hurts you because &quot;two answers&quot; seem almost identical. He loves the whole &quot;the most correct answer&quot; approach. Lots of questions were about the bio's of the guest speakers instead of actual content, its ridiculous. Don't take comm1800whim"
12366,2571795,1.0,3.0,"Guler is not good at communicating and really just throws material at us to understand on our own. He does have an accent but that's not the problem, it feels like he mumbles half the time. Genetics would be so much easier if the professors really taught the course better here. But be prepared to do the majority of studying on your own."
12367,2571795,1.0,5.0,A good and caring professor’s proudness “must be” interaction with his/her students not the asking out of context questions. 
12368,2203158,5.0,3.0,"one of my favorite profs ever. she's so nice and willing to help you with anything. she is a tough grader though- i thought this class was going to be an easy A but you really have to write well, do all the readings, and participate in class. we did a lot of fun movement experiences in the theaters which everybody seemed to enjoy."
12369,2203158,3.0,4.0,"Do not be fooled by this 1000 level Drama class. This professor makes you work and I would only recommend this class for people serious about the Dance minor. The few assignments we have are graded strictly and seriously for both content and form. Quite often, homework would consist of a 10+ page reading and a 30+ minute long dance piece."
12370,1433112,4.5,4.0,Lectures are impeccably organized and very interesting. Highly recommend taking if you have an interest in American history
12371,1662490,4.5,4.0,"Elizabeth is an awesome teacher. She's super quirky and really nice. That being said, she is a super hard grader. She doesn't necessarily recognize all the effort put in and just grades based off the papers alone. She's really picky but she will help your writing improve."
12372,1662490,4.0,4.0,"The biggest thing about this teacher is that she was a hard grader. You'll get better at writing if you put in the effort, but I couldn't get better than a B+ on anything but the midterm. She was also kind of awkward, which was pretty funny sometimes. Reading wasn't too bad, only took a few hours a week. Overall, she was ok."
12373,917025,5.0,3.0,literally the best ASL teacher ive had
12374,917025,5.0,3.0,"Incredible instructor. If you are concerned about this class being too hard, don't be. Its way easier than I thought and he is very patient and understanding. Outstanding guy"
12375,917025,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher, strict, but good!"
12376,917025,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic! I love Mr. Devito. He does not tolerate nonsense, and demands respect, and that makes me respect him more. He is funny, but strict. This is HIS language, and HIS world, and he wants us to take it seriously. This isn't a ""easy A"" course. I took him at BRCC."
12377,917025,1.0,3.0,"Horrible experience with this teacher. He was adjunct at BRCC, where I took the class. Always late or missing class. Never helpful. Tests are super hard, because we don't review the vocab. The homework is no longer counting as a grade (at the end of the semester!). Just DON'T! Trust me, don't take him at BRCC."
12378,917025,4.5,2.0,"GREAT CLASS! IT may be a little hard in the beginning, since there is no talking for day one and he is Deaf, but Devito is funny and try his hardest to help everyone understand. His tests are very fair and there isn't much homework. Take Devito!"
12379,917025,4.0,2.0,GREAT! Nothing bad can be said about him. Every ASL student must take him at least once! Always try to get him. Great stories. Really helps you. Period.
12380,917025,4.5,2.0,"Very fun! Never bored in that class, very funny teacher, easy work, easy tests."
12381,917025,3.5,2.0,"His class was so much fun and he is a really great guy!!!! He is hilarious and sometimes you forget you are in class! The only downside is that there is a slow return of grades and comments on your work, so you sometimes don't know how you are doing... But I still loved the class and don't regret taking it!"
12382,917025,4.5,1.0,Rocco is awesome. He has a great sense of humor and makes ASL fun. But I find it annoying that he is always late for class. Take his class for ASL!
12383,917025,4.5,4.0,"Rocco is the man. So cool. Very tough class though, which is why I didn't go on. (There is no ASL-English dictionary!) If you need to meet a lang requirement though, I would highly recommend Rocco for ASL."
12384,1941025,5.0,2.0,Austin is such a great professor and person. He always goes out of his way to help every student with whatever they are having difficulties with. I strongly suggest taking any of his classes if you get the chance.
12385,630310,4.0,2.0,"Kelsey sometimes seems serious enough; however, she is a wonderful, caring professor, who allows a class of 90 feel like a discussion. She will challenge your thinking to be more interdisciplinary and encourage you to consider how science can play a role in your life. This course is based on group projects and blogs (no exams!)."
12386,630310,2.0,3.0,"Ok the positives: free-style discussion in a 90 people class, the professor doesn't really explain anything but to let the students go online and get answers themselves, oh she's also good at to dim the light and show funny videos - i liked them, but I don't think they are what I pay my tuition for. Way to survive exhaustive blogs - write for fun"
12387,630310,5.0,3.0,"By far one of the most enlightening classes that I've taken at UVA. Even the captcha test at the bottom of this rate my professors form intrigues me now thanks to her. Amazing lectures overall, and gave me an interest in astronomy, which I never thought I could be interested in."
12388,630310,5.0,3.0,"Kelsey is great. She's very blunt, yet entertaining with her smart elic-ness. Her notes and lectures are very dense, and so are the readings, but she is very helpful if you have any questions. Her tests are also very fair, and she offers tons of Extra credit."
12389,630310,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class! She is an excellent professor who always keep class exciting and amusing. She is very interactive with the class, despite its huge size, and will remember your name. The weekly readings were frustrating (write way more than you think is necessary), but those were graded by the TA. I highly recommend Kelsey."
12390,630310,4.0,3.0,"Excellent! Pretty much the best class I've ever taken at UVa. I'm going to be really sad when the semester ends. Kelsey has a great sense of humor, and she is absolutely brilliant. A true role-model."
12391,630310,4.0,3.0,This class was very interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My only complaint  is the weekly handouts you have to fill out for the reading which took me FOREVER! A couple of the books assigned I also found a bit boring and difficult to read. Also if your looking to fullfill an easy science requirement don't take this because its not that easy.
12392,630310,2.0,4.0,"Not too bad of a class, she tries to keep it interesting but sometimes stuff seemed outside her expertise.  Lectures were average, I dont' understand why science professors aren't required to have any teaching training, so probably not her fault. It was not as interesting as I heard and was pretty mindnumbingly obvious at times for 300 level."
12393,630310,5.0,2.0,"Kelsey is awesome-- she is so passionate about what she teaches and inspires her students. She's young/fresh and not jaded. The topics we cover are unlike any you will find in regular classes (Black holes,spacetime warping). I'm not big on science at all but this is easy and interesting yet mentally challenging-get rid of your biases 4 this class."
12394,630310,5.0,3.0,"This class is so much fun! Kelsey cracks me up all the time and it runs kind of like a discussion with lots of student interaction. If you like to venture into uncharted territories like aliens, black holes, wormholes, and all other fun mind warping theories... take the class. It's UVa at its finest and the only class I care if I miss!"
12395,630310,5.0,2.0,"definitely use her office hours--will help a lot on the homework assignments (very few of those).  there was busywork but she cut it out towards the end.  material is interesting (especially towards the end).  while the math wasnt taught in class, it was very easy to do and there were a maximum of 5 problems involving math (not including hw)"
12396,630310,2.0,4.0,"Odd woman, laughs at herself and gets angry because people don't &quot;study&quot; enough. Tests/exams covered a lot of math that she never reviewed in class other than giving the formulas. Lectures extremely boring and she flipped through the slides very quickly...do not recommend her at all."
12397,630310,5.0,3.0,she was a great astronomy teacher. Made the material very interesting and was very enthusiastic.  The tests were fairly easy. My only problem with the class is the amount of busy work in it.  your midterms were not even 50 percent of your grade.  Every week you are graded on a question of the week and there is a lot of other busywork.
12398,630310,3.5,4.0,Not the easiest class but interesting.  Make sure you read before coming to class or you'll have no clue what she's talking about and can get lost much easier.
12399,630310,5.0,3.0,"The class is NOT an easy A; she expects her students to work for their grade and actually learn. Don't take the class if you're looking for a blow-off science grade, but if you would like to learn more about astronomy from a teacher who is actually enthusiastic about her subject and always willing to help students then I would highly recommend it."
12400,630310,5.0,1.0,ok so she sucked in the beginning of the semester but toward the end it got really interesting and a whole lot easier to stay awake.  ps... only 2 homeworks and the midterm took 20 mins! i loved it
12401,630310,2.0,3.0,Very very boring.  I slept almost every lecture.
12402,630310,5.0,3.0,"Prof Johnson is clearly passionate about astronomy, which makes the class interesting.  Her lectures are clear (she slowed down as the semester went on, this was her 1st semester at UVa).  Do NOT expect an easy A though.  In her own words, she does not have much tolerance for students who aren't interested in learning.  Worth Taking."
12403,630310,4.5,3.0,"I think this is this most interesting science class I've ever taken.  I don't really like science in general, but I think Kelsey Johnson is pretty entertaining and accessable.  She does expect her students to *think*, but in my mind that is what college is for."
12404,630310,2.0,3.0,"If your thinking of taking this class with Kelsey Johnson, just dont. Shes so full of herself, laughs at her own jokes, and thinks she is teaching a 3rd grade class. I took this class becuase i expected a nice easy **** science class.... but she takes it way way to seriously, and gets angry at everyone who doesnt."
12405,630310,1.0,5.0,"HORRIBLE, the only word to describe this teacher. She acts like this is a middle school. In a 140 person class she makes us do group work everyday and write answers on the board. We have to sit at different tables every 2 weeks to meet new people. Having already taken an Astonomy class before this one i would recommend someone else. She SUCKS."
12406,917032,3.5,1.0,Take this class for an easy A and an unintentionally hilarious professor.
12407,917032,1.0,2.0,No Comments
12408,917032,4.5,2.0,"The most knowledgeable prof about all things Physics/astr including current developments.  Easy weekly hw assns.  Easy end of semester presentations.  You can learn a LOT if you feel like it.  Can learn nothing if you feel like it (no tests/quizzes).  He puts a lot of effort into the class, into looking over your hw and answering any questions!  :)"
12409,917032,1.5,1.0,"Yikes. DON'T take origin of the universe unless you are reeeally interested. Prof. Celli rambles on and on in class, and even if you understand the words he is saying through his thick Italian accent you still have to decipher the physics mumbo-jumbo. But, it's also incredibly easy, even if you never pay attention in class."
12410,630313,4.5,2.0,"His classes weren't exactly THRILLING but they were okay. He was very helpful, extremely accessible and always nice. I wouldn't recommend him for everyone, but he was good enough."
12411,630313,2.0,4.0,"Mr. Traore is a professor who wears his emotions on his sleeves. You can definitely tell when he's having a good or bad day. He's also hard to understand due to his accent. Criticism isn't taken very well, and I could never figure out what to study for tests. He's funny at times, but I would look at other professors."
12412,630313,2.5,3.0,"Interesting guy, can be moody at times. On a good day, he's very nice. On a bad day, don't ask a question that he has already answered. Hard to determine what will be on tests - the material is not clearly from the book or his lectures. A group project counts instead of a final exam."
12413,630313,2.0,2.0,He is not the easiest teacher to understand;  his accent takes some getting used to and you must have a good foundation in grammar before coming into the class. If I hadn't been introduced to it all before I would have been lost. The tests are very fair and the bulk of the information is from the notes and not the text.
12414,630313,1.5,4.0,I agree I am alway 1 or 2 minutes late because I have a class across campus and he reems me out everytime. He is NOT understanding or helpful. He is actually kind of a jerk also.
12415,630313,1.5,3.0,"Confusing and not very understanding if your prior class is on the other side of grounds. Likewise, assigns Quia homework which is time consuming  and pointless. You should be ok if your grammatical basis in French is ok - I got a B+ after not having French for 5 years..."
12416,630313,2.0,4.0,"In my opinion he is not a very good teacher for introductory french students.  Before taking his class I really enjoyed French, but after his class I ended up thinking I was going to quit.  I ended up taking another French class after his though and love it again.  Would not recommend."
12417,630313,3.0,1.0,"Salif is a really funny African man with a great personality.  He can be a bit confusing at times, but he is always very helpful and entertaining.  His tests are pretty easy and as long as you clarify any instructions that aren't clear, you can do well in his class."

12419,7723,4.0,1.0,"""Systems Thinking and Sustainability"" was an amazing USEM. Mark White was the most engaging professor I've had at UVA thus far."
12420,7723,1.0,4.0,I took the course long time ago.  He was arrogant. I remember that his biggest accomplishment in life was buying a Porsche when he was studying abroad. He was quite proud that his car had higher residuals compared to his friends' first cars.   Unfortunately his classes were very uninspirational if you are a creative type.
12421,7723,1.5,5.0,"Condescending, pious, arrogant toward highly intelligent students and colleagues - hopefully he lives up to his own expectations!"
12422,7723,4.0,5.0,"Students either love him or hate him. White pushes students in a way that sometime borders on offensive, but, he is hands down the best ICE finance professor and he genuinely cares about all of his students. His class frustrated me to no end at times, but he is absolutely the most engaging professor I've had in the Comm School"
12423,7723,1.0,1.0,I have not come across an equally condescending professor since elementary school. Do not take his course unless you want to be taken aback by his rudeness. I would have learned more not taking the course and have felt better about myself afterward.
12424,7723,5.0,3.0,He's absolutely brilliant.
12425,7723,2.0,2.0,"he never actually answers any questions.. he just says &quot;yes good question, what do you think&#63;&quot;"
12426,7723,5.0,3.0,"very thought provoking class... a lot of reading, but definitely worthwhile. take it!"
12427,7723,4.5,4.0,"White is an amazing professor.  He definitely intimidated me at first, but I've learned a ton about Finance that I never would've otherwise.  You'll learn so much without even realizing it in his class, especially compared to other blocks."
12428,7723,3.0,4.0,"Finance professor--- White is SO difficult to explain. He is an AMAZING guy, so smart, so passionate about what he does but his teaching methods are hit or miss. While you'll learn a ton from him, youll be confused 100% of the time bc he teached with a &quot;throw you into the deep end&quot; method. He's such a funny guy, worth it."
12429,7723,1.0,4.0,selectively cruel to some students--attempt to be &quot;firm and fair&quot; comes off as mean and harsh instead.
12430,7723,4.0,2.0,"Interesting USEM, highly recommend it, few work although one long paper and presentation at the end. No tests or evaluations at all!!"
12431,7723,5.0,3.0,AMAZING CLASS!!!! Highly highly reccomend it. Getting to know Mark was a great part of my college experience.

12434,237109,5.0,4.0,This class is a wonderful opportunity to learn about what economists actually do: in class you discuss real-world problems and look at leading economists' research on the topic (students not responsible for technical content).  Turner is a very good economist and a compelling teacher.  Not difficult.
12435,237109,4.5,2.0,"Pretty easy for a 300-econ. Turner's expectations are pretty clear, material is fairly interesting. But why is there a discussion for this class&#63; My TA sucks, discussion is worthless"
12436,237109,3.0,2.0,very nice
12437,237109,2.0,2.0,"Horribly boring class, but there are a few redeeming topics.  The articles are completely useless.  Turner is very intelligent, but just really boring.  Tests aren't hard per se, but require a fair amount of BS."
12438,237109,4.5,3.0,"Good class. There's no textbook, and the readings are numerous, but you can get by just reading the abstracts. Attending class is important; she also makes the PPT slides available online, which is crucial. She's always enthusiastic and helpful."
12439,237109,2.0,2.0,"Boring, very very boring."
12440,2473534,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Cleeves is nice, really cares about what she teaches. Expect anywhere from 35-60 min homeworks twice a week, four big projects(one is a paper). Fun class, not an easy A though. Quizzes are thorough, but MC. Little bit of math, clicker questions each class."
12441,2473534,5.0,2.0,"Great lecture, fun class. She will guide you every step of the way. It is EXTREMELY WORTH IT to go to her office hours. Very inspirational. You will never regret taking her class."
12442,1384002,4.0,4.0,"Daniel is by far the hardest professor teaching Calculus II and he was pretty upfront about being a tough grader. Always go to office hours even if you understand all the material because the major exams consist of extremely challenging problems. If you do this, the course is manageable. Just don't screw up on any major exam or else you're done for"
12443,1384002,5.0,3.0,"I only took 1210, but Daniel Remine is awesome.  He's really nice, and willing to answer any questions you have after or outside of class. I didn't buy the book for this class, just went to lecture and did the online homework.  I did awful in AP calc in high school, but managed to get an A in this class with him as the teacher."
12444,1384002,5.0,3.0,"MATH 1210 and MATH 1220: Class isn't easy but he teaches you what you need to know for the exams. Go to class,take notes and you are set! (assuming you study) The textbook isn't necessary at all... The online hw package that you are required to buy gives you online access to the book.  Great TA! oh and 1220: the Final is HARD."
12445,1384002,5.0,2.0,Great teacher! Daniel is very clear and helpful in class. Not a hard class if you study.
12446,1384002,4.0,4.0,"Good!  Hard class, but that's calculus anywhere."
12447,507460,5.0,1.0,"Really nice guy, extremely knowledgeable. THE expert on Salem. The class is just really boring and repetitive. I've never witnessed so many people sleeping in class everyday (myself included. Really easy class without much work. Just be prepared to fall asleep and hear a lot of information repeated class after class."
12448,507460,4.5,1.0,"I took his COLA on the Salem Witch Trials. Extremely nice guy. Very knowledgeable and cares about his students as well as the material. The class was very easy, a couple short assignments and some reading that you can get away with not doing."
12449,507460,4.0,2.0,"Expert on Salem Witch Trials. Great teacher. Nice. Easy to talk to. A little disorganized at times, but classes consist of great discussion. HW included fair amount of reading plus discussion questions."
12450,507460,2.0,5.0,"Ben Ray is unique.  A bit monotoned, pensive, and I find him to be quite prejeduiced against minority students."
12451,507460,4.0,2.0,Sooo nice.  Fairly easy.  He is very helpful.  The kind of guy you wish was your grandpa.
12452,507460,5.0,1.0,"Great professor! The reading and grading are fair. There are two ten-page papers though- but he gives you everything you need for it so it's easy to complete. Take this class. He can get boring and repetitive but once he realizes he is, he gets on track and finishes when he finishes (which is most likely early)."
12453,507460,3.5,4.0,"SUPER GUY, GREAT TEACHER...go to coffee or to his office hours with him and get a great one on one lesson...just awesome and very caring!"
12454,507460,5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors at UVA! VERY knowledgeable on the Salem Witch Trials, enthusiastic, really cares about his students. Always happy to chat with you during office hours."
12455,507460,5.0,2.0,"he's very nice, however the class is so long and he gets boring/repetitive. the assignements aren't hard and the course work is interesting though."
12456,1785419,4.5,1.0,"Great Teacher, very fair, helpful, and insightful. There was a fair amount of reading and writing, but Ms. Hess went over each reading in class to ensure we mastered the content. I doubt that she will ever be able to teach this course again, but would absolutely recommend to others  if she chooses to continue teaching."
12457,1080917,1.0,5.0,"I dont understand how anyone in their right mind would hire this man to teach anything to anyone.He just feeds students his personal propaganda and fumes with irrational anger whenever someone disagrees with him, like &quot;who do you think you are scott&#63;, a political science prophet&#63;&quot;,I hope he retires soon,he is a waste of time and space"
12458,1080917,1.0,5.0,"I dont understand how anyone in their right mind would hire this man to teach anything to anyone.He just feeds students his personal propaganda and fumes with irrational anger whenever someone disagrees with him, like &quot;who do you think you are scott&#63;, a political science prophet&#63;&quot;,I hope he retires soon,he is a wasted of time and space."
12459,1080917,1.0,5.0,carl scott is a very knowledgeable and enthusiatic teacher. unfortuantly this matters little because his totall inability to teach makes him come across as an ignorant idiot. im sure scott kows his materiel but his total lack of teaching skill combined with his harsh grading and total lack of compassion just makes him come across as at total ****. 
12460,1080917,4.0,4.0,"The material is easy enough, but Scott can be a real prick if you disagree with him (DON'T BAD-MOUTH LINCOLN). Harsh grader, but he is always willing to help if you go to office hours. The class certainly helped put the American political system in perspective.  Worth taking."
12461,1080917,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Scott's class is amazing - it's a 200 level intensive discussion class. Consists of attendance and participation in class, two 5 page papers, 1 midterm and 1 final. You need to do the readings and talk (A LOT). He's a hard grader on the papers, but very understanding on the midterm+final - bottom line: TAKE THIS CLASS!!!"
12462,2342486,5.0,2.0,"Music and Discourse is a fun and interesting course when taught by the department head Dr. Miller. Class is discussion based, with short readings before every session. I learned a lot about music, the industry, and how we relate to it. Dr. Miller is engaging and fun. Grades are a few short papers and participation- any effort will be received well."
12463,2342486,5.0,2.0,"Karl is such a wonderful professor! He's great at facilitating discussion and also knows how to give interesting lectures. He's happy to just chat during office hours once you've covered the important stuff, and since he's been the go-to for music major declarations he's knowledgeable about current and future courses. So sad he'll be on sabbatical!"
12464,2342486,5.0,3.0,"Miller is so much fun. Popular Musics is an intriguing course, and he did a great job of making it interesting. Lecture isn't technically required (no attendance taken), but it would likely be difficult to elaborate in papers if you hadn't gotten the material. Textbooks are just readings for discussion, which you can probably get by without."
12465,1293916,4.0,2.0,"Loved this class! Amy felt really encouraging at the beginning with drawing skills and was really understanding that all of us were coming from different backgrounds and levels. As time went on, she pressured kids to try a bit harder on the conceptual assignments, but make sure to talk to her about your ideas in detail before trying them out."
12466,1293916,5.0,4.0,"Amy is helpful and encouraging, and gives solid feedback.  She is pretty chill, and classes are devoted to working on projects.  If you work hard in class you will have little to prepare outside of class, and she rarely assigns extra work.  Assignments are fun, and she sometimes gives several options for students to choose from."
12467,1293916,1.0,4.0,"1. If she says your work is great, it means that you're getting a B. 2. She may be an artist but she's definitely not a professor. Gives little feedback and expects you to cater to her tastes."
12468,1293916,3.5,4.0,"She assigns a lot of outside work in the beginning, but it lightens up over time. Her honest critiques can sometimes be harsh, but if you work hard and put in the effort to improve, you'll earn her respect and the class will become more enjoyable. The work is repetitive, and sometimes boring, but I learned a lot and respected her in the end. "
12469,1293916,4.0,3.0,"Amy is friendly, incredibly helpful, and very encouraging.  She wants to see you do your best and will inspire you to make that happen.   Assignments were always interesting, and much (most) of classes were given to work on them.   Critiques were enjoyable, be sure to participate!   "
12470,310876,3.0,4.0,Good professor. Kinda pushes his ideas on you vs letting you decide which is really annoying. 
12471,310876,5.0,2.0,Mitch is an amazing professor. I wouldn't have thought that I would like Philosophy but he made the class very enjoyable. Be prepared to read and paying attention is quite important in this class because what he says are the answers to the study questions that are used for the exam!
12472,310876,3.5,2.0,Equal parts brilliant and pedantic.
12473,310876,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Green is a great professor. He challenges students in class and goes into the implications as well as problems with various theories. The papers are a lot of work, but are open-ended. Definitely meet with him about your papers."
12474,310876,5.0,1.0,Totally awesome and inspiring in every way. I hope Mitchell offers another on-line course.
12475,310876,5.0,2.0,"Green is the man! honestly one of the most intelligent individuals I've ever come across. His lectures are awesome... simple yet profound! The discussions are great, so many ideas I'd never pondered before. This class opened my eyes, man. Green has the answer to every question on the tip of his tongue, theres no stumping this guy. TAKE THE CLASS."
12476,310876,4.5,3.0,He's a very engaging lecturer. He also makes himself pretty available for discussion. His lectures are always fun and interesting.
12477,310876,5.0,2.0,In love with the subject
12478,310876,4.0,3.0,"I personally hated this class, but that was a personal issue, not Mitch's fault. The tests were relatively straight forward, but not necessarily &quot;easy.&quot;  Just because you're given the questions doesn't mean you have the right answers. The final grade distribution turns out to be a rather harsh bell curve, so don't choose this as a blow-off class."
12479,310876,5.0,2.0,"I was excited about taking this class to introduce me to the philosophy dep, but found going to lecture useless and boring, and lost interest. He is very likeable but dumbs it down & mostly uses stupid examples to explain; hurts by trying to hard to get students to speak up. Easy exams! The papers were pretty interesting but very specific."
12480,310876,4.5,2.0,"this is a great intro class. lecture is interesting and gives you most of the info  you need. some tas are better than others, but mitch is a great professor. very approachable and energetic."
12481,310876,4.0,3.0,"He knows what he's talking about -- he has his own book. Don't have to read anything. Write EVERYTHING (on the slides) down in class. Bring a laptop. TA's are very picky on the midterm, so be careful that you write the answer perfectly."
12482,310876,5.0,1.0,"Honestly, I found this class to be somewhat of a joke. No sense in his logic. He was always coming up with hypothetical situations about aliens or something...what the potential existence of aliens has to to with what makes something human i will never know. dont go to class, just read his book and regurgitate answers to the study questions"
12483,310876,5.0,2.0,"A very decent class.  Prof is incredibly clear and does a   good job of making some deep issues come to the surface for people new to philosophy.  Read his book carefully, come to class, and you'll do fine.   Stay on top of weekly study questions and that'll help make sure you understand the material.  The class made me decide to major in phil."
12484,310876,3.0,2.0,"This class was kind of my blow off class. His lecture said virtually the same thing the books did, so if you did the reading, you didn't really need to go to class. But I didn't find it a very stimulating class and got bored with the subjects a lot."
12485,310876,5.0,1.0,"Don't even bother reading the prinouts or any books other than his book, Engaging Philosophy. They are dense and he will present all you need to know in class. I earned an A by just going to class, reading his book, and doing the study questions in advance so they don't pile up. Great teacher. Must-take class."
12486,310876,4.5,2.0,"If ou dont like going to class, this a class that u can miss alot. Its huge! plus the book engaging philosophy s so straightfoward and easy to read. Read that and do as many of the study questions as possible and you'll do great!"
12487,310876,4.5,2.0,"He gives you all the study questions ahead of time, which is what your midterm and final are based off of. As long as you read Engaging Philosophy and do the study questions ahead of time you will ace the tests. However, the TAs grade the two papers very harshly. I feel like your grade is more determined by your TA."
12488,310876,3.5,2.0,"Lectures were intersting. He gives us the questions for the midterm and final so they're not that bad because you know what to expect. Papers were graded hard though, but that might just be the TA."
12489,310876,5.0,2.0,"TA's are very harsh on the papers since Mitch requires so. Tests are relatively easy since the questions are given out in advance. Ironically, I did so well on the papers, and not very well on the midterm. But, I rocked the final. Make sure you read his book, Engaging Philosophy. Other books are quite unnecessary. Go to his office hours, too!"
12490,310876,3.5,1.0,"Monotonous lectures. Although not a high area of interest for me, it is an easy class. Only 4 grades, 2 papers and 2 tests."
12491,310876,4.0,2.0,Mitch rocks! He's very laid back and definitely approachable...go visit him during his office hours! All you really have to do is read his book and ANSWER THE STUDY QUESTIONS! If you do midterm and final are easy.
12492,310876,4.0,3.0,"Mitch is a very clear lecturer, and his book provides you with everything you need to know for the papers and the tests.  He is fun to talk to and knows his stuff.  The only caveat is that grading is arbitrary because your TA determines your grade.  Charlie and William are good TAs."
12493,310876,4.0,2.0,"Found this class to be very interesting... Mitch's tone can be similar to Ben Stein at time but still manages to make it interesting. Make sure to have his book, since study questions can be answered with it alone."
12494,310876,5.0,3.0,Anser the questions as he gives them to you or you'll be kicking yourself... I had a study group of three ppl ... we met weekly and discussed the readings... most times we were behind schedule and behind on the readings but it helps and ends up very well... esp helping with papers...
12495,310876,4.5,3.0,"I wish I had known the layout of this class. The structure is very easy. The readings aren't necessary, attend lectures, read his Engaging Philosophy book and answer the midterm questions before hand since they are given to you. Mitch as a professor is very personable and lenient. More professors should teach with his style."
12496,310876,4.5,3.0,"I wish I had known the layout of this class. The structure is very easy.

Mitch as a professor is very personable and lenient. More professors should teach with his style."
12497,310876,4.0,2.0,"I did not like the class, but personally I do not like being spoken down to in lectures that feel more like a magic show with trap doors and mirrors than an intellectual discussion of ideas. Philosophy is about truths not facts, or you could get his simplified version: Engaging Philosophy."
12498,310876,4.5,1.0,"makes a boring subject somewhat interesting. don't bother buying any of the books or doing any of the reading besides Engaging Philosophy (his book). basically, to get an A, all you have to do is know the answers to the questions he asks every 2 weeks or so (the test is verbatim). very easy to talk to and encourages it - go to discussions for help"
12499,310876,4.0,1.0,"I fell asleep every class and still got an A.  Just read Engaging Philosophy, download the slides, and go to discussion sections.  You don't need to do the readings or go to lecture to do well.  He seems like a nice enough guy but could definitely be condescending at times."
12500,310876,5.0,2.0,"Class was interesting, and Mitch explained everything clearly.  His Engaging Philosophy book was really helpful; it basically reiterated everything he said in class. So if you missed something he said, you could just get it from his book.  If you want to take a philosophy class, definitely get Mitch!"
12501,310876,5.0,1.0,"good class. puts the most recent lecture up for the day of class, in case you miss it you can download it. classes are interesting, sometimes he moves fast, but he gives all the questions that he will draw from on the midterm and exam. really nice professor, very good teacher."
12502,310876,5.0,3.0,"Not a bad class. Exams are pretty easy because you have all the questions beforehand. Lecture just explains the reading, so you really only need to do one or the other."
12503,310876,3.5,2.0,"Kind of a boring class, but easy none-the-less. Read his book, Engaging Philosophy, and you have the lectures and readings at your convienence. Keep up with the study questions every week (about 3 a week), and you'll ace the exams with no real work."
12504,310876,4.5,2.0,"Pretty good professor.  He knows his stuff, which is always good.  He's also very easy to talk to, and holds an office hour in Starbucks every Monday, which is cool."
12505,310876,4.0,2.0,"a smart guy.  can refute anything you say in class, which is occasionally frustrating.  pretty easy and he doesn't pull any punches on tests.  open to questions.  i probably did more than i had to by reading AND going to class.  possible to get by w/ just 1.  very interesting though and the class will make u think about ur views, which is good."
12506,310876,4.5,1.0,No Comments
12507,310876,3.5,1.0,"Such a boring class.  Don't bother doing any of the readings -- just take notes on the lectures.  I recommend also taking notes on what he says in addition to his PowerPoint slides.  If you thoroughly study/cram the study questions for the exams, then the class is a piece of cake."
12508,310876,2.5,1.0,the class was really easy & i liked my TA a lot. But Mitch's lectures  were unnecessary for learning the material and often very repetitive.  he also has a very condescending manner i think.  you will get a good overview of various topics in PHIL100 but i'd try to get a different professor
12509,310876,4.5,1.0,"It was a good class overall, it just taught me that Philosophy was not for me.  In spite of losing interest halfway through because of this, I still found it possible to keep up and do well."
12510,310876,4.0,2.0,No Comments
12511,310876,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor; clear, interesting lectures and the tests aren't too bad either. He's always available for help and goes out of his way to accomodate individuals in a 300 person class. The only thing that soured my experience was that my TA absolutely sucked =("
12512,310876,5.0,2.0,Very quirky and interesting teacher - his class is one of my favorites. He's very open to discussion and unintimidating - a great professor.
12513,310876,5.0,2.0,An excellent professor.  Always an interesting lecture with him (that's why I was so disappointed to sleep through his 9 a.m. class all the time!).
12514,310876,5.0,2.0,"Very nice guy, teaches the material in a very straightforward fashion. if you go to the lectures then the test and papers are easy. not a bad class at all"
12515,310876,5.0,2.0,I enjoy every one of Mitch's lectures.  He actively engages his students to get involved in the conflicts that different philosophers try to solve.
12516,310876,3.0,1.0,I was interested in this class before I took it.  Now I hate philosphy.  Maybe it's just the subjet matter.  Everyone loves &quot;Mitch&quot; but I find him kind of annoying to listen to.  This class is so easy to get an A+ in. I went to lecture about 5 times and still got an A.
12517,310876,5.0,1.0,excellent teacher always there for help very clear lecture not pompass
12518,310876,5.0,2.0,"Killer smart dude with a vast knowledge of aesthetics and the arts.  Is there a movie he hasn't seen&#63;  Very clear lecturer with fascinating, stimulating ideas.  Take anything from him that you can--this was my third with him and as great as the others"
12519,310876,5.0,3.0,"Go to class, take notes, and DEFINITELY go to the review sessions before the exams.  This course isn't an easy A, but if you try, you'll do well."
12520,310876,4.0,2.0,"Mitch knows his stuff.  His lectures can get somewhat tiresome, but the material is usually interesting.  The tests are very straightforward, but with some studying, it's an easy A."
12521,310876,2.5,3.0,"Mitch has clear, organized lectures. He likes the sound of his own voice."
12522,310876,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor. Dedicated to his students. One of the best at UVA. Made philosophy fun. Take notes on his lecture slides.
12523,310876,5.0,4.0,"Clear and interesting lectures, and he's really committed to his students.  He's also demanding,  but because he made philosophy so interesting to me I didn't mind rising to the challenge.  Definitely take at least one class with him before you graduat"
12524,310876,5.0,4.0,Great prof.  Really knowledgable.  Very committed to his students. Working on his book.  Very HOT.
12525,1941088,5.0,5.0,"if you take this class with anyone else you're screwed. chalak is the man, amazing professor if you get off your phone and actually pay attention and he stops literally every 45 seconds for questions. You should have lots of questions because the material is super hard! but chalak will help you out if you let him!"
12526,1941088,5.0,4.0,"The content he teaches can be extremely difficult to understand but if you pay close attention in class he makes it all sound clear. Also, he makes people feel incredibly comfortable stopping to ask questions if they don't understand something-at the beginning of the course he says the pace of the course is determined by us students."
12527,1941088,1.0,4.0,"From someone who hasn't really had trouble with other economics classes, he doesn't explain the material well. Then again, neither does the textbook-- your best bet is going to be searching up specific concepts online. There's a huge emphasis on proof memorization, so make sure to copy down everything on the board, since there are no online notes."
12528,1941088,4.5,4.0,"Professor Chalak is an outstanding and extremely clever professor.  He explains complex topics that are comparably difficult, in a step by step logical manner.  The class is demanding. The problem sets are tricky and harder than any homework I've ever had, but he gives you all of the time and the tools you need to master Econometrics."
12529,523879,3.0,4.0,"I'm an art history major/good student (4.0). But this class kicked my butt. I came out with an A, but only because I killed myself studying. He's a really nice guy, but he doesn't really understand how much students are capable of doing and drastically over-assigns, like giving you five really heavy 30 page chapters. And tests test from readings."
12530,523879,3.0,4.0,"I enjoyed this class much more than I expected to... until the midterm. The TAs grade so differently, and because there are only 2 quizzes and 2 tests, they all matter a lot. I got screwed by my TA on the midterm, and neither my TA nor Dobbins helped me when I went to talk to them. It's SO much memorization. The class is fine, but a lot of work"
12531,523879,4.5,2.0,"Dobbins is  a great professor -- he's passionate about art history and wants you to understand concepts. Lectures are worth attending for interest/true understanding of material purposes, but the textbook is sufficient and similar. The tests require a lot of studying and memorization, but if you study well and have good notes, you'll get an A."
12532,523879,3.5,4.0,"I took his Fall 2014 Class (currently preparing for final...). The lectures are great. He's very interactive and more often then not you will find yourself being forced to stand up andor participate in some quirky activity to help remember or connect with the art. He only gives 2 quizzes and 2 tests, and both of those are difficult."
12533,523879,2.5,4.0,this class requires way too much work for a such a low level. unfair/uneven grading between TAs so its easy to get screwed. not recommended
12534,523879,3.5,5.0,"Dobbins seems to think we are not taking any other courses than the one he teaches. While he is enthusiastic and likable, the harshness and arbitrariness of his grading is infuriating. It is impossible to get a good grade in this course unless you have extensive prior knowledge of art history. For a 1000 level course, take anything else."
12535,523879,5.0,4.0,A delightful class but definitely not for the lazy student. Memorization is important for dates and titles. Dobbins is a great lecturer- engaging and really cares about the subject- so attending lectures will be to your benefit.
12536,523879,4.5,3.0,"Fun and interesting class. The lecture can get boring, but Dobbins does a good job of using anecdotes and comparisons to make the material more accessible. The tests and quizzes are nearly all memorization so it's time consuming but not too hard."
12537,523879,4.0,4.0,"LOVED this class.  soo much memorization its sort of insane though.  i didnt go to lecture much, but it was pretty interesting when i did and it definitely helped. quirky professor, he makes lecture funny. took this class just for fun and now its my major. i recommend it :)"
12538,523879,4.5,4.0,Mr. Dobbins is an excellent teacher.  The tests and quizzes are difficult (there's a lot of memorization) but his well-prepared lectures make the class worth it.  He incorporates humor and personal examples into the information he presents.  Definitely worth taking!
12539,523879,1.5,3.0,"His lectures are pointless. Most of your grade will be on dates/places/name, and the three &quot;facts&quot; about the art piece can be made up pretty easily, even without knowledge of what it is. So read the book and memorize those three things, and you'll have enough knowledge to make up the rest. I stopped going to class in October and got an A."
12540,523879,4.5,4.0,Dobbins is a GREAT professor. He manages not to bore me in class. I did read the book but somehow going to class made the images stick to my head better. LOTS of memorization so use flash cards or powerpoint. I recommend this class!
12541,523879,4.0,3.0,"Dobbins is great.  Very cute and funny and tries to make class interesting.  He would always include anecdotes relating to the works, which was cool.  LOTS of memorization, so you'll do well in the class if you know how to study for it.  Flashcards worked for me - took a long time but was worth it.  Pretty interesting class"
12542,523879,4.5,3.0,Goes through slides very quickly so sit in the front. Either read the book or go to class--they're the same. This class requires more memorization than I've ever had in my life. If you're good at memorization you'll do well. Dobbins is a funny professor though! Buy a used copy of the book! Newer edition of the book's not necessary!

12544,523879,5.0,4.0,"absolutely adorable, he'll try to learn everyone's names in the first few weeks and he's so dynamic during lectures. he makes very subtle jokes (about american politics and the like) there's very little chance you'll fall asleep. pay attention to lectures and you'll only need the textbook for reviewing and getting dates right."
12545,523879,4.5,1.0,So fun and so easy. The lectures are so interesting and you'll basically be given the A if you attend sections. You don't even have to read the book; seeing the pictures in class is basically enough.  It must have been harder before but last semester was so easy. I guess Dobbins just lightened up. DEFINITELY take this class.
12546,523879,2.5,5.0,"what a hard class... i had always been interested in art, but this class is turning me away from a minor in art history.  It is interesting but it is SO much memorization. procrastinators BEWARE, you really cannot learn all the material in one night. He's nice, but really felt like a GPA killer"
12547,523879,4.0,4.0,"He's a really good teacher + lecturer, the material's interesting, but the class was WAY too hard. So much memorization. I didn't so well, but some of my friends did so it depends."
12548,523879,4.0,5.0,"I liked the professor,not the class.Lectures are interesting,he adds some personal stories/jokes.there is a lot of memorization for quizzes and exams, which makes it a quite hard class."
12549,523879,5.0,3.0,"I love John Dobbins!  He gives great lectures, and I loved the material of the course.  Being a intro level course, this class covers a lot of material less specifically than higher level art history classes, but I enjoyed the range of topics.  If you are not willing to memorize art pieces, then don't take this class."
12550,523879,3.5,4.0,I hated this class. It was awful. I felt like I didn't really get to appreciate art. Way too much memorization. Too hard for a 101 class. Thumbs down.
12551,523879,4.0,3.0,"I love art but I HATED this class. Dobbins was interesting & passionate but ur grade = memorizing 800&#63; works (3/4 of ur grade, others = participation & 2 short 1 long essays per exam). This shows NOTHING about how YOU understand the art. I would've had more respect if there were more essays analyzing how YOU understood art, not regurgitating facts."
12552,523879,4.5,4.0,"Even though I wasn't really that interested in pre-Renaissance art I took 101 just to have a background in the subject, and I'm glad I did. Dobbins was an excellent professor, demanding, yes, but also passionate and enthusiastic. There is a lot of material to cover, and a lot of memorization, but the art is easy enough to learn and understand."
12553,523879,3.0,4.0,"I love art but I don't like the way the class approached art. LOTS AND LOTS of memorization (only tests on 15 slides out of 300 or so for the final) and the quizzes are only worth 1/9 of your grade even though people study a lot for them (unfair). Grade also depends on your TA, mine took off points for things other TAs didn't."
12554,523879,3.0,3.0,"Tons of memorization and sooo boring lecturer, but the subject is quite interesting. Basically, a learn it yourself and study a ton class."
12555,523879,3.0,4.0,"The lectures get kind of boring and long, but you really learn a lot... overall, I'm glad I took the class.  Just be prepared for a LOT of memorization and lots of studying."
12556,523879,5.0,4.0,Amazing lecturer and very passionate about the subject. Absolutely adorable - spends the first few weeks of class actually trying to learn everyone's names. Exams are very hard and require A LOT of studying - definitely can't put it off until the night before. I definitely recommend the class though - it's super interesting.
12557,523879,4.5,2.0,I'm now an art history major because of Prof Dobbins. he's a fun teacher and subject is very interesting. It helps to have an incredible memory
12558,523879,3.5,4.0,The material in this class is not hard but SOOOO much memorization.  If you procrastinate don't take this class.  Studying almost impossible to do in a few nights in advance...most definitely impossible to do in one night in advance.  For one quiz you have to memorize 100 items (literally)  for 4 items on the quiz. Nice intelligent guy though.
12559,523879,5.0,4.0,"I only took Roman and Etruscan art because I wanted to have another class with Dobbins, and I ended up loving it so much that I'm studying abroad in Italy next semester. It is a lot of material but nothing is too difficult to understand.  Dobbins works on th Forum project in Pompeii and he has lot of firsthand experience to bring ot the class."
12560,523879,2.5,5.0,This class was hard as BALLS! Professor Dobbins is really nice but his lectures can be boring and you can get the same info by just reading the book. The tests are ridiculously tough - wayyy too much to memorize...study like 2 years in advance.  He expects too much for this course...it's only a 100 level.
12561,523879,4.0,4.0,"awesome class. i learned more than i did in any other classes. keep up with the readings and study for tests ahead of time. you cant do all of the memorization in one night. the tests are intense, but the class is worthwhile and definitely enjoyable."
12562,523879,3.0,5.0,"Nice guy, but OH MY GOD the memorization is insane.  Unless you are an art history major, just take an upper level course that is not only easier, but much more in depth.  I underestimated the amount of work involved; basically, this class consumed my life last semester."
12563,523879,3.5,3.0,the subject itself is interesting although his lectures can be quite boring at times.  the material cover a crazy amount of time so be prepared to study like no other for the tests
12564,523879,4.0,3.0,"Dobbins is a good teacher. His lectures can get a little boring at times, but thats the repetion of the material not him. He has a quirky sense of humor; quizzes and tests are very fair. Be prepared for a lot of memorization and a lot of slides. Don't always need to go to lecture but it def helps!"
12565,2752107,2.0,5.0,"The most frustrating, opaquely worded quizzes and tests I've ever had from any professor.

NOTE: Course code says ASTR1220, but actual class taken was ASTR1270 "
12566,2752107,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Pryal was new, so he was always looking for student feedback. I would recommend to attend class and read the textbook (although both are technically avoidable), but even if you're like me and don't excel at tests there were plenty of classwork and homework opportunities. Astronomy wasn't as easy as I was told, I did math! Still good class!"
12567,2752107,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Pryal is a young professor, but you can tell he really loves what he teaches and genuinely wants his students to do well. While the tests were decently hard, he offers review sessions and the homework and lab scores make up for any bad scores you might get. It's easy to get an A or a B as long as you go to class and try on the assignments."
12568,2752107,4.0,3.0,"quizzes are hard but u can make up for it with labs and hw and participation, i had a 85 average on quizzes but still ended with an A, overall really interesting material"
12569,2752107,4.0,4.0,Professor Pryal is someone who you can tell cares about what he is teaching. He is new which makes him care more about his performance. His lectures are very helpful and so are the homework assignments. Definitely recommend taking his class!
12570,2752107,1.0,3.0,"Given he is a new professor, I would say he has a way to go in teaching technique. He was not very helpful for me personally in office hours nor did he have much engagement with his students. My personal experience was quite negative but a good grade is certainly achievable in his class."
12571,15980,5.0,4.0,"The topic is pretty hard to grasp during lectures, but he is very helpful during his office hours. He's very approachable and willing to stay longer after class to help you understand anything with which you are having difficulty."
12572,15980,4.5,2.0,as long as you pay attention and go to office hours you'll do fine
12573,15980,1.5,5.0,"Professor Stan has no understanding that people taking his courses are not masters of the subject and likes to take two weeks off where instead of a teacher, you listen to his powerpoints all class.  He would attempt problems and then stare at the board for minutes before saying he couldn't show us.  Weekly quizzes about any material &quot;covered&quot;"
12574,15980,4.5,3.0,"If you go to class and do the assigned work, you'll do well. He was also very helpful during office hours. His lectures made sense and helped me understand the material."
12575,15980,1.0,5.0,This man is the worst teacher in  the history of the UVa. T. Jefferson would be displeased!!!
12576,15980,5.0,3.0,"Stan is great.  Totally excited, you'll learn a great deal about circuit layout from this guy, I hope the department treats him well."
12577,15980,1.0,5.0,"DLD is an easy concept, and should all in all be an enjoyable class for EE, CPE's considering what we're about to face.  He takes the 'f' out of the 'fun class.'"
12578,15980,2.5,5.0,"Ah Dr. Stan, how you have forsaken me.  Kind of reminds me of Dr. Nick Riviera from the Simpsons.  Inflamable means flamable&#63;  What a country.  Seriously though, this guy is tough, you gotta be into the material hardcore to do well.  EE is a nightmare major that I'm glad I got out of."
12579,15980,1.0,3.0,a nutjob.  holy crap
12580,15980,3.0,5.0,"Professor Stan seems to assume that all of us are EE geniuses. Either that, or he has very high expectations of our ability to quickly grasp DLD concepts. The class material was difficult. His lectures covered easy topics, but his tests and quizes were very hard. The labs were fair, though."
12581,15980,5.0,4.0,Great introduction to grad school!
12582,15980,5.0,4.0,Very knowleadgeable
12583,15980,1.0,4.0,"His tests and class are pointless. Avoid at all costs. He is the type of person that loves to harp on boolean algebra, KMaps, converting numbers from binary to decimal (by hand), and other unrelated minutia that computers normally do."
12584,15980,1.0,3.0,what the %$#! is a meannnnnnnn-term&#63;&#63; it's minterm! u crazy ****..
12585,15980,1.5,5.0,"Stan did not teach the basics of circuit analysis well. I got a B, but I went into ECE 204 not knowing much of anything about circuits and was confused all semester."
12586,15980,2.0,5.0,"The class left me not well prepared for tests or for following courses. Nice guy, though."
12587,15980,1.0,5.0,"book sux, stan is horrible lecturer, impossible hws and tests are too hard.  this class sucks"
12588,15980,1.0,4.0,No Comments
12589,15980,2.5,5.0,did not teach necessary stuff for 204; b/c Stan uses Reed's horrendous book!!!
12590,15980,1.0,5.0,No teach basics.  Hard homework.  Hard tests.  Hard labs.  Book is horrible.
12591,15980,1.0,4.0,I FAILED
12592,15980,2.0,5.0,"uses the word  guys  too often, basics are not covered very well"
12593,15980,2.0,5.0,Reads from book.  Doesn't cover basics.
12594,15980,1.0,5.0,"Pretty Hard, no curves, hw takes forever, txtbook is by Reed( read his reviews)"
12595,2023021,1.0,3.0,"She gave all our papers back from the semester the night before the final exam, so we had no opportunity to improve our writing all year. She would complain in class about her personal problems and how she did not have time to grade them. We were only allowed to miss three classes a semester before she would take off a letter grade. "
12596,15981,5.0,2.0,"Hands down one of the best professors at UVa. Not only does he do an exceptional job at explaining difficult material, he is also a wonderful person who passes on his wisdom to students. CS3102 is as hard as you make it, since you have infinite extra credit. Take advantage of this opportunity to really understand and enjoy the material."
12597,15981,5.0,2.0,"Gabriel Robins is a fantastic professor. He really cares about the students learning and enjoying the class, as such a lot of the grade is towards attendance and extra credit opportunities. Highly reccommend"
12598,15981,5.0,4.0,Gabe is the best professor I've had -- undergrad or grad school.  Hands down.
12599,15981,4.0,5.0,"He's very smart and students respect him. However, most tested material is not taught in class but is thrown at students in large problem sets. Unnecessarily difficult."
12600,15981,5.0,3.0,"Gabe is one of the best professors ive ever had.  He has a great ability to explain things in ways that are easy to understand and he will really push you to think hard and enjoy doing it.  His classes are hard in that you really have to use your brain, but hw is not collected and you will get an A as long as you try"
12601,15981,4.5,4.0,Easily the best CS teacher I have had at UVA. Focuses much more on problem solving concepts rather than just the material. Homeworks are very challenging but well worth the time spent. I really feel like I learned a lot from this class.
12602,15981,1.0,1.0,"Did not enjoy this class. Too slow, and we didn't get to a lot of the material."
12603,15981,4.0,2.0,"Very nice guy, very helpful, very smart. It sometimes is easy to get lost if you don't pay attention to all his lectures, but he gives take-home open-note tests which makes things easier (the tests are still hard, but you have every opportunity to do well on them)."
12604,15981,5.0,2.0,"Gabe is amazing, my favorite professor at UVA. Has a wonderful ability to lecture ad hoc, and make the students active participants in the learning."
12605,15981,4.0,3.0,"His classes are the most intellectually stimulating ones I have taken.  If you like professors that just want you to regurgitate what they tell you on tests, he's not for you.  If you want a professor who will challenge your ability to think and teach problem solving skills, he's your man."
12606,15981,3.5,2.0,"Gabe is pretty much the man. His skills with the bow are undeniable as are his experience and algorithmic abilities. This class is about solving problems like a computer. If you can’t think like a computer, you’re probably not right for this class."
12607,15981,1.0,5.0,Same as last semester for CS 302. Uses his slides with less material than the book. Horrible at lecturing. No way to prepare for tests; questions are basically hit or miss (more often miss).  Luckily goes easy on the grading b/c he can't just fail everyone.
12608,15981,3.0,2.0,"Gabe is a bit of a character. If you appreciate an engaging, socratic style of teaching, you'll learn buckets. But if you're not into the subject matter and you don't spend time trying to get into the subject matter, it'll all be a blur. Luckily he offers tons of extra credit. I loved his class."
12609,15981,5.0,5.0,Gabe is awesome.
12610,15981,4.5,4.0,"Interesting structure, not great at staying on schedule, but focuses on a Socratic style of problem solving.  You can either really get into the class or feel left out."
12611,15981,1.5,3.0,"Same as the last person's comments, plus: assigns a project completely non-related to the course worth 1/4 of the final grade. Do not take this class if you don't have to. CS majors; wait for a semester when he's not teaching this course."
12612,15981,2.0,4.0,"Caters to the smartest people in class, while many have no idea what's going on.  Homework questions test concepts not covered in class.  Doesn't teach things clearly, just uses unclear slides and spends most of the time asking people questions."
12613,15981,2.0,4.0,Goes on 90 minute tangents and then asks you questions about the material he didn't cover. Likes to give test questions where the answer is non-obvious.
12614,15981,4.0,1.0,Bingo..You just did that once again. The paranoid is over dude..You Rock
12615,15981,5.0,1.0,No Comments
12616,15981,4.0,4.0,Extremely intelligent.  It just shows in how he lectures and addresses students.  The programming project was EXTREMELY difficult but you have the whole semmester to work on it (start earlier than you think you will need) and have partners. Great class!
12617,15981,5.0,4.0,"Really good class! I learned a lot! The project is hard but the grading is reasonable! Don't leave anything until the last moment! I would gladly take another class with him, even though I had to work super hard. It pays off!"
12618,15981,5.0,4.0,"Excellent, brilliant professor.I highly recommend Robins over Reynolds or Milner.Used very challenging 6 question 48 hour take home midterm and final v.s. time pressure nonsense and varying days so you could schedule around other finals.Cool project too"
12619,15981,4.5,4.0,"the class is hard, but he is an awesome professor!  smart, friendly guy, knows what he's doing"
12620,15981,4.0,3.0,really enjoyed this class
12621,15981,4.5,4.0,No Comments
12622,15981,5.0,2.0,Probably the best professor I've ever had.
12623,15981,1.0,5.0,"he likes to lecture alot, but doesn't help on hw which is what counts"
12624,1351281,4.0,2.0,Read. Study notes. Pay attention to slides.
12625,1351281,2.0,2.0,"What an idiot! Showed up late to class every day, then had to call to get the projector working.  Has no business teaching at UVA given the other stellar professors we have here.  Brings UVA wayyy down"
12626,1351281,3.5,2.0,Great teacher. Interesting class . Always prepared every single class. Highly recommend if you want to learn interesting stuffs in Anthropology!
12627,1351281,3.5,1.0,"I loved this class. It was really easy. Professor may be boring, but overall, quite fair."
12628,1351281,2.0,2.0,"Very boring with a tendency to be flaky, reads right off her notes. Going to this class was like pulling teeth. AVOID."
12629,48757,4.5,3.0,"Interesting lectures, regardless of your own interest classics. Covers Roman culture, literature, history, art, philosophy, and architecture. Hays has a quiet voice and may come across as boring at first, but his lectures are engaging and useful."
12630,48757,4.5,2.0,"Overall, Professor Hays was one of my favorite professors I have had at UVa. He is very funny and relays the information in an engaging way. Going to class is a must, since there's no real textbook for this class, just a bunch of reading. Assignments and tests are not too difficult."
12631,48757,4.5,2.0,The lectures are semi-boring but still go to them because thats where tests come from. Reading is not all mandatory but you should skim all of it anyways. Esp. read the stuff for section. Test and final were not bad esp. if you do study guide and go to review session. Paper on Aeneid was worst part but still managed to get A. Nice humanities/histor
12632,48757,4.0,3.0,"He's a pretty good teacher... Lectures are kinda boring. You have a lot of reading -- though not all of it is entirely necessary. Tests aren't bad. He can be kinda funny, and you won't expect it at all."
12633,48757,5.0,1.0,"Good class!  Not very hard, and Hays is hilarious.  Kind of hard to understand at times.  Also, I slept through half of the midterm, yet still did well.  Good sign!"
12634,48757,4.0,1.0,"lectures are interesting, but i started to get bored after a couple classes. the exams are really really easy, but you have to go through the list of topics he gives you and make sure you know about every single topic on it. if you do that (which is what i did), the exam is the easiest exam ever."
12635,48757,4.5,1.0,"i think greek mythology is interesting, so i liked the class for that. to do well on the tests, just do the reading. but lecture is worth it, because he's very funny, dry humor, and knows a lot. interesting just for the sake of it (one of my friends audited, and he still came to every class) - definitely worth it! easy and interesting and fun!"
12636,48757,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE this guy. Even when the class material was dull, I loved going to class because he's so droll. He knows what he's talking about and is a great teacher, to boot. Given how horrible most of the other professors are in the department, I'm surprised he's stuck around and not gone on to a more prestigious department somewhere else. I've heard he's not as good in large lecture settings as he is in seminar-type classes."
12637,48757,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I've had, charismatic, funny, I acutally looked forward to going to my 9:30 a.m. lectures.  Also had him for discussion, he was very helpful and kept things moving, we even had a field trip (to the art museum)."
12638,48757,5.0,2.0,Wonderful teacher.
12639,48757,4.5,2.0,"Smart, funny, sarcastic, clearly knows Latin backwards and forwards...Petronius withProf Hays is probably the best Latin class i've ever taken!"
12640,48757,4.0,2.0,"Hilarious, sarcastic, easy to talk to. If you don't like him, it has to be because you dont &quot;get&quot; his style."
12641,48757,5.0,4.0,"This guy is hilarious!  Great professor, I also had him for discussion.  Very helpful at answering questions in study sessions and in office hours.  Class was hard as all get out, but he was great."

12643,48757,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors I've ever had.  Funny and very clear.
12644,48757,4.5,2.0,"Great professor for Roman Civ, Latin and Greek"
12645,1965686,5.0,3.0,"James is a wonderful guy and his class was definitely my favorite when I took it. It's honestly a great way to meet people and make friends, on top of reading some good poetry and writing theory. The curriculum really lost me in the last third of the semester, but James gives you options for the essays, so I didn't have to worry. Take the course."
12646,1965686,4.0,3.0,"Ascher really cares about his students, always taking time to give specific feedback and communicate what you are doing wrong/right. He was very experimental with hw and grades. Instead of simple papers and exams, we had group research projects, completed oral exams, and created websites to convey our readings. Overall, a real fun prof"
12647,1965686,4.5,2.0,The previous review was way too harsh. This class is one of my favorite classes. He takes the time to help you if you need any. He's interesting and cares for his students. I genuinely think that I have improved my writing because of this class. 1010 would recommend!
12648,1965686,1.5,4.0,"In comparison to other ENWR 1510, this class was extremely harder. In addition to having 200-500 word writings due every sunday and tuesday night, there were 3 1500 word writings due throughout the semester. Then, those long essays must be rewritten in a new format. The prompts were difficult and easily confused. I feel as if I learned nothing."
12649,1490552,2.0,3.0,She is way too old to be teaching ICE. Super inefficient. The class is a repeat of Stat 2120. Complete waste of my time.
12650,1490552,1.0,3.0,"Professor Fraser is, without a doubt, the worst professor or teacher I have had during my academic career. I've never submitted anything to RMP before, but Fraser's incompetence, lack of presence, and overwhelming lack of both communication skills and empathy make her a nightmare. I have had a great experience at UVA but she is the exception."
12651,1490552,5.0,3.0,"Really useful/ important class. Hands on andcareer relevant, unlike other stat classes that I've been forced to take. Fraser is helpful in office hours and really nice."
12652,1490552,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, really knowledgeable, a marketing expert. Great credentials, an honor to study with her."
12653,1490552,2.0,3.0,"Doesnt care about students. Schedules office hours during the universal ice block class session; demonstrating a lack of care to her availability. Notes are incomplete, her book has errors. She will see your hand raised and blow you off. She has now sent a mass email to her students saying she will no longer answer her email (its finals week). Lazy"
12654,1490552,5.0,2.0,"Prof Fraser is nice and always willing to help.  Go to office hours, and the class isn't that hard."
12655,1490552,4.5,3.0,Course is manageable if you pay attention. Fraser is quirky and nice. Go to office hours.
12656,319101,5.0,3.0,"I was scared reading all comments here& IDK if things changed from previous years but Grisham by far the MOST caring,understanding,& inspirational prof. It says your grade is based on midterms only,in reality as long as you show care about class you will be happy w/ your grade. he pushes you hard on exams&you might get 50%but @ the end up with an A"
12657,319101,5.0,4.0,"Incredibly nice guy, just show you care and he will be really impressed. Lecture was right from the textbook, so make sure you read. Gives pop quizzes, but the average on them is so low that you shouldn't worry. Exams are very tough, and the averages will be low but he looks for improvement when assigning final grades. Project also boosts grade."
12658,319101,3.0,5.0,"Prof Grisham is an amazing person but his class sucks. The average on the first exam was a 51%; and Grisham was HAPPY about it! People received no points for questions they got correct because the TAs didn't like how they showed their work. If you are not a biochem major and don't have to take this, take the premed biochem class instead."
12659,319101,5.0,4.0,"Professor Grisham is probably the most kind, caring, empathetic, and passionate professors I've ever had at UVA and beyond. He loves biochemistry almost as much as he loves teaching students. I took Biochem2 as a summer session and I've never seen anyone so lovely at 8 am, energetic throughout, or genuinely passionate about biochemistry."
12660,319101,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Grisham is a great Biochemistry professor. He's super sweet and caring. I don't go to UVa so I wasn't sure what to expect, but hes the best science teacher I've had through all of pre-med. A very do-able class. Skim the book because he wrote it and do all of the back of book problems and you will be great! Definitely recommend taking him!"
12661,319101,3.0,4.0,"Professor Grisham loves biochemistry, making it fun to sit in his lectures. That being said, I feel that he didn't always focus on the most important topics, leaving the students to learn them on their own. His pop quizzes (which could happen in any class) were tough, but he often used similar questions on the exams, making them good study tools."
12662,319101,4.5,3.0,"This teacher is so genuinely nice, he offered me a million chances to make up the midterm and the final essay. He cancels class, but when we do have class, he is on time and ready to lecture. Very interesting and relates good modern analogies to history. Do all the work and show him that you TRY (on papers). DOESN'T give any hw! WHAT?! ..i know :) "
12663,319101,4.0,4.0,"Good professor. He does make you work for it, but makes it clear what he expects you to be able to do."
12664,319101,2.0,4.0,"Biochem has been one of the hardest classes I've taken so far at UVa. Grisham can be rude and unhelpful (he gave our class a 10 minute lecture on why we shouldn't be aspiring to go to med school and be more like him and ""actually like our lives""). His exams are way too hard. Midterm on the last day of class? It's a final, you're not fooling anyone."
12665,319101,1.0,5.0,"Ok, Grisham may appears nice at the first glance, but he is a very rude and uncaring person inside, he gets moody easily and will howl at students. I think the university should expel him, he is not a professional professor, he is not even a decent human"
12666,319101,1.5,3.0,"I had him for lab lecture and he would always give super hard iclicker questions, especially at the end of class and then giggle because he was keeping us over the allotted class time. The information he gave for labs was irrelevant and he was more annoying than helpful. I didn't listen to him and I did fine in the labs."
12667,319101,3.0,5.0,"Grisham is the most inconsiderate professor at UVa.  He is unhelpful, teaches directly from the book, and expects you to put in 15+ hours a week outside of class.  Our test averages were under 50 for every test, and he yelled at least once every class for our ""lack of integrity.""  Class is incredibly boring and you learn nothing from it."
12668,319101,1.5,3.0,"Grisham is rude and uncaring. He messed up my grade, and when I told him so, he scowled me out of his office. He later emailed me admitting he was wrong, and changed the grade. He did it again the second semester, and never admitted his mistake. He is cocky and rude to deal with in person."
12669,319101,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I've had at UVa. The quizzes are extremely unfair and stressful. Pre-med weed out class at it's best.
12670,319101,1.5,5.0,It was impossible to study for this class and ensure that you knew everything you needed to know for a quiz. He didn't explain things clearly and seemed unwilling to explain it further during office hours.
12671,319101,1.5,5.0,"I liked one of his lectures this semester and it was the very last one, which was semi interesting. Grisham speaks ridiculously fast and has really hard quizzes. Even if you study your butt off, which I did, it doesn't really help because he throws in little history questions to see if you were paying attention in lecture. Brace yourself."
12672,319101,2.0,4.0,"Grisham seems really interested in what he's teaching and willing to help, but he often moved too fast and simply read off the slides. I had a hard time following his thought process and felt the 5 quizzes throughout the semester did not reflect what we learned (there were random history questions, etc.) Aside from iclickers i saw no point in going"
12673,319101,3.0,4.0,"Grisham is an interesting and enthusiastic lecturer, but his quizzes are ridiculously hard.  He likes to include a lot of trick questions and random facts from his lectures (his way of making you go to class).  I would definitely not recommend taking him."
12674,319101,2.5,5.0,"This class was very difficult, mostly because quizzes asked questions about Chem history, such as how many times a person was nominated for the Nobel Prize. I suggest taking it with someone else who will test your knowledge of Chemistry and its application. Grisham reads off slides and comes off cold. His last lecture was the most interesting."
12675,319101,3.5,3.0,"A &quot;grit your teeth and get through it&quot; kind of class.  Quizzes are full of trick questions and historical trivia from lectures that don't measure your understanding of material.  Go to lecture just for the iClicker questions.  Grisham seems like a nice guy, but the class is a pain."
12676,319101,4.0,3.0,"One of the best classes I've ever taken. He is a very enthusiastic professor, and very willing to help students out. However, his quizzes and tests are very difficult. Not impossible, but you definitely have to work for them. Lectures are definitely worth going, because he mentions things in class that are often on the exams. Great class though!"
12677,319101,3.0,4.0,Tries to trick students with every question. Not assessed on understanding of fundamental material.
12678,319101,2.0,5.0,"Professor Grisham actually seems like a genuinely nice guy who cares about the class he teaches and cares about the students in his class succeeding (or that's what he leads you to believe by his personality in lecture), but it is very true that his quizzes/tests are ridiculous.  There are much easier professors at UVA."
12679,319101,2.0,5.0,"He is not helpful at all, like doesn't give you answers to practice exams so how are you supposed to know if you are doing problems right."
12680,319101,2.0,5.0,this man is the reason why i want to transfer out of UVA. worst class ever.
12681,319101,5.0,4.0,good enthusiastic teacher but hard tests
12682,319101,4.5,1.0,"Great teacher. Slides are clear and helpful, lectures enthusiastic. Quizzes and tests can be a little hard ? just read the book and do some practice. I really enjoyed how he threw a little chem history and &quot;chem in your world&quot; into the lectures. He asks a 1-2 outlandish questions on each quiz/test, just study quizzes from previous years (on collab)"
12683,319101,2.5,5.0,"Grisham isn't a bad teacher really, he just quizzes you on random information that doesn't matter that he decided to throw into his lectures. Avoid if you can to save your grade."
12684,319101,1.0,5.0,Grisham is a worthless piece of crap!
12685,319101,2.5,4.0,Hold very unrealistic expectations for it being an intro class. Expects us to spend AT LEAST 15 hrs/week studying Chem and isn't shy about saying it. Lectures are quite dense with material that must be memorized and largely mastered on our own. Breezes through material. Avoid taking unless you have to!
12686,319101,4.5,3.0,"The subject of chemistry is easy to some and hard to others. That in mind Professor Grisham is an excellent teacher.  His quizzes ARE harder than the others, but its all curved. He runs with the big dogs in the chem world, hes written multiple text books... I recommend him to people actually somewhat interested in chemistry, he wont disappoint."
12687,319101,4.5,4.0,"Not easy, but he is very smart and an interesting professor. he does take some getting used to. no need to take notes since he posts his slides and the slides cover everything important from the text. if you like chemistry I would take his section but if you are only fulfilling a requirement and don't care much for the subject, take someone else"
12688,319101,1.5,5.0,Grisham is one of the worst professors that I have had. Going to class is next to useless because he just reads off the slides and tells you to memorize everything. He gives tests meant for 3 hours in less than an hour.  He expects around 15 to 17 hours a week outside of class in order to get a C (includes project). DO NOT TAKE unless required.
12689,319101,4.0,5.0,"What everyone already said, reads directly from slides, slides are just condensed versions of the book, he wrote the book so you basically get it read to you in class, exams are wicked specific.  Yeah he's enthusiastic, but that can only go so far.  Study your ass off/have an innate ability to remember details and do well. Otherwise be cautious."
12690,319101,2.5,4.0,He's not as bad as the other chemistry professors when it comes to the lectures.  His exams are not as easy at Gerrans.  He definitely goes through the material quickly without too much explanation and the student is expected to learn mathematics of equations on his/her own.  He goes off on tangents that have little to do with actual chemistry.
12691,319101,1.5,5.0,do not ever take grisham's class. you will fail his exams and you wont even know why. I studied all the homework problems and the mastering chem and the old quizzes he posted and still had a below average quiz grade...this is from someone who's taken gen chem and 2 years of ib chem in high school. i do not recommend him as a teacher.
12692,319101,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Grisham is an amazing professor.  His enthusiasm makes learning way more interesting, and he tells tons of cool facts.  Class attendance is critical because he gives hints on what are on the exams.  Also, he wrote the textbook, so if you know the textbook, you should do fine on exams."
12693,319101,3.5,3.0,"Grisham himself is a nice guy and wants to make chemistry interesting for everyone. However, his style in presenting materials lacks the ability to capture the audience (ie he reads directly from the slides). The outside reading is not mandatory... I never read them, but I attended lecture and knew those &quot;random&quot; questions from there."
12694,319101,2.0,3.0,"Grisham is the WORST, I repeat WORST, professor ever! He gives TONS of outside reading, which is useless because he only puts one question about 20+ pages on the quiz. Also, going to lecture is boring because he reads DIRECTLY from the slides he posts. He also does not round grades up 0.5 points (I know from experience). Overall AVOID HIM!!!!!!!!!!"
12695,319101,1.0,5.0,AWFUL!!!!!!!!! He made me hate chemistry! He asks pointless questions on the exams that don't even test your knowledge on the material. He is not helpful AT ALL. If you go to his office hours he talks about random things that don't even relate to chemistry! He just likes to hear himself talk. Do NOT take him!
12696,319101,1.0,5.0,"Possibly the worst teacher at UVA.  He doesn't do any example problems, he tells you exactly what's in the book, and his quizzes don't represent the practice quiz/book problems, so you've basically got nothing to go on.  If you have to take this course, wait for Gerrans.  He's the only competent Gen Chem teacher."
12697,319101,2.5,4.0,He tries to &quot;make Chemistry interesting&quot; by talking a mile a minute. Merely reads off of slides made by the textbook but forces you to come to class by putting questions on the test about random facts he mentions in lecture. Tests aren't terrible - Mastering Chemistry is DIFFICULT. Take Gerrans.
12698,319101,2.0,4.0,Worst teacher I have ever had! He is out to prove that he is smarter than his students. He gives up to 50 pages of outside reading that shows up as a question on the test. No other chemistry professor does this. He also assigns impossible homework questions and is unwilling to provide worthwhile help until after the assignment is due. HE'S AWFUL!
12699,319101,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher, very enthusiastic about the subject which makes it a little easier to learn. Read the chapters and DO practice problems galore to prep for quizzes! They are very difficult and designed to be so. Office hours are a great help and Prof. Grisham is very approachable and willing to help :)"
12700,319101,2.5,5.0,"Very entertaining. Nice in person, terse in emails (understandably so). However, my problem was the quizzes. After doing every problem in the book, taking a different professor's quiz (and acing it!!), just to get a C on Grisham's version, it was hard to not get discouraged. Often, he'll synthesize complex concepts within one problem, so WATCH OUT!"
12701,319101,4.0,3.0,Very interested in his subject matter. GO TO CLASS!! he tells you what is on the quiz so no matter what people say you need to go. The quizzes are pretty fair. Best of the 3 teachers for 151...
12702,319101,4.5,4.0,"This guy's amazing! He is hilarious and super interesting and tells great stories. On the last day of class, which I'm in right now, he is giving this awesome talk on bizarre biochemistry which is so random but really really great. He wants us to learn and understand how chemistry applies to the real world, is very personable and basically the MAN."
12703,319101,4.0,2.0,"Grisham is hilarious.  Genuinely cares about his subject and teaching it as well as he can (he would often change his notes the morning of class to try to make it more clear.) Quizzes are tricky, but overall fair. Definitely best of the three gen chem professors."
12704,319101,5.0,3.0,"Grisham is really fantastic.  Of the three professors you can take for this class, there is no question that he is the best.  He's also hilarious and does a fantastic job of explaining everything in detail."
12705,319101,3.0,5.0,he is not a bad professor. But there is a problem with his assignments. And his quizes are tricky(questions about polar bears!)
12706,319101,4.5,2.0,Overall great professor. Explains concepts very well and does a great job relating them to the real world. Great sense of humor and nice guy to just talk to.  Very helpful with 1 on 1 help. He tells you everything that you will need to know for tests and quizzes.
12707,319101,3.0,3.0,"not as bad as people make it out to be. there's a lot to memorize, but he TELLS you what to memorize, so you really don't have to know every graph and table. very interesting lectures and knows how to make things understandable. however, tests are made by the TA and are extraordinarily mindless."
12708,319101,3.0,4.0,"In lectures, he discusses concepts.  In exams, he tests you on memorization.  Memorize all the little tables of data you come across that he mentions in class (he's good about telling you what you need, but lets you find it on your own time).  Interesting lectures, but the out-of-class time you need for a good grade is ridiculous."
12709,319101,5.0,4.0,"Great class, even better person (you'll realize this once u get landers for 442, 451). go to his office hours and memorize absolutely anything he says more than once (obviously)."
12710,319101,4.0,3.0,"Grisham has annoying tendency to be late to EVERYTHING. He makes the class a bit more manageable by giving BIG HINTS as to what will be on tests. That being said, those hints don't always materialize on the exams. He is not always clear in class but is always VERY excited to explain topics in great detail if you corner him..but good luck with that!"
12711,319101,1.0,5.0,"really bad, exams are not fair,nor are they in accordance to what he covers in his lectures. **** him"
12712,319101,4.0,4.0,"Busy because he's a touch over-extended, but good. Pre-meds can just memorize the book and get an A, or you can start a relevant conversation after class and get much more out of him. I got a C and B, but I'm now happily involved in medicinal chemistry and drug development, mostly due to his influence and that's far more important than the grades."
12713,319101,2.0,3.0,"He is by far the worst professor I ever had.  This isn't someone talking who is doing poorly either, I have a decent grade.  But he is terrible.  He never responds to emails, appears at office hours always 25 minutes late, and even skips office hours.  HE EVEN COMES IN LATE FOR TESTS.  I am embarassed that I pay $30,000 for this guy to teach me."
12714,319101,4.5,4.0,"Prof Grisham has to be one of the most interesting professors. His lectures are funny and he really loves teaching. The tests and quizzes are hard, but there are no surprises; he tells you to expect this or make sure you know that.  Go to office hours-they help a lot. Study every night!! This is not an easy course, but it is fair. An amazing class!"
12715,319101,3.0,3.0,No Comments
12716,319101,4.0,4.0,"don't really know how &quot;easy&quot; it is to memorize the amount of material in a 1200+ page book.  Don't get me wrong, he does love his book, however the 'outside of class' time that's required to make the A, makes you wonder why it's only 3 credits"
12717,319101,3.0,1.0,"Extremely easy class.  As 3/16/04 mentions, he cowrote the textbook, so all you have to do is memorize it."
12718,319101,3.0,4.0,"he's enthusiasitc, tests are difficult;fair but not resonable,if u take this class be expected to study everynight, he believes in quizing every class session,he really cares about his students..and his time is limited to only two class discussion a week"
12719,319101,5.0,1.0,"Java was a great class, a lot of fun, and I learned a lot. Take this USEM!"
12720,319101,2.5,5.0,"Memorization.  Memorize the textbook, he cowrote it."
12721,319101,2.5,1.0,No Comments
12722,188037,5.0,3.0,"This professor is inspirational, and perhaps the kindest man I have met on campus. While he may be old, he is non the less incredibly informative. Just take it in to listen to his course, judgement free. I find myself getting angry when I hear of people discrediting him for being crazy because to me: he is a brilliant professor. Better than any."
12723,188037,5.0,2.0,Amazing guy. lectures are so funny. bring your computer to mess around with while you listen and you'll be golden.
12724,188037,3.0,2.0,"Prof. Wagner's class is what you put into it. The class is easy with no final and only three papers, but his concepts are abstract and fascinating. Pretty interesting guy."
12725,188037,2.5,1.0,Honestly take this class for entertainment. What he says is really thought provoking if you don't write it off just for sounding crazy. He's a brilliant individual and you'll gain some new perspectives. A guaranteed A doesn't hurt anything either.
12726,188037,4.0,2.0,Roy Wagner was one of the best and most inspiring professors I had in my four years at UVA.  His lectures are amazing and will change the way you see the world if you come in with an open mind.
12727,188037,1.0,4.0,"It's made up of three papers, no final. Pick the most vague topic, find the study sheets about the topic, and then summarize them in your own words. Going to class is not necessary. Only reason to go to class would be to pick up the study sheets for the essays. I didn't learn much but it's an easy class with minimal work so I would recommend it."
12728,188037,1.0,2.0,"Roy is brilliant, but his lectures are a crapshoot; they can either be thought-provoking, or boring as hell. He frequently talks about his field work in Papua New Guinea and often digresses on topics totally unrelated to the books being discussed. If you cannot read and decipher his incomprehensible paper topics, then it will be difficult for you."
12729,188037,2.0,1.0,"The books were really interesting, and the papers easy and short, but going to lecture was useless. Instead of talking about anything relevant, he rambles about a bunch of random subjects and stories from when he was in New Guinea. Barely anyone showed up and I spent the time reading. I mean, he  seems like a nice guy, but he's a little out there."
12730,188037,1.0,2.0,I got an A but I cant say the class was all that easy. 3 Papers for the semester grade. None of the stuff I wrote made any sense and his essay prompts don't make any sense. Even if you don't think what you're writing is right just keep writing. Nothing about this class makes sense. I went to the first week or two of class and never went again.
12731,188037,5.0,1.0,"GREATEST PROF AT UVA, EVERY TEACHER SHOULD STRIVE TO BE MORE LIKE ROY, HES AMAZING."
12732,188037,1.0,1.0,"This is the easiest class at UVa. Three 3-5 page papers, no midterm, no final, no discussion. Roy Wagner is out there, but his lectures are HILARIOUS! Highly recommend!"
12733,188037,4.0,1.0,"This dude is the craziest teacher I have ever had, but it was amazing.  All you do is listen to him talk about crazy stories.  You can get by without going to class, but there isn't any reason to skip cause it's really easy."
12734,188037,2.0,1.0,"Stopped going to class halfway through the semester and still got an A. You won't miss much if you skip class, aside from picking up the &quot;study sheets.&quot; He does have some crazy stories. Wagner was once able to sing and cause one of his enemy's cars to break down. He can also pick up his cat's dreams."
12735,188037,2.5,1.0,"Don't let him scare you on the first day - you're not going to fail! Few people actually show up to the lectures. Crazy stories, but he's brilliant. He hates technology, so don't expect to be able to contact him via e-mail. Three 5-page papers, but he gives you study sheets. Supposed to read 9 books, but I got by with just skimming 3 of them."
12736,188037,2.5,2.0,"Honestly, I just stopped going to class. If you go to the end of class and pick up papers, you're solid. Professor Wagnor may seem like a whack-job, but he's an incredibly intelligent man. He offers a different way of thinking - something you don't usually get from normal college classes. This class was definitely not to difficult of a class."
12737,188037,4.0,3.0,"Professor Wagner will change the entire way you see the world.  You have to be persistent and approach him and learn his language.  While it is easy to write him off as a nut-job, within the anthropology department he is generally known as the most brilliant individual at UVA.  Without the ambition to approach him, you will miss out on a lot."
12738,188037,1.0,1.0,"Roy is a nutcase, but a really smart nutcase. Lectures are a total waste because he only talks about something relavant to the paper topics like 1 in 5 classes if that. If you put your name on the paper and write more than 2 pages, you'll get at least a B on them all. Two words: Athlete class."
12739,188037,1.0,1.0,"You don't need to go to class or read the books.  Either way, nothing will make sense.  None of the paper topics will make sense, but the crazier your paper is the better grade you get.  I went to one class and got an A-.  Don't take this class trying to learn something, take it to lighten you load one semester."
12740,188037,4.0,1.0,"not your typical class. don't go in there expecting it to be cut and dry like all the other classes. if you don't have an open mind or the desire to see the world in a way the society does not, don't bother. you're only going to get flustered. you have to be part crazy to understand the concepts. but whose defining the word crazy&#63; the drones."
12741,188037,1.0,3.0,"He SUCKS. Talks about nothing all class and leaves you high and dry for any sort of grades. Three essays are all you're graded on and its completely subjective on how you &quot;see&quot; the books. Trust me, even an amazing writer has the chance of a less than perfect grade in this class. If you think you're lucky or you don't care about a mediocre grade, th"
12742,188037,3.5,2.0,"Come to class with an open mind. The books and his lectures are kinda trippy, but you can't say they aren't interesting. Essay questions are challenging, but as long as you support your answer with examples from the books you're fine. The study sheets he hands out after lecture are key for the essays."
12743,188037,1.0,2.0,"He told us he summoned the wind god to class about twenty years ago and that it blew over three trees outside the classroom, enough said.  It's an easy class, where you don't really have to go to class unless you definitely want to seal an A.  The paper topics make no sense, but he loves nonsensical creativity."
12744,188037,4.0,4.0,Ignore the jokes about him smoking too much. Wagner takes apart your expectations of how mind and language work. Part & parcel to this is that he lives in another world. Look at it this way: his lack of clarity is a reprieve in a world where clarity is falsely equated with truth. BUT: SKIP IT if you are susceptible to mental breakdowns-I'm serious.
12745,188037,1.5,1.0,"amazingly off subject, but hilarious. most cracked out guy ever. Paper topics make as little sense as he does, but I want him to father all my children."
12746,188037,1.0,1.0,"Easiest class at UVA.  I picked up the syllabus on the first day, didn't go again, and got an A.  Write your essays as if you were in 4th grade i.e.  incomplete sentences, random punctuations, 1st person interjections... and you will do well.  TAKE DON JUAN"
12747,188037,2.0,2.0,don juan is a trip
12748,188037,2.5,1.0,"he obviously had fun in the 60s/70s, that really sums him up.. the paper topics dont make any sense, just read the books and do your best, he pretends to grade tough, but its all an act.. also, he doesnt have a computer, so u cant email him, theres no toolkit etc.. hes out there.."
12749,188037,2.5,2.0,"Aloof and sphinxlike, Wagner is fond of giving oblique paper topics which really get you thinking. However these are graded leniently, blunting the potential challenge. Makes himself inaccesible, which is off-putting. Interesting (if tangential) lectures. At the very least, a unique approach to anthro, but i'd like to be  challenged a bit more."
12750,188037,2.0,1.0,"Best. Lectures. Ever.  Have nothing to do with the class, but I laughed so hard I pissed myself every Tuesday and Thursday morning."
12751,188037,2.5,3.0,"If you want a teacher who lectures on stuff that you won't hear in any other class ever then take this class. The books are easy, the lectures can be boring or interesting, and the essay topics are insane, but grading isn't too hard."
12752,188037,1.5,1.0,This dude is wacked out from the 60s.  Rambles on about nothing in particular.
12753,188037,1.0,1.0,wierdest teacher in the world! i wrote doo doo for essays and never picked them up because he has you pick them up at his office- which is up a flight of really scary and steep stairs- like spiral stairs- im terrified of them! and the office is in the scariest building on grounds... i got a B+
12754,188037,1.0,4.0,wagner is not good. try something else.
12755,188037,3.5,1.0,"I love writing the essays for this class. They're so much fun! And the books are awesome. The prof has interesting lectures, though it's hard to follow at 930 in the morning. The lectures are not needed to do well in the course. Recommended."
12756,188037,2.5,2.0,"randomest lectures ever. full of himself, but has some good stories and every so often he presents an interesting concept. come to class with an open mind, otherwise you'll want to die."
12757,188037,1.5,2.0,"Easy Class, horrible teacher."
12758,188037,1.0,3.0,"He is one of the worst professors I have ever had, he makes no sense during lecture, he is not willing to help you, and his essay questions make no sense.  Do not take any of his classes!"
12759,188037,4.5,1.0,best classes ever!
12760,188037,2.0,1.0,"His lectures aren't worth much and his essay questions are weird, but the class is rather easy."
12761,188039,2.0,4.0,"Professor Geraci is a mediocre professor at best, and his lectures are no better. Although he generally seems like a decent guy, one can't overlook the clear flaws with his course."
12762,188039,3.0,2.0,"He's a decent professor, though at times the lectures can be dry. Regardless, one can easily attain a good grade by going through the motions and putting effort in."
12763,188039,1.0,5.0,This class is AWFUL. He does not cover nearly the amount of material in class that he expects you to know on his exams. He did not make his expectations clear at all before the first midterm. During lecture he goes off on random tangents but does not want students to ask questions because they distract him. DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS.
12764,188039,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Geraci knows Russian History. I do not doubt this.  However he is an absolutely terrible professor. His lectures have no direction, he is repetitive and gets himself distracted very easily. I learned absolutely NOTHING from his lectures. If you absolutely MUST take this Russian history course, then good luck. Otherwise, STAY OUT."
12765,188039,3.5,3.0,"The class has great content.   However, Geraci falls short as a teacher.   He often comes into class late only to express frustration when he didn't get through everything he wanted to do.  His lectures are a strange combination of powerpoint and notes and even with such teaching crutches he is often difficult to follow and contradictory."
12766,188039,3.0,5.0,"Impossible amount of reading and the primary sources are on the final!  Interesting content but too much reading with take home exams and paper.  We didnt have a TA to help us out this year, and from what I hear, that made the course SO much worse and so much more difficult, especially since we did not have quizzes to get easy grades, only 4 grades"
12767,188039,5.0,3.0,"I actually do not agree with the negative comments. Yes, he assigned about 8-12 books, but they were necessary in order to attain a good grasp on the the historical events. His teaching style was very clear. He used a very organized outline in class and he does aim at making sure his students understand his teaching. I think he was a good professor"
12768,188039,4.0,5.0,"TONS of reading.  I mean 12 books and he hardly limits the books to certain chapters.  The midterm was take home, but extremely lengthy and dense.  I got a b+ (15 pages later)  He is extremely passionate and knowledgeable, but steer clear if you're into tons of reading and essay papers."
12769,188039,1.5,5.0,"STAY AWAY!! $300 on books, very poor lecturer. Ruins interesting material."
12770,188039,3.5,2.0,"I disagree with a lot of the bad comments.  I never took any history and went for this one... I really like the class and the subject matter is interesting.  The novels are actually pretty good, + movies are offered.  Blakelely gives you easy quizzes I think just so they can have more grades.  I do wish the lectures were more interactive."
12771,188039,5.0,3.0,pretty interesting subject matter and he presents it really well.  very helpful during office hours.  incredibly knowledgeable about russian history - i thought it'd be a lot more boring than it was!
12772,188039,2.0,4.0,"Geraci is a bad lecturer and only focuses on obscure points rather than a general overview of Russian history, and the reading load is too much and the texts are WAY too detail-oriented and long for the kinds of questions asked on the quizzes. The good thing about the class was the TA, Blakeley Winslow. He was awesome!"
12773,188039,3.0,1.0,"Easy class.  There is a lot of reading, but all of the novels and biographies are at least engaging.  Not a good lecturer, but he does know a ton about the subject matter."
12774,188039,1.0,2.0,Horrible lecturer... worse of all i've ever seen...

12777,188039,1.5,3.0,"an awful class. he has rambling disjointed lectures and is utterly incompetant with the powerpoint. there are lots of pointless readings, useless quizes, a takehome midterm with impossibly short page limits. the only way to do well is to have a decent TA and already know the subject."
12778,188039,3.0,3.0,Geraci gets my award for being the best at making Russian history BORING.  Everything just started to run together.  He does know his stuff though.  The quizzes are purely memorization - be prepared to pull facts out of the air - no mc!
12779,188039,2.5,3.0,"the class would be a lot better if he didn't make it seem more boring than it is.  the material is actually pretty interesting.  the readings get pretty long after about 5 weeks, so it's hard to keep up with them.  i am yet to experience the final, but i'm sure it will be hard. blah"
12780,188039,2.0,3.0,"Who would have thought that someone could make communist revolution and assassination seem so dull&#63;  Well, take this class and find out - that is, if you can survive his lectures.  A good TA can make up for some of it, but beware lectures are pretty slow."
12781,188039,2.0,3.0,"How could Russian history be so boring&#63;  Terrible lecturer, probably means well.  Not hard, though.  You can easily get by without going to class.  But is that really how you want to spend your life&#63;"
12782,188039,2.0,3.0,terrible lecturer...
12783,188039,2.5,4.0,"seems ok at first, but in the end is pointless, boring, and has awful paper topics."
12784,188039,2.0,4.0,I never realized someone could make Russia so boring.
12785,1400458,1.0,5.0,"By far the worst classroom experience of my life. Me and my one other classmate were always confused and despite our countless questions and after class study sessions, we were still left in the dark. The assignments were boring and difficult. Her cold attitude made it really difficult to approach for help. I would not recommend taking!"
12786,188044,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Grissom is the best professor at UVA. Fair, humble and understanding. I love that man. He is my hero."
12787,188044,5.0,1.0,The sweetest guy. Extremely helpful.
12788,188044,4.5,1.0,"Wonderful professor! Kind, laid-back, funny. His lectures are clear, fun, and easy, and teach you a ton of great stuff about theater without much stress. You have to write a paper and several reviews of UVa plays, but I enjoyed seeing the plays and the papers aren't graded hard. Come to class, since exams are easy but based on lectures."
12789,188044,5.0,1.0,"One of my favorite profs@UVA: smart, enthusiastic, an all-around cool person. He's extremely approachable + pretty laid back. Playwriting coursework isn't too heavy (a few scenes per month). He always creates a fun atmosphere- no one is ever afraid 2share their stuff. good for any1 interested in writing, theater, or a fun break from reg. classes."
12790,188044,5.0,1.0,I think the whole basketball team was in it when I took it.  Very easy class as long as you attend every lecture.  Only need to do the reading when he says he's going to discuss a particular play.
12791,188044,5.0,1.0,gut class. all the jocks are in it. take down a couple notes every class and you'll be fine.
12792,188044,5.0,1.0,"easy class. boring at times, but is just based on facts; no theoretical bs. tempting to skip class, but try not to b/c thats where the tests (multi-choice) come from. easy paper grader and doens't take attendence.  i suggest taking it, esp if u want to raise ur GPA."
12793,188044,4.0,1.0,"Easy, fun class. Grissom is understanding, helpful, and a fairly lenient grader. Tests are multiple choice. Attending class is the best way to make an A  because tests come straight from notes and in-class presentations."
12794,188044,4.5,1.0,"Very easy if you attend class and pay attention. Outside work is limited and also very easy. Great teacher, very laid back, nice, understanding"
12795,188044,4.5,1.0,take this class if you can because its very easy and the prof is really nice.
12796,188044,5.0,2.0,a real lifesaver - oversaw an independent study project for me that helped me graduate - gave me excellent feedback on my writing
12797,188044,5.0,1.0,"Sure, it's a gut, but if you put in some effort you can learn a lot about the theater."
12798,949903,5.0,1.0,i thought he was a great teacher. his appearence was a distracting though.
12799,949903,5.0,1.0,Top marks!  A great guy and a fun teacher!
12800,188049,4.0,3.0,"With everything happening with the pandemic, I believe professor Smith was one of the few who was understandable!! He gave a decent amount of work and recorded all of his lectures. He gave you a decent amount of time to complete everything. Def a great person overall. Would recommend."
12801,188049,2.0,4.0,Whole class is based off of 3 exams. The lectures are boring. Professor is a good person but his structure of the class is lazy. Very unsatisfied
12802,188049,4.0,4.0,"Awesome lectures-hes very straightforward and the grading criteria is always clear. the class only has 4 grades (multiple choice tests), so not a lot of room for error. No final. He  is very organized and easy to follow. also a super nice guy in general. beware though the multiple choice tests are tricky, not as easy as you'd expect."
12803,188049,5.0,2.0,"HE'S MY FAVE!! The Plants People and Culture class was the best. The material is SO interesting and you learn so much. He is super funny and nice and really knowledgeable about the information. The course teaches you about plants and how they are used for food, medicine and alcohol. All tests are multiple choice and no readings or cumulative final!"
12804,188049,4.0,3.0,"Professor Smith is a very nice and knowledgeable professor.  Simply, he is a straight-shooter when it comes to tests, and he is a wealth of information in lecture.  With Plants, People and Culture specifically, it definitely is recommended that you attend lecture, but it is not required."
12805,188049,5.0,3.0,An incredibly nice guy and a great lecturer. Definitely take
12806,188049,5.0,3.0,"Tom Smith is undoubtedly an amazing professor. Every lecture was phenomenal and kept me interested the whole way through.  However, tests can be hard and the study guides can be a bit misguiding.  He didn't quite explain what would be on each test, so the first one everyone did pretty well then the second people tanked. Still a great class though!"
12807,188049,4.5,2.0,"Don't buy the textbook! As long as you go to class and study a minimal amount, you should pass with at least a B. Going to class is more important in the end than in the beginning as the tests get harder and harder. Also he'll have opportunities to for you to get extra points on random days, so even though class is boring, GO!"
12808,188049,4.5,2.0,"Class is made up of three exams. Exams get harder. Class attendance isn't mandatory but if you want a good grade, you should go. To study, read over his Powerpoints and look at the terms on the study guide. Class is a basic high school science class, so go to class and study a day in advance of exams and you should get at least a B."
12809,188049,3.0,4.0,Class is boring.  The exams are very difficult and require memorization.  Questions are written in a way to really confuse the students.  There are only 3 exams and he really doesn't care if you do well or not.
12810,188049,4.5,2.0,"Awesome Professor. He is such a nice man and very helpful. Dont buy the textbook he even advises not to buy it ( and he wrote it). The class is very straight forward, most things come from slides others from paying attention.Cool guy :)"
12811,188049,5.0,1.0,COOLEST EVER
12812,188049,4.0,2.0,Awesome teacher.  Subject matter is challenging but Smith makes it understandable.  NOTE: Lab is VERY challenging and takes a lot of effort crammed into a short amount of time.  Lab not recommended if you don't have to take it. TA's run labs.
12813,188049,5.0,1.0,Very good teacher.  Excellent explanations. Extremely flexible with office hours. Keeps you up to date and wants students to succeed.  1010 is very easy.
12814,188049,5.0,1.0,"One of the best professors I've had.  Very helpful and flexible.  Attendance isn't required and the class itself isn't very difficult.  All the test questions come right from his class slides and he gives you outlines with the topics that will be on the test.  If you have the opportunity, definitely take a class with him"
12815,188049,4.5,1.0,"He is the nicest man in the world. He will help you with anything. You don't have to buy the book or go to class. There are only 3 tests for your grade, based on the slides that he posts online. He makes it easy for those who have to take this class to fulfill a science requirement."
12816,188049,4.5,2.0,"I really enjoyed this class. For a non-science person, the information was interesting and accessible. I definitely learned a lot and really enjoyed Professor Smith's enthusiasm and friendliness."
12817,188049,1.0,5.0,Horrible class. Horrible professor. He does not teach at all and reads off slides and then tests you on stuff that don't appear on the slides. Much more difficult than it should have been. Never responds to e-mails and I could never get in to see him during office hours. Avoid this class.
12818,188049,5.0,2.0,"EVSC 320 is not THAT easy. 4 exams 25% each. Exam format is all free response and not multiple choice. He doesn't let you write nonsense answers so you have to get them right. He is, however, very nice. Possibly one of the nicest professors I've ever met at UVA. Overall a pretty easy class for a major level class."
12819,188049,1.0,4.0,"I took this class to raise my science GPA. That didn't happen. I'm the type of person who loves lectures, but even these bored me. I tried to listen, but he really doesn't make sense. Try to avoid."
12820,188049,4.5,1.0,"Smith is a Great professor with a exceptional command of the material--he literally wrote the book on the subject.  Go to class, study briefly for the exams, and you will almost certainly receive an A."
12821,188049,3.5,2.0,"EVSC 101 is pretty low-key and doesn't require the textbook.  The lectures were not necessarily enthralling but Tom Smith knows his material very well (going to office hours is very worthwhile).  I learned a bit, but I probably could have gotten more if I had actually read the textbook and understood the details, which aren't always given in class."
12822,188049,4.0,1.0,He is a really good professor who really cares about his students. There are 4 tests that are each 25% and there is no curve. he posts slides on toolkit so going to lecture is not totally necessary
12823,188049,4.5,1.0,"He is probably the most helpful professor I've ever had. He has no problem rescheduling tests if you have a conflict and he really loves the material. The text book is optional and he posts the slides online before class along with outlines so you don't really need to go, but if you do go then you really don't have to study for the tests."
12824,188049,5.0,1.0,"Just as they say it is. The EASIEST science course at UVA. Book is written by him, yet he encourages you NOT to buy it. Pop quizzes are extra credit, tests straight from powerpoints online. As a science major, this was a great GPA booster. All I wanna know is...how come there arent any courses like this in the politics or history departments&#63;"
12825,188049,4.5,1.0,This class is great. You never have to attend or buy the text. He is very clear about his teaching plan as well!
12826,188049,5.0,2.0,hey is so great! especially for those non-science oriented students who think that theywill never make an A in a science class. He makes it possible
12827,188049,5.0,1.0,"Best teacher, willing to help and very enthusiastic about his subject"
12828,188049,5.0,1.0,"to describe it in a sentence: the EASIEST sci req. class for a non-science major. 3 words to describe it: EASY, EASY, EASY. Just go sign up for it, why do you waste your time reading this comment&#63;&#63; Don't you want an A/A+ &#63;&#63;&#63; seriously this is a joke class. Going to class reduces study time for tests but not necessary."
12829,188049,5.0,1.0,"Very approachable man.  Very kind man.  Wonderful class in part because there is very little outside studying needed.  Dont buy the book.  You dont need to.  Everything he says in on the slides and even if you dont go to class, he gives out pre-tests to make sure you dont fail the exam.  Very kind man."
12830,188049,5.0,1.0,"TAKE THIS if you need a science credit. As much as I like Prof. Smith, the class is a joke - you learned 99% of this stuff in elementary school. Pop quizzes (that can only help you), four easy tests, and no final. He is friendly and approachable. I never even took the shrink wrap off my book and still got an A."
12831,188049,5.0,1.0,this class is awesome.. take it because u will most likely get an a.. plus the professor is awesome and makes ur life as easy as possible!
12832,188049,5.0,2.0,an easy class.. good to fill the science requirement.  he doesnt require you to do any reading and he always lets the class out early. there is no final exam just a third test
12833,188049,5.0,1.0,"this class literally is a joke. he even said it himself- he prides himself on teaching the easiest class to fulfill your science requirement. lectures arent too bad and are never as long as the time slot allows. hes such a cute professor and really into his material. take this class to fulfill your science requirement- no reading, no calculations."
12834,188049,4.5,1.0,"Pretty easy; however, the tests are a bit pickier than he portrays in class. I never bought the book but went to every class, printed the powerpoints, and took notes. I got an A. He's SUPER HELPFUL so go to his office hours if you have problems.  He's willing to work with you even if you bomb a test.  Recommend, just bring coffee to class."
12835,188049,4.0,1.0,"Very easy for a 300 level class. Interesting subject, good lecturer, but the tests are hardly worth studying for because they're so flippin' easy. And he's a nice guy too."
12836,188049,4.5,2.0,"Very mild for a major-level class. He is a very nice and approachable guy, but his lectures are known to induce sleep. The tests are pretty straightforward and you can really tell he wants everyone to do equally well. The book is useless, and lectures do serve the purpose of expanding on the notes posted on the internet."
12837,188049,4.0,3.0,"This is easy for a major-level class. For all the time he talks, he says very little, which is what makes him boring. Tests are not a breeze-he's more picky on them that you would expect, compared to the broadness he portrays in lecture. Still a pretty easy class though. I never read, went to most of lecture (slept a littl though), and I expect a B"
12838,188049,4.5,3.0,"Really nice and approachable. Good lecturer. The class itself requires very little reading. He posts review sheets and previous tests for each exam. Exams were straight forward and fair, but not necessarily easy."
12839,188049,4.5,3.0,"NOT AS EASY AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS! He's a nice guy and his tests are pretty straight-forward. BUT, you do need to study or else you won't get an A. It's not a complete breeze by any shot. Minimal effort, yes. But still effort."
12840,188049,5.0,1.0,"Prof Smith is such a nice guy and the class is definitely the easiest i've taken at UVA.  If you glance over the slides before the test you will get at least a B.  Easy way to fill a gen ed, but extremely boring."
12841,188049,3.0,2.0,"Ecology is pretty easy - I went only to take exams and got a B in the class.  I figure had I gone to class it would have been an easy A.  If you need to fulfill the science requirement, this is definitely a good way to do it.  It is definitely boring though (hence why I failed to attend lecture)"
12842,188049,5.0,1.0,"go through lecture notes and practice exams on toolkit before each test, and its an easy A."
12843,188049,5.0,1.0,Easiest class EVER!!
12844,188049,3.0,2.0,Nice guy.. and not that hard... want a fairly easy class try this
12845,188049,5.0,1.0,"For those of you looking for an extremely easy class that can, at times, be interesting, EVSC 120 is your best bet.  Prof. Smith is an awesome guy who is willing to help with anything and everything.  Dont buy the book!!!  Waste of 100 bucks.  Also, make sure to complete the practice tests."
12846,188049,4.0,2.0,"Great class, not hard.  Study and you'll do well.  Professor is fun and all the necessary notes are there for you so you can follow lecture very well."
12847,188049,3.0,2.0,"The class is really easy.  If you look over the notes and do the practice tests, you'll do well.  Lecture is really hard to sit through, so I rarely do, and I have an A in the class.  The book is completely optional.  Dr. Smith is really nice and very approachable."
12848,188049,4.0,2.0,No Comments
12849,188049,5.0,2.0,"Take ECOLOGY!!!  It is an easy class...I don't even own the book.  You don't have to go to class really--lectures are online.  And we have 2 take home tests per semester!  Its good class.  EASY!!  Take ECOLOGY, you won't regret it."
12850,188049,3.0,2.0,Make sure you study the practice tests and you'll do fine.
12851,1621654,4.0,2.0,"What you will gain from this class: 
1) Business Mindset (how to become an entrepreneur in action)
2) Business Notions (a lot of useful tools such as business model canvas, value propositions, etc.)
3) Connections and Experience (they invite many guest speakers)

What you won't learn from this class:
1) How to start a company
2) Legal Issues"
12852,2432681,2.0,4.0,"The only grade is tests. They are open note, 25 questions, and you have 2 hours to take them. Couple questions are straight up unfair. Hence why the averages would be an 80. I rewatched every lecture recording until my notes were a transcript of his lectures and still couldnt get an A. You can do fine with hard work, but getting an A is just luck."
12853,2432681,1.0,5.0,The worst professor I've ever had. Orgo was easier than taking one of his exams. I honestly recommend not taking this class if you can avoid it. I honestly hope they kick him out because his exams were poorly designed and seemed like he made them last minute because he would always have problems with it and email us about it.
12854,2432681,1.0,5.0,He won't respond to emails. His exams include answer choices that are ambiguous like &quot;some of the above&quot;. Some of his questions don't correlate to what he taught in lecture. Doesn't give you anything to study from besides some useless study questions. He'll email you during the exam and tell you there are problems with questions. Honestly the worst
12855,2432681,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Parichy is a great lecturer and makes a lot of references to his own research during his lectures. I really enjoyed having him as a professor this semester. He was very detail oriented in lectures and on exams, but studying hard and paying close attention will ensure success!"
12856,2432681,2.0,5.0,"Parichy is extremely knowledgeable in genetics but his lectures are difficult to follow, and his exams often require specific details from examples in class. The textbook barely followed the course material and was not much help. The study questions he provided as exam prep were not very useful either. Avoid unless your major requires his class."
12857,581313,1.0,4.0,The worst professor I had so far. If you are thinking taking his class just find another professor
12858,581313,1.0,4.0,Worst teacher ive had at UVA
12859,581313,1.0,5.0,Tested on items not discussed in lecture or in the book. Rambled on for the lecture and does iclicker questions. Makes you use fly genome sites for the exam when he doesn't explain where to look for the answer. Horrible.
12860,581313,1.0,1.0,Not helpful at all.
12861,581313,1.0,2.0,"Awful. Just terrible. His tests are too difficult to do well on, but he is an absolutely terrible professor. He doesn't explain anything, goes of on random, useless tangents, and basically teaches nothing."
12862,581313,3.0,2.0,Hirsh is the easiest teacher of the three in genetics. He seems like a confusing/boring professor at first until you get to Adler and Cronmiller. Study hard for his tests because it is easy to get a good grade if you do! You want to save your dropped score for Cronmiller's section.
12863,581313,2.5,4.0,"Was usually boring, but the slides contain everything you need.  Just look at the pictures in the book and read the caption underneath for clarification.  Tests were a little tricky, but you get to drop 1/6.  Can contact him through email.  He will answer quickly, but sometimes will not tell you the answer."
12864,581313,1.0,5.0,"Terrible professor.  His lectures make absolutely no sense, he goes into way too much detail, and he can't explain anything with clarity."
12865,581313,1.5,5.0,Bad
12866,581313,1.5,5.0,"He makes no sense, asks hard questions, and has TAs that give quizzes on the material he did not teach.  He refused to give me a test a day early despite my necessary travel due to my ailing grandfather's 80th birthday...heartless, a total lack of compassion and teaching ability."
12867,581313,1.0,4.0,the worst.  avoid this class and this professor whenever possible.  does useless demonstrations and can't explain the concepts with clarity to save his life.
12868,581313,2.5,4.0,No Comments
12869,581313,1.5,3.0,"Professor Hirsh, of course, is a bad professor.  What these raters don't know is that he not only is a terrible lecturer, but he is a terrible person.  Only the worst kind of person would waste hundreds and hundreds of students' tuition by making lectures vague at best and by giving the most useless and daft examples of the utility of biology."
12870,581313,2.0,2.0,"Strange organization of powerpoint slides. Lots of unnecessary detail. Not always clear. However people should stop whining about him telling us to &quot;figure things out yourself&quot;, because 1. they're generally easy things like PCR 2. God equipped you with a brain for a reason."
12871,581313,1.0,4.0,GAWD AWFUL LECTURER!!! Didn't really explain anything.
12872,581313,4.5,3.0,Hirsh rox my sox!
12873,581313,1.0,4.0,He asks rediculous questions in class and expects you to answer them.  He will ask a question and then wait...and wait...and wait until someone says something.  He also makes people do presentations to make up for his lack of teaching.  He seems very well versed in his field but just not an effective teacher.
12874,581313,2.0,1.0,"He's aight.  Sometimes he doesn't make any sense, but he does incorporate some pretty interesting topics.  Problem is you have to go online and &quot;figure them out for yourself&quot; if you want to understand it.  Tests are pretty easy and fair.  When you ask him a question he acts like you're a total dumb ass."
12875,581313,1.0,4.0,"So Im sitting in this dudes class and I havent got the slighest clue what hes talking about. Something about seeing in 3d and how the book sucks. and &quot;how it's worth spending some time figuring this out for ourselves&quot;.  Also, in case you were wondering, his brother's son is albino. Hirsh sucks...steer clear."
12876,581313,1.0,5.0,"All he does is critize the book, and say &quot;you're going to have to figure this out yourself at home.&quot; When I went to him for help he was so rude, and even said I am so  hungry I want to go eat. Total lack of concern for students."
12877,581313,1.0,5.0,Rude. Does not care about students. Lectures are hard to follow.
12878,581313,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher, very lively. If you get alarmed for whatnot reason, know that the test will be fair and pay attention to the &quot;you have to figure that out for yourselves&quot; points, - those make good test questions and he hints at the answer very unequivocally shortly beforehands."
12879,581313,1.0,4.0,"terrible professor, very unfriendly, unwilling to help students. is pleased when students do poorly"
12880,581313,1.0,5.0,"Nice guy, but absolutely worthless as a professor.  Classic example of knowing a lot, but not having a clue how to convey it.  Steer clear of Mr. Hirsch."
12881,581313,1.0,5.0,He loves to say &quot;You'll have to figure it out for yourself&quot; after every slide.  What are we paying him for&#63; He is a bad teacher.  He gloats about ivy league schools that other people went to & got awards.His test was not as bad as expected. He is confusing and not helpful.
12882,581313,1.5,2.0,"Name drops all the time. He'll let you know that he did undergrad in Cambridge, Mass. Chooses not to teach, but rather tells to read the book and figure it out yourself."
12883,581313,2.5,4.0,Went too fast through material and had hard tests. Would have been better if I'd taken him for Bio 201 & 202.
12884,581313,3.0,3.0,No Comments
12885,581313,2.5,4.0,"Very intimidating in upper level biology. I always stumble around him. If he likes you, your fine, but if he doesnt or he gets a bad first impression, its over...."
12886,581313,5.0,2.0,Great teacher who is always willing to talk about whatever you want.  Goes out of his way to help students.  Highly recommended.
12887,1015491,4.0,3.0,"Notes are extremely clear, very organized. She does have an accent, but she writes everything on the board, so it shouldn't be a problem. Quizzes are taken straight from practice problems online, and midterms/the final are definitely harder, but not insane."
12888,1015491,4.0,4.0,"Do not be fooled. Her notes are super organized and she is always willing to help. If you look at the online questions she posts then you are set to ace the quizzes. However, most of your grade depends on her midterms and final, which is dead-on difficult to the borderline impossible. If you care about your grade, don't take this class."
12889,1015491,4.0,3.0,She definitely knows what she is doing. She is very nice and can explain the subject very well.
12890,1015491,4.0,5.0,"Good class and great professor. Econ is a dry topic but she actually makes it quite interesting (to me). Midterms/finals are hard, but is not impossible. She is a fair and to an extent, lenient grader. Take her class."
12891,1015491,5.0,2.0,"Interesting, funny, and cute!"
12892,1015491,5.0,3.0,"I had her in summer school and I am glad she was the instructor. She is extremely good at explaining things and always willing to help you if you have problems. She tries to make the class interesting by showing movies, giving real life examples etc. Her exams are challenging, but if you study the lecture notes you will be fine. She is also hot!"
12893,1171142,4.5,1.0,"easy class to follow because he haa nice boardwork and organized his ideas well... he really lit up when he would tell us why something was important and fundamental. highly recommend him for this class... oh, and don't buy the textbook!"
12894,1171142,5.0,3.0,"great TA... learned more from him than from the professor ... take anything you can from him, i'm sure it'll be interesting"
12895,1171142,5.0,4.0,"Awesome, he made 9am class enjoyable. he's very funny, makes sure everyone is on the same page, and answers questions in a thought-provoking way. I agree that he is one of the best math profs"
12896,1171142,3.0,3.0,relaxed about the class but very irritable...if i had not taken calculus before i would have been completely lost...problems on the tests and homework were at times harder than those he worked
12897,1171142,5.0,2.0,He's probably the best professor out of the Calc 121 series. He extends office hours and really makes an effort to help the students. Great guy.
12898,1171142,4.0,5.0,"he's a really nice instructor and makes sure that everyone understands what's going on. because... you're generally focusing on his lips, not what's coming out of them."
12899,360134,1.0,2.0,"Professor Lillard once hopped over a row of chairs to cold call someone.  She's extremely passive aggressive and will berate the class in a chill-inducing kindergarten voice, especially for sitting in the non-computer section with a laptop.  She really hates laptops.  Lots of reading and iClickers which count for an unreasonable portion of grade :("
12900,360134,1.0,3.0,"I do not recommend this class, insane grading system, does not return assignments until day before or after next assignment is due so no time to fix any mistakes if you missed anything, changes the criteria many times throughout the semester. She is just completely unorganized!"
12901,360134,1.0,4.0,"Summary: abusive grading scale, unimportant/mandatory lectures, cold calls, 

To anyone trying to take this class with Lillard, DO NOT. This class is more than brutal. Lillard has a grading scale that is insane. This scale is used to fail students, and is used as a way to abuse power in the classroom.

Singles out students + harms your confidence."
12902,360134,1.0,4.0,"Prof Lillard seems so sweet when the class begins then turns into a nightmare. A student started sobbing after Prof took her phone off of her lap, because she has a no tech policy (It was faced down and clearly wasn't in use) w/the consequence of an 8pg paper. As if we aren't adults responsible for our own learning. Her grading is the worst, ever."
12903,360134,1.0,3.0,The way that she grades makes absolutely ZERO sense. It's completely unfair.
12904,360134,1.0,3.0,Class was okay I guess. Specifications grading is nice and I thought I liked it until I did a 45 page book as extra credit for an A only to realize I didn't use a correct source on a random weekly essay in October and ended up with a B+ for the entire class. Did ALL the work for an A and got a B+ just because of one article.
12905,360134,1.0,2.0,"Professor does not care and is all over the place. Constantly contradicts herself. Very unclear grading system. Heavy on in-class iClicker questions; miss one and you're absent. If you miss more than 5 classes or come in late, good chance you'll fail the class. Worst professor I've ever had. Would not recommend unless you could take it online."
12906,360134,5.0,1.0,"I don't know what everyone else here is talking about but this was the easiest and most interesting class I've taken. No tests or quizzes at all so I didn't even have to take notes in class, just listen to her lecture. The essays are easy and professor lillard makes it so easy to get an A. I definitely suggest taking this class."
12907,360134,4.0,3.0,"Overall fine. Graded on 500 word papers based on a scholarly article, plus iClicker participation/correctness. About 80-100 pages of reading a week. However, with the way she prowled the aisles waiting to steal someone's phone and call them out in our 300 person lecture, no one really respected her by the end. Sometimes boring, but not hard."
12908,360134,2.0,1.0,"If you don't miss class, you'll have an easy A. If you can't stand to sit through a boring lecture or go to a class with no academic motivation, it's not the class for you. Essays, in-class questions on readings, and attendance are pretty much the only grades, all weighted equally."
12909,360134,3.0,2.0,Literally so much reading but if you put in the work you'll do fine. Uses specifications grading. Lectures super boring but you have to go because of iClickers. She took someone's phone out of their hand in the middle of class and they have to right a 5 page research paper because of it. Class isn't hard if you read and write well. No tests.
12910,360134,4.0,1.0,"This past semester the grades were based on weekly essays and then iclicker questions. Essays were short (around 500 words) and you could skip two. They didn't grade harsh at all, so the class was easy to get at least an A- in. She might be boring sometimes, but she truly cares about if her students are actually learning. Interesting PSYC course."
12911,360134,1.0,4.0,"It's not that the class itself is impossible, but she's very particular about so many things. She's very persistent about everyone sitting in front for participation. She really enjoys talking about herself as well. You just have to be present for every lecture, paying attention thoroughly. The exams are also not extremely difficult."
12912,360134,1.5,3.0,"Control freak, poor lecturer, and constantly interrupting a 200 person lecture to single out one person on their phone. While not a hard class, this professor is not worth it."
12913,360134,1.5,2.0,"Not a very tough class in the end, but I ended up dreading it. She's a terrible lecturer, and essentially convinces you you're going to get written up for an honor violation regardless of whether or not you've done anything wrong. Attendance is mandatory due to iClicker questions, but beyond that, lecture is all but worthless."
12914,360134,1.5,3.0,"Everyone who says this lady is a control freak and in love with handing out honor violations is right. It's not an extremely difficult class, but she is not a good person or professor. Think twice about taking her class."
12915,360134,4.0,2.0,Very hardcore professor. Makes everyone sit packed at the front and is very obsessed with plagiarism. Interesting topic but intimidating professor.
12916,360134,5.0,1.0,"This class isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  Professor Lillard knows her stuff and expects you to learn it as well.  If you are analytical and good with writing the class is relatively easy, but intellectually rewarding."
12917,360134,2.5,5.0,"two words. HONOR CHARGES. if you want them, take a class with her. she is scary."
12918,360134,1.0,5.0,"I entered this upper level &quot;Theory of Mind&quot; course a couple of weeks late..had to catch up.  I'm usually astute enough to do well under such circumstances, but this was challenging.  Wish I had been focused from the very beginning.  Subject matter was fascinating - would have enjoyed graduate school, but got a C+ (worst grade). Pithy writing key."
12919,360134,2.5,4.0,"Lillard is an intimidating, even threatening teacher.  She would scream at students in class and stalk the aisles of the lecture hall just to glare at students, then go back to her kindergarten voice.  She didn't respond to e-mails but preferred students CALL her.  She is obsessed with plagiarism and has accused students of it the last 2 semesters."
12920,360134,2.5,4.0,"Lillard definitely knows her material, and gets it across clearly. I could always pay attention in class, yet she often called people out for talking or possible honor offenses. The midterm and final papers are graded hard. Make your writing simple and concise. Go to your TA or Lillard to discuss your project before hand."
12921,360134,3.0,4.0,"Lillard is a good communicator and she cares about the material. However, she is annoying and kind of crazy sometimes.  She is a little to obsessed with plagiarism and her class is like High School in the sense that she tries to make sure people are paying attention and says she will kick you out of class if you get on facebook in class."
12922,360134,2.5,3.0,"Wow this lady is a little scary. Iclickers can be tricky especially when they are on movies. My advise: stay away, take something else. The material was interesting, she shot down my interest like an expert skeet shooter! Also discussions with TAs are harshly graded, impossible to get over a 3.4 out of a 4!"
12923,360134,2.0,3.0,Control freak and not approachable. Very nosey and dont dare to move an inch in her 150 person lecture class or she thinks you are extremely disruptive or cheating.
12924,360134,3.0,3.0,The subject/textbook was very interesting-however Lillard really does patrol the classroom to check if you're on facebook during lecture.  She refuses to let you make up I-clickers even if you are working on your project for her class (20 of your grade). I hated how the two essays and I-clickers were most of your grade.  Take another psych class!!
12925,360134,4.0,3.0,"Interesting subject and, once you get used to her style, interesting lectures. It's especially great when children actually come to the class! BUT discussion sections are tedious, and your grade hinges on iClickers and 2 essays. If you only want to take 1 or 2 psych classes overall I might not recommend it."
12926,360134,2.0,4.0,"I was much more interested in the material than the overall class.  She would always pace around and look for people not paying attention, which was intimidating.  It was almost like a high school class all over again.  If you pay attention, the iClickers will be easy.  I didn't like that your entire grade is based around two essays and iClickers."
12927,360134,3.5,3.0,She's crazy - she paces around lecture halls to see if people are on facebook and will not hesitate to stick the mic in someone's face if they are talking. This erratic behavior was distracting while in class.  Read and you'll be fine for iClickers. I like the subject more than the presentation of the material by Lillard.
12928,360134,3.0,4.0,No Comments
12929,360134,2.5,4.0,Professor Lillard has two major projects that compose half of your grade but does not clearly explain what she expects from these projects.  She also requires a great deal of reading but you are tested on very little of it.
12930,360134,5.0,1.0,"Professor's lectures work well to clarify information from the textbook and to add to that knowledge. While occasionally the lectures are dry and most lectures follow the same format, this class should be interesting to anyone with a vested interest in psychology."
12931,360134,2.0,3.0,"Professor Lillard had her moments, but the class was pretty boring overall. And I really don't agree with some of her teaching methods. I thought Child Psychology would be interesting until I stepped into this class. The discussion sections were the only thing I really liked about this class."
12932,360134,3.5,4.0,"I don't know why everyone dislikes Prof. Lillard. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot. There's 3 or 4 iClicker questions per class, and iClickers count for 25% of your grade, so attendance definitely counts for something. 2 papers, one of which is an essay on a project. And there's a weekly section meeting, which was great."
12933,360134,3.5,1.0,"She should talk more about psychology and less about herself. She should also give assignments that test material she taught, and not the entire book as a whole in 4 pages. check minus."
12934,360134,2.5,3.0,"I have one word for this class - disappointment! I used to believe that psychology was a misunderstood science, but now I'm led to believe it's a wanna-be science full of crap. Don't bother taking this class. The TAs were horrible as well."
12935,360134,2.5,4.0,"Lillard's style of teaching vaporized my interest in child psychology. Grading was on 2 papers and a project. It was tough. And this course doesn't even fulfill the 2nd Writing Req. If you're even slightly interested in psychology, avoid her before she vaporizes your interest too."
12936,360134,2.5,4.0,"she definitely manages to make a very interesting subject boring. no tests- just papers and she grades those extremely tough. attendance manadatory because of annoying comprehension checks- which sometimes have trick &#63;s on them- definitely take child psych, but not with lillard"
12937,360134,1.0,4.0,"She is really spacy and her Child Psych class is boring and does not follow the book.  She also spent like three days talking about the Montessori program, something that wasnt even in the book.  I would not recommend her."
12938,360134,2.5,4.0,"Ugghhhh. She was terrible! I am a psych major and HATED this class. There are no tests, only essays and the grading was very tough."
12939,360134,3.5,3.0,"i was super interested in the class beforehand, but slowly found the class boring...Lillard sometimes made such a great topic incredibly dull.."
12940,360134,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed Child Psych- a lot of the things you learn are more or less common sense and the paper assignments are not difficult as long as you keep up with the reading and are attentive in class.  The comprehension checks are a little irritating, but they encouraged me to do the reading."
12941,360134,2.5,4.0,"Not a super easy class, but very interesting if you already have an interest beforehand.  Lectures and readings are fine, but grading of papers (especially exams) are not good unless they are written in the words she would choose to write. Can really learn a lot though, and see fun kids."
12942,360134,3.5,4.0,Only good if you want to hear her talk about how she knows so much about child psych.
12943,360134,2.5,3.0,"Lectures were uninteresting, but discussion was very interesting.   The paper assignment was fun, but needed more direction than what we were given."
12944,360134,2.5,3.0,"Not such a great professor, makes an incredibly interesting subject incredibly boring."
12945,360134,2.0,4.0,Lillard is a boring professor who grades completely subjectively.  boo!
12946,360134,3.0,2.0,Her class is interesting although at times it can be boring.  Her lectures are alright but sometimes she goes too fast so you can't even copy down any notes.  She's very harsh on students talking in class...she'll embarrass you really badly...
12947,360134,4.0,3.0,"I think the first thing you will notice about this lady is that she's &quot;off&quot; somehow. Her lectures are pretty comprehensible, although her &quot;aren't childrens' fingerpaintings amazing&quot; attitude may cause a few laughs. Overall, a good lear"
12948,360134,3.5,4.0,"I really did not enjoy the class too much.  Although the material is interesting, I did not like the essay test formats.  I also felt that, although she did bring babies in for us to observe, her lectures were somewhat biased and disorganized at times."
12949,360134,4.0,2.0,"My friends don't like her, but I really have no problem with her. Class is interesting, and she brings in babies for us to observe which is fun. All the tests are essays, so if you don't like writing and prefer tests, she might not be ideal for you."
12950,2154192,3.0,4.0,"As a law student, Professor Halliday presided over the most ridiculous class I took during my time as a student. Dig this. For 3 credits, you read 12 books, present for 45 minutes on of those books, write a response essay on another book, and have a final exam. Thousands of pages of reading with almost no knowledge gained. COMPLETE FAILURE."
12951,2154192,4.0,5.0,"Halliday is a smart guy and seems to know the answer to any question you ask. Class time is used for large-group discussion, which brings out the key parts of the reading. Halliday can come off as condescending to students at times, although you can tell its not his intention so shake it off and keep going. Hes a captivating prof and makes it fun"
12952,2154192,5.0,4.0,"Really dedicated, and makes an enormous effort to provide guidance and feedback. Gives a lot of work, but has a lot of constructive criticism and is always fair."
12953,1048275,4.5,2.0,I loved the class. Prof. Johnson was one of the most approachable teachers in the engineering school altogether!
12954,1048275,4.5,3.0,"prof johnson is a great guy! he's really nice, super approachable, and always willing to help you out, especially when you're sick. he's genuinely concerned about his students doing well. his tests are very fair and i wish i could have him teach every one of my calculus classes! he doesn't put you on the spot during class, like other profs do."
12955,1048275,3.0,3.0,"He is alright. As in most APMA classes, long weekly homeworks, weekly quizzes, and mostly learning on your own outside of class. Lectures are worthless"
12956,1048275,3.5,5.0,"Likes to make you do stuff with the very hardest method. Lots and lots and lots of homework. I suppose its good for you. 3 tests. Don't fail. He proves everything. helpful, though. and he really wants you to succeed. DON'T SLEEP IN CLASS!"
12957,1048275,5.0,2.0,Very cool teacher....i took calc I n HS and he definitely explains things a LONG way...but i guess its good 4 u. dont think just b/c u took calc b4 u shouldnt study WRONG! there's only 3 test fail one of them and u could be screwed
12958,1048275,4.0,5.0,"Nice guy, decent teacher, but he definitely makes 109 a hard class. I've taken Calc 1 numerous times before, but this is definitely the hardest go-around. His problems are filled with numerous steps and complex arithmetic, be prepared to study for the weekly quizzes. He's a really nice guy, and helps you out when needed. Holds TONS of help sessions"
12959,2318036,1.0,4.0,I really hate his class. He would assign 80 pages to be read within a day. He rambles aolt in class.
12960,2318036,2.0,3.0,"Josh tried so hard to be friends with us. He really wanted to be a fun, cool professor, but it flopped. There was an absurd amount of reading for each class meeting, sometimes upwards of 100 pages (class met twice a week). For a class centered around engagement, he just lectured the whole time, usually on unrelated topics and without visual aids."
12961,540373,4.5,4.0,"Really awesome professor. I really like him. He is easy to talk to, very helpful and he makes the class a lot more fun and enjoyable with the jokes he tells during class sometimes. If you get the chance to take his class you should take it and hope that he teaches second semester p-chem also."

12963,540373,4.0,1.0,"While he might be old, his class was certainly not boring, and he really stimulated studetns to think about readings. Very intelligent(found out he was a mentor to a director/researcher of Human Genome project). yeah the class was easy, but I think USEMs should be that way."
12964,540373,4.0,1.0,"This is the most boring class you will ever take. He's a nice guy but can't keep anyone's interest with his rambling. It amazingly easy though and he doesnt learn names so you don't have to go to class every week. If you can sit through the class, take the easy A."
12965,556760,4.5,2.0,"Professor has a pretty heavy accent which takes a little bit of getting used to but overall her lectures are pretty clear and easy to understand.  The course moves fast, we had an exam every week but all of the exams follow the same format so they are easy to study for.  Overall she was very helpful and participation gets you a long way.  "
12966,556760,5.0,4.0,"Great class, be ready to invest a lot of time though. The work is definitely worth its 4 credits. She's awesome though!"
12967,556760,3.5,4.0,"She moves through material very quickly and sometimes does not explain topics.  However she is very nice and will explain anything you ask about.  She will destroy you in class if you get something wrong, but she doesn't mean it malevolently and it won't hurt your grade."
12968,556760,4.5,4.0,"Lilia Saf'yanovna is a very clear and helpful professor. Her Kazan accent makes her slightly intimidating, but she has a good heart. Stay on top of your work and prepare for class; you do NOT want to answer an easy question wrong, she will tear you apart in front of everyone. Lots of homework, but AMAZING TA's"
12969,556760,2.5,3.0,"Wow, I really disagree! Prof. Travisano zips thru complicated material and expects you to know it, forever, after one week. This might be ok if you have a TA that drills you, but my TA sucked. The book is unhelpful. If you really want to learn Russian you'll survive, but make it your top priority. Prof.'s poor English makes learning difficult."
12970,556760,5.0,3.0,She's so nice and explains things really clearly! Classes aren't too big and she's very approachable and makes russian interesting even in 101. quizzes and a chapter test about every other week but she gives you the exact format of the test so it's not too bad if you look over it the day before.
12971,556760,4.5,2.0,Lilia is awesome! She genuinely wants everyone to pass her class and learn to love Russian :)
12972,556760,5.0,3.0,One of the most advanced and interesting russian classes i've taken. you're going to learn about stimulating topics and have mature conversations. Be prepared to put in more effort than the one credit is worth though.
12973,556760,4.5,2.0,"She is amazing. If you can, take a class with her. It doesn't even matter what class it is. Ask her questions and don't be let down when she tells you how badly you really did on that essay, she is trying to help you, if you let her. She's funny and knows her stuff!"
12974,556760,5.0,1.0,"Very easy class. get to play games or watch Russian cartoons once in a while. sometimes the homeworks are a bit long, though."
12975,556760,5.0,1.0,"The easiest A at UVA.  The exam policy is absurd.  You can retake any test or quiz you want, so there is no real incentive for doing well or studying the first time around."
12976,556760,5.0,1.0,Simply fabulous!
12977,556760,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher! She's one of the best foreign language teachers around. It's an easy A- guaranteed if you just do your homeworks and follow the assignments. Sometimes course materials can be overwhelming but on the other hand, that's the whole point of 1st year Russian class! YAY~"
12978,556760,5.0,2.0,"I view slightly differently. Very nice, accessible individual, clear Russian lectures and you'll do okay if you just finish your homeworks and read some textbook materials. It might be tough for 101 courses, but that's the point of 101. For 301, Mrs. Travisano was a real pleasure. Loved it!"
12979,556760,1.5,4.0,"Teacher is very kind and willing to help after school, but the class has a huge load of tests and quizzes -- like at least 2 or 3 a week on extensive vocabulary word lists. I'm talking like..memorize 150 words in one night."
12980,188127,5.0,4.0,"Milkis is the man. When I was a first year, he invited me to his office hours without skipping a beat, just to talk to him about what I was interested in. Take a class with him if you get the chance, he's really passionate about the presidency and American politics."
12981,188127,4.5,3.0,"This class one was of my favorite at UVA! Milkis is a great professor.  He is passionate about the presidency and really wants his students to learn.  There were a lot of readings but most of them were interesting and there's not much other work in the class.  If you work hard, it can reshape your perspective of presidential influence in history."
12982,188127,4.0,4.0,"HARD grader.  A- is the best grade he gives.  Great lecturer.  Very interesting.  Very busy, however, now that he is Chair he doesn't have a lot of time.  Is nice to students but doesn't have a lot of free time.  You will get a lot out of the class but the grading might be tough for some to take.  You will have to work hard."
12983,188127,5.0,3.0,"hard to get into this class for a reason.  Great TA's.  He does not give out A's unless you earn it.  Be creative in your papers and link it to the bigger picture.  He doesn't give Reagan the love he deserves, but he is fair.  A different perspective on the presidency.  Jefferson would be proud."
12984,188127,4.0,2.0,"Milkis is a fabulous professor- he has utmost respect for his students and he is highly entertaining. He really makes you want to attend class, and treats students as though they are his equals. Awesome."
12985,188127,5.0,2.0,"Professor Milkis is perhaps one of the most enthusiastic additions to the UVA Politics Department. It is rare to find someone with so much passion for subject matter and concern for students.  Readings can be numerous, but well worth it."
12986,188127,4.0,2.0,"This class is pretty sweet...easy readings, and interesting material. Definitely take this, but oh wait, its nearly impossible to get into. Fun Fun."
12987,188127,5.0,3.0,No Comments
12988,188128,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Braun is a very genuine, kind, and charismatic teacher. There is a lott of readings, however they are some of the most valuable pieces youll ever read. There arent many assignment except essays so be ready to write. He works to create a positive, inspirational atmosphere and he does. Try to take this in-person if you can."
12989,188128,5.0,3.0,"I was part of the inaugural cohort that took the Latin American Studies interdisciplinary seminar, back in 2013-2014, over which he presided. Five years later and I'm still thinking of this man's gift for telling a story. Outstanding. Please seek Tico if you're in C'ville. Take a class, go to his office hours, talk to him, listen to what he says."
12990,188128,5.0,4.0,"The Individual and Society was, hands down, the best course I've ever taken. His lectures were entirely improvised, but his teaching was incredibly engaging. There was a LOT of reading, even though he said it would be pretty light, but the readings were interesting. All-in-all, would recommend, even though he's no longer teaching the class."
12991,188128,3.0,3.0,"The Individual and Society for the New College Curriculum. Hes pretty great the first few lectures but then the course seems to be repetitive. Engagement courses are only 7 weeks long and I was over it by week 3. It's only at 8am, and I was contemplating getting out of bed each time. Lots of reading, but you dont have to read in detail to pass"
12992,188128,4.0,4.0,"Tico is a gem! If you are taking this class, don't expect a traditional &quot;this happened, then this happened&quot; history class. More about themes and patterns in LA Hist. A lot of reading and hard to judge what grade you will get, but if you go into it with an open mind and you actually care about changing your perspective you will love it!"
12993,188128,1.5,4.0,"Doesn't provide a lot of guidance, but he teaches a great class with some wonderful reading material. There is a lot riding on your journal and the final paper, as well as your attendance. This class requires commitment and diligence. Don't expect to coast through the semester even though you only have two assignments to hand in. Its a challenge."
12994,188128,3.0,5.0,"Tico is truly an excellent teacher.  Sure, you may not agree with his ideas, but put some effort in and he really pushes you to think.  I took his small seminar at the beginning of first year, and it's been invaluable to me in terms of teaching me how to write and how to discuss texts in small classes. He's fascinating if you talk outside of class!"
12995,188128,2.5,3.0,"If you're looking for an actual history class, DON'T TAKE THIS ONE. Instead of talking about the chronological chain of events taking place in Central America, we talk about coffee, bananas and massacres. Tico is interesting sometimes, but he rants about things a lot, like the war in Iraq, which are irrelevant to the class."
12996,188128,1.5,4.0,"I was so disappointed by this class.  It was been the worst history class I've taken at UVA.  Braun does not lecture; there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to the discussions he attempts to lead.  This class has not been worth the significant amount of time it requires, and I deeply regret taking it."
12997,188128,4.0,3.0,Coming to class isn't mandatory but it is a factor on your grade and does affect his opinion of you as a student in his class. He rambles but is generally an interesting lector. You don't need to read all the readings but def. most. He is not for the faint of heart or the staunch conservative; he tends to turn off conservatives so watch out for it.
12998,188128,4.0,2.0,"Great class.  Lots and lots of reading, lots of wild discussions.  There's a 20 page paper at the end which is 40% of your grade; your notes constitute 40%; and attendance/whether or not he likes you makes up the rest.  Tico's a riot--you can't not pay attention--and makes coming to class (he takes daily attendance) worth it."
12999,188128,1.0,3.0,"this is an old-fashioned marxist, and thus fun for conservatives... can't find types like that anymore. boring teacher though, and not a serious scholar; hence a waste of time - and only for undergrads if any..."
13000,188128,1.0,4.0,"Take a class with Tico if you seek socialist indoctrination.  This man is easily the most radically left-wing prof. I had in four years at UVa.  Historical fact and personal opinion were indistinguishable in his lectures, and the reading material reflected his individual biases."
13001,188128,5.0,3.0,"The most inspiring and enlightening class I've taken yet at UVa.  Tico is really something.  It is a vibrant and dynamic class, the only one I truly enjoy waking up for in the morning.  If you're willing to open your mind, it will be the kind of class that will forever alter your perspective on La, life, everything."
13002,188128,5.0,3.0,Tico is so great.  He is one of my favorite UVA Professors.  He taught me a lot about what it means to do history and be a historian.
13003,188128,3.0,3.0,"Ok. He's not so bad but not so great either. What happened is that this class, in my opinion, is def not for people that know nothing of Central America. It is for people who already know about the history of Central America and want to expand on their knowledge. That is prob why many people learned nothing and left frustrated. The guy knows a lot"
13004,188128,1.0,5.0,wouldnt take it again if i could....
13005,188128,1.0,4.0,"He's awful. I learned nothing. Class is a random jumble of unclear, abstract ideas, and he doesn't know how to put events in context so they are coherent. A waste of my time."
13006,188128,4.5,4.0,"good class, tico is the man"
13007,188128,2.5,3.0,"Don't expect to learn any Latin American history from this guy. His class = him giving opinions on different matters. Some of the readings are interesting, but you can do those on your own time. I'm all for an easy class once in a while, but this one is unbearably boring & truly a waste of time."
13008,188128,4.5,4.0,"Tico = rockstar professor. He will make you question everything you know. He teaches that everything is connected and intertwined, nothing is simple, there is no such thing as absolute truth, and does all of this to give dimension to the actual people of LA, without whom history would be irrelevant."
13009,188128,3.0,4.0,"Braun is fun to listen to, but his class is very hit and miss. Sometimes the discussion is fun, other days he just rants on random opinions trying to show how &quot;nuanced&quot; all our opinions are. But its not very helpful. This is NOT a history class, much more sociological/anthropological."
13010,188128,5.0,1.0,"One of the most interesting professors I have ever had.  His class was a pleasure to wake up early for, and that really something in my book.  Lots of reading but everything was wonderfully interesting.  He made me even more proud to be at UVA.  Caring and helpful as well."
13011,188128,1.5,4.0,"so biased and weird that it's not really worth it, hip with pc second-yearers"
13012,188128,4.5,4.0,A great professor.  Lectures always make you think about issues in new ways and he is very entertaining.  Wants to know his students and help whenever possible.
13013,188128,5.0,4.0,The best professor at UVA.  Always wants to help and see his students succeed. Take his class even if you have no interest in the subject.  He will remind you why you're here.
13014,188129,5.0,3.0,"Professor Arata is a remarkable professor. He's approachable, engaging, and intelligent. Do yourself a favor and take an English class with him, regardless of your major. You won't regret it."
13015,188129,3.0,3.0,"This was a great class with an incredibly interesting syllabus. However, if our books weren't so intriguing, I'm not sure what I would have gotten out of it. Class is set up like a large discussion, where we often talk about how we feel about certain characters or plots. It's more like a book club than a class. 1 paper, 1 midterm or paper, final."
13016,188129,2.5,4.0,Not impressed.
13017,188129,4.0,4.0,"Arata was interesting to listen to. I was a science major with little Lit background. While the reading is VOLUMINOUS, it was rewarding & intriguing.  But if you're not an English major  who has all day to sit on your bum or have a hectic schedule, the reading load is very intense (trust me, trying to read Proust or Dostoevsky at 4 AM is brutal...)"
13018,188129,5.0,4.0,clear and often funny. hard reading but arata/discussion made it approachable. tests are 'good' in that they actually do test what you learned...knowing plot isnt enough. fair grader. heavy reading load. had him in 382 as well; lectures follow a clear articulate plan. reccomend arata strongly but be prepared to read a lot and discuss.
13019,188129,3.0,2.0,The only time I went to the lecture was when I wanted to do a crossword puzzle or take a nap.
13020,188129,3.0,3.0,"Extremely entertaining and easy to follow.  Really takes an expansive topic and puts you at ease.  The exams aren't designed to trick, but to aid.  If you have to take 382, you definitely want to do it with him."
13021,188129,4.0,2.0,"Team taught 382 along with Morris. Arata's lectures were way better than Morris's. I really liked him, he was interesting considering the course does not lend itself to being fascinating."
13022,188129,5.0,2.0,No Comments
13023,188129,3.0,2.0,One of those teachers who tries to get out of the way and let the (grad) class teach itself.
13024,188129,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely amazing teaching skills, and selects interesting works to study."
13025,188129,2.5,3.0,"Steve taught a very difficult  Fin de Siecle  course when I was there as a grad in mid-90s. I did not find his course very clear or concise and, after reading some of his papers on the subject, was even less impressed."
13026,188129,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors in a good department.  Knows so much about literature--he'll make you love it too.
13027,1335012,5.0,2.0,really nice
13028,1335012,5.0,2.0,No Comments
13029,1629925,5.0,3.0,The class material can get slow at times but this class made learning the law fun and interesting! Professor Moore is also such a wonderful lecturer and person.
13030,1629925,5.0,3.0,"Sherri has been doing this for a long time and knows what shes doing. She is a very dynamic lecturer and makes going to class fun. Be prepared to take notes fast because she can talk quickly, but her exams are always straightforward. An A might be hard to achieve, but an A- is very doable."
13031,1629925,5.0,3.0,Overall great teacher. Note-taking in her class Comm Law 1 is a grind but there is zero reading or anything outside of the class. Genuinely a great and interesting person as well.
13032,1629925,5.0,2.0,Sherri is the greatest professor I have had. She makes Law interesting and applicable to a students life. The class is not difficult and you do not need to get the book. Go to lecture and pay attention and you will get a good grade in the class.
13033,1629925,5.0,3.0,"Professor Moore is very friendly and a good Professor. You really need to be able to apply the concepts to real situations if you want to get an A on her tests. I know that sounds simple, but she makes you work for it."
13034,1629925,4.0,3.0,"No longer an easy A but attend lecture, take it somewhat seriously and you're golden. You'll start to love Pr Moore and subconsciously work to not let her down. The material is sometimes dense but honestly everyone should take this course (lots of information about leases, contracts, your rights as an individual). Weekly quiz, extra fred, 3 exams. "
13035,1629925,4.5,4.0,"To students who will take it in the future: this class is no longer an easy A class! You may find that from 2011-2012, people were saying that this class was very easy as long as you listen to her and take good notes...But, it is definitely not easy anymore! The test questions are tricky, and you have to have some background knowledge!!!"
13036,1629925,4.5,2.0,"Great Professor, tries hard to make law relevant and interesting to students and is incredibly helpful during office hours. Students can use up to two pages of notes on the midterm and final, and almost all the material is covered well lecture. Tests are relatively easy as well. She uses clickers a lot though, so attendance is required."
13037,1629925,4.5,2.0,Great professor who is super approachable and so so hot!
13038,1629925,5.0,1.0,Amazing interesting and funny teacher. I came in expecting commercial law to be bored but her class made me like the material so much. Her tests are open note so as long as you took really good notes and paid attention in class you'll get a A!
13039,1629925,5.0,2.0,Prof Moore is awesome! Her Comm Law class is always interesting and definitely useful in the real world. She is very approachable and helpful. Reading from the textbook isn't necessary as long as you understand your class notes. Definitely recommend this class!!!
13040,1629925,5.0,2.0,Great teacher who is very friendly and approachable. She makes the class interesting and you learn very valuable real-world lessons. Reading was usually unnecessary as long as you took notes and paid attention in class.
13041,1646317,5.0,3.0,"Very responsible, and humorous. You'll definitely learn a lot if you follow the class. There are a lot of quizzes and tests, as in all language classes."
13042,2006766,5.0,3.0,Professor von Oertzen is a really nice guy and is super organized with his lectures and slides. I had to miss class once and he went through the entire lecture separately with me during office hours. He also has the best practice exams. I would recommend attending class and review sessions. Get to know him outside of class because he's really cool!
13043,1908473,5.0,4.0,"Best class I've taken at UVA so far. Professor was passionate and knowledgable and gave us interesting although sometimes difficult readings about gender, race, and media. She will push you to think very hard about these topics during class discussion so it helps to prepare well if you want a good grade."
13044,1908473,5.0,3.0,Great class. Very helpful writing instruction. She assigns difficult texts but she's willing to elaborate in class if you don't understand. She will reward you if you show up prepared though. Makes you work for your grade.
13045,1908473,1.0,3.0,"She assumed I was a athlete and undermined my intelligence in the class. I came to UVA on a full academic scholarship and she made me feel uncomfortable. I dreaded going to class because I felt like I was back in high school again, and that she singled me out. Lectures are boring and incohesive. Very nice to talk to and always available."
13046,1908473,4.5,2.0,She was very helpful and informed about the material. We read exciting stuff. I enjoyed the experience of the class. 
13047,1908473,3.5,3.0,"The class was nothing special, there are probably better ways to fulfill your second writing requirement."
13048,2088697,2.0,1.0,"The course was based off of her research and was frowned upon to disagree with the topic. We were encouraged to think for ourselves, however, this excludes thoughts that were not directly aligned with hers."
13049,2088697,2.0,3.0,"Lindsay had to teach very little. There were several weeks where her post-doc did the teaching, and several weeks where a guest speaker did the teaching. Overall, she taught maybe half of the course."
13050,2088697,1.0,3.0,This class was a waste of time. We answered charged questions that were designed to tell Lindsay what she wanted to hear. Would not recommend independent thought if you want an A.
13051,2088697,1.0,3.0,"It should be removed from the curriculum or should be treated as a formality that is pass/fail. I say that because in this class, a 95 is the cutoff for an A (which was never conveyed to us). If a graduate course is so easy that a 95 cutoff is actually employed, then it should be treated as a formality and Lindsay should not have a say in our GPA."
13052,900868,3.5,3.0,"Her lectures are pretty boring and put most students to sleep. For the most part, it's an easy class and she's a pretty easy teacher. The only thing that really surprised me was her grading on the papers. She was very particular about certain things that  was not specified and marked you down for it and her prompts were very broad. "
13053,900868,5.0,1.0,Was very helpful and willing to discuss problems with students. Work level was fair. Some of the readings were boring but overall it was a good class to gain a broad understanding of Chinese culture.
13054,900868,4.0,3.0,"Nice teacher, but the lecture are kind of boring. A lot of things are dragged out. However, she is a great teacher and a very kind person. I still like this class. It was a very relaxing class. Recommended!"
13055,900868,4.5,2.0,"a very friendly, very genuine professor. the readings could be thick and boring at times but class discussions were interesting and she was good at facilitating discussion when it got quiet. overall, a pretty easy class and a good professor."
13056,900868,4.5,2.0,"I had her for a small discussion class open only to 1st and 2nd years.  The material started off interesting but got progressively more boring.  She was a good teacher, however; very knowledgeable and good at stimulating the discussion when things slowed down.  She brought in great homemade dumplings for the last class.  Pretty easy class."
13057,900868,4.5,2.0,"A very nice, friendly professor that cares about your questions.  It is true that the lectures are a bit boring, but they aren't THAT bad.  I've never fallen asleep during my 1 hr and 15 min classes.  The material isn't hard as long as you put effort into doing the work."
13058,900868,3.0,2.0,"Very knowledgeable, BUT her lectures will put you to sleep.  My avg notes = half page.  She said people usually complain about her being too loud, but it is extremely difficult to hear her, so her solution (in a boiling room) is to turn off A/C.  Not a difficult class... do the readings and look at her outlines, if you can't stay awake in class."
13059,401163,2.5,4.0,"Worst experience of my life! She belittles everyone that asks questions and expects you to get the material on the first try. Exams would be cake without her trick questions. When she explains why certain answers are wrong, she even sounds ridiculous. Crazy lady...should've taken Freeman for sure! Biggest regret at UVa"
13060,401163,4.0,3.0,"Schmidt is a good, fair professor, and she does her best to keep things interesting.  I thought she was reasonable, and while I didn't love her class, I have no complaints about her as a teacher."
13061,401163,2.0,3.0,"If you had Freeman for 3005, you'll love Schmidt, just because of how bad Freeman was in comparison, but Schmidt is actually kind of tricky. You'll really only do well if you take the time to teach yourself the material outside of class, because she doesn't really go through the math with you in class. She's also kind of crazy...not in the good way"
13062,401163,1.5,5.0,"She is one of the worst teacher's I've had at UVA. She's extremely condescending when people ask questions, and not very helpful when explaining trickier topics near the end of the semester. Overall, she was boring, rude, and did nothing to make a hard class any better."
13063,401163,4.5,2.0,"AWESOME!  She's sassy and funny.  You don't need to use the book AT ALL - just read over her PowerPoint notes really well!  She gives in class quizzes that raise your test scores, and her tests are so easy and fair.  She doesn't try to trick you at all!  And she's HILARIOUS.  Also super nice - she helped me out with regression for my DMP.  AWESOME!"
13064,401163,3.0,5.0,"Her exams are difficult, and I would have to say that Spellman is much better and much clearer. She responds in a snapy tone to people who ask questions. I didn't like her, should've taken Freeman"
13065,401163,5.0,2.0,"I took 305 with Weinfield (got a D)and Freeman (barely made the C grade for psyc ppl).  Schmidt is direct and easy to understand.  Also really helpful when you need her.  Take her for 305/306, even if you have to wait another semester for her to be the professor teaching it."
13066,401163,4.0,2.0,Prof Schmidt is so quirky and makes the class fairly manageable.  Definitely take her over the other professors if you can!
13067,401163,4.5,3.0,she is great. strongly recommend.
13068,401163,4.5,1.0,DEFINITELY take Psyc 306 with her over Spellman or Freeman...although this is apparently a harder class than 305 I did MUCH better. Her tests arent mean or tricky and she is a great teacher.
13069,401163,5.0,2.0,Professor Schmidt was amazingly helpful and she made the course subject matter very interesting... she has a great sense of humor to keep things in perspective!  I'd strongly recommend her class.

13071,401163,3.0,2.0,"Not a very hard class if you just put some time in.  She is a good lecturer considering the sometimes boring material, and seems to be nice, but has been rude and very unhelpful to myself and others when we approached her for help individually."
13072,401163,4.0,2.0,Class wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  Don't even need to read the book because all of the questions come from the lectures.  Professor Schmidt is really nice and quarky.
13073,401163,3.0,1.0,"Tests are much easier than Freeman's, and they are taken entirely from lecture slides. Just do the problems ahead of time and you'll be fine. Her jokes  get old and she's always apologizing for how boring the class is, which I find annoying."
13074,401163,4.0,2.0,"she knew how miserable it was to be in class at 9am m/w/f, relaxed and clear, but you do have to ask if something doesn't make sense, if you have to choose between her and freeman TAKE HER! freeman is the devil!"
13075,401163,5.0,2.0,"A lot of people may not enjoy statistics, but the course is very reasonably paced and the professor keeps the mood light.  Tests are fair and if you go to class you should know exactly what to expect."
13076,401163,1.0,5.0,She freakin'collects rulers!Awesome!
13077,401163,5.0,3.0,"Karen is great.  She makes class fun, and is always there to help you out.  I loved this class, even though it was statistics!"
13078,1335064,2.0,3.0,"Nice guy and a fairly easy grader, but for an introductory course, the readings are long-winded and esoteric. His lectures are fairly useless and he essentially expects the readings to do the teaching. Large portion of the grade comes from group work (including an eight-page, collaborative research paper), so if you dislike that, avoid his classes."
13079,1335064,2.0,5.0,"Dense readings, seems to forget it's an intro level class. Seems like he's more eager to call American students out on ethnocentrism than to teach. Doesn't lecture as much as assigns readings and lets those teach for him, does not really explain them. exams are all based on readings and theres a lot of material to study. Avoid avoid avoid."
13080,483101,3.5,4.0,"If you do the homework and understand it, you'll do fine on the tests. Overall Good lecturer, sometimes the definitions get technical and hard to understand, but that's math I guess."
13081,483101,4.5,3.0,"If you do the homework, the test won't be impossible. She is very generous with the curve. If you try, you'll do well."
13082,483101,5.0,3.0,"nice person and good lecturer, but has a accent u need to get used to."
13083,483101,3.5,4.0,The homework took 4-5.5 hours every week. Tests are too long for the amount of time we have and she'll ask you things we never did in class or on the homework. Overall she is a good lecturer.
13084,483101,4.5,2.0,"hard class, but if you do the hw, u'll get at least a b+ on the test"
13085,507690,1.0,3.0,"Corse is, by far, the worst professor I have ever had in my life. She is rude, lackluster at communication, and flat-out mean at times. She barely wanted to communicate with me to help my grade, but would instead attribute my shortcomings to any failures in here class. Avoid this professor for any sociology course, trust me."
13086,507690,1.5,3.0,"Lectures were not clear and very broad. She claims that slides posted online won't make sense unless you come to class, but even in class they were confusing. Subject was interesting. Tests were way too specific and little mistakes can cost you. Try to pick a good TA, they will save you."
13087,507690,2.5,2.0,"Interesting subject, ok teacher. The class was very easy with some good readings. She posts the notes online so lecture isn't mandatory, and by the end, I'd pretty much stopped going. Idk, she didn't make it interesting enough to keep my attention. We covered a lot, but it wasn't in depth enough for me. Wouldn't recommend unless you're a SOC major."
13088,507690,2.0,4.0,Waste of time! Professor Corse knows that no one cares enough to come to her class so she makes the slides very unclear. Attendance in section in MANDATORY with no excused or unexcused absences allowed. Try to get a good TA (Dan is the best).
13089,507690,2.0,3.0,didnt like her much. class could have been much better. couldnt communicate well with her when i went to see her; she seemed to just ramble on about the material she was teaching rather than respond to what i was asking.
13090,507690,2.0,3.0,Terrible Teacher.  I learned nothing at all.  Tests are very specific and if you use one wrong word you get everything wrong.  Missing one question on her exam is detrimental.  I would recommend taking anybody else for soc 101 if necessary.  Not the best soc class for non-soc majors.
13091,507690,3.0,1.0,The view times that I went to lecture I was completely bored.     Each time she would ramble on about something distantly related to what we were learning and that was irritating at 10 am.
13092,507690,1.5,3.0,"Take a 200 level soc class instead!!! Corse rambles through lecture never making any coherent points at all. I had lunch with her at the beginning of the semester and it was one of my most awkward moments at UVA. She spends half of the course talking about what sociology is, and then the other half stumbling through subjects like gender. Avoid!"
13093,507690,3.0,2.0,Lectures can be interesting or boring depending on the subtopic. Very smart woman and the tests were directly from information on her slides. Good introductory class.
13094,507690,2.5,1.0,"Really didn't like the class. Boring lecturer who would sometimes get lost in her own family life while lecturing. Feminist, although not completely blatant. Nice overview of sociology, but class sucked."
13095,507690,3.0,2.0,"Best described as all right.  Prof. Corse is very nice and is pretty good at explaining things, but also boring. Plus she posts her slides online, so coming to class is hit or miss--sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't matter. I wish I had taken a 200-level class instead."
13096,507690,3.0,2.0,cool but cooky
13097,89899,1.0,3.0,Muy bien!
13098,89899,5.0,4.0,She is great!

13100,2072387,5.0,1.0,"A well-organized, well-paced lecturer with a passion for weather forecasting, Professor Grise is definitely a professor worth having. Hes helpful outside of class and simplifies things as much as possible to make sure you have a clear understanding of material. Hes also just a friendly person in general, very approachable."
13101,2072387,4.0,3.0,"Prof Grise is awesome! He's new so not many reviews yet. Very clear, very helpful, covers a lot of material at the perfect level of detail. Great for an intro atmosphere class. He's only been teaching like 3 semesters and is way better than most older profs. Also, you can tell he's super into meteorology. Would highly recommend. "
13102,139083,5.0,3.0,"I personally love Prof. Owen and his class. He is a great guy and very approachable in office hours. Unlike others, I found his lectures to be organized and fairly easy to follow; there was definitely a central and fairly obvious theme to each day's class. It is because of this course and Prof. Owen that I decided to major in the field of IR."
13103,139083,4.0,3.0,"Owen is a friendly and approachable professor, but his lectures and especially the Collab readings tend to be dry. Though he is very knowledgeable, often times he will start a new line of thought mid-sentence, which makes him seem scatter-brained. It's not necessary to have perfect attendance in lecture, but always go to section!"
13104,139083,1.0,3.0,"I respect him as a scholar, enjoy his writing, and for the most part like the readings assigned.  However, his lectures are hands down the worst. They're disorganized, have no central theme, and contribute little to the course overall. I've gone everyday just to make sure  I wasn't missing anything but 9 weeks in they've proved to be worthless."
13105,139083,3.0,3.0,"so he rambles during lectures.. impossible to take notes during lectures ended up doodling for most of the time. it's still a good class though because it covers a broad range of theories (realism, national values, etc.) interesting stuff. some readings are just WAY TOO LONG."
13106,139083,3.0,4.0,Owen is an INCREDIBLE professor! I've never had a professor with such clarity and makes a somewhat theoretical subject completely applicable. An absolute must-take class.
13107,139083,4.0,2.0,Owen's lecture were somewhat interesting. Readings were boring and long. Two tests and 10 page paper so wasn't horrible. Really depends on your TA
13108,139083,3.0,2.0,not that interesting.
13109,139083,2.5,2.0,"A wide breadth of material is covered in this class. Owen also has the tendency to ramble during lectures. Overall though, a pretty good class."
13110,139083,4.5,2.0,"Take this class! Even if you think you don't have an interest in IR, it's worth it. You learn info relevant to today's events and he's an all-around good guy."
13111,139083,5.0,4.0,"AMAZING!! He is my fave professor thus far!!! I came into this class thinking &quot;this is going to decide whether or not IR is something I want to pursue&quot; - now I'm going to major in it! He is a great lecturer, modest, and very approachable. He has a true passion for IR. He is a great professor and SO nice!"
13112,139083,2.5,3.0,Spare yourself. The lectures are sometimes interesting but often boring and he rambles. Sure he makes jokes but that doesn't help anyone learn IR. TA does all the grading and grades tough but discussion sections can be very helpful.
13113,139083,5.0,3.0,"LOVE HIM! LOVE HIM! LOVE HIM! my favorite professor so far. very smart, humble, funny, and approachable. he's kinda cute too! interesting lectures, make the crowd laugh hard. tries to have direct discussions in classes even though it is big. grade depends on TA. two 1000 words papers, midterm and final. take it and you will love it"
13114,139083,5.0,3.0,"nice guy. lectures not the best but didnt put me to sleep either. very clear and concise; assumes no prior IR knowledge. 340 but went over most IR101 material (made it easier for me). grade really depends on TA. readings boring; i did practically none of them (just key quotes for papers) but still got an A-. take home MT, 10 pg. paper, final- take."
13115,139083,4.5,2.0,"Very basic, easy level class, although suprisingly, the readings were quite interesting. Owen is very knowledgeable and tries his best to give students a useful way to interpret world events both in text books and on the news"
13116,139083,4.0,3.0,"great lecturer, but the class seemed gearing towards students who know very little about american foreign policy-- too much emphasis on basics, not enough on critical analysis"
13117,139083,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher, awesome lectures, horrible section and boring readings.  If you are interested in politics take the course, he is by far top two in FA professors I've had.  The papers are graded hard, and the TA made the hour a giant waste of time. But it is tolerable considering the lectures are great."
13118,139083,5.0,2.0,"I loved this class.  The readings were very dry and I ended up not reading them (which harmed my grade - learn from my mistake) but I still enjoyed this class.  Prof. Owen is very easy to understand (and &quot;Southern&quot;) and the class just seemed to fly by when he lectured.  If you want to take PLIR101, make sure you wait to take it with Prof. Owen!"
13119,139083,3.5,4.0,"Well organized and pretty interesting lectures, if you go to the lectures and do the readings, you'll be fine, but the papers were graded hard."
13120,139083,5.0,1.0,"Owen is clear, direct, and Southern, and he holds your attention, and he repeats key phrases. I thought this course was great, subject matter was very interesting (strategic elements of WWI and WWII, globalization, theories of IR, etc.)."
13121,139083,4.0,3.0,interesting lectures and sections are quite helpful. good starter class to take.
13122,139083,5.0,3.0,"Don't listen to people rant about the subject matter being boring! If you like politics, then the class will interest you. If you don't, then it won't."
13123,139083,3.5,3.0,"This class required too much time for a 101.  The readings were soooooo dry I could not TAKE it.  I think lots of people end up just blowing off the TERRIBLE readings, and that's what I ended up doing."
13124,139083,4.0,3.0,"I dont know about him being the GREATEST professor here at UVA, but he's not bad.  Nice guy.  The class is way to hard for a 101 but hey...talk to your TA about that"
13125,139083,5.0,3.0,"Talented professor.  Also challenging, but for 101, its the best."
13126,139083,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, funny person. Take this class"
13127,139083,5.0,2.0,"Owen rocks. Nice guy, funny, good lecture, humble, etc. Definitely take 101...best class I've ever took at uva"
13128,139083,4.0,1.0,He knows his stuff but is hampered by mind-numbingly boring subject matter.

13130,139083,4.5,3.0,"Owen's one of the better Politics professors, but if your TA sucks it can really sour the experience."
13131,139083,4.5,3.0,One of the best classes I have taken
13132,139083,4.5,4.0,No Comments
13133,139083,5.0,3.0,"Mr Owen is the greatest professor at U.Va. Helpful, kind, super intelligent."
13134,106322,5.0,2.0,"Loved her lectures. She is one of the most brilliant and caring professors. If you are looking to actually engage with the class material, she is a great choice."
13135,106322,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hale is one of the best professors I had in four years at UVA. She keeps it real like few professors I've ever met; she is open about her opinions and embraces conversations with opinions that differ from hers. Her lectures are brilliant, her seminars are thought-provoking and she is someone you should visit in office hours."
13136,106322,4.5,3.0,Dr. Hale is an amazing teacher with a world class command of the history of the American South.  Highly recommend her courses.  She is sometimes hard to follow because she thinks so fast- be prepared to work to keep up!
13137,106322,4.5,2.0,"Professor Hale is awesome -- even though she seems disheveled sometimes, she is super knowledgeable about the subjects she teaches and brings a great perspective to the table when it comes to race and the south. She is a scholar but could easily be an on-the-ground activist, so she is passionate and easy to talk to. She has a good sense of humor."
13138,106322,3.0,3.0,Lectures can vary from very good to absolutely boring. I felt that the class tended to focus on race too much.
13139,106322,5.0,2.0,"this class is supposed to be about the effects of poverty on the poor, and instead this lady engages discussions on irrelevent factors that have nothing to do with the topic.  i skipped almost all the classes and got an A-.  i don't think that i learned a single thing in that class."
13140,106322,2.5,1.0,"Good Lord, this class was BORING.  If you read her book, you don't have to go to lecture (or vice versa).  The papers are extremely easy, but the lecture/reading material will put you to sleep.  You will only talk about race relations.  Stay away from horrible TA's."
13141,106322,4.0,4.0,"20th Century South is a very intersting class.  Topics range from Civil Rights to a discussion of the peoples in Appalaicha.  The assignments consists of 2 or 3 papers and two tests.  The only drawback of this course is the fact that Hale interjects her far left liberal views into the material, which sometimes obscures the material."
13142,106322,3.0,3.0,"Half the class is spent in reconstruction (19th century). We spent one half of a day on post-1960s South. Her tests are easy and so are the papers, but a bad TA can make things hard. Reading/film load is very large. I think Hale would make a better Sociology professor then a history professor."
13143,106322,5.0,4.0,Great professor...very enthusiastic and tries to keep things lively.  Very clear and outlined lectures.
13144,106322,4.0,3.0,"Great professor, enthusiastic about the course and the material."
13145,106322,5.0,3.0,"By far one of the best professors at UVA.  Her class is interesting and while she goes on tangents sometimes, they always relate back to her topic.  Good classroom management, she always makes you think outside the box and she'll make you smile everyday!"
13146,106323,5.0,3.0,"Single greatest professor I've ever had. Brilliantly intelligent and completely passionate about the Civil War. His lectures are hugely entertaining and incredibly informative. You will read A LOT, but the reading assigned are generally interesting, and are clarified very well in the lectures. I genuinely look forward to the lectures every week."
13147,106323,4.0,3.0,Looked forward to the two lectures each week! He allows students 10 minutes to ask any question about anything prior to beginning his lecture. Unbelievable knowledge about the Civil War and personalities of generals. Fantastic class!
13148,106323,5.0,5.0,"Really fun class and a hilarious teacher but few grades, and very tough grading"
13149,106323,5.0,4.0,"Wow, UVA definitely needs more professors like him.  I am an English major, but he helped me understand how to look at history and understand the biases that can be created through interpretation.  Plus, he's a laugh riot and a very interesting, charismatic person.  He wants you to work, but he'll help you.  Gary Gallagher = FTW"
13150,106323,5.0,4.0,"Far and away the best professor I've ever had. Regarded as the best Civil War scholar still teaching today, in the nation. Lots of work, but it makes up for it. You will feel like your previous understanding of the US was insufficient by any definition! Great class, great professor... Just don't ask any stupid questions! He's a quick wit!"
13151,106323,5.0,3.0,Prof. Gallagher is an amazing professor.  I took US military history with him first and loved the class so took Civil War history at 8 am.  It was worth getting up for class every morning because it was always interesting and usually very funny as well.  Make sure and do the readings however.
13152,106323,4.5,3.0,"I am going back almost 20 years when Dr. Gallagher was a prof at PSU. To this day through a bachelors, masters, and now a doctorate I have never had such an insightful, yet entertaining professor in all my life.  He is the absolute best there has ever been. In fact I stumbled upon this website looking for a way to contact him to thank him for this."
13153,106323,5.0,4.0,"He is by far and away the best professor I have ever had at UVA. His lectures are phenomenal. At the beginning of class he lets you literally ask him whatever you want and he will deign your question with a reply that is usually hilarious. Please, please ask him his views on the Sociology Dept, I almost cried of laughter. Pity he is on sabbatical!"
13154,106323,4.0,2.0,This is a great class.  He loves the material and gives great lectures.  He talks really quickly so it's hard to take notes.  Get a good TA because they grade all of your work.
13155,106323,4.0,3.0,"Oh wow. This class is ALL ABOUT whether or not you get a good TA. I'm an English major and writing is my specialty. I worked my you-know-what off on those 12 pagers and got B's on both of them. Honestly, the lectures were good and Gallagher's hilarious, but I didn't think it was worth it. Maybe only for true history buffs."
13156,106323,4.5,1.0,"No exams, just 2 papers (12 pages each- you have a week to do each). He's very clear in lectures althogh he speaks fast so note takers have to write quickly. Fascinating subject matter, he REALLY knows his stuff and is clearly passionate about it. Funny and light-hearted lectures which are always a pleasure to attend. Quite a lot of reading though."
13157,106323,4.0,3.0,"My favorite class of the semester.  He absoultely glows when talking about the Civil War.  The lecture is very fast paced and the class has lots of reading, but he has a sense of humor both historical and worldly.  An awesome teacher all around."
13158,106323,4.5,3.0,"Great Lecturer. Is able to teach military history yet give you a sense of the overall scope of history. Don't miss class when he goes over the Civil War, he's an expert. Grade is based on TA and discussions (30% participation, three papers), so if you don't like tests like me, this is a great class for you."
13159,106323,5.0,4.0,"I had never woken up before 8am until this class, but it was so worth it. If you Wikipedia anything on the Civil War, they always cite Prof. Gallagher, so you might as well just attend class. He's a leading scholar, and is very funny. This is a difficult class, but it'll make you a better student. Plus you'll have a ton of fun in the process."
13160,106323,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gallagher is awesome.  His lectures are really interesting and it is worth it to go just to hear him speak.  Easy to do well as long as you do the reading (amount is not too bad), go to class, and participate in discussion."
13161,106323,4.0,2.0,Prof. Gallagher is by far the best teacher I've ever had.  His lectures are interesting and his witty sense of humor will crack you up.  I highly recommend Hist 205 even if you don't have a profound interest in military history... Gary Gallagher doesn't disappoint.
13162,106323,4.5,4.0,"Absolutely the best teacher Ive had in my life. His lectures are extremely entertaining, and he really catches your attention every single time. I was very disappointed that I had to take this class at first, but after the first month I was glad I did. Very very good professor, highly recommended, US military His 205 is an excelent course."
13163,106323,5.0,3.0,"Great professor.  Classes are very interesting, his lectures are great, and on top of it all hes got a great sense of humor.  Highly recommend taking any of his classes, even if youre not a hist major.  He'll make it interesting.  Oh but make sure you participate in discussion (and do the readings) or you wont do well."
13164,106323,4.5,2.0,"AMAZING PROF! my favorite class thus far. lectures are very interesting. makes witty remarks, dry sense of humor. pretty easy too!"
13165,106323,5.0,3.0,Gallagher is absolutely amazing.  His lectures are very interesting and informative.  Discussions count a lot so do the reading and talk in section.  Two 12 page papers.
13166,106323,4.5,2.0,"If you don't like Gallagher, you don't have a pulse.  He's is the best lecturer I've had at The University thus far and his class is not only extremely engaging but you also learn a lot, too.  He personally seems approachable and willing to speak with you.  His sarcasm and wit produce laughs throughout the lecture hall."
13167,106323,5.0,4.0,Great class.  Professor Gallagher is the foremost historian on the Civil War today.  He keeps class entertaining and interesting.  Consists of two take home exams (16 pages each).  Each take home has an eight page question and two four page questions.  Must do the reading to do well.
13168,106323,4.5,4.0,"I had high expectations going in and after a few classes, I found out that while maybe a little overrated, he is a great prof. VERY knowledgeable and just and overall nice guy. Very animated yet laid back. His tests drive you nuts for a week, but then they are over and youre very glad you wrote the essays. HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS CLASS AND PROF."
13169,106323,4.5,4.0,"His Civil War class is incredible and his lectures were the highlight of my semester.  He is very entertaining, and he knows his stuff.  That being said, this is not an easy class, and his papers take a long time to write.  Class was a little more difficult than I had expected."
13170,106323,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. The workload isn't too bad; only two paper. However, the discussion counts a lot. Make sure you talk and go to every section."
13171,106323,5.0,3.0,"Military History is a great class!  I definately recomend it.  Class consists of 2 tw take home exams (1 six page essay, 2 three page essays)."
13172,106323,5.0,4.0,very interesting
13173,106323,5.0,3.0,"I liked Gallagher so much I made him my advisor, knowing that he was going to be away all year.  DONT TAKE HIUS309 with HOLT!  Wait til Gallagher gets back because he's where its at!"
13174,106323,5.0,3.0,"I have taken two of prof. Gallagher's classes, and I would take two more if I could. The Civil War was over 130 years ago, but he lectures like he was there, and he will make you feel like you were too. It makes history come alive. Great Professor."
13175,106323,5.0,3.0,Great lecturer.  It was worth it to get up for 8:00 class to hear him speak!  Very enjoyable and funny.
13176,106323,5.0,2.0,He is an amazing teacher and hilarious as hell.  I would recommend taking his class if you are at all interested in the subject.
13177,106323,4.5,2.0,He is the best professor I've had; an excellent lecturer.  Very knowledgeable on the subject and brings a good sense of humor to the topic.  His battlefield tour is also very interesting.
13178,106323,5.0,3.0,"I was disappointed that this class didn't focus on tactics as much as I would have liked, and some of the reading was rather boring, but Gallagher is a very engaging lecturer and is extremely knowledgeable on the subject.  Worth it for lectures."

13181,1924953,4.0,4.0,"Tough tests, good amount of homework. Mylab homework is easy 100, but problem sets are difficult. Utilize office hours. Sometimes Prof Troyan is slightly condescending when I ask questions, but otherwise, he's a pretty good prof. Curves the class at the end."
13182,1924953,5.0,5.0,"His tests can be hard but he's very approachable and friendly. Great lecturer and passionate about teaching and making sure his students do well. So go to his office hours and ask for help! (He's also really cute IMHO... Great dresser, too)."
13183,1924953,5.0,3.0,Clear and organized lectures. hard tests. Prepare to invest hours in doing HW. Talented and nice person.
13184,1924953,5.0,5.0,"The Good: Professor Troyan is one of the nicest and very helpful.  He is good at responding to messages even late night.  He is respectful and open to students. You can talk with him about anything.  He's nice eye candy too ;)! The Bad: He's really smart, which means his tests, HW are super hard, so unless you're really good at econ, it's tough!"
13185,1220444,3.5,2.0,"If you're interested in psych, this is a good class to take. It's a good first-year, first-semester course to get you adjusted to college. The material is interesting, but the lectures were boring since she just reads off the slides she posts online. It's not hard to do well in this course, the lectures just aren't enjoyable. However, she is nice."
13186,1220444,3.0,4.0,"How everybody is saying this class is an easy-A makes me feel dumb. Some questions on the exams just makes you think where in the world did it came from. Plus you will have to get up at 8am twice a week for the clicker questions. No need to listen to her lectures, she just reads off the slides. WELL this is NOT an easy class so you've been warned."
13187,1220444,1.5,3.0,"Do not take this class with this professor! She seems really nice during lectures but in reality, she is super mean and not helpful at all. When I email her about questions for the test or participant pool she is super rude. All she does is read straight from her powerpoints. She is very strict and will never give any points back no matter what."
13188,1220444,3.5,3.0,"Overall an ok professor. Lecture is mandatory (Clicker questions), but she allows you to miss up to 25% of the questions in case of emergency/illness. Four exams, seven short assignments, participation points. Exams aren't awful but there are a few obscure questions. Read the textbook! A worthwhile course if you're interested in psych."
13189,1220444,4.0,3.0,"Very dry subject with a lot of reading, I would avoid this class, although she does the best she can to make it interesting, pretty easy to skate your way through to a B/B+. She goes on rants about psychopathy which aren't really relevant but comical and slightly concerning"
13190,1220444,4.5,2.0,"Interesting lectures made this the best course I've taken so far. Even though there were required in-class assignments, it was the one class I didn't want to miss. The reading is somewhat dry but hardly makes up a significant part of the tests (which mostly come from notes she provides which are extremely nice to have & allow you to pay attention)."
13191,1220444,3.0,2.0,"Prof. Anderson is boring, plain and simple. The only entertaining portions of lecture are when she goes off on her rants about psychopathy. However, her tests are fair and 25% of your grade is a 100 if you just go to class regularly; the catch is having to endure those lectures and the in-class assignments. Take the class, but not with her."
13192,1220444,3.0,3.0,Her lectures get really boring because she just keeps talking for so long and doesn't really break it up with anything. Sometimes she shows funny videos. You don't have to go because she posts notes but there are in-class assignments everyday that you can miss 6 of to still get an A. The tests suck because there are only 30 questions on lots of inf
13193,1220444,2.0,5.0,"This professor was very unhelpful. Her tests were difficult and extremely short - weeks of material summed up in 35 questions or less. Class is nothing but her reading notes, but like mentioned above she requires attendance and checks with assignments. Textbooks are dry, and you have to know them perfectly. Don't take this class."
13194,1220444,2.0,3.0,"HORRIBLE! Don't take her classes. She takes a great subject and makes it unbearably boring. She purposely makes her test hard and quotes in class &quot;This is UVA, it shouldn't be easy.&quot; You have to attend class cuz she gives in class assignments for points and attendance. To top it off, she enjoys calling people out for sleeping and using cell phones."
13195,1220444,3.0,1.0,"I found this class to be the easiest class I took at UVA.  You get 25% of your grade a 100 if you simply show up to class (you can miss 6 classes).  Class is useless because she posts everything online (show up for the easy 100%).  If you are looking for an easy class, this is probably it.  You do have to know the textbook well though."
13196,1220444,2.5,3.0,"The info in this class is interesting,but she is boring.She reads from her notes that she post online so it feels like going to class is pointless, but she does these annoying in class assignments every class. I would recommend the subject, but not with her. She doesn't stop for questions and the guest lectures are much more interesting than hers."
13197,941921,5.0,1.0,"He's an environmental historian with a broad educational background; classes are interesting if you like the environment and how technology played a hand in shaping it and vice versa.  Makes you turn in your thesis components in a timely and organized manner, you might not like it at first but you'll thank him for it at the end of the semester."
13198,941921,1.5,4.0,"He is not very helpful for people who wants to course action into his class, and basically just follows administrative rules without really considering special conditions and needs of students. Not bad professor, but is not too helpful in terms of helping you get into his class."
13199,941921,2.0,2.0,"Strange fellow. Not helpful. Somewhat lazy because he is only here to write books on environmental science, not here to teach. Sits in back of class 75% of time. Readings were helpful though."
13200,941921,5.0,2.0,"Makes you turn in parts of the thesis proposal throughout the semester, which you will love him for once the final proposal is due.  Most of the class is an open discussion of modern issues.  He keeps his opinions to himself so you don't feel obligated to agree with his views.  Brings a lot of experience to the class and is an all around nice guy."
13201,1163108,4.5,2.0,"One of the most useful classes I've taken. Great, laid back teacher who encourages clear, thorough arguments instead of the usual formulaic mumbo-jumbo. Definitely improved my writing skills thanks to this class."
13202,1163108,1.5,2.0,One of my least favorite classes. Critical grader if you have any flair in your writing - advised me to dumb down my style to fit the intelligence of my reader: the average person/soccer mom. Narrow-minded
13203,1163108,4.0,2.0,"He is a good teacher. Matt's a grad student, we took him out to lunch, he's cool. Makes himself available to his students (will often be found, regardless of appointments, in the Alderman Cafe). He's fun, has a good sense of humor, and makes for an overall good class atmosphere. I definitely recommend this teacher (and the subject is interesting!)"
13204,1163108,3.5,2.0,"Overall, he's a pretty laid-back instructor. He makes himself available to his students. I'd definitely recommend him. It's a simple, to the point course."
13205,991084,1.0,4.0,"Literally so much reading. Have never had to print so many things in my god damn life. And she actively doesn't understand any of the science we talk about, but won't let the climate science professor who coteaches explain anything to us. Honestly a terrible professor."
13206,991084,1.0,5.0,"Lectures were soooo boring, she speaks very slowly, reads her notes and just repeats things from the reading. TONS of reading assigned each weak with uninteresting, unnecessary repetitive information. Made us do sing alongs in class. Tests were hard. Never got my final paper or final back so who knows how I got graded."
13207,991084,4.0,4.0,The class requires extensive reading but it is very easy to do well in. She has a very generous curve and is willing to work with you to improve from the first exam to the second. Highly recommend.
13208,991084,3.0,2.0,"And oh yeah, she'll tell you about 25 times how she was a Fulbright professor. How wonderful; it makes sense considering Europe's affection for unsustainable spending/following illegitimate ideologues/lack of logic. Also, take all her personal writings with a grain of salt (or several) because they mislead more than the other literatureshe espouses"
13209,991084,2.5,2.0,"Everyone on here who says she's a ""genius"" is clearly not qualified to make that claim. She is one of the most biased professors (or teachers)for that matter I've ever had and every reading/lecture felt like two hours of senseless EPA indoctrination by one of the most far-left leaning people on Grounds. Highly NOT recommended. Quite unprofessional"
13210,991084,1.0,5.0,"Whew. As previously stated, Thomson is clearly a genius. She also has a soothing NPR voice that knocks out a quater of the class immediately (which is funny). Her reading demands are ludicrous, with upwards of 120+ pages PER WEEK. She grades her discussion sections on a bell curve, which lowers the quality. She is unclear and unhelpful. BOOO"
13211,991084,1.5,5.0,Prof. Thompson is by far the least helpful professor I have ever had in 4 years of college.  She is completely unapproachable and unwilling to help students or clarify ANYTHING.  I went to her office hours often and each and every time she made me feel like an inconvenience and a bother.  She is the sole reason I decided against the ETP major.
13212,991084,4.5,4.0,I agree with all the other ratings that say there is a lot of reading for a 200 level class.  But Professor Thomson is absolutely an amazing teacher.  She is well over qualified for what she teaches and is one of the smartest people at UVA.  She cares about what she teaches and as long as you give her respect she will help you with your grade!
13213,991084,4.5,4.0,"EVSC 230 is a class that people love or hate. I think that people who took it because they were mildly interested in the subject matter and looking for an &quot;easy&quot; class are definitely disappointed because it is VERY rigorous. But, if you are ACTUALLY interested in policy and/or the environment, it is THE MOST worthwhile class you can take at UVa."
13214,991084,1.0,5.0,"This is one of the worst classes taught at UVA. The reading is absolutely boring, and there is so much of it that you won't have time to take it. She is the advisor for the Environmental Thought and Practice Major. So, unless you plant to major in THAT, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS"
13215,991084,3.5,5.0,She is clearly brilliant but very intimidating and demanding in class. TONS of readings assigned each week. Definitely pushes you if that's your thing.
13216,991084,3.5,4.0,"However, I found the lectures to be really  interesting-Thomson is organized, extremely clear, and widely knowledgeable.I thought the readings were also really interesting and varied, though...excessive.The class is definitely hard mostly because of the amount of reading and the tests-most questions were unpredictable/completely random"
13217,991084,4.5,4.0,"She is a fantastic lecturer and obviously knows the topic well.  I did not feel that she was extremely biased either way.  A hard class with lots of reading.  But the subject matter is my passion, so I enjoyed reading the articles."
13218,991084,4.0,4.0,"I thought she was a good teacher. I shared a lot of her beliefs, so I did not find any alarming bias."
13219,991084,1.0,5.0,One of the WORST professors at UVA!!! She turns a course on environmental policy into her platform for subjective rants. There is a ridiculous amount of reading for a 200 level course and tests are ridiculously hard. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!
13220,991084,2.5,5.0,"She is a great lecturer and really knows the subject well. The problem is that the tests encompass everything, including random names and specific details that you might not remember even if you know the topic. The TAs were amazing and very helpful. Ask questions and read everything as assigned. It's a very hard class but so informational!!"
13221,991084,1.0,2.0,The teacher is one of the worse at UVA.  Do not take this class if you want an objective lesson on Env Pol.  She just gets on a high horse and talks about random things that have nothing to do with Env. Pol.  Too much reading for nothing.  Not enough actual discussion on Env. Pol.Instead of focusing on concepts she focuses on names of senators.
13222,991084,2.5,4.0,"Oh, what can I say about Viv&#63; She is arrogant, and somehow managed to turn a course that should be objective into a series of subjective rants. Any passion I had for environmental policy has been replaced with contempt."
13223,991084,2.0,4.0,"This class is not worth the amount of reading, much of which you have to print off of Toolkit...sometimes upwards of ~80pgs per week.  Weeks we use actual books reading is even more daunting.  Tests are not impossible, but asks multiple choice questions with multiple correct answers.  All in all, not worth it for a 200-level class."

13225,1359734,5.0,3.0,I took him for international political philosophy. Great class. He did a good job getting students involved in discussion.
13226,1359734,2.0,5.0,He gives pop quizzes and they're only one question so if you get it wrong automatic zero. The test are all short answer and are extremely difficult. Expects a lot out of you for a general education Philosophy course. 
13227,1359734,5.0,2.0,"Galen was an awesome T.A! I was in his history of modern philosophy section, and he did a noticeably better job at explaining the tough concepts brought to bear in Hume, Kant, Descartes, and Berkeley than the main professor. He truly had those highly complex lines of philosophical reasoning NAILED DOWN, and was great at explaining them. Take him!"
13228,1359734,4.5,2.0,Galen is super hot!
13229,1359734,3.0,3.0,"He's pretty serious, but he challenges you to think and defend your position. He grades papers very fairly."
13230,1359734,5.0,3.0,Great TA. Understood the material and explained it clearly unlike the professor.
13231,1359734,4.5,3.0,"He was real laid back, which made discussion more fun. He made the material that Secada presented much more understandable. Great TA overall."
13232,1359734,4.0,4.0,"Galen is the bomb-diggity. He carries a trapper keeper with fuzzy kittens on it and dresses like its 1990. Very clear, very ironic, and tells good stories. Sometimes he mumbles. Worth taking."
13233,2244471,5.0,2.0,Professor Taylor is really knowledgeable and approachable. His lectures were easy to follow along and he really wants us to succeed!
13234,2244471,2.0,4.0,"Great lecturer, interesting content ruined by worst syllabus and grading system I've ever seen. Grade has nothing to do with understanding of history and everything to do with memorization of dozens of arbitrary dates for weekly ID quizzes and conforming to his ludicrously rigid writing guide. Awful experience."
13235,2244471,5.0,3.0,Professor Taylor is a really good lecturer and you can tell how knowledgeable about the subject he is. He works really hard to make his lectures fun and engaging. He understands the students and breaks down his lectures so even non-history majors could feel interested in what he was talking about.
13236,2244471,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Taylor's class was so fascinating just by his clear passion and engaging lectures. There is a weekly discussion, but the discussion readings are not hard (just interesting primary sources). His additional readings are not too bad, and honestly not insanely important if you pay attention to his lectures. Strict writing criteria though."
13237,2244471,5.0,4.0,"Professor Taylor quizzes every other week for 2 months in the middle of the semester on IDs from lectures and the books, so I recommend splitting the readings among a study group well ahead of time to make studying easier. Taylor's writing standards are quite high, so you will need to write drafts and not wait til the night before to write papers."
13238,2244471,4.0,5.0,"I loved his lectures but hated this class. He says his grading criteria are meant to make you a better writer, but really they are incredibly arbitrary and dumb. Learned a lot, but I wish I hadn't taken this class."
13239,614271,4.0,2.0,"Don't know what all the negative comments are all about. Mrs. Pecora does a significantly better job than most of my other teachers. She gets a lot of disrespect from students but still holds her head high, and I respect her for that."
13240,614271,1.0,1.0,"She is the worst teacher i could ever have for my italian class. She does not speak italian and she confuses italian with spanish, she does not explain what we need to do before doing it, she lets native italian speakers to correct her, her grammar is horrible and she cannot make a sentence or a question  in italian that can actually make sense."
13241,614271,2.5,1.0,Hahahahahaha. All I have to say.
13242,614271,3.0,5.0,"she's an ok teacher, but it was hard for me to learn in the class. before I took this class, I loved taking Italian, now, not so much. but ya, overall she was really nice and tried to help me as best she could."
13243,614271,4.5,4.0,"This is really a great introductory Italian class and Maggie is incredibly helpful.  She makes learning the language fun and exposes us to a lot of Italian culture as well.  The class is all in Italian, but she does a great of job making sure everyone understands before moving on."
13244,614271,4.0,3.0,No Comments
13245,614271,3.0,3.0,"i hate languages in general so this was a hard class for me.  dont take unless you realllly have an interest in italian and/or are good at languages.  maggie was nice though, and a pretty effective teacher.  spent the time to make sure you understood everything"
13246,2416512,2.0,4.0,"All 3010 sections are frustrating, but Prof Chemris' teaching exacerbated this for me. She alternated b/n extending hw due dates &amp; reviewing worksheets answers right after handing them out. Gives good feedback on papers, but her explanation for grammar forms isnt always clear. Youll do well if you participate often &amp; practice grammar outside class"
13247,2506627,5.0,2.0,"Nate's knowledge of the material was on point. His approach was pretty laid back but thorough. I would 

recommend this class.  "
13248,2506627,5.0,3.0,Nate is an absolutely amazing instructor. One of the first things you'll notice is how casual and open minded he is. His essay prompts are very open ended and he gives great feedback and constructive criticism. Most of our classes were discussions about what we read and he facilitated them really well. Highly recommend you take one of his classes!
13249,1367940,2.0,3.0,He did not lecture at all.  The students ran each lecture by being divided into groups at the beginning of the semester and then being assigned weeks to present for both Monday and Wednesday for an hour and 15 minutes. Midterm assignment was unclear which resulted in a ton of low grades but he gave us a second chance to bring up those grades.
13250,1367940,2.0,4.0,"The lectures are incredibly boring and the readings are very dry. The tests are rather easy, he gives the prompt the class before and you can bring a sheet of notes to write the essay on the prompt the day of. I wouldn't take this class again but I did learn some interesting things. "
13251,1367940,2.0,3.0,"I only took this class because the course description made it seem really interesting. It's basically a philosophy class though and he's a terrible teacher. Not engaging at all. Powerpoints are black text on a white background. People sign into attendance and ultimately get up and leave during the class. No tests-just papers,but he's a picky grader"
13252,1367940,3.5,1.0,"Goofy and quirky, but grades based on engagement with the material and original thoughts, not necessarily accuracy. Probably wouldn't take the class again, but I did learn some interesting things in this class."
13253,1367940,1.0,2.0,"This class is one of the most boring, useless classes I've ever take. The professor attempts to make this 2000 level class harder than it needs to be by making four assignments each week that don't actually help you learn the material, but is judged solely on whether you can schedule to do them. He has an accent and rambles quickly through lecture."
13254,1367940,4.0,2.0,"This class was just okay.  I pretty much hated it at the beginning because the lecture style was unorganized and the slides were bad, but things got much, much better after the midterm.  He's a really nice guy and does want you to do well, but it's not a class I would go out of my way to recommend to anyone."
13255,1367940,4.0,3.0,"I took Economy and Society with him and it was an interesting class.He's not the most exciting lecturer especially that early in the morning, but lectures were very clear and organized and really helped with understanding the readings.Midterm was pretty easy,straight from the slides,and weekly exercises weren't too bad.Overall,I'm glad I took it."
13256,1310596,4.0,5.0,"The first thing he tells you in the first day is: A = Excellent, and he really means it. This guy is ridiculously hard, for I feel like no reason at all. You have to write a Pulitzer prize-winning essay to get As. The material, however, is incredibly interesting and I learned a ton of important information."
13257,2768781,1.0,4.0,"I can't say about his other classes but AVOID THIS ONE!!! Firstly, I think this professor is not so respectful to students as he would post homework grade of each student on blackboard before he gave back the paper copies. Moreover, the homework was all MATLAB based questions and it took a lot of time. Instead, you could do it by EXCEL."
13258,1777551,4.5,3.0,BEST TA IN THE FREAKING UNIVERSE. Nice. fair grader... Overall: Awesome.
13259,1777551,3.5,3.0,"A fair grader, very nice, and approachable"
13260,1777551,2.5,4.0,"I had a really hard time with her because she seemed fairly impossible to please with papers. While she was good at trying to involve everyone in discussions, I still encountered issues with not getting clear feedback with what was wrong with my work when there were problems."
13261,1777551,5.0,1.0,Super sweet French TA. She's awesome! would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
13262,1073040,4.0,3.0,Cool. Chill.
13263,1073040,5.0,2.0,This guy's cool.
13264,1073040,5.0,3.0,Peter Kang is a TA but a wonderful TA. He is absolutely hilarious and makes every discussion section worth attending.
13265,1138582,5.0,1.0,great.
13266,1138582,5.0,4.0,"Jennifer was a really nice TA, and knew what she was talking about and would always answer any questions, Very approachable. Although she was not the easiest grader, her comments were always fair and helpful. As long as you participate in class your discussion grade will turn out high, and will definitely help out your overall grade for the course."
13267,1138582,4.0,2.0,Jennifer Heliste was a pretty clear and understandable TA. She was very good at answering questions. You have to read for Discussion but it's not alot at all and not very dense. Just come to class and revise your 3 papers for a better grade and the easy A is totally worth the grade boost.
13268,1310617,5.0,3.0,"An inspiring, fantastic woman- really knows what she's talking about and how to explain it."
13269,1974170,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Edwards is very good at explaining the material clearly, is good at creating class participation, and has the cutest children. I will miss him next semester."
13270,1974170,4.0,1.0,"Prof. Edwards was really fun, even though my discrete class had upwards of 200 people he made it feel as interactive as a high school class. Asks for questions at the beginning of every class, even if it takes 15 min. Sometimes frustratingly easy, as in spends a lot of time on easy topics. Funny. I chose his class next sem even though it's early :D"
13271,130970,4.0,2.0,"This class has a lot of reading that definitely doesn't need to be done, but it is enriching if you want to understand the topics more. Professor Hantman kind of babbles and goes off on tangents, but the material isn't so difficult that that's a problem. I found him funny and kind and he's passionate about the material."
13272,130970,3.5,2.0,"Grading was  pretty unpredictable, but usually above a B for nearly everyone in the class. I only ever saw a few A's given out. Make sure to write about WHY your reasons are important and you'll do fine."
13273,130970,2.0,5.0,"This class is HARD. Do not underestimate this class. Most hard working students end up with a B or B+, but getting an A or A- is almost impossible."
13274,130970,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed Prof. Hantman's Human Origins class. The material was interesting and he was very passionate about his topic. Occasionally he went off on tangents, but they were still interesting. There were only two midterms and a final, which came from the notes and readings. As long as you take notes in class and do the readings, you'll do fine"
13275,130970,2.5,2.0,He is passionate about the subject but rambles and goes on tangents about useless information instead of covering all of the material we were tested on.  What should have been an interesting class ended up being boring and frustrating
13276,130970,2.5,2.0,"Prof Hantman can be hilarious but he would go off on tangents during lectures and I could NEVER follow him. He seemed passionate about the material. The only way I could learn material was to read the books, but don't leave them till the end because they are hard to catch up on. Would only recommend if you like evolution or archaeology."
13277,130970,1.0,2.0,"Human Origins was literally the worst class I've ever taken! Class was SO boring, he can't stay on topic... his voice was so boring but the tests were specific. NEVER TAKE THIS CLASS EVER."
13278,130970,5.0,2.0,Most entertaining and one of the most intelligent professors I have had.  Passionate about his topics and easy to get along with.
13279,130970,4.0,2.0,great teacher. he teaches pretty boring subjects but hes a really funny guy and can entertain you even during the most boring things. grades pretty easily on papers and tests and provides study guides so its not a hard class if you put in a little effort. id take him again in a heartbeat
13280,130970,4.0,2.0,Hantman is great...classes are boring but he's funny and a good teacher. Gives study guides for exams which make it fairly easy to get an A. He's been my favorite teacher so far at UVA
13281,130970,4.0,1.0,Great class
13282,130970,3.0,4.0,"He's a pretty cool guy, but the class can get pretty boring. Some of the material went over my head. A good class to take if you're really into anthropology, history, or biology."
13283,130970,5.0,1.0,"This was a great class.  The first test was really easy, and the second was more difficult but he graded pretty easily.  Very laid back, funny guy, who knows everything you want to know about Virginia Archaeology.  Lots of reading, don't really have to do it all.  Research topic on anything you want related to VA Arch."
13284,130970,4.5,3.0,Great teacher.  Laid back but serious (with a dry sense of humor).  You will have to work at any class you take from him but hey - that's U.Va.   Has some great ancedotes to tell to relate what is being discussed in class.  Also a gentle man.  You won't regret taking a class from him.  No matter how hard it might be.  It's good for you - remember&#63;
13285,130970,4.5,4.0,"Fourth year second semester Jeff graciously let six of his students, me included take make up exams so we could all get at least C's to make sure that we graduated.  If I'd failed his class I would not have gotten out!  Twenty five percent of the class flunked his stones and bones exam, but actually, he warned us we would.  I think that is a weed out class for anthro, and I was taking it for fun.... Oooopppps!"
13286,130970,4.5,4.0,A quarter of the class got a d or below on the stones and bones exam.  The physical aspects of anthro are difficult unless you have a specific talent in that field or already understand anatomy and physiology.  Just don't do this class on your spring semester fourth year !!!!
13287,130970,4.5,3.0,great class
13288,130970,4.0,3.0,Nice guy but can get VERY boring.  I wouldn't recommend unless you like biology- a lot of the material is within a biological context.
13289,130970,5.0,3.0,this man is a god
13290,130970,4.0,3.0,"great class, great man. he's insanely difficult to keep track of, though and his lectures are very very unclear. first test was hard.  very hard to get anything concrete in his class. you have to guess what the point of the lecture is."
13291,130970,4.5,3.0,"He's a really sweet, interesting prof.  Easy to talk to & very intelligent.  He's really willing to help."
13292,130970,5.0,3.0,"Hantman is da bomb! The best prof. at UVA! He is hilarious and classes often go off on wild tangents and great stories. But don't get me wrong, he knows what he's talking about. Take a class from this man. You won't regret it."
13293,130970,5.0,3.0,"Knows his stuff and has a wonderful sense of humor.  Fun to talk to even if it's not about anthro, but loves to talk about archaeology or physical anth (a rare thing in the department).  Slightly strange--Get to know him."
13294,130970,5.0,3.0,No Comments
13295,384922,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. Great human being. 
13296,384922,4.0,3.0,"If you enjoy reading AND writing, you will probably enjoy this class. Rody is enthusiastic and helpful but doesn't just dish out good grades-- you have to put in some effort."
13297,384922,2.5,2.0,No Comments
13298,384922,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed Rody's class--both the subject matter and her teaching style.  Extremely encouraging and positive with her students.  Good command of interesting material, and useful feedback on papers.  Highly recommended."
13299,384922,5.0,4.0,"Professor Rody was hands down the best professor I had at UVA.  Really knows her stuff, has great insight into the material at hand, and moreover really interested in her student's progress, and will take the time to talk to you and get to know you"
13300,1818528,5.0,2.0,"He was very clear with what he wanted and answered any questions you had. He was very willing to meet outside of the classroom to help with subjects to do with the class, or anything else you may have inquires about."
13301,2015139,3.5,3.0,"Profesora Goman was a great teacher to have as a re-introduction to Spanish after 4 years since taking it in high school. Although there was lots of homework on a consistent basis, I feel like most of the assignments helped me prepare for the tests."
13302,2015139,4.0,3.0,"Wonderful professor who really cares about her students. She makes Spanish truly engaging, which was unexpected for me."
13303,2015139,5.0,2.0,"Professor Goman is the only good teacher I've had at UVa, and the best I've had period. Would absolutely take her again, and recommend her to everyone interested in taking Spanish."
13304,1417124,4.0,5.0,"Easy until the final paper which was 3000 words minimum, which is a lot for the course level. A lot of readings which are important to do."
13305,1744811,4.0,4.0,Strict but approachable. Works hard to make content interesting for students. Not my favorite but definitely a good option for this course.
13306,1744811,5.0,4.0,"Suzie is a very enthusiastic instructor. She makes you work for your grade, but she's available to help during her office hours."
13307,1744811,4.0,2.0,"Suzie does change office hours, but she holds them a lot. She's super approachable and if you listen to her advice in class you'll get a good grade. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her as a TA"
13308,1744811,1.0,4.0,Worse TA ever. Shes too busy with her own work to help you. always changes her office hours. For some reason she grades the first paper harder than the second which has no logic. Avoid at all cost
13309,688044,4.5,2.0,She is a wonderful professor and has made me want to double major in Global Health! i will be taking her again next semester! quizzes are group quizzes and its impossible to make lower than a B on them. Tests are easy and exactly whats on the study guide.
13310,688044,5.0,2.0,"took her class over the summer and absolutely wonderful. all of the readings were great and she's enthusiastic about what she does. i think she's in tanzania now, but when she comes back, take her class!"
13311,688044,5.0,1.0,Her discussions are very interesting and she will use real-life examples to illustrate the problems of society. Take her discussion class! She's very entertaining and funny sometimes too. She's smart and grades you more than fair.
13312,688044,5.0,2.0,although i didnt look forward to taking the class i ended the semester glad i did. amy is a fantastic TA and all of her lectures are interesting! while she does assign a lot of reading it is worth it. her class is fun and you cant go wrong picking her as a teacher!
13313,688044,5.0,2.0,Amy is a great TA. Although she assigns a lot of reading she is fair and understanding if you cannot complete it all. She is an exceptionally fair and easy grader and makes the class interesting and fun!
13314,688044,4.5,2.0,"She gives lots of reading, but you can get away w/ only reading about half of it. She is really excited about what she teaches and her energy really drives the class. She gives easy assignments and grades easy too. This was a great class and Amy was a fantastic TA."
13315,688044,4.0,2.0,"Tons of reading, but it is all interesting. She grades easy and gives good assignments."
13316,1589170,5.0,4.0,"Big worth knows his stuff, appreciate being in the presence of a master in the subject matter.  His lectures are gems, copy every little thing he writes down, him and Stankovic are the only ones I know that put in the effort to use the chalkboard and their own notes, the least students can do is put in the effort too and learn something."
13317,1589170,1.5,5.0,"Worst professorteacher I have ever had.  He mumbled through the class, handwrites (badly) his lecture notes on paper and refuses to post them, has no clear grading criteria, and basically just lets you sink or swim on your own until you hope you get a good grade at the end."
13318,1589170,1.0,5.0,Horrible professor! never have lecture notes or any other resource online. Clearly make the class unfair to students. exams are too hard and you are likely to get terrible grades if you are not a master of the material before every single class. His handwriting is often confusing and unclear.
13319,1589170,1.0,5.0,"Only materials you have for exams are your notes and a textbook. The notes are difficult to take because he comes to class with nothing on his hand, just writes stuff on the board with unclear explanations. The textbook is not very well written, not too consistent with the exams. No resources uploaded online(no notes or practice exams)."
13320,1589170,1.0,5.0,"No resources uploaded online, only study materials for exams are notes and textbook (no slides, nothing). However, difficult to take notes because he comes to class with nothing on his hand and his explanations about the material are not clear. The textbook readings are not too helpful for the exams either. Exam average is usually 50~60."
13321,1589170,2.0,5.0,Didn't explain stuff very well (mumbling/rambling) and made the class harder than it needed to be... he catered the class to the people who clearly had mastered the material before it was even taught.
13322,1818551,5.0,3.0,Really great guy who genuinely cares about his students and material. His lectures are pretty cool and the class is not at all difficult - just do the reading and make sure to participate from time to time and you'll be good. He blends philosophy and technology really well and I'd definitely recommend the class.
13323,1818551,5.0,3.0,Great professor for if you actually want to learn something. Don't take if you're planning on slacking.....
13324,1818551,5.0,3.0,Very good prof- please take this class if you can. he is helpful and very nice.
13325,49086,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hawley was awesome.  Funny, smart, and really helpful one on one.  A truly great professor."
13326,49086,4.0,4.0,"His presentations are an outline of what he's talking about--what he says is more important and he moves kind of quickly, so I'd suggest using a laptop for note-taking. The tests can be difficult but taking detailed notes really helps you understand the material. He's funny and helpful if you ask him questions, which he really seems to enjoy."
13327,49086,4.0,4.0,"I loved this class. I'm in no way a science person and I only got a B, but the class was worth it. Hawley is HILARIOUS and a very good professor. I learned so much. The material is utterly fascinating. It's a difficult class, especially if you're not a science person, but I don't regret taking this class to fill the science requirement."
13328,49086,3.0,4.0,Interesting material and textbook readings important to understand lecture. Hawley is funny and makes the class laugh 1-2 times each lecture. I always thought I did well on tests until I got them back. Weekly homeworks helpful but sometimes difficult
13329,49086,2.5,5.0,"Interesting topic, Hawley is funny, but this class is an OBSCENE amount of work to do well.  The tests are easy if you study a ton, but you really really need to put in a lot of effort.  I'd avoid unless you're really math/science-y"
13330,49086,2.0,4.0,"Definitely not as good as I was expecting.  He wasn't as funny or interesting as other people have said.  The classes were very dull and the book was the densest, most boring textbook I've had during my 4 years here.  This class is not as easy as you'd expect!"
13331,49086,4.5,5.0,"Makes a few good jokes but classes are kind of dull. Buy his textbook because it has everything you need to know. Like the COD says, you'll learn about black holes and the big bang. But be warned: if you hate relativity and other physics concepts of the like, choose another class."
13332,49086,4.0,5.0,"Very good at explaining the material. Even though the lectures can get a little bit boring, he has his funny moments. The book is a godsend and he co-authored it, so use it."
13333,49086,4.0,4.0,"I took several classes with him.  Easily the funniest professor i've had.  Kind of a dry sense of humor but he works it into his lectures very well and keeps you listening.  I highly recommend any of his classes, especially if you have any interest in astronomy."
13334,49086,3.0,3.0,I went to app. half of his classes and didn't find them to be interesting at all. He makes some nice jokes once in a while but he couldn't keep me from falling asleep in 75 minutes. The material is hard. And the book sucks! Don't you underestimate the homeworks! Find his old tests! He doesn't give the same ones but you'll know what's coming!
13335,49086,4.0,1.0,"The funniest professor I've had so far at UVA, and a pretty good teacher to boot.  He wrote the textbook, which is a quick read and generally easy to follow; the only preparation I ever needed for his tests and homework.  This was one of the most interesting classes I've ever taken, and if you keep up on the reading it's a piece of cake."
13336,49086,4.5,2.0,"Yes, he's mind-blowing.  Had our huge lecture class of jaded students in a morning class ROFL multiple times each lecture.  Sometimes he gets on a roll and really gets the class going.  Can be funny and still really teach at the same time.  Easy weekly HWs.  Tests are ok.  Uses his own textbook, it's pretty good just not many pretty pictures."
13337,49086,5.0,4.0,"unbelievably smart. kind of reminds me of einstein (similar hair). really funny. material is hard. black holes, big bang, relativity, models of universe. very cool material. learned so much. recommend, but make sure you go to class. i didnt for the first half of the semester, didnt do great on 1st test. hw 15%, 2 tests and a final."
13338,49086,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely hilarious.  Not afriad to make jokes that go over the head of half the class.  Oh, he can really teach as well."
13339,49086,5.0,3.0,This guy is so cool! I'm not even joking. When I get older I want to be spunky like Mr.Hawley. That is truly the only word for him spunky. His class is hard but his lectures are really funny. I want him to be my grandpa!!!
13340,49086,5.0,1.0,"This guy is freaking amazing. Not only is the topic great, but this guy is hilarious and I'm pretty sure he has superhuman powers.  His lectures can be boring, but the jokes are good and I enjoyed class when I went. Tests are really easy if you read the book."
13341,49086,3.5,3.0,"Prof. Hawley is great! He's extremely interested in what he teaches. He's also hilarious: &quot;Anyone who compares himself to Galileo today is a crackpot&quot; and &quot;Now put the horse and the cart in outer space. Well, the horse would quickly die. Let's start again. Give the horse a space suit...&quot;"
13342,49086,5.0,2.0,Teacher is hilarious had him for 121 too.  Makes you want to go to the classes
13343,49086,5.0,2.0,This man is amazing.  I would hihly recommend him to anyone because he excites students during his lectures.
13344,49086,4.0,4.0,"Ignore the lower level class opinions, because Cosmology is fantastic.  Yeah, it's hard, but it's not his fault, it's the subject.  He's friggin hilarious and also a very accomodating professor.  Chances are that people who reviewed him negatively are a bunch of slackers.  I've already had cosmology but I'm going to go just for fun this semester."
13345,49086,4.0,5.0,"He really is hysterical. Once he told us that &quot;The universe is not like a weiner-dog shaped balloon.&quot; But he's tough. His tests are hard, and he likes those equations. He's one of those professors where I'd like to just go audit his classes so I could laugh at his jokes and learn the interesting stuff, but not have to tested."
13346,49086,4.5,1.0,"Guess what, guys, Hawley teaches 124 only, not 121. As the other ratings said (the previous one is a good example), this guy is hilarious. The class itself is ridiculously easy for anyone who's even heard of physics, but the lack of rigor is annoying (Blatantly gets physical laws wrong in the name of easiness.) A good slack class, great professor."
13347,49086,4.0,3.0,"Incredibly great guy. Best Astronomy teacher I know of. He has an amazingly dry sense of humor. His tests arent too bad, but you have to study. &quot;Rollercoasters are just long lines of people waiting to have forces applied to their bodies. For five bucks I'll let you stand in line at Wal-MArt then hit you with a bat when you come out, same thing.&quot;"
13348,49086,4.5,4.0,"Hawley is very funny and explains the material well, but the tests and the material can be rather difficult."
13349,49086,4.0,4.0,I thought Hawley was kind of boring but from what I hear he is the best astronomy teacher. Far better than Strutskie or Trinh.
13350,49086,3.0,4.0,"lectures are extremely boring, exams are hard; if you want to take astronomy find another professor"
13351,49086,1.0,5.0,TERRIBLE!
13352,49086,3.5,4.0,"As far as lectures go, he's not bad at all.  He is actually rather amusing.  Exams are a nightmare, though.  On the bright side he lets you drop one.  He is definitely one of the harder Astronomy profs."
13353,49086,5.0,3.0,"he is awesome...keeps class interesting and is hilariously sarcastic. makes jokes all the time, keeps you awake.  one of my favorites :)"
13354,49086,3.5,3.0,"knows his stuff and hilariously sarcastic. however, he is one of the harder teachers of the intro course; its deceptively easy - make sure u study for the tests"
13355,49086,5.0,2.0,"True about the quotes, &quot;The universe began today at 8am&quot; and &quot;Obey the voices that come out of the tv&quot;  this man actually said, &quot;Come around for a good slap later&quot; when talking about people who didnt think the moon landing re"
13356,49086,5.0,2.0,"great sense of humour, interesting class"
13357,49086,5.0,2.0,"Keeps class entertaining; if you don't pay attention, you'll be awakened to people laughing, and you'll miss the joke or funny story.  Is really interested in cosmology; doesn't expect you to understand EVERYTHING, since it's hard to picture."
13358,49086,3.0,4.0,Absolutely hilarious quotes--especially about man and science fiction.
13359,49086,4.5,3.0,WOW!  Funny and EXTREMELY knowledgeable!
13360,1245126,4.5,1.0,"very easy going professor. starts you on your assignment then leaves the room. there are some outside assignments but he doesn't record whether you did them or not, though everyone normally did. critiques usually involve him talking extensively. but he is very nice and complimentary towards everyone's work - would recommend him as a professor"
13361,1245126,5.0,2.0,This is the third semester I've had Geiger and I definitely recommend him. He really knows what he's talking about when it comes to painting and drawing. He's fairly lax which is both a good thing and a bad thing.
13362,1245126,4.5,3.0,"Geiger is the best art professor at UVA in terms of classically trained methods.  Learned a lot about composition, value, etc.  Can be unnecessarily long-winded in his critiques."
13363,1245126,5.0,3.0,dont be intimidated! he might seem a little severe and very serious at first but he's a good teacher
13364,2039764,5.0,4.0,loved him!
13365,2039764,4.0,4.0,Such an interesting course and Emery is clearly passionate about what he is teaching. There are extra credit opportunities available and although it is a lot of textbook reading it's not unmanageable
13366,2039764,5.0,3.0,"Robert Emery is fantastic! He clearly cares about his students and he is very approachable. His lectures are very engaging, but they do deviate from the textbook content so you need to both pay attention in lecture and do the readings in order to be well-prepared for the exams. He offers extra credit opportunities in the form of easy papers."
13367,2039764,5.0,2.0,"Emery is my favorite prof I've had at UVA. The lectures are interesting, the tests are pretty easy, and there are extra credit opportunities to improve an entire letter grade. I highly recommend."
13368,2039764,1.0,5.0,"One of the worst professors I have ever had. He was an arrogant man, and makes you read the textbook that he wrote. His tests were formatted to trick you, and your grade is based solely on those 4 tests. He was a dry lecturer and it was a challenge to stay awake. I read every chapter and still struggled to pass - DO NOT take abnormal psych with him"
13369,2039764,5.0,3.0,great professor.
13370,1302497,5.0,2.0,"I definitely recommend Carolyn! She is extremely helpful and willing to help her students any way she can. Her notes are very clear, and she uses examples that aren't already in the textbook. Additionally, I didn't need to use the textbook at all. Her grading is very fair. Take her class!"
13371,1302497,5.0,3.0,"She is an absolutely wonderful Calc teacher. She is very helpful, and although classes might seem extremely long, you learn what you need to learn. Her notes are very clear- I haven't used the book all year. Definitely recommend her as a teacher."
13372,1302497,5.0,3.0,carolyn really wants to help her students and she does everything she can so that they understand and get a good grade on her tests. she's very nice and definitely knows how to teach calculus. i would recommend having her as a calculus professor.
13373,1302497,5.0,2.0,"seriously awesome, she was so nice and very helpful, fair with quizzes and exams, take her for calc!"
13374,1302497,5.0,2.0,"Carolyn is young, sweet and dedicated to her students. More than fair in her grading, she really tries to make sure you knows what's going on and is extremely helpful in office hours. Definitely recommend her for this course."
13375,1302497,4.5,2.0,Very friendly and easy teacher. Prepares you very well for the exams and even makes classes interesting and calculus not too painful to learn (or re-learn). I heard some horror stories about other teachers for 1210 but Carolyn was great.
13376,1458153,4.5,4.0,lots of reading. overall a good professor.
13377,1458153,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bishop is fantastic.  The class is focused on writing process so plan on multiple revisions.  Her feedback is centered on correct grammar, discontinuity in narrative, and respecting the student's narrative voice."
13378,1458154,1.0,3.0,"Professor Levine was nightmare.  His grading procedures were unorthodox, and he did not provide feedback. 
He failed to allow  a screen share on Zoom during my presentation and did not allow me to join the other  classmates who were not  prepared  for a  ""special"" Zoom  meeting in order to fix the problem.  He was unhelpful and unencouraging. "
13379,1458154,2.0,3.0,"Levine knows a lot of about art history. However, his lectures are dry, uninspiring, and uninteresting. Not a fan of snide comments and putting folks down. Avoid like the plague."
13380,1458154,5.0,3.0,Take any course he offers.  He will bend over backwards to help a students - but he never compromises fairness for the whole class. Fair grading. Topics are right on target.  Makes history and culture cool; he doesn't skimp on racy parts that get edited out like in high school.  Friendly.  Easy to talk to.  Cares about students & that they improve.
13381,1458154,5.0,4.0,Levine is a great professor! He is fair and will work with you on your papers and written materials - the first &quot;Green&quot; Professor I've ever had; he does everything online and he uses the text book completely...no waisted money on unnecessary books! He keeps it real!
13382,1458154,4.0,3.0,"This prof started out great but he is way to hard on grading. He comes off as an nice guy but he leaves no room for error, only a bad grade. Skip him and take someone else."
13383,1458154,5.0,2.0,"Generally interesting lectures, easy grader, and takes a lot of interest in how the students are doing. Great teacher overall, definitely recommended."
13384,1654765,2.5,1.0,Very fun and kind but not good at teaching art. Doesn't really know how to improve students work. When she describes techniques a lot of people are left confused and not really sure what the point is but great studio time if you already have talent. Doesn't grade hard at all.
13385,1212407,5.0,3.0,Great guy and a great teacher as well. Always willing to go the extra mile for students by extending homework assignments and holding extra office hours. Lectures were very clear and if you went to class and understood all the homework problems you would do fine. Really made Calc 2 and 3 conquerable!
13386,1212407,5.0,2.0,Very funny and makes the leture very clear. Approachable and nice. Take this class.
13387,1212407,5.0,3.0,"Ajay is really clear about all the materials, and I can tell he has very solid foundation in what he teaches. He is very helpful too, always having extra office hours and review sessions. Very good teacher."
13388,1212407,5.0,1.0,Ajay is great!  he answers questions well and you can tell he wants the class to understand the material.
13389,1212407,3.0,4.0,"Sometimes says things that don't make sense, but for the most part the class isn't too hard. An A should be attainable if you do all the homework and study a bit for the tests."
13390,1212407,4.5,2.0,Interesting and easy class. Professor Chandra is extremely helpful and nice. He is always willing to help and if you do all the take home quizzes and the reviews he gives before every exam you'll do very good in the class (You can easily get 100 if you review these.) It is an easy A and the class is not time consuming for a math class.
13391,1212407,4.5,3.0,Really helpful and friendly Professor! Take Calculus or any maths class with him and you wont regret!
13392,1212407,5.0,2.0,Absolutely spectacular math teacher who is great explaining things. Phenomenal person to take any math class with.
13393,1212407,5.0,4.0,"EXCELLENT professor- extremely helpful.  Held study sessions on Sunday nights if the class needed extra help before an exam.  First three tests were very easy, the final was a little bit more tricky.  Really nice guy and helpful."
13394,1212407,5.0,3.0,absolutely great teacher and one of those overall &quot;nice guys.&quot; emails are hilarious
13395,1540093,4.5,5.0,I loved the class on PLCs.  Thomas was a great teacher and a lot of fun to learn from.
