She only questions students' answers and does not allow for student questioning. very strong about her own beliefs and she chooses which philosophers she agrees with to teach about. I wouldn't participate in her class because she tells every student they're wrong. Not great."
1,143362,5.0,1.0,So good
2,143362,5.0,5.0,"Great Professor. I loved her class, she's hilarious!!! I came out writing much better."
3,143362,4.5,4.0,shes da bomb
4,143362,5.0,4.0,"OMG! she was so much fun, and so funny. her class is hard, but if you just go to the lectures, she explains it all and you'll do well on the test. i wish i had the units/time to take her again! she's sooooo nice."
5,143362,4.0,3.0,awesome prof...class was entertaining too.

8,1372166,4.0,2.0,"Laidback n gets sidetracked easily but it makes the class enjoyable. There IS a textbook but I got an A w/o it bc I did all HWs &amp; we always discuss the reading in class-- so make SURE you show up! Class  viewing diff sources like vids, documentaries, articles, etc based on the week's content which was WAY better than an hr+ long lecture every day!"
9,1372166,3.0,2.0,"Garcias a chill professor, most of the assignments are online and its an easy A to just complete them. Hes nice and doesnt mind answering any questions or concerns. However, his grading expectations are high; for ex: a 95 is an A- when typically its an A or a 92 is a B+. Just make sure you do the assignments and you will be fine :)"
10,1372166,4.0,3.0,"Father Garcias tests are medium level difficulty so be sure to study. Lectures are sometimes interesting. Do not skip class, he takes attendance everyday and it counts!!! He only assigned maybe 2 papers and the exams are taken online. Only thing that sucked was he did not curve exams no matter how bad the results were :/"
11,1372166,5.0,4.0,"Awesome Professor! I had never read a bible before but Father Garcia made it so interesting, by giving more details. Hes hilarious, lectures are more of an open discussion mostly. I am taking another of his classes next semester."
12,1372166,5.0,2.0,"Im shocked to see all these low ratings, he is an amazing teacher and he is hilarious. I took him for Death and Afterlife and he was amazing, he really knows his stuff and will explain more if you don't understand. "
13,1372166,4.5,3.0,"I am taking him for Intro to Hebrew Scriptures and he is absolutely amazing! He talks about the stories in the bible so if you are confused during the reading he will most definitely go over it in class. Make sure to pay attention during the lectures because everything in the test was discussed in the lecture, even if it wasn't in the book."
14,1372166,2.5,2.0,took him for christian ethics. All assignments are turned in online and check your emails every day  before you go to sleep. Interesting topics but not consistent and a bit all over the place. There's like 5 different professors coming in and out to teach. He's a nice guy.
15,1372166,2.0,3.0,"Be sure to turn in all assignments, no late assignments accepted! He incorporates what he posts online to his exams on top of the readings from the textbook. Make sure you understand the stories from the Bible. Take notes when he talks about those stories and review them after class. "
16,1372166,2.0,2.0,"Need the book mostly for assignments he gives. Do not understand how he gives the questions on the exams. Mostly on  his lectures. He was really unorganized. Participation does matter because the more you participate, the better your grade will be. You get to enter your own participation in an angel dropbox so participate!!"
17,1372166,4.0,1.0,I don't really get why the reviews here are so low.   His study guides are great because he basically fills it all out for you.  Study the study guides and do the readings and I don't see why you wouldn't do well.  He is a very smart man and knows the bible thoroughly.  I love the perspectives he gives about the stories in the Bible too.
18,1372166,2.0,2.0,"Father Garcia is very nice and is understanding about absences and helping to raise your grade. If you don't pay close attention and do all the readings, you're not going to learn anything from him because he's a push-over and lets giggly girls get him way off track and he'll ramble on and on about something unrelated. Was an interesting class."
19,1372166,1.0,1.0,This man seemed to care but he is easily influenced by the women and nuns that run his life... I am thankful for his small amount of help. He is not a professional and as a Priest he should not be running the Religious Studies depart here...
20,1372166,1.0,3.0,He was very entertaining during class. Was not able retain from his class. His test are not based on lectures make sure to read books & stuff posted online (mostly stuff online). He can be very sarcastic. NO LATE WORK ACCEPTED!! Takes attendance everyday.
21,1669128,3.5,1.0,Amos is a bundle of energy to keep you intrigued especially with politics. She knows her English discipline well. She's very approachable and helpful to get a good grade. But her class doesn't have much structure to know what is expected throughout the semester. She's either absent or cancels class often. Her class is a vacation in the semester.
22,1669128,5.0,1.0,A Great Teacher!!!!!!! You learn alot to improve your speech! Very helpful and caring. I recommend taking her. She is an awesome teacher!
23,1669128,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Amos is awesome. Her class is a nice break from the rest of your classes. You end up saying a fair amount of speeches, but her grading is not hard and equally as fair. There is never a dull moment in her class as she speaks her mind and does not hold anything back. Bottom line, take her. You will not regret this class or teacher!"
24,1372170,5.0,1.0,Scott is amazing. You have to take one of his classes. He gives great lectures and his classes are enlightening and humorous. If you are looking for a challenge then someone else might be more suited for you. If you want a class where you can learn and not be drowning in work and have fun then he is the perfect professor.
25,1372170,5.0,1.0,"Pretty great professor. Very helpful and you learn a lot about yourself. He makes it so that what we learn, we apply it to our own lives. Take it!!!"
26,1372170,5.0,1.0,Best teacher I've ever had! Extremely unconventional course. You'll learn so much about yourself in the process. Take him! So awesome.
27,1372170,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher, loved his class.Super creative, you won't be bored.The class is very unconventional , more like a personal trip through life stages.Take it!"
28,2287646,5.0,3.0,"Logic was not easy. However, Professor Walt does his best to help you understand the content. He is always willing to help and if he notices most of the class did poor on something he does the most to help the class out. I think during this pandemic, he has been the most understanding professor I've had."
29,2287646,5.0,4.0,"Prof Walt is a gr8 professor and person, but the class content is DIFFICULT to understand. He gives great lectures &amp; doesn't mind us asking questions in the middle of a lecture. He's also the ASC tutor for writing+philosophy, &amp; if u attend, u get extra credit! Def do your homework bc it's based on completion &amp; provides a huge cushion for exams!"
30,2287646,5.0,3.0,Professor Walt is the best professor I have had at the Mount. Lectures and Assignments are straight forward and easy to understand. He's typically always available for any questions or help you may need. Professor Walt makes philosophy so much more interesting than anyone else I've had. He's a great professor with a great character and charisma !!
31,2287646,5.0,4.0,"Professor Walt is definitely one of the best professors I have had here at the Mount. His lectures were very informative and easy to follow along to. He is very passionate for philosophy and will do whatever he can to make sure his students understand the material. I would highly recommend taking any course he offers, you will not regret it!"
32,2287646,5.0,4.0,"Professor Walt is a fantastic human being who ACTUALLY cares about his students learning in and enjoying his class. I have always struggled with philosophy but he worked very hard to create lectures that were fun and easy to follow, his class is the only good experience I've ever had with philosophy. Very funny too, sad not to have him anymore!"
33,2287646,5.0,3.0,He is really great and always helpful. Truly cares about his students and wants to make sure they understand.
34,2287646,5.0,3.0,"Prof Walt is brilliant and a caring person. Hes good at explaining details, encouraging participation, and ensuring we are learning the material. He is readily available to help in office hours and at the Learning Center, too. Definitely enroll in any course he teaches!"
35,2134050,4.5,2.0,"He's a fun professor, and actually wants to help his students. If you want to get extra credit points, talk about how amazing the circle of fifths is. You're welcome."
36,2074661,4.5,1.0,She gives a lot of homework if she notices you all dont care about the class. But gives extra credit at the end of the semester. 
37,2117671,5.0,1.0,"Professor Berndt is such a sweetheart. She is really understanding that people have lives outside of school, there were times where she would give our whole class extensions for projects or assignments. The only downside is the textbook that you need for the homework assignments. Besides that, her class was really easy and I enjoyed it a lot."
38,2117671,5.0,3.0,"Professor Berndt was very flexible in her online course. She was understanding of everything going on and extended certain deadlines. She made material easy to understand in her recorded lectures. She wasn't really a difficult grader, just make sure you complete everything and put in your best effort. Manage your time wisely! There was a lot to do!"
39,2117671,5.0,3.0,"The summer course had a lot of reading and assignments each week, but professor Berndt was really flexible with deadlines as long as you reached out to her. She gave a lot of extra credit opportunities and always gave feedback on each homework turned in. Study guides for the exams were also really helpful"
40,2117671,5.0,2.0,"Such a great professor, would take again. Is very clear when teaching so there is no confusion. She knows what she is talking about and makes the material relevant to the outside world and social media so this makes class captivating and engaging. She doesn't just sit there and stare at you like other professors at the Mount. She is also reachable."
41,2117671,5.0,2.0,Such a great class to take! If you need to take Philosophy I would really recommend her! It is a night class and lectures are three hours long and you stay for the whole time which can be boring! But probably best philosophy you can take!
42,2117671,5.0,2.0,"Professor Berndt is absolutely incredible! She is beyond my favorite professor. She explains everything very well and is very knowledgeable. Her class includes: exams, quizzes, writing assignments, homework, and a final. Philosophy can be very difficult to understand; however, Professor Berndt makes it easy to understand and remember."
43,970793,5.0,2.0,i was very scared to take Dr. Cheng's course this past semester.... i am so grateful i did! she was very detailed when explaining the importance of each chapter. she did very well at explaining what will be on the exam! you must always read the book and the homework questions are your bestfriend! 
44,970793,5.0,2.0,Professor Cheng is by far my most favorite biology professor. If you read and study her slides you will pass her exams. If you don't understand something ask questions! She will explain the concept to you in the best way possible.
45,970793,3.0,3.0,she refuses to accept any late work or give any extra credit. There are weekly pop quizzes. The exams have 50 questions and she puts things that we never even learned in class.
46,970793,5.0,2.0,"Previously I failed bio1 &amp; had to take her to move forward in my biology career, when taking her she provided extra worksheets to help us understand the material better. She is also a great lecture I was able to understand everything she talked about &amp; she cares about everyone in her class and is willing to provide extra work to have everyone pass."
47,970793,3.0,4.0,I don't really like her class. I can barely understand her because of her accent. Recommend not taking if you have a choice.
48,970793,5.0,4.0,"This review is regarding her lab. She is so patient and does her best to help you with labs. Her in lab quizzes and two exams were kinda difficult, but you just need to make sure you read the background information. Attendance is counted for Lab!"
49,970793,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Cheng is not a difficult professor if you study right. She is straightforward and all you really have to study are her slides, worksheets, and Mastering. I believe she made Micro really easy to understand. Pay attention and engage in lectures! Other than that, she is so sweet, understanding and is always willing to help her students."
50,970793,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Cheng for Bio 5 and I'm currently taking her for microbiology lecture and lab. She's a very good professor. MAKE SURE TO STUDY. Microbiology can be tough but make sure to study and you'll definitely pass. If you need help, make sure to go to her office hours. Overall, she's a very helpful and caring professor."
51,970793,3.0,3.0,"Professor Cheng is okay, she is tough, and you really need to put in the work. Also, she could be hard to understand so be aware of that. Just make sure to study for the class and put in the time, and you should be fine."
52,970793,5.0,3.0,Her material is super straightforward. I'm gonna be honest I only read her PowerPoints to prepare for her exams and I got good scores the only reason I got a B was because I slacked off at the end. BUT! She's super easy if you just pay attention to the lectures and DO THE HOMEWORK. Overall she's a pretty great professor.
53,970793,4.0,2.0,"I think Dr. Cheng could be a challenging professor, but her materials are pretty straightforward. If you understand her lecture materials, as well as, do plenty of practice questions from mastering homework and utilize the textbook, I think passing the class will be a breeze."
54,970793,3.0,2.0,"She is very understanding and fair. If you dont put in the effort of study time, then you will not pass"
55,970793,5.0,4.0,"I took this professor for bio5, and she is more of a better professor in micro. Tbh, most of the criteria is based on powerpoints/ teaching yourself to understand and its either you know it, or you don't. Very good professor compared to other bio professors at the mount."
56,970793,1.0,4.0,Hard at grading. Have to turn in work on time. Do not give second chances. Need to pay lots of attention to the lectures and lots of reviewing on quizzes and exams. She is not a very easy teacher.
57,970793,1.0,5.0,Can't understand her. Your best friend would be the textbook
58,970793,3.0,1.0,She is a good teaching but sometimes/most of the times i cant understand her.
59,970793,4.0,1.0,"Easy A class. If you show up and pay attention to her slides, you won't have a problem passing. I didn't get an A because I simply did not try. I rarely paid attention to the lectures and crammed everything last minute. I know I could have gotten an A. You have to try in order to fail her class."
60,970793,4.5,3.0,Professor. Cheng has great Power Point slides for her lectures. The slides are an easy study guide for quizzes and exams. If you study and take the class seriously you will get an A+
61,970793,3.0,3.0,"If you dont go to the lectures, you wont know what she's going to cover on her quizzes/test. But if you read on your own you can pass without going to class. Plus she doesnt take roll!"
62,970793,4.0,1.0,"quizzes and exams were easy..you just have to memorize a lot of groups terms, etc."
63,1984551,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Goes step by step. Dont be afraid to ask questions. Her YouTube videos help (students know which ones were talking about). Totally of topic, but an instructor outside of MSMU had a picture of her on one of the PowerPoints being lectured."
64,1984551,5.0,3.0,Professor Higgins is extremely clear about every topic that she covers. The book is not needed to pass the class. There are exams almost every week but three are dropped so there is some room for mistakes. She is always available and tries her very best to help her students as much as she can. I suck at match but I managed to pass with an A-.
65,1984551,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher. she's straightforward and makes science interesting and relatable. She offers lots of resources like her youtube channel, dropbox which has answer keys of previous quizzes and tests, and office hours where you can ask her personally for help. tough class bc I had no background in chem or physics but she made it easy to understand."
66,1984551,4.0,2.0,"Attend lectures and office hours and you will be fine! She teaches step by step and also had youtube videos to help you understand her lectures. At first she is kind of boring, but as she gets used to her crowd shes hilarious."
67,1984551,5.0,3.0,"Tough only if you simply do not try. GO to her office hours; a big help when you're struggling! Will be difficult if you have no high school background on chem,physics, and math, which is why people drop.  No need of text book for her class at all, everything is based on problems from lecture. No hw, only matters exam grades. Overall good professor"
68,1984551,5.0,3.0,She is pretty tough however i Learned a lot from her lecture. You can basically show up to any of her class times but just put your time in your paper for the in class quiz. Overall as a pre-nursing she  is very good with her lecture and if you don't get the concept just show up to her other classes. I got an A and I am not good in math.
69,1984551,4.0,3.0,"Cool teacher! She's funny,takes lecture very seriously and she goes fast,doesn't waste any time she literally takes the whole class period to write on the board(uses every corner of the board) Gives in class quizzes to practice after lecture,super organized but makes things more complicated than what they really are sometimes"
70,1984551,2.0,3.0,"Let me just start off by saying this This class is part of a requirement for nursing students. The class is difficult if you do not have a strong background on math+ science & chemistry. Many classmates did not pass and gave up bc there was no hope in raising their grade up to a C-, also no extra credit.  4 exams , must pass 3 out of 4 & no quizes"
71,1984551,4.5,4.0,"Very challenging teacher, but this is what college is all about! Absolutely felt that this class was very engaging yet very helpful for what my major is. Would definitely recommend her even though she's tough its studying and reviewing that will help, because she offers so much help for one to understand the material before any exam."
72,1984551,3.5,4.0,"Lectures are an hour and a half but it goes by fast because you are so engaged in the lecture. You have to take notes on everything she goes over and you have to pay attention. The material can get tough and the tests can get challenging but seriously, if you study hard before tests and pay attention in class you'll be fine. I ended with an A :)"
73,1984551,1.5,5.0,Doesn't  explain things well at all. Doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Rushes through material. I do not recommend taking her class. It was challenging just to get a C.
74,970795,4.0,4.0,She is very straight forward about the material and teaches it in a way that you can understand. Incredibly understanding that were students and that its a lot of information thrown at once and is willing to work it out with you.
75,970795,5.0,3.0,"I love Dr. Chotiner, she is so engaged in her lectures. I was always eager to attend her class."
76,970795,5.0,3.0,"This teacher is awesome! Neuro and Med Physio... This teacher expects you to know and explain the material in the exams. Her exams tend to be all free response and the questions are more difficult compared to any other bio professors at MSMC. She is comfortable with Q's during class, but if you have too many, ask her during office hours."
77,970795,5.0,3.0,She makes the material very easy to understand. If you don't understand something ASK she is an amazing professor and she will do her best to help you clarify. Best bio professor ever!!!
78,970795,4.5,2.0,"She is one of the best professors at MSMC. Not only is she the department chair but she is also a very awesome professor. Hard to get a hold of so if you need to talk to her, you'll have to look for her but other than that read the book, her slides and ask questions if you don't get it.She tends to go fast sometimes so if you don't get it, ASK her."
79,970795,4.5,4.0,Hard material. She's so helpful! If you ask for it!! Really is a good professor and wants to help everyone. Funny and knows what she's teaching.
80,970795,3.0,4.0,"She's truly a great person. The questions on her tests and quizes make you think! talk to her, let her get to know you.. make sure she knows your name!! I didn't even own the book, and I received a B+ in her class, but i made sure i knew the info and her lectures!"
81,970795,4.0,2.0,"I really liked this class. Dr. Chotiner gives numerous quizzes throughout the semster and several Exams. For some, her test material was hard because they didnt study. If you study..and I suggest reading the bio book by yourself you will get a good grade. Her questions aren't straightforward..you have to think a little. If you like a bit of a chall"
82,970795,4.0,4.0,Her lectures are easy to comprehend and she has a passion teaching students. She really does make you think though. Her tests are filled with critical thinking and this is the hardest part of the class. She uses information from both her lectures and the book.
83,2324521,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Varay will have a long-lasting effect on your education. I highly encourage students to ask questions. At first, I was intimidated by the material in PSY 106 &amp; L, but Dr. Varay's approach to teaching made statistics seem enjoyable. Dr. Varay taught me how to collect, sort, and interpret data. AND the biggest perk of was teaching me how to use SPSS. I appreciate how available she was to talk about her experiences and best practices. I highly recommend her class, just know she expects her students to work hard."
84,2324521,5.0,3.0,Hybrid class. We met once a week. On days we met she lectured then the day we didnt meet wed have an easy discussion online about the topic she had lectured on. Every 2 weeks wed have online quizzes which had NOTHING to do with what she lectured on so no need to pay attention during lectures. Must read the book to do quizzes.
85,2324521,5.0,3.0,Prof Varay is such a sweet and caring professor. She is SO PASSIONATE about what she teaches and you can really see how much she loves being a psychologist during her lectures. She is so inspirational! I took her abnormal class and it did not stress me out at all. It was easy! I def recommend you take her!!
86,1599535,4.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Tang during the pandemic, and her workload is insane. She gives a lot of pages to read, and she provides the textbook online. However, the work is doable but do her homework with time because it's a lot. Study for her quizzes and read!"
87,1599535,4.0,4.0,"Professor Tang is very nice &amp; straightforward. The workload is a lot, but definitely doable. Start your reading &amp; homework the day before it's due to give yourself some time. She's a tough grader, but she'll tell you why she marked you off. She gives you opportunities to earn full credit on perusalls even after it's due &amp; gives extra credit!"
88,1599535,2.0,5.0,So much time was consumed into this class. Do not take if you dont have free time.
89,1599535,3.0,3.0,Really study for her quizzes and exams.
90,1599535,3.5,4.0,"Professor Tang gives a lot of work but is also very helpful. Intro to Psychology was boring but Child Dev was better. She gives parter quizzes and her final is not cumulative. I survived her class and got an A both semester. As long as you do your work, you'll be fine. Never hesitate to ask her for help!"
91,1599535,1.0,5.0,"By far the worst professor I have ever had at the Mount. Wishy-washy, confusing, unclear. Will deduct points from you left and right. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS"
92,1599535,1.0,5.0,VERY confusing professor her office hours interfered with my schedule.
93,1599535,1.0,4.0,"Very Confusing professor, she gave me mixed signals"
94,1599535,4.0,2.0,"She is a really tough grader, but she truly cares and wants you to learn the material. She is really nice and pretty funny!"
95,1599535,4.5,5.0,"She is an amazing teacher. Prior to taking her class, I was discouraged by the reviews but was pleasantly surprised. She is very passionate about psychology and will help you if you seek her help. Her class is very difficult but if you read the book and study your notes, you should be fine. Her class was surprisingly interesting and fun."
96,1599535,2.5,4.0,"Julia is a very knowledgeable professor about research and has a great passion for it. I learned a lot from her. However, her directions were unclear and when I asked for help it always seemed to make things worse. I would recommend using her TA and going to her office hours. Quizzes and exams are open book and open note. Study hard!Trust me!"
97,1599535,1.5,4.0,I was forced to tak her class to begin with and I just disliked her from te first day. She treats you like your still in high school and she grades really unfair. I got B because she deducted points for every little reason and you cant reall approach her because no matter what you say she is right and you are wrong. avoid her classes!!!!
98,1599535,2.0,5.0,Do NOT take her. She is somewhat hard to follow and does not give accurate study guides. She lectures all the time and can be a bit awkward.
99,1599535,3.5,3.0,She does assign quite a bit of work. She gives a lot of group time. Has powerpoint prepared for lecture. Her tests are pretty easy as long as you read and pay attention in class!
100,1599535,4.0,3.0,"do the readings. takes awhile to get used to how she teaches. if you're having trouble, ask to make an appointment and she'll help you. she also teaches child development too"
101,1935408,5.0,2.0,One word: AMAZING!!!
102,1935408,5.0,5.0,I actually have heard wonderful stories of the professors teaching style and waited to take Child Abuse and Family Violence with her. Now I see why everyone brags about her courses. The environment is very relaxed and in a way free.
103,1935408,5.0,4.0,I love Dr Harris' teaching style. It's very laid back but I learn so much. I'm so glad she continues to teach at this school because she gives us a place to learn about ourselves without feeling judged or shut down.
104,1935408,5.0,3.0,Dr. Harris is by far my favorite professor since I started coming to the school this semester. She makes everyone feel safe and accepted. It doesn't matter if you're different. She just doesn't judge and teaches you to care about yourself and find your voice.
105,1935408,5.0,2.0,Dr Harris was great!  Her reflections are meaningful and quizzes and exams are easy if you look over the reviews for that quiz or exam.
106,1935408,5.0,4.0,Dr. Harris is so into the material and what she's teaching that it makes me interested in it too. I like how I'm not bored in class.
107,1935408,5.0,2.0,Take her class on drugs and alcohol. It will change your life. She has you write journals and really makes you look at yourself and life.  
108,1935408,5.0,3.0,Best Professor Ever!! Take a class with her if you get the chance. 
109,1935408,5.0,1.0,SHES AMAZING. 
110,1935408,5.0,2.0,So sweet & helpful. And is always wiling to help in any way that she can. I did not think that I would enjoy psychology BUT she made it very relatable and fun. 
111,1935408,3.0,1.0,"Easy professor easy A. You take quizzes every week, but those are used for attendance. If you studymemorize the quizzes you should be good for the final & midterm. Only downfall is that she does not have control of the class & students do as they please. People would be on their cellphones during lectures & she would not say anything. "
112,1935408,5.0,1.0,"Awesome professor, her lectures are so cool and fun.  If you can take a joke and want to have fun learning about psychology you should take her. The midterm and final are both based on all the quizzes and the final is NOT cumulative. The research paper is pretty easy just don't procrastinate. Try to find the digital version of the book if you can. "
113,1935408,3.0,1.0,"If you want the super easy A, this is the class to be in. Just memorize  the answers for the ""quiz"" ( basically notes) and you're set to take the test. Most challenging part of the class would be waking up in the morning to attend the class.  "
114,1935408,5.0,1.0,"BEST TEACHER EVER! I love her class, I went into PSY1 thinking I was going to hate the subject but I AM LOVING IT! She makes you love psychology just as much as she does. Definitely recommend taking her class! You do need the book for reference but not always because she explains it so well."
115,1935408,5.0,1.0,"Great human being! And a great teacher as well. She's very clear in what she wants and  as long as you study your quizzes, you'll be set for the exams!  Aside: She's hilarious and really wants you to enjoy the class and not look at it as a drag! "
116,1935408,5.0,1.0,Great professor. Really gets to know her students on a personal level and is very understanding unlike most teachers. She's open to ideas and gets along easily with the class
117,1935408,5.0,1.0,"She's soooo incredible! great person and teacher. Her class is incredibly easy, she simplifies and clarifies everything and will answer all your questions. Her tests are as easy as the straightforward quizzes and she won't trick you. Her class was my fave class all sem. Never have i once dreaded going to her class in the morning, super enjoyable. "
118,1935408,5.0,1.0,"Her main exams are basically questions from her quizzes. Plus, what grade you get on quizzes doesn't affect grade in class. It's merely used for attendance."
119,970801,5.0,3.0,"I was struggling a bit in the begging because I was sure what she looking for in her essays. After a few weeks, I got the hang of things! I got A's on most of my essays, including the 10 page group research paper! Sandor is a wonderful professor and I actually enjoyed her class even though I hate English!"
120,970801,5.0,2.0,"One of the best English teachers on campus. She is very funny and her class is very engaging. The writing prompts are almost all narrative essays so they are manageable. If asked, she will look over your paper and tell you what needs to be corrected. I highly recommend her!"
121,970801,5.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed her class, I love her as a professor and person. She is great! I highly recommend her!! :)"
122,970801,5.0,1.0,Wonderful person. I didn't even like the subject but by the end of her class I did and you'll probably like it too if she's your professor. She is really helpful as well. The best english teacher i've ever had. =]
123,970801,5.0,2.0,"She is extremely helpful. The writing prompts are not difficult. As long as you try, you'll pass. She grades on your improvement."
124,970801,5.0,3.0,"I never really liked writing essays but when I took Prof. Sandor's class her approachable and kind personality really helped me become more interested in writing. Her essays are an easy write as long as you read, write well, listen in class, and attend those &quot;peer review days&quot;. Overall, she's one of the best English teachers at MSMC and I highly re"
125,970801,5.0,3.0,"She's very excited about English let me tell you that. She's very helpful and wants whats best for her students. It's alot of work, just learn to manage your time. Other than that I enjoyed her class very much. I highly recommend her!"
126,970801,5.0,3.0,She is amazing I love her style of teaching!
127,970801,4.5,4.0,"Prof Sandor is very nice and she communicates well with her students. I was very impressed that within the 2nd week of school she knew everyone's names! Attending this class should be a priority. I never missed her class and I benefitted very much from that. Do the homework, READ READ READ, work on her papers ahead of time and you will have an A!"
128,970801,4.5,1.0,just do your work and you'll be fine. She does baby the class a bit so it's pretty easy and your papers just have to be mediocre.
129,970801,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Sandor is very nice. Read all of the stories, participate in class, and write great essays and you'll get an A"
130,970801,4.0,2.0,"great teacher, make sure she gets to know you."

132,2351153,5.0,3.0,"Proffesor Tiernes is a great teacher. Her lectures are interesting. Make sure you are present in classes, or you will miss important information. She cares about her students and encourages them to do well. She is considerate about students' time and makes assignments due at the end of the week. I would take her again. "
133,2351153,5.0,2.0,Dr.Tiernes is a very good professor she cares about her students doing well. Her class is very interesting I am currently enrolled in SPAN 147: SPECIAL TOPICS IN SPANISH STUDIES. She makes the class very interesting and is willing to hear her students opinions.would take professor again
134,2351153,5.0,3.0,She really cares about students academically and personally. She's open to any questions and answers them clearly. She is so funny and a great person overall.
135,2351153,5.0,3.0,I honestly love and adore this professor. She's new at MSMU and she's great. She encourages you to participate because that's just the thing you do when learning a new language. She always prepares you for quizzes and exams and let's you know exactly how it's going to be. I took her for Spanish 1&amp;2 and got both A's. It was super enjoyable!
136,1511480,4.0,3.0,"There are four novels assigned for the class, from each novel, an essay is assigned. For the Final, it is most likely an essay.*Make sure to participate and show your effort in the class (If you are struggling: meet with him outside of class so he can tell you your weaknesses and allow him to view your essay, days before you turn it in."
137,1511480,4.0,3.0,"Very nice professor. ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION COUNT! Grades hard, but fair. A LOT OF WORK. you read 4 novels, and write a paper for each one. FINAL is a paper comparing all 4 novels."
138,1773626,4.0,2.0,"Professor Allevato is very nice and very helpful. The material learned in class is not hard at all, although if you ever needed help, he would gladly explain. Definitely an easy A if you try and actually study for tests."
139,1773626,2.5,1.0,"Even though, Allevato is a nice and easy professor, he isn't  ""math"" teaching material. Unfortunetly, I didn't learn anything in his class . And in the last 2 weeks of the semester he decides to give us ""real"" math work?! If you want to learn math avoid taking him. If u want to get an A take him."
140,1853499,3.0,4.0,"Since it is a hybrid class, you'll meet on Mondays and Wednesdays for an hour each and have an assignment due on Friday. The assignments are alright, you'll have to actually try in them. When essays are due, she makes a due date for drafts and then meets up with you at the cafe to comment on how to make it better, and then the next week it is due."
141,1853499,2.0,4.0,Lange is very specific on what she wants for an essay. Would not recommend.
142,1853499,3.0,4.0,"Professor Lange is really nice and she really cares about her students, but she gives a LOT of work and is a TOUGH grader. If I didn't major in Nursing, I would be fine in her class, but I do. I just think the amount of essays she gave were unnecessary since it's just a GE. On the other hand, she really does train you to be an excellent writer."
143,1853499,1.0,3.0,"Listen, I'd rather cut off one of my toes than take Lange's English class again. I've never had teacher as rude or pretentious as she is. The Friday assignments can be confusing so read them early. Most lectures are spent just summarizing text that she assigned for that day. She treats lecture like we're all dumb but then expects amazing essays."
144,1853499,4.0,3.0,"If you want an actual review for Lange then ask people whos work ethic is similar to yours. Anyways, Prof. Lange was such a chill professor. Yeah you have to read and write a lot but that's what an English class is. And honestly, who has a degree from an IVY League school? Not u. Always do the homework because they will help your grade stay afloat!"
145,1853499,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lange is an amazing professor as well as an amazing human being.  She honestly helps you on yours essays as much as she can, the rest is up to you. I've never received anything less than a B+ on any of my essays. I'd recommend her, she's great all around."
146,1853499,2.0,4.0,"When it comes to English I don't think I have ever had a teacher who is never content with any essays. She always says how there is something wrong with the essay and how it needs to be re-written because it doesn't make sense. She says that she will help you, but when you go looking for her advice she doesn't give it at all. Will not take again."
147,1853499,4.0,2.0,Professor Lange is great. I had her for both my English courses and I had no difficulty. Her lectures were  entertaining and very easy to participate in. I never received lower than a B on an essay. She is always willing to help on essay's. There is a good amount of reading but not too difficulty.
148,1853499,2.0,3.0,At first she was an amazing teacher but as the semester progressed her assignments became more confusing than the one before. I would ask for her clarification on essays and she would say to re-read the prompt until I got it. I wasn't able to do her last two essays and because of that failed her class.
149,1853499,2.5,4.0,"I would not take her again.  Professor Lange is not clear, and she is not helpful when it comes to notes on a paper.  When she comments that you need to change something in your paper (and you do), she will comment that you need to change  everything else that was already there.  I would not take her again."
150,1853499,4.5,4.0,"She is a very sweet, funny, relatable professor who genuinely cares for her students. But she gradually became to be the toughest grader I've ever encountered in my whole educational career. The readings are enjoyable. The essays are challenging, but the class is sure to improve your writing style if you are willing to work hard for it. "
151,1853499,2.5,4.0,"For those who are nursing majors, DON'T take this class unless you would rather be stressing about English than your most important science classes.  She is nice to your face but is a tough grader. If your essays aren't the way she wants it, you'll get a bad grade. For a class that's suppose to be English 1, she makes it as if English is your major"
152,1853499,4.0,2.0,AMAZING CLASS! I HAD THE  PLEASURE OF HAVING HER FOR BOTH ENGLISH 1A & 1B AND SHE MADE MY ENGLISH CLASSES VERY INTERESTING AND FUN. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK HER FOR HELP SHE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND IS HELPFUL. GREAT PERSON WHO NOT ONLY LOVES HER JOB BUT HER STUDENTS.
153,1853499,5.0,3.0,Professor Lange is one of the most caring professors I have encountered! When you are not clear with an assignment she asks and makes sure you understand the prompt. She revises your essays and personally explains to each individual what we need to work on. We also get a chance to re-write essays if we want to receive a better grade. She's awesome!
154,1853499,4.5,2.0,"I absolutely loved this class ! She would be so engaged in what we would read in class. Although there was always an essay and sometimes it wasn’t so clear what she expected us to write, she was always available to give great feedback. She was awesome and its sad that she won’t be teaching 1B next semester."
155,1853499,4.5,3.0,I had a great experience with Professor Lange.  Yes some prompts are a little vague but she's always willing to clarify them if asked and whenever i needed suggestions she gave great ones. Definitely suggest taking her. Plus the reading materials are interesting!
156,1853499,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lange is an amazing professor. She's always there to help and clarify anything that was not understood. The readings were very inserting and fun to write about. She is super nice and understanding. Some may say she is a harsh grader, but I became a better writer because of her. I highly recommend taking her class. It's worth it!"
157,1853499,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lange is very sweet and very helpful. If you don't understand the assignment or you don't know how to exactly start your paper she will go out of her way to help you and give you great ideas. She will even find great sources if you need it. You're expected to have great writing skills, I didn't get anything less than an 86% on essay."
158,1853499,4.0,3.0,"Ok, Professor Lange is not easy. But the best professors are not suppose to be easy.She knows what she wants and if you actually LISTEN when she gives suggestions you WILL improve. I should know because I started off with getting 80% on my essays and ended with 98%.  The advice she gives is very helpful and will get you the grade you want!"
159,1853499,4.0,3.0,"Ok, Professor Lange is not easy. But the best professors are not suppose to be easy.She knows what she wants and if you actually LISTEN when she gives suggestions you WILL improve. I should know because I started off with getting 80% on my essays and ended with 98%.  The advice she gives is very helpful and will get you the grade you want!Take her!"
160,1853499,1.0,4.0,VERY VERY PICKY. She expects us to have the same exact writing style as she does. Do not be fooled by her so-called kindness. She won't be so kind once you get your overall grade.
161,1853499,3.0,5.0,"Grades essays WAY too harshly, and they make up the majority of your grade. She grades classwork toughly too, even though the rubric states classwork would be checked just for completion. The frustration and stress I felt this semester is not worth it for a freshman English class. Take any other teacher!!"
162,1853499,1.0,5.0,"She was very picky with the essays. She would tell us to improve our essays by doing one thing, but it seems that nothing we did was good enough for her. She was very unclear about the things she wanted, and even the classwork were graded harshly. Her grading is also inaccurate on Angel. Our grades are based on points rather than percentages."
163,1853499,2.0,3.0,"For an English 1A class she made it difficult to get an A. On assignments she's vague and will go back on her words, if you ask her for help she will say one thing and then grade you down for it later as she changed her mind. Most essays you revise you will get the same grade on your final essay as your first. It's ridiculous."
164,503878,4.0,1.0,"She's a great person and teacher, She is very clear and keeps you interested using examples and experience. Also gives you  some life advice which isn't to bad either"
165,503878,4.5,1.0,"Pam is such a nice lady. Her class is extremely easy, and there is no reason not to receive an A. She helps you during tests. All you have to say is that you don't understand the question, and she practically gives you the answer. Don't buy the textbook because she doesn't use it. Definitely take her!"
166,503878,5.0,1.0,"Print out the slides and write down what she says in class, especially the stories that she says because those usually appear on the exams. Be careful with the online tests because there are only four and you do not want your grade to drop because of them. really read the questions and look at your notes. Her class is really boring btw"
167,503878,5.0,1.0,everything you need to know for exams are based off of her lecture so it's sort of a rip off to buy the textbook. all her exams are online as well
168,503878,5.0,1.0,"Her class is very fun and interesting. She will give examples of each concept with personal experiences. If you show up to all the classes and read the slides, there is no reason why you should lower than a B on her exams. If needed, you CAN TAKE THE EXAM WITH HER. I highly recommend her!"
169,503878,4.5,4.0,She is very clear in her teaching. Like how she also connects it to her personal life. Interesting class for certain lessons. But overall you will enjoy her! :D
170,503878,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Gist is a good instructor and she knows her stuff. Her course isn't too intense because it is interesting. She wants you to succeed in the class, so she is helpful. As long as you study your class notes for exams and put effort and interest into the final project you will do well!"
171,503878,5.0,1.0,"She is an awesome teacher! You'll enjoy her :) Her personal stories are very funny and you can apply your knowledge to your own personal experiences, making it easier to learn :)"
172,503878,4.5,2.0,"She is a very nice teacher and is really into her teaching, but she is unfair in certain situations. She needs to lighten up!"

175,503878,3.0,3.0,talks to much about herself
176,503878,2.0,2.0,All I can say is... flake. Too many personal stories - I don't want to know more about your husband!! Seems to lack self-confidence - kinda need it to be a college prof.
177,503878,5.0,1.0,"I've taken an intro to psych class before, and Prof Gist teaches in a visual manner so that everyone can easily understand all the psych/sci jargon. less text-style, more lecture and online assignments, fun projects, and totally supportive if you ever need any help. great teacher!"
178,503878,3.0,2.0,She's really easy and all of the notes are posted online.  The tests are pretty easy if you do the homework.
179,503878,4.0,2.0,"go to class, do homework, review for tests and its easy. she posts everything online so u can just print out the notes."
180,503878,5.0,3.0,"She's a wonderful teacher. Her teaching skills are understandble and clear. She will get together with you to make sure you will do well in class. She is very down to earth and easy to approach. Her exams can be a lil tricky if you don't study, but she'll help you out. I recommend her. She's great!"
181,710730,5.0,2.0,Only had him for lab so was really easy. He is also easy on the eyes ;p
182,710730,2.0,4.0,He's lectures are cool but when its time to take a test nothing from the lectures are on the test.
183,710730,4.5,3.0,He is a great teacher. He definitely wants to help his students and gives plenty of opportunity for this. It's important to read the lab before class and to understand everything. Always willing to answer questions. HE'S SUPER HOT TOO!
184,710730,4.0,4.0,He is a great professor I suggest you record lectures because thats what test are about. If u pay attention in class and turn in the reports way ahead of time its an easy A. Very cool professor.
185,710730,5.0,4.0,He's tough but fair with grades. Very understanding. Takes the time to explain things well.
186,710730,4.0,3.0,"If you're good with memorizing powerpoint slides, then this is the class for you. If you have a hard time memorizing things, I suggest you don't cram for his exams because they can be very hard. By the way, He's a HOT Greek guy too!"
187,557141,5.0,1.0,Amazing Teacher. She will make you work but it's not tedious or boring. She makes everything interesting and lighthearted. She is very down to earth and relatable. She does surprises quizzes and reaction papers but one of the best classes and professors I have had so far. Take her if you have the chance!
188,557141,5.0,1.0,if u hate math trust me Robin will make you learn to cope with it!!!! i HATED math before taking this class and walked out loving it...she's really helpful and won't move on until u get it...
189,557141,5.0,3.0,She is the best advisor ever!!! i love her!!!
190,557141,5.0,2.0,She is awesome!!!! will try different ways of explaining things until she is sure that you've got it. I wish there were more professors like her!!!
191,557141,4.5,3.0,Robin's Awesome!
192,557141,5.0,2.0,"Very helpful, funny, in task and willing to miss a heck of alot for the fellow student."
193,557141,5.0,2.0,Really cool teacher. Very helpful and easy. She makes the class very fun and interesting. And she's always willing to help for any doubt you have.
194,2144351,2.0,1.0,"Dr. Thulsiraj is a nice person and cares for her students, but as a professor, she is lacking. She is late to class all the time, does not grade labs until grades are due at the end of the semester, expects you to know how to perform all the labs w/o her instruction, makes you feel dumb when you ask her questions, and snaps at the class sometimes."
195,2144351,4.0,3.0,"Read the labs beforehand so yo don't fall behind during class!  Other than that, she is always willing to help when needed."
196,2144351,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Thulsiraj is an amazing professor and is extremely helpful!! Never be afraid to ask for help, she will be so happy to help you, of course after you try first. She knows her stuff inside and out & always explains things in depth. Really fun and it was a great experience. Took her for another class as well & I would continue to do so if I could!"
197,628832,2.5,2.0,"Becky is the nicest person I have met. she is always happy she is always smiling. you can ask her anything. of course, her lectures are a little off because she talks a lot about non-relevant stuff but the subject is not difficult. I only read one chapter from the book because her notes is the only thing she uses for the test. and common sense!"
198,628832,4.5,2.0,"Becky was a fun teacher.  I read the comments posted and you get out of a class what you put in!  If you are there to learn, you are going to learn and be an active participant in your learning. Becky's teaching style, while sometimes eccentric, it was helpful. The use of real stories to demonstrate her point was great. I would recommend her class."
199,628832,3.0,2.0,Becky seems like a nice person. I too have seen her passive-aggressive ways!  Don't ask her too many questions while she is lecturing - she does not like to be interrupted.  Her tests are okay - some of the questions have better answers to them.  A lot of group work in the class and the final was open book/notes.
200,628832,5.0,3.0,"Becky is a great teacher! She made my first semester of nursing a great experience. She is very approachable and always willing to answer any questions you may have. Make sure though that you don't interrupt her during class, she doesnt like that. She loves telling stories along with her lectures which makes them so interesting."
201,628832,2.5,2.0,"Did you notice her passive-agressive nature&#63;  If you have to ask her more than once, I've seen her subtly ream a student.  I've seen her blow up at things that she took personally, but had nothing against her (this I can prove).  Don't get on her bad side, for she wields power in the school-in-a-vacuum that has no checks & balances.  She's a puppet"
202,628832,4.0,2.0,"Becky is really a likeable person. She reminds you of a very competent, intelligent teacher with a charming personality. She has great manners and treats you like a friend. Her quizzes are pretty standard. I'd recommend her class."
203,628832,5.0,3.0,Becky is such a great lady! She truly cares about her students and the nursing program.  She is great teacher too. she expects a lot of her students but is always willing to explain and put in extra effort to help her students. You can tell she loves nursing and teaching. sweet person.
204,628832,4.5,4.0,"Introduced nursing style tests, critical thinking was difficult for a beginning level course.We had a regular final, not take home."
205,628832,4.0,2.0,"Becky taught our first Nursing class (The Roy Model), while I'm still not really sure what we learned, Becky was a fair and friendly instructor.  I think we would have learned more if we were able to use an older version of the Roy book since the current one is not meant for new nurses. The final was easy (take home)."
206,2472035,5.0,3.0,She is a great teacher. Very professional online and in person. She provides good feedback on assignments and encourages participation. I have taken this class as well as her graphic novels class and she was a joy both times. Highly reccomend for english classes.
207,2472035,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Roberson was a pleasure to meet. Her class was very intriguing and prompted me to think of writing in a different way. Reading the articles she gave, having discussions, and challenging my own writing has allowed me to grow as a writer. I learned a lot about the power of words. Also gave a really unique outlook in combining creativity with it."
208,2472035,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Roberson is a new professor and she is wonderful! She has a very mellow, caring, and approachable personality. She is very patient and always encourages different view points during lectures. She does assign lots of reading but you will be okay in class if you just do most of the reading because there are no quizzes, just discussions."
209,825450,5.0,2.0,"Prof Dixon is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He cares that you understand. He made algebra so easy!! If you've been out of the loop with math, take his class. He breaks every formula down. I haven't taken math in 12 years! I got an A =)"
210,825450,5.0,1.0,Prof. Dixon has a way of taking all the stress out of getting back into a math class after many years away from school. His patience with students amazes me and it is obvious that he really wants his students to succeed. I will definitely take a class from him in the future and I highly recommend him for math 2X.
211,825450,5.0,1.0,"Art cares about his students, and is an awesome teacher.  He understands that students in his class are obviously not math braniacs.  He taylors the class to learning math essentials and not rediculous and unnecessary mathematical jargon."
212,825450,5.0,1.0,"I love his classes, he is laidback and very helpful. His lectures are never boring"
213,825450,5.0,1.0,"Physical Science is a breeze with Prof. Dixon. Very helpful and engaging lectures.  If you have to take a Phys Sci class, take it with him. You will not regret it.  Fun class, fun teacher -plus he's nice too."
214,1845376,1.0,5.0,"Professor Filla was extremely difficult to comprehend and it didn't feel like she was passionate about the subject she was teaching. As a woman, it is hard to see another woman not care about her students. Do not take her. I have always been a good student but this class was impossible. "
215,1845376,4.0,3.0,I enjoyed this class very much. The lectures were informative and the topics were very debatable and argumentative. The grading policy was very fair and understandable and everything on the exams was taught in class or given to us on Canvas. I highly recommend this class to those interested in politics and government.
216,1845376,5.0,3.0,"she's really kind! but can come off intimidating, would recommend doing well in her class esp if youre an HCP major, it pays off and she does take notice. exams are all written, based on class lecture so pay attention/take notes/participate. Ask questions in class!"
217,1845376,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Filla was an okay professor and she was interested in teaching the American Government class, especially as it was during a presidential election year. Expect her to have a bit of attitude when the class is overwhelmingly confused over Zoom, and make sure that you study the textbook well, as she grades mostly on all-written exams."
218,1845376,4.0,4.0,"I know that many people don't like Dr. Filla because she is hard. But I've taken her multiple times, she is not that bad once you get used to her style. She is really lecture heavy so don't miss class. You just have to make sure you study and go to office hours. Have her review your papers beforehand."
219,1845376,2.0,3.0,"The way she sets up these upper division classes, generally speaking is about 1 written midterm, 1 (10-12 pages) paper, and a written final. That's all ! It works for some, but it didn't work for me."
220,1845376,1.0,5.0,Her lectures are not helpful and forget her remembering your name. Show up to class once in a while so she keeps the lectures online. When you need to find out something about the class ask a classmate and not her. One she does not reply to emails and two if people ask her the question multiple times she gets upset and grade based off of emotion.
221,1845376,2.0,3.0,Expects you to put her class as a priority despite other classes and work.
222,1845376,4.0,2.0,Dr. Filla is very clear and very organized. She prepares her students very well for her exams. If you pay attentions to her lectures in class then you will do well. She is very smart and gives a workload that is reasonable. When I've emailed her she emails right back. I highly recommend and plan on taking her women in politics next semester.
223,1845376,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Filla, is a great professor who is very passionate about her work, women, women in politics, and anything she talks about. Her lessons are slides from the textbook that hit main points, which are a good guide line. If you read the work, and most importantly pay attention you will be good to go. Engage in the conversation! Awesome professor!  "
224,1845376,1.0,5.0,"She's rambles too much and her lectures have nothing to do with the exams. People in this class either pass with a B or fail D of F. There is no in between. Personally this class was a waste of money and time. She is not a good professor, take someone else. I had all A's in my other classes and this class ruined my GPA because of the professor."
225,1845376,3.5,3.0,"Class was a lot of work, but it wasn't hard material. She lectures you on what is going to be on the exams (provides study guide). Group project was the challenging part, but if you get a good group you'll be fine. Whenever you need help just go to her office hours, she's always there if you ask."
226,1845376,3.5,2.0,"She is very nice and tells jokes. Her lectures and power points are not the only thing that is on her exams so you need to read the book to pass. Her office hours really help, she does whatever she can to help you pass."
227,2353298,5.0,4.0,Very accessible in and out of class - very understanding and is willing to make accommodations. The workload is heavy but that's just the course. Tends to have a light attitude in class while still remaining respectable. communicates his material very clearly and is very open to any kinds of question so don't worry about asking stupid things.
228,2353298,4.0,4.0,"The experience was he was pretty nice! Taking supplemental really helps, would recommend if avail. Talk to him if you don't understand and take time to study. Important to know basic math + sci but can totally manageable. NOT A CLASS TO TAKE VIRTUALLY, take in person if you can. beware of pop quizzes."
229,2353298,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Lee's class is challenging material-wise(chem is in general),but if you ask questions and go to office hours,you will succeed. He does go through the lectures at a faster pace,but that is because you are expected to have already read the chapter/looked at the PowerPoint slides before class. Go to supplemental or get a tutor for extra support."
230,2353298,1.0,4.0,"Worst CHEM professor. Sadly, Dr. Lee does not care about teaching or helping students to grasp material, even students who try hard, care, and come to office hours and want to learn. Why is he still at the Mount? Does the Mount evaluate their professors and do anything about it? Clearly not in case."
231,2353298,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lee expects you to study and practice on your own time. If you fall behind at the beginning, there is no chance to catch up so if you know you struggle with word problems and algebra, get a tutor before the second week of classes regardless of your grade. Dr. Lee does tend to dance around questions so be as direct as possible with him."
232,2353298,1.0,4.0,He is the worst chemistry professor at the mount he moves way too fast when we had the fire he still gave out exams/test &amp; skipped chapters telling us that it our problem not his when I went to office hours he laughed me at when when I took him I did not understand anything in lecture &amp; told me that he cannot help me bc I am not putting in the work
233,2353298,1.0,4.0,He doesnt explain well (too fast) and brushes you off when you have questions or need help.
234,2353298,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Lee offered little in the way of help for those that needed it. Teaching is more than lecturing, assigning homework and giving tests. It is ensuring students learn. I would not take this prof again."
235,2353298,4.0,4.0,"He is really nice and is helpful, just do all the practice questions he gives you from the slides for each chapter before a quiz and you can probably get an A or B, study before class if you can so you can understand what he's talking about, and do all the homework he gives on time, study more if you know ur not good at chem/math"
236,2353298,1.0,4.0,No comment
237,2353298,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lee is a kind professor who wants his students to succeed. If you are a gen chem student, you need to understand that STEM majors are never easy, so get used to self-teachings, but Dr. Lee is always available for help. He is also funny and smart. Take him and get to know him."
238,2353298,1.0,5.0,"Avoid taking this Prof unless you like to teach yourself. Teaches at a very fast pace, does not make much time for questions and tests/quizzes are extremely difficult compared to the examples he provides in class. Chemistry is a hard class in general, but he does not make things easier or comprehendible. You will def struggle unless ur a natural"
239,391323,5.0,2.0,"Prof Schifrin is a great professor! She does not give any exams or midterms or finals. Rather, she has you write multiple reflection like papers which in my opinion is great! This class is very centered around counseling and she does a great job at teaching us what makes a good councilor."
240,391323,4.0,1.0,"Schifrin is very dedicated to helping her students understand whatever subject she is teaching. Her classes are not difficult, but they do usually revolve around writing some short papers (1-2 pages). If you are shy, run for your life from her classes. She won't tolerate a lack of participation."
241,391323,5.0,1.0,I has Schifrin for 3 different courses and I loved her in all 3! She is an amazing human being & professor. She will make you reflect about yourself and apply what she is teaching in classes. I can honestly say she made me a better person and getting to know was the best experience I had at the Mount! Every psychology major should take her!
242,391323,4.5,1.0,One of the best professors I have had. 
243,391323,5.0,1.0,"Amazing Professor! Would definitely take her again. One of my best classes, take her you won't regret it! :)"
244,391323,5.0,2.0,"She gives you a reality check in the helping profession. Very laid back, understanding, interactive, and she is simply an amazing human being and professor!!"
245,391323,5.0,2.0,Best professor ever!!
246,391323,5.0,2.0,Best teacher ever! She really opens up your perspective. She mainly lectures but they keep you interested and involved. Quizzes are usually take home. Easy A and she's definitely worth taking the class!
247,391323,5.0,2.0,Her class was indeed a reality check. She has been a helpful professor throughout the two classes I have had so far. I will be going for a third course with her. She is a good professor and I extremely recommend her.
248,391323,4.5,2.0,I love this professor!!! She is an amzing human being and she really shows how much she loves her profession she is really helpful and easy to talk to. I had her for Intro to Counseling and I really learned a lot. She is the reason why I love psychology!!!
249,391323,4.5,1.0,"I loved her class.  If you did the readings, you will always know where you are.  Humorous and laid back, this prof is very easy to talk to and ask help from."
250,391323,2.5,2.0,"Schifrin is very unclear.  She requires a lot of participation from her class, and half the time you don't even know what she is asking."
251,2304156,5.0,3.0,An amazing teacher. Really cares about her students. Be prepared to do group projects. Quizzes and tests are diffucult but if you study hard it is very doable.
252,391325,5.0,4.0,"I liked that I didn't really use the textbook aside from clarifying something. Her tests are based on lecture, powerpoint, and Mastering hw. She seems intimidating but is very understanding and overall wants the best for each student. Highly reccomend."
253,391325,5.0,4.0,Changs exams and quizzes are based of her lecture 10000%. Her quizzes are harder than her actual midterm which really helped to prepare you. She goes kinda fast in lecture though so you gotta really be quick on taking notes.
254,391325,5.0,4.0,"So I took Chang for Anatomy and honestly she is such an amazing professor. Her lectures are interesting and she goes straight to the point. However, you HAVE to study her tests can be extremely difficult if you don't put the time to study ESPECIALLY the muscles and the nerves!"
255,391325,4.0,5.0,Dr. Chang is great! Her lectures are very interesting and goes over the content that you should/NEED to know! Her exams are tough but just review the material and make sure to understand it and you should be good! She answers questions you ask and its a great class environment to be in.
256,391325,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Chang is AMAZING. She makes lectures so fun and she never hesitates to answer questions or clarify. Her exams were hard, but for good reason. She always emphasizes how important learning everything will be for your nursing career, and she is not wrong. Such a caring and intelligent woman. Just make sure you put in the time to study!!!!"
257,391325,5.0,4.0,Truly one of the best professor at the Mount. I took Dr. Changs course for Bio 50A and 50B which were both really hard but if you need help or clarification make sure to ask. Shes a really caring professor and make sure to take good notes from lecture. Her class is definitely one of the best ones ever but make sure to always study.
258,391325,1.0,5.0,"Took PHYS01 over the Spring20, during the COVID-19 the entire class when on Canvas. However we were obligated to purchase a camera because we are being Proctored by the tutors and professor Chang. It was weird, becuase there was ppl looking at you, and ur screen was all being recored. you were not able to open up tabs! 160 questions for 70 minutes!"
259,391325,5.0,5.0,"BEWARE of her 200 question multiple choice exams!!!! One of the toughest professors at the MSMU. But you have to put time and effort to study 7 hours everyday to memorize each chapter. Her lectures are fast but you'll learn so much. Shes really funny at times, get in her good side because she offers extra credit at the end of the semester."
260,391325,5.0,5.0,"One of the best Anatomy / Physiology professors at the Mount. Well if your trying to get into the BSN program, you need this class regardless. She truly made me fall in love the material, heavy material, about five hours of studying, she will help you if you need help, ask her shes really funny. BEWARE of the tests! You have to study and work hard."
261,391325,5.0,3.0,"Chang is the best for A&amp;P. Tests are lecture-based, but there are some random questions that you would only know if you read the book. Lectures can be wishy washy, but you can email/see her during office hours for clarification. Participate to get on her good side. Tests are very doable, but they are cumulative and you still need to study hard."
262,391325,5.0,4.0,"Love Dr. Chang so much! She truly does everything in her power to help you succeed, and her lectures are so interesting. I definitely learned a lot in her class, and I will take that with me throughout the rest of my college years and into my career!"
263,391325,5.0,4.0,"She is an amazing professor! She was the first professor who made learning interesting and fun. I enjoyed taking her class for anatomy and physiology. I wish I could take her again. Please do try to get her as a professor! You will enjoy listening to every lecture of hers, but make sure to stay on top of your studying and DO NOT get behind."
264,391325,5.0,4.0,"Take good notes in class, read the book to clarify topics she discussed. Go to office hours, she is more than willing to help you. She uses case studies she talks about in class on the exam. DO NOT GET BEHIND STUDYING!! She asks questions every class (like oral quizzing) to make sure you are keeping up with the material."
265,391325,5.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Chang for Anatomy and Physiology.  Pay attention and copy everything she says VERBATIM during lecture. Trust me, it will help a lot. You'll hit the ground running, but don't expect it to get easier. Ask questions and ask for help. She's tough, but don't be intimidated. She's more than willing to see to it that you succeed.  She's great."
266,391325,4.5,4.0,Really ensures that concepts are enforced by asking each individual student a question based on the previous lectures. Office hours will be your best friend if you're struggling. Review right after each lecture to make it easier for when midterms come. The final is easy. Muscles test was the most difficult.
267,391325,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor! Kinda though when it comes to the test on muscles. Most of the tests are based on lectures, so pay close attention in class. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Make sure to be caught up on the material every time you come to class, because she asks random students questions."
268,391325,4.5,4.0,Dr. Chang is amazing. I've learned so much from her! My friends and family think I'm crazy because I use anatomy terms for everything. Her tests are difficult so study hard. She's not kidding about the 9 hour per week studying thing. Take her!
269,391325,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Chang was amazing! I couldn't have had a better physiology teacher. She goes above and beyond to teach us concepts that will help us in our career paths. By verbally quizzing the class each period, Dr. Chang ensures that the students will review their notes and readings before class. She's an inspiration. "
270,391325,1.5,4.0,Eh she's alright. Can't understand her at all. She's  a bit sassy too. Her class was boring but semi easy. You have to study at least like 3 hours for her class. Her tests were long. Its possible to get a good grade but you need to put in work
271,391325,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Chang is AMAZING. Hard but very fair and understanding. She knows what she is talking about and is passionate about what she teaches. She does not take it easy on you, she gives it her all, and as long as she see's you giving your all she will work with you. She is not easy, but trust me YOU WANT to take her! "
272,391325,5.0,2.0,Dr. Chang is such a great professor. She is very straightforward and her Anatomy class was easy to handle just don't forget to study. Midterm and Final were not as bad as I thought they were going to be. Take her! She always keeps lectures interesting because she has a passion for what she does and it shows!
273,391325,5.0,4.0,"Chang is an amazing teacher. She's very intelligent. She keeps the class interesting. Yes her tests consist 100+ questions, but they're do-able. You need to put 110% effort plus a little blood, sweat and tears. It's hard work, but it pays off in the future."
274,391325,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Chang is an amazing professor. It takes a lot of work to get an A though, but this goes for any anatomy or physiology teacher at the mount. Dr. Chang keeps the class interesting with relevant anecdotes. She makes herself available for her students but does not simply hand out the answers. She wants you to figure out the answer to learn."
275,391325,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Chang is an great professor, but you really need to work for your grade. I spent at least 3 hours/day reviewing the material in order to feel prepared for her oral quizzes and exams. Each exam usually has between 100-150 multiple choice questions and short answer responses so you really have to be on top of your stuff in order to be efficient."
276,391325,5.0,4.0,The first semester I did not read the book at all and just memorized my notes and I really struggled. However the second semester I read the book and everything was just so much clear. Do not listen to others advice and just read the book and do the questions at the end of the chapter because they are similar to the ones on the exams.
277,391325,1.0,1.0,"She's a life ruiner. Students beware! She cares more about looking smart than being an educator. Bossy and if she doesn't like you, it will be a witch hunt. Get ready to teach yourself. No ppts. No study guides."
278,391325,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Chang is a great teacher and you learn a lot in her class! She is definitely not an easy teacher, but she is just trying to make you more competent later on.I would go to her office hours and get a tutor for this class. It really helps! Overall though this class is great!Don't be intimidated and STAY on top of your work. Good luck! :)"
279,391325,5.0,5.0,This woman is amazing!! she really knows her stuff and challenges her students and expects alot but its duable justg to her lectures and study as much as possible. She really sets the bar high but you learn your stuff. I admire her for being such a hard worker. She was my favorite professor in my freshman year.
280,391325,4.5,4.0,This class was hard for me.you can't pass this class by just memorizing info.she expects you to know the concepts and how to apply them.all 3 tests were difficult. i HIGHLY recommend a tutor.
281,391325,3.0,4.0,Well honestly she is not that hard. People who dont do well in that class expect to party all night and get a good grade. Reality check people: THIS IS COLLEGE!. Honestly if you study all that she goes over (I MEAN ALL) you should be fine. Also her final included ques from lab too so be prepared (she didn't tell us that tho). I got and A.
282,391325,1.0,5.0,"ONE OF THE WORST PROFESSORS I HAVE EVER HAD BY FAR.  ABSOLUTELY IN THE PROFESSION TO SHOW THE STUDENTS HOW SMART SHE IS, NOT TEACH.  DON'T BOTHER STUDYING UNLESS IT IS IN NEUROSCIENTIST GRADE AND NOTHING LESS.  STANDARDIZED QUESTIONS THAT AREN'T IN THE LECTURES AT ALL, NO POWERPOINTS, AND DISORGANIZED.  I CHOSE ANOTHER PROFESSION BECAUSE OF HER."
283,391325,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor. Challenging class. STUDY ALL THE TIME if you want to pass this class. Attendance is MANDATORY. She WILL call you out if you have missed class. EXTREMELY HELPFUL. answers ALL questions clearly. 3 tests and 1 paper. FIRST AND LAST TESTS ARE EASY, SECOND IS DIFFICULT. Got an A. Key to passing this class: STUDY STUDY STUDY!!!"
284,391325,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Chang is one of the most helpful proffesors ive ever had. If you go to her office hours and ask her questions she will get to know you and she will know that you actually care. The book is useful but mostly her tests are right from her lectures. Her tests are very challenging but she only wants you to do good in the future. Basically, take her."
285,391325,5.0,5.0,If you are a Pre-Nursing student then I highly recommend Dr.  Chang. She is hard but she will bring out your confidence and the knowledge you thought you never had. Go to her office hours and study every day because she loves oral quizzes. Great professor and someone you should be inspired by and look up to.
286,391325,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Chang for both anatomy and physiology.  Definitely not an easy teacher, but she is so intelligent, you learn so much!  As long as you take good lecture notes and study often, then you should be ok.  If you want to learn and like a challenge, you'd enjoy her class, I know I sure did!!"
287,391325,4.0,4.0,"She has high expectations of her students. Probably one of the hardest classes my first year, but it allowed me to learn a lot and is helping me throughout the nursing program. Be sure to get on top of memorizing those bones, muscles, veins, arteries, and nerves."
288,391325,5.0,3.0,"She is a great teacher. Don't use the textbook much because her lectures cover the required material. Don't miss class or you run risk of falling behind; she moves at a fast pace. very approachable though. take her if you really want to learn. course material is moderate, but she makes it a lot easier."
289,391325,3.0,5.0,One of the most difficult classes. You realize that it's one of the most important though so you have to stick through it. WIll make you or break you if you're trying to get into the Nursing program.
290,391325,5.0,5.0,My best professor yet.
291,391325,5.0,1.0,I love Dr. Chang.  She truly is inspiration and a prime example of what hard work and a positive attitude can lead you in life.
292,391325,3.5,5.0,No Comments
293,391325,5.0,4.0,"She's awesome!! Very passionate about her work and knows her stuff!  She's willing to help and a motivator, I wouldn't of traded her for another anatomy/physio teacher.  Don't Cram though, its too much info!"
294,391325,4.5,4.0,I had Dr.Chang for two semesters and she is a great teacher. She explains things very well and makes it easy to understand. Everything is straight forward and she is always there to help. Go to her office hours and she is there. She applies things to everyday life which makes you understand better even more. Study everyday and don't get behind.
295,391325,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Chang is an amazing teacher! She makes learning fun and interesting but at the same time she teaches the importance of professionalism. She is also encouraging and helpful with her students. Tests are fair, attend her lectures, listen, & take notes. LAB with her is great too because it's strait forward and never a waste of time."
296,391325,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Chang is an amazing teacher. She is very passionate about the subject, making her lectures very interesting. She is a wonderful person and easy to talk to. If you have a question about absolutely anything, you can go to her for help. She is a great inspriation and motivator. I truly recommend he"
297,391325,5.0,4.0,"She is one of the best teachers I have ever had. It is a lot of info, so don't cram, but she covers everything in lecture, is always available for questions, and the tests are really reasonable. She makes class interesting and applies it to life."
298,391325,5.0,4.0,She is so informative and always try to help you understand the materials. She is so energized for the class. Her tests are reasonable. They are not hard (Easy to get A if you pay attention in class and do just a little bit review daily.)
299,391325,5.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Chang for two semesters and was VERY pleased each time.  Though her class often does take a lot of work on your part, she is very knowledgeable about her subject, friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful."
300,1024160,4.0,3.0,"WOW! Where do I begin! Ok... so she is very passionate about the English language which I appreciate. However, what I didn't, and completely made me dislike her was that she continually harassed the class by stating that we we're all illiterate students from LAUSD and that we suck as writers. Perhaps she's upset that her acting career was a fail"
301,1024160,1.0,5.0,She is mean and so rude! Avoid taking her!
302,1024160,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Tyszkiewicz is a great teacher! Yes, she has high expectations but she gives you the grade that you DESERVE. It's AWESOME that an English teacher cares so much about grammar, MSMC NEEDS it (it's pretty sad how people can't even read or write well here)! I have learned so much in her class and I love her enthusiasm. I hope to take her again."
303,1024160,3.0,4.0,"I took this course online. She assigned some interesting plays to read for this course. She is tough on her grading but she is helpful. There are group discussions that you must participate in every week. I would have hoped for an A- but i got a B+ and I worked hard in this class. Overall, not too bad."
304,1024160,4.5,5.0,"This teacher is difficult but she is extremely knowlegdeable! She does care about grammar and spelling and be to honest, it's a breath of fresh air to see someone who does. She is only rude if you don't read, neglect the meaning of the text, or have poor grammar skills. Otherwise you ahve no excuse! Great teacher, very passionate as well."
305,1024160,1.5,5.0,She is extremly hard and she is rude to people. I have gotten some harsh comments and she grades very harsh.
306,1024160,4.5,2.0,"Ms. Tyszkiewicz is a great guide and mentor when entering the literary world! She opens your mind and makes you think beyond the pages. She picked great works to read. 3 major essays are due in addition to weekly papers and inclass quizzes; they are merely to help write your big papers. If you love literature, TAKE HER. If you don't, you will"
307,1024160,4.5,3.0,"I have learned so much in her classes and my writing has improved drastically. The key is to attend class, participate, and do your best. If you need help do not be afraid to ask."
308,1024160,4.0,3.0,"she is OK, i have learned a lot in her class, especially grammar. she gets extremely upset when u do not know the basic grammar rules. also when u start whispering to the person next to you oh and when u do not &quot;actively read&quot; sometimes i feel like she expects us to know everything. but she is ok, u do learn a lot on how to make ur essays better."
309,1024160,1.0,5.0,Everything has to be her way she is very rude!! and class needs to start on time or else hell will break loose...also if she hears on peep out of your mouth sh'll kick you out
310,1024160,4.5,3.0,"She's amazing! Participate in clas, she loves it! Honestly, one of the best english teachers I have ever had!"
311,1024160,1.5,5.0,She is very quick-paced and will have a heart attack if class does not start at the time she wants it to start. She speaks too fast and sometimes expects students to know every single detail that she knows before she's taught  anything. Cannot understand her and gets upset when you don't. She needs to loose the clothes. VERY late-80s and early 90s.
312,1734827,4.0,3.0,"She challenged me with the material. But, in the end, I felt like I really learned a lot. Great to talk to and offered time after class!"
313,1734827,4.0,3.0,Really liked her approach: real and solid with expectations. I am not Hispanic/Latino and I learned a lot. I dont know about others but she was fair and k8bd to all.....
314,1734827,5.0,4.0,"We had a great class with Professor G. Take the class, submit your work and participate. Shes really nice and approavhable."
315,1734827,4.0,4.0,Looking forward to taking class with Dr.G again!
316,1734827,4.0,4.0,Great Prof! Enjoyed the course and I am glad that she was upfront about what was expected in class...
317,1734827,5.0,4.0,I really liked her personability. Humble and nice instructor. Would take again for sure....
318,1734827,1.0,2.0,"BIG WARNING: took her in summer and actually solicited good reviews from students for extra credit on this site. She was unable to answer many questions and drifted off topic many times and talked about Frida Kahlo and Mexican History, which should have only been part of this class. Misinterpreted questions and show-offish about her degree."
319,1734827,5.0,4.0,"I enjoyed the class discussions and, if you follow the syllabus and participate, you get the grade."
320,1734827,5.0,4.0,Would take classes with Dr. Avila again. She was helpful and also understanding with the class.
321,1734827,5.0,5.0,Class was exactly what it said it was going to be on the syllabus .
322,1734827,4.0,4.0,Good syllabus with assignments that were reasonable. I appreciated her willingness to be open to talking before or after class.
323,1734827,5.0,4.0,"I really liked Dr. Avila. She is really patient, helpful and kind. I would take her class again!"
324,1734827,1.0,5.0,OMG she is the worst professor ever!  Terrible at grading group projects even when you do it perfectly but others mess up.  Very insulting to students and brags about how important she is at the director of some hospital.  All in all this lady shouldnt be a teacher.  Avoid her at all costs as you will not learn.  Talk about personal life too much
325,1734827,4.0,2.0,"I really like taking this course and I felt like she was fair. She only asked you to do what was on the sylabus, I learned from the lecture and the class discussions were provoking."
326,1734827,2.0,2.0,"Dr Avila was real terrible and basically handed us all high grades, however, the class kind of felt like some things you would learn in grade school.  She tried to be funny but when challenged, she usually does not have answers to general questions and does not appear intellectual. When she is in a bad mood she seems to take it out on the kids!"
327,1734827,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Avila is a very knowledgeable professor who helped me get to know myself more through the assingments she gave us. Every week we had to turn in a two page paper (nothing hard), we had a group presentation, and towards the end we had a 10-12 page paper due about a different culture. So, if you do your work and show up you'll be fine. I got an A!"
328,1556652,4.0,5.0,"Dr. F will challenge every single student she encounters. If you are not ready to buckle down and make nursing your priority, you will have a difficult time adjusting to her class. She takes her recommendations seriously. She is never late and she is well known and well liked in the nursing community. It behooves you to be the best student you can."
329,1556652,1.0,5.0,"FYI she does not come up with her own tests. For 24, she does not lecture, you're basically learning on your own so start reading early. If you have clinical with her, sorry. In regards to her teaching style, I prefer a more relaxed learning environment and would choose Legaspi if I could re do my first semester."
330,1556652,4.0,4.0,"Not going to lie, the reviews terrified me before starting the program, and even moreso when I found out I had clinicals with her.  Prof F is passionate about nursing and wants nothing but the best for her students.  She went above and beyond, inside the classroom and out.  Best fundamentals teacher you could ask for!  Quality professor all the way"
331,1556652,5.0,4.0,Professor Ferrerosa is built on structure & discipline. She is also very passionate about what she offers in Nursing. She's a highly motivated individual that will leave you knowing your basic foundation in nursing inside & out. She will challenge you as new nursing student. She will make you grow in a course of 16 weeks. One step at a time.
332,1556652,4.5,5.0,Professor Ferrerosa is mama bear. She is protective of her students. She teaches you discipline & how to keep your nursing license the right way. She's a tough cookie at 1st but has the best intensions of wanting you to be successful.This is a woman who built herself from the ground up in Nursing wearing the super woman logo.
333,1556652,1.0,5.0,"I don't know why she's still a teacher. She yells at everyone and expects you to know everything. She doesn't instruct, and makes you do so much busy work. If you do something wrong, oh well, be prepared to get yelled at, you were suppose to know because you were suppose to read the everything in the textbook."
334,1556652,1.0,4.0,"Very intimidating professor, hard to learn from. She would point & scream in the middle of clinical, checked our underwear to make sure it wasn't colored in uniform & rarely answered a question without being snarky or insulting. Awful 1st clinical experience! Learned NOTHING & she made us redo careplans like 4x for stupid errors; spelling, wording."
335,1556652,1.0,5.0,"Not a great instructor nothing she talks about is ever on the tests and her power points are useless you basically need to memorize the entire book, its not shocking students aren't passing the NCLEX both Fundamentals & Med Surge are a big part of the NCLEX and she is NOT preparing the students properly for this exam.  Her tests are not relevant."
336,1556652,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Determinant is an awesome teacher, at first she seems tough but she is such a sweetheart lady when you demonstrate her that you are in the nursing program for a great reason, to make a difference in ppl's lives. Tips: focus, focus...then you will learn a good deal in her class :-)"
337,1556652,4.5,4.0,"Professor Ferrerosa truly cares about her students. Her ultimate goal is to create a nursing student with exceptional leadership skills.  Everything she does, all of the little nuances that seem overwhelming as a first semester nursing student are totally relavant to making a stand-out nurse.  While she is tough, in the end you will thank her."
338,1556652,2.0,4.0,"A very difficult person to be around and learn from. Decent instructor when you get her one-on-one for a meeting, but otherwise extremely disrespectful and not able to present the material in a productive way. Last semester she checked our underwear underneath our white uniforms! Not the type of woman you need to instruct in a nursing program."
339,1556652,4.0,4.0,Found different creative ways to present material.
340,2465972,2.0,4.0,"She will dock points if you have a typo by just the slightest on the quizzes and exams. Even if you rush and add an extra letter to your response, she will doc you for misspelling. You have to be on your toes for this class since quizzes and exams are your only way to pass since homework is about 2-3 points. Weekly packets and understand visuals"
341,882875,4.0,4.0,"Fossum is awesome, energetic and knowledgeable"

343,882875,5.0,3.0,No Comments
344,2453692,1.0,3.0,"She is also a hard grader. Even if you do the assignment perfectly as the rubric states, you will not get 100/100. I thought I was going to learn about the math part of the CSET, instead we built straw bridges and paper bridges. Seriously a big waste of time. As a person though, she is wonderful."
345,2453692,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Leggett does not follow her syllabus- beware! I am writing this review because in the final group projects, every sing group got the same grade, and 86/100. She told my group she didn't like our font. She told another group they didn't follow the criteria. How does a font equal not following the rubric? IT DOES NOT! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"
346,485568,1.0,5.0,"She's horrible. If you think research is rough, her class makes it 100 times more difficult. Do not follow her timeline -- finish things sooner. Do not take her too seriously -- she'll change her mind later. Do not take what she says personally -- you will be insulted."
347,485568,1.5,5.0,There is a method to the madness. This professor is teaching students critical thinking skills and to be responsible for your education. Do not expect her to stroke your ego because you will not be stroked in the nursing world. Not on a ego trip just helping you be the best nurse you can be by having you take responsibility for yourself!
348,485568,1.0,5.0,Some of these people leaving good comments are her pets.  She is a very hard and strict teacher.  She makes students feel inferior to her.  No patience and manners what so ever.  Warning: DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS AND REVIEW ALL QUIZES AND MIDTERMS AFTER YOUR RECIEVING YOUR RESULTS.
349,485568,3.5,2.0,"It's true that Dufau has the potential to be a good person/teacher and at Mt. St. Mary's she HAS TO BE because she's just an instructor there but she treats all other students at other school like crap! She always reminds us of her credentials, she tries to make a fool of you, and I was actually a great student. horrible example. POWER-TRIPER!!!!!!"
350,485568,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Dufau was one of best teachers I ever had. I had the pleasure to be her student for pharmacology, Med-Surg II, and Advance Med-surge practicum. She always reminded us that patients are humans not room numbers; preserving patient's dignity was her main thing. How can anyone say that this great person is evil&#63; Dr. Dufau ROCKS!!!"
351,485568,5.0,5.0,"again, to comment, and yes its true shell get in your face, but its not because &quot;shes there for the money&quot; something that someone wrote, or that she is evil and wants to belittle you.. DUDE HELLO! your BECOMING a NURSE, you have to be prepared mentally and thats what she puts you through, a mental test, and it is the best gift you can get. XJeraldX"
352,485568,5.0,5.0,"All the people leaving bad comments are haters, they either didnt have her for adv. med surg, or they saw her in a totally different way than i did, i had her for my adv ms clinicals and she honestly was the best teacher i have ever EVER had at MSMC.. its true she does make you think... i will continue this on next comment"
353,485568,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Dufau was my favorite professor in nursing school. Her lectures were intriguing, informative, and at times captivating. She definitely prepares you for the &quot;real&quot; world. It's a shame we didn't get that from more professors. Always respected her and felt she gave me the same respect. It's sad to read all the negative comments people have wrote."
354,485568,5.0,5.0,Dr. Dufau is a tough customer. She makes you accountable for your grades and your learning experience. I appreciated her ability to motivate my independence. Autonomy and Integrity is needed in the world of Nursing. My hat is off and a standing ovation to Dr. Dufau. Thank you!!!!!!!
355,485568,5.0,5.0,Dr. Dufau is a tought customer. She makes you accountable for your grades and your learning experience. I appreciated her ability to motivate my independence. Autonomy and Integrity is needed in the world of Nursing. My hat is off and a standing ovation to Dr. Dufau. Thank you!!!!!!!
356,485568,2.0,5.0,"Tori can relay the subject matter very well, but don't ask questions! All questions are stupid in her mind! Tests aren't too hard, but her final is VERY hard! She gives a study guide, but 99% of the final was not on it. Know EVERYTHING!"
357,485568,3.0,3.0,"Notice that the Nurs/Med Surg students write decent comments since Tori has to watch her step at Mt St Mary's but in other programs/classes, she gets away with ridiculous conduct. Someday the BRN will realize that they're wasting a license on evil. God will get her and many can't wait for her demise!"
358,485568,3.0,4.0,According to her she is always right.  very intimidating. She will ridicule and make you feel stupid in front of everyone if you ask a simple question. Over abuses her power. I think she really enjoys the fact that many students fear her.
359,485568,2.0,3.0,"This heffer is on a serious POWER-TRIP!  yes, she is knowledgable, but it's a shame that she's too much of a jerk to actually CARE about really helping her students learn from her experience and become better nurses.  she tries to humiliate people and sometimes succeed's - don't let her! stand-up for yourself. she's JUST a teacher."
360,485568,2.0,4.0,"She knows her stuff and makes sure to humiliate you in front of the class if you don't.  The learning environment is there, but it's hostile.  Good luck and be prepared to be stomped."
361,485568,1.5,5.0,"This lady does not hold respect for anyone. She demands respect, but she does not show it to others. I would definitely say this program was one of the worst experiences of my life. She abuses her power, uses her knowledge to feel superior, and doesn't care about the quality of education you achieve, but rather the amount of $$$ she will make!"
362,485568,4.0,4.0,"Excellent Instructor, Demands you to be responsible for your education as an adult learner. Demands that you prepare yourself for class and participate in the learning process.  Very structured professor.  Gives you what you need to learn.  Continue not to compromise your quality and level of teaching.  Thanks for the experience."
363,485568,4.0,4.0,"Excellent Instructor, Demands you to be responsible for your education as an adult learner. Demands that you prepare yourself for class and participate in the learning process.  Very structured professor.  Gives you what you need to learn.  Continue not to compromise your quality and level of teaching.  Thanks for the experience."
364,485568,1.0,4.0,horrible teacher. teaches for a paycheck not for the sake of educating. not there for her students. lady knows her stuff well but does not know how to lecture at all. down grades the morale of students.
365,485568,4.0,4.0,"Tori was a wonderful teacher. I read the comments posted and it sounds like a lot of whining. She is not here to babysit, she is here to teach.  In the real world, that is how it will be.  When you get into the hospital setting, that is how it will be. She is not warm and fuzzy, but she is an effective teacher. I learned a lot in a short time."
366,485568,3.0,4.0,"very knowledgeable, very unapproachoable"
367,485568,1.0,5.0,sux
368,485568,4.5,4.0,The best teacher I have ever had in my entire life!  I wish there were more profs like Tori.  I learned soooooo much in such a short time.
369,485568,2.0,3.0,"&quot;Oh, THANK YOU so much for giving us a test review&quot;-THEDAYB4THEEXAM! She voiced disgust 2 our class when she ONLY rec'd 2 thank-you's. Then,the exam didn't even cover the info!She covered test mat'l right b4 the test b/c she was behind in her lectures.A mean woman makes up 4 having an overbearing husband &/or low self-esteem.She has 2 prove hrslf!"
370,485568,2.0,3.0,"Chip on her shoulder&#63; Most condescending & belittling, she maintains righteousness from the start, esp when she gets 2 lectures behind. Her cruelty is unwarranted & unprof'l. She purports to be all-knowing, but has already proven otherwise. Not an effective teacher, nor is she approachable, unless you stroke her ego. A smooth killer, like Ted Bundy"
371,485568,4.5,4.0,"Tori is an excellent teacher, her tests are HARD, but all the information is in the powerpoints and the handouts she gives.  It is good to read the book before each class as she asks questions during lecture.  Be sure to review your quizzes as some of the questions come back on the mid term and final."
372,485568,4.5,4.0,"She's a great instructor... this class is hard because there's so much material to cover in only 8 weeks.  Pay attention to lecture and read and you will be fine.  Barely getting her master's&#63;  Check your facts, she's got a Ph.D."
373,485568,1.0,5.0,"She is the epitome of evil!  Uses scare tactics to teach, is inappropriate, intimidating and demeaning.  If you are a brain on the subject, she'll give you respect, if you're not, prepare to have many nervous breakdown-like experiences and night mares.  This woman is so unecessary.  Take her only if it's your last resort.  My condolences --"
374,485568,1.0,5.0,not effective or interested
375,485568,1.0,5.0,this female needs therapy for her mind games  through out the course. Pray that she changes for the better. Poor thing is barely getting her master  degree and thinks that she is running the show!
376,485568,4.5,4.0,"Tori is one of the best teachers I have ever had.  Her class was hard, but her examples helped me to understand the material much better.  I really appreciated the fact she would stay after class and give me my test grades.  It was good to review the test too."
377,485568,1.0,5.0,Instructor was not helpfull in any way.  She would belittle people for asking questions during her lecture.  She was not clear as to what she expected from students in her test.  She did not provide or promote a learning environment!!!
378,485568,4.5,4.0,"This is a hard class, but I am learning so much.  There is a lot of reading and the tests are hard too.  However, Tori helps us understand the material by giving good lectures."
379,485568,2.0,5.0,She's a pretty horrible teacher. Lectures are useless when it come to taking her exams so don't bother listening to them. Just read your book and hope for the best.
380,485568,4.5,4.0,Tori MAKES you think.  She is the BEST professor I have had so far.
381,2758852,5.0,4.0,"Biegon is p understanding, talk to him if youre having trouble or need resources, easy to talk to once you get to know him so make the effort to see him during office hours. Class is structured like uk academia so HEAVY reading and writing, make sure to have good writing skills because he does grade a little tough on papers. overall insightful."
382,530628,5.0,4.0,Sociology 162 is one of my favorite classes that I took this semester. I learned a lot about human rights and Dr. Harte is a phenomenal professor. She has encouraged me as a writer and student to do my best and advocate for those who are in need. The skills and information that I have learned from her class are tools that I will apply in medicine.
383,530628,5.0,1.0,"Harte is a very caring and lovely lady. If you need something just reach out. Shes very lenient about missing class, if you do just email her and she will make sure she goes over things with you. She gives fun lectures because she turns them into stories. She gives Friday assignments almost every Friday, usually a quiz discussion, or short paper"
384,530628,5.0,3.0,She is amazing! So sweet she cares for her students and an amazing advisor as well! She explains everything we need to know such as assignments and when it comes to exams she actually helps us get prepared for the exam.
385,530628,5.0,3.0,Great professor. She gave us everything we needed such as reading materials and study guides for her exams. I felt very prepared for the class and she is a very sweet lady. I look forward to taking more classes with her!

388,530628,5.0,3.0,"""So many papers"" probably isn't the best way to put it, but there are a good amount of one-page essays. She only lectures, so if you're more of a slides person, she may not be the professor for you."
389,530628,5.0,1.0,"Love her! She is so intelligent, funny, and helpful! She is always willing to help and is clear on assignments, also very understanding."
390,530628,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Harte was a nice, helpful, and amazing teacher. Although her short answer questions on the midterm and final are a part of the study guides she gives you beforehand, she can be a tough grader when it isn't answered specifically. Make sure you read the book or at least skim it in order to pass her quizzes. "
391,530628,5.0,3.0,"Harte is a very intelligent professor and her experience prior to teaching really helps when it comes up in class discussions, very funny and helps improve your writing. Wonderful woman and very realistic with her students and her expectations, one of the best professors at the Mount, I was lucky to take her."
392,530628,5.0,4.0,great professor. don't really have to read she explains everything very clearly during lecture. take notes!! blue book tests only. just study and on the test write as much info as you know and you'll get an A
393,530628,3.5,4.0,"One of the best teachers, she is very intelligent and caring. Also sweet and cute. Her class can be hard but if you show up for class assignments that will help raise your grade. She explains very well and uses great examples."
394,530628,4.0,2.0,You watch alot of movies.
395,530628,3.0,5.0,I was expecting a sweet and understanding woman in this online course based on the ratings here.  I did NOT find one.  Harte was very mean and not understanding at all.  Her workload was ridiculous.  Instructors like her forget that students have other classes too.  She sucks!
396,530628,5.0,1.0,best soc teacher ever!! real easy although the class is BORING!!
397,530628,5.0,2.0,She is a great teacher who gives very interesting lectures. I learned a lot from her and she was very helpful.

400,530628,4.0,1.0,Her class is very easy...you have to actually try in order to fail...as long as you study the study guide you'll be able to pass...she is great and willing to work with you if u are having difficulties
401,530628,5.0,3.0,Dr. Harte is the coolest teacher at Mount St. Mary's. She always willing to help the students and gives good study guides. Sometimes class can be a bit boring but she is intelligent and knows exactly what she's talking about.

406,1538245,5.0,2.0,"She is probably one of the most amazing professors ever. Beyond caring & really goes out of her way for her students. She really knows what she is talking about and is a passionate nurse. Anyone who states otherwise, does not care about her class or isn't taking her seriously. Study and you'll be fine. There is really no reason you should not pass."
407,1538245,1.0,5.0,She's condescending and negative. It may come from a good place but she should not be teaching with that attitude.
408,1538245,3.0,3.0,Lectures are pointless read on your own join a study group and you'll be fine
409,1538245,2.5,2.0,Professor wasn't well knowledge about the topic. Her lecture were boring and it was really hard to focus. Lecture time was not organize which ultimately created chaos. I would prefer to stay home and read the book.
410,1538245,2.0,5.0,"Tests are hard as hell, do not correlate with the lectures (if she even lectures)...Everything you learn on your own! READ READ READ and learn to take NCLEX style questions."
411,1538245,5.0,5.0,The best professor at Mount Saint Mary's College. She is an incredible professor and mentor for nursing students.
412,1538245,4.5,2.0,Extremely sweet and understanding Professor! She is very knowledgeable and she understands the way the students feel because she always says she has been in our shoes. Laid back but expects the best from her students.

418,2164947,5.0,4.0,Professor Fritschi is a phenomenal speech professor. I have learned skills that have enhanced my presentation and delivery when speaking in front of an audience. She has taught me ways to ease my nervousness by informing me that the fear I feel before presenting is normal and that I can overcome that feeling by practicing my speech.
419,2164947,5.0,2.0,She is easy and a great professor.
420,2164947,5.0,3.0,"Fritschi gives excellent reading material. The semester will be a breeze, she gives great lectures and grades fairly.

Class discussions with her are the best. Her class is like a book club!"
421,2164947,5.0,3.0,"Prof Fritschi is probably the nicest English teacher I've ever had. I am a nursing major so I don't want to be worrying about passing my English class.

423,2164947,5.0,2.0,"I loved this professor! She would go through her powerpoint and would usually finish with an hour to spare. That hour was offered to anyone who had questions, needed feedback, etc. Everyone else was welcome to leave after that. Solo project and a group project were really easy. Her essays were based on what was spoken about in class. 10/10."
424,1347804,5.0,1.0,An awesome belly dancing instructor who has been dancing for over 10 years now. She loves to chit-chat for the majority of the class time and is always smiling and laughing.

She is always welcome to answer any questions and clear any confusion you may have. Make sure to keep track of time because it is easy to get lost in paper work.
430,2511078,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Moosa is one of the best clinical instructors I've had. She really challenges me to always think critically, problem solve, and encourages hands on skills teaching.

431,2511078,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Moosa wants all of her students to succeed and shows that through her constantly challenging and encouraging us. She will ask you many questions, but that helped me learn a lot throughout the clinical environment.

Overall, she helped me become a critical thinker &amp; I am grateful for her guidance."
434,2511078,5.0,3.0,"I feel truly fortunate to have had Dr. Moosa as a clinical instructor. During the semester, I saw a significant improvement in my nursing knowledge and skills. She does an amazing job explaining how medications, labs, etc. correlate to the diagnosis. She also gives you plenty of opportunities to practice the skills you learn."
435,2511078,5.0,3.0,"I had the privilege of having Dr. Moosa as a professor for Funds and as an academic advisor. She is amazing in both roles! Funds was challenging as all nursing courses, but she makes it doable and is accessible to help. She is always prompt in replying, likes to challenge your mind, and genuinely cares and wants you to be successful. Great person!"
436,2511078,5.0,3.0,"I greatly enjoyed and benefited from having her as an academic advisor and clinical instructor in my first semester of nursing school! She is very accommodating and accessible when it comes to meeting outside of class. As an academic advisor, she has been very helpful in organizing my schedule and answering any questions I have."
437,2511078,5.0,4.0,Ms Moosa really challenges you to think critically and emphasizes the importance of looking at the bigger picture in nursing. She is a very helpful teacher and has prepared me to move on further with my nursing studies. Highly recommend and definitely would take again.
438,2511078,5.0,4.0,"Professor Moosa was my clinical instructor for my second clinical rotation in nursing school. While I felt like my knowledge about nursing was very little at the time, professor Moosa guided us to experience various nursing skills for the first time by continuously giving us the opportunity to perform skills given the right circumstances."
439,2511078,5.0,4.0,She is a very detail-oriented instructor. She has a wide breadth of knowledge and her ability to critically think is nearly unparalleled. Students that come into her class do leave better equipped to deal with challenging scenarios. She definitely has the capability to produce top-quality nurses and I fully recommend her as an instructor.
440,2511078,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Moosa is a great clinical instructor that has helped me grow as a student nurse. She helps to connect the dots between what we learn in class and what we see in the patients, and she encourages to learn and practice new nursing skills. She can be challenging and has higher expectations, but overall she truly cares about her students."
441,2511078,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Moosa is a dedicated instructor and she genuinely wants her students to get the most out of their clinical experience. While it might take a little bit of time to adjust to her teaching style, you will learn so many nursing/life skills (critical thinking, time management!) &amp; become the best possible student nurse by the end of the semester."
442,2511078,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Moosa helped me connect the dots between diagnoses, medications, and lab values. She really forces you to think and she encourages you to seek out new clinical experiences. She can be tough, but I definitely feel more prepared for next semester because of her."

She definitely cares for and pushes her students to critically think and make connections with medications, lab values, etc. in the clinical setting. Her teaching is very structured and thorough, and she has helped me to become a better student nurse."
444,2511078,5.0,3.0,"Professor Moosa was my clinical instructor for the 1st semester of nursing. While learning the material can be daunting, she took the time to speak with her students individually about their care plans to cover difficult concepts. She makes sure that you understand the material so that you are prepared. I still remember everything she has told me."
445,1347818,1.0,5.0,"Head of the sciences at Glendale Career College but absolutely terrible professor for Microbiology. Crams information that is not relative to test, asks to visit office when struggling but only tells you to read the book and form study groups. Offers advice to use different sources but not relevant when in an accelerated program. Impossible. "
446,1347818,2.0,4.0,"horrible professor. his lectures dont match his test, dont know where the hell he gets his test from. i spent every day in his office for help, would not give extra credit."
447,1347818,1.0,5.0,"I suggest you not to take his class, unless you love reading the text book word per word and memorizing each bold term. He expects you to learn every single vocabulary in the book. His lectures are useless. His office hours are not helpful at all. If you're stuck with him, the only way to pass him is READ THE BOOK."
448,1347818,2.0,5.0,"Horrible teacher! Tests were impossible, and barely put any effort into helping his students. He turned me away from his office several times stating &quot;just to read the book&quot;, and even when I had him sign my drop slip he told me I had a learning disability! But don't get his class for anatomy or physiology, unless you have a photographic memory."
449,1347818,1.0,5.0,All he did was go over the slides and expected you to know all the material from the book. His test were really hard and tricky. Some of the answers could not even be found in the book.
450,1347818,1.5,1.0,"friendly professor, very easy to engage in conversation; more interested in lab than lecture; disorganized; class is unstructured"
451,1151211,5.0,1.0,One of the best professors in school
452,1151211,5.0,4.0,"Great instructor. Very knowledgeable. She has a lot of enthusiasm for the subject matter and use different tools for learning. Even if you aren't interested in the subject matter, she's great!!!"
453,1151211,5.0,2.0,Lisa is a wonderful instructor. She really made it a pleasure to come to class and clinicals.
454,1151211,5.0,1.0,great instructor. no bad bone in her. she makes it easier to come to class. approachable and easy to talk to. Always smiling. I learned a lot from her
455,1347821,5.0,3.0,"Great professor and very funny! I have taken him for two criminology classes, and I have enjoyed both classes. I wouldn't consider him a ""tough"" grader, but you will have to do some reading and research on your own in order to get maximum credit, as you should be doing with any college class anyways.
"
456,1347821,5.0,1.0,"If i would retake his class over and over again, I would. He's an amazing professor and cares about his students especially during this pandemic."
457,1347821,5.0,1.0,"He's an amazing professor. If you turn in all of your work, there's no way you fail the class."
458,1347821,5.0,3.0,"Passionate about what he knows. Loves opportunities for hands on learning (guest speakers, field trips etc.). Very understanding of outside responsibilities."
459,1347821,4.0,1.0,"dr. gordon is a funny character. has a bit of a different style of teaching. i swear he ate CPK every day. but that's irrelevant. just go to class and do what's expected, nothing too hard."
460,1347821,4.5,2.0,Dr. Gordon is so funny when he lectures. Most of the time he's telling the class stories of his whacky patients or movie projects that he's doing. He's also very straightforward. Even if you hardly read the book you can still do well in the class by doing well on the presentations the online discussions. Funny & easy going guy. Highly recommended.
461,2427124,5.0,3.0,"Ignore the bad comments because Professor Rojo is one of the best professors at the Mount. Her lectures are very informative and you can tell she cares a lot. This is the 3rd time I take her and her classes are just the best. She is not a tough grader, she grades what you turn in. She provides study guides for exams which is amazing! "
462,2427124,2.0,3.0,She is a very picky grader. I rarely got 100% of my points on my assignments even if it was based on completion. But the content is clear and the exams are decent.
463,2427124,3.0,1.0,Her class was not hard at all but she is a weird grader. The end of the semester project is very vague and she will not provide you with much information on how to do it. Is extremely anal when it comes to grading. The way she tells you is kinda rude as well. But her exams are super easy
464,2427124,5.0,4.0,"This professor was so caring when I took her class! She always answered any questions and was so considerate. Really appreciated her! She's clearly knowledgeable about her teachings and is passionate about what she teaches. In terms of workload, make sure you read the given module, make flashcards to study for tests and quizzes, and take notes!"
465,2427124,5.0,3.0,"Attendance is not mandatory, but Dr. Rojo gives extra points for attending. This class didn't have exams or final, but she gave out quizzes. The quizzes are straight forward and questions come from her lectures and the textbook. She is pretty strict on grading assignments and papers, but overall, Dr. Rojo is kind, understanding, and knowledgeable."
466,2427124,3.0,3.0,"Rojo's nice and the course material is not hard. No issues 'til late in the semester when she dumped a large group project during the move from Chalon to Doheny bc of the fire. She didn't tell us it was a point grade system until right before the final, everyone's grades dropped! I went from an A to B. She also grades journals grammar not content"
467,2427124,5.0,2.0,"Rojo was one of my favorite professors and I'm a nursing major. She made psychology so fun and interesting to learn about through her relatable lectures and playful examples! To pass the class you really just need to pay attention during her lectures and study her study guides thoroughly. Skip the class, you won't pass! I definitely recommend her."
468,2427124,5.0,3.0,"Professor Rojo was an amazing instructor but if you dont reach out for help, youre on your own. Shes very easy to talk too but at the same time, you may need her to clarify things. Overall, I would take another class from her."
469,2427124,4.0,3.0,"I took Rojos hybrid course and it was great. Dr. Rojo is a wonderful lady, she smart and makes a lot of jokes in her lectures. She also offers extra credit for attendance. Her work load is light but you definitely must read and show up to pass because exams are very similar to the textbook and her lectures."
470,2427124,5.0,3.0,"She is such a good professor that teaches very well. I really understood every topic she spoke about. Take her!!! The study guides really help for the exam, just study!! She explains her topics in a way that the students understand and wont stop until her class fully understands the topic. She does assign readings but they are just like the lectur"
471,2427124,5.0,2.0,Great teacher. Very understanding and always willing to help!
472,2427124,4.0,2.0,"Great Professor, I would definitely take her again. Her lectures are interesting and she makes the class interesting overall. Always make what we are learning in class to relate to our life. One of the most fun learning experience I had. She gives a couple of assignments throughout the semester but nothing one can not handle. Amazing professor!!"
473,2427124,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I've ever had! She is lovely and caring will always be understanding of any issue you're having. She grades a little tough, but because she expects you to follow the rubrics she gives. Would definitely take her again."
474,2427124,5.0,2.0,"She's the best teacher!! Yes there is readings of the textbook in order to pass the quizzes and tests, but they're also based on what is discussed in class. She's a fair grader and gives extra credit for just showing up. You literally have to do nothing to fail her class. She's the best and would take her again."
475,2427124,5.0,2.0,Professor Rojo made me love Intro to Psychology. Her lectures were interesting and everything she went over in class reflected her quizzes and exams. She gives study guides on what to study for the exams. Although attendance is not mandatory she gives extra credit if you do show up. Her quizzes do require you to read but it will pay off.
476,2427124,1.0,2.0,"She is fair but is a weird grader. Also, I wish she stuck to only teaching developmental psychology because she also teaches intro to psychology, you can tell that intro to psychology isn't her forte."
477,508149,5.0,3.0,Great learning experience!  he's hard but worth the effort.
478,508149,1.0,5.0,"He is a hard grader, his tests are very hard. I don't undestand how he expects his student to learn 10 chapters at a time. He hardly passes anyone and no A's."
479,508149,4.0,3.0,A very intellectual guy.  He really cares about his students.
480,508149,4.0,3.0,"Loved his class, got an A"
481,508149,1.0,5.0,"I read ever chapter this **** assigned, I studied my ass off for everything and I got a C!"
482,508149,1.0,5.0,"This teacher is not the kind you want to have especially for a Biology teacher. His test are very hard and they are based on 1 part of so many chapters he wants you to read!!My advice, stay focus in his class especially his lectures, take good notes, STUDY!! and DO NOT let him intimidate you!"
483,508149,1.0,5.0,This man does not know how to teach.  He lectures for hour and his exams are never based on them.  It's really hard to pass the class. I had to drop the class at the last moment.  He sucks!!!
484,508149,1.0,5.0,"His tests are NEVER based on his lecture/notes. Not even the book at times. He tells you to stdy chapters 1-10, and the test ends up being on chapter5....it sucks, because you study so hard, and you basically study things he never test you on. Everyone is failing my class right now. =("
485,508149,3.0,5.0,"This guy is hard! Unless you're a bio freak- you'll need to get a tutor. He's very good at explaining material but his exams are hard. His tests are based on the book. Take excellent notes, read the book, and see a tutor. If you want an easy &quot;A,&quot; this is NOT the class for you. But you'll learn..."
486,2826487,5.0,1.0,Love Professor Cheriki! She is very knowledgeable about the information being taught in skills. She is very engaging and funny but makes sure you are learning first. Very approachable and easy to talk to compared to the other clinical instructors. Very supporting and encouraging instructor! She never made me feel dumb when asking questions.
487,536830,5.0,1.0,"I absolutely love Professor Leighton. From the get-go, the energy she brings to the class is so calming and inviting. She is a holistic teacher, she doesn't give out too much work and she never gave my class tests. We mostly had projects throughout the semester. Her perspective on government and politics is super unique. Definitely recommend."
488,536830,5.0,3.0,LOVED the class!!!! Professor Leighton makes the lectures interesting. During times like these Professor Leighton makes sure to incorporate small mediation practices before class and sets the students and I into small breakout rooms to interact! Overall her course is easy and straight forward!
489,536830,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Leighton's course online during the pandemic and it was one of the most positive, impactful experiences during this time. She is a world of knowledge when it comes to politics and is open to sharing all of her insight and resources in a practical way. If you participate and take good notes you will succeed in her classes."
490,536830,4.0,2.0,"Class can be boring but its PolSci, thats expected but she makes an effort to combat that. Leighton, is incredibly adaptable and is willing to slow down and repeat things. Taking the class online posed some difficulties and I had many things upset me due to the pandemic but she helped out. Leighton is sweet and she has a very kind heart."
491,536830,5.0,3.0,I loved this class. Dr. Leighton is amazing. If you are an auditory learner than this class will be easy for you. She is very good at explaining. She is a little difficult but she is fair. I did spend a lot of time reviewing my notes but this class made me feel like I have a real voice in politics.
492,536830,5.0,3.0,"In order to do well in the class, you need to attend class. Very lecture heavy, so make sure you take good notes. She doesn't allow laptops in class, unless you are working on your group project. Exams are hard, but exams aren't the only thing that make up your grade. She is willing to work with you, as long as you put in the effort."
493,536830,4.0,4.0,"She is a caring professor but all her lectures are on a Powerpoint where there is just key points and you need to listen and follow with her in order for her to elaborate. Mostly it is just in-class notes, mid-term, final and some pop quizzes or even group projects. She is a professor that is full of information and you will learn, pay attention."
494,536830,4.5,2.0,"Professor Leighton was a cool and non-strict teacher who although has lectures that are long, will inspire you and will allow you to think critically and effectively. Her exams are what's on the study guides she gives you beforehand. Just pay attention to her lectures and you will do great. Do not worry about having a textbook. "
495,536830,4.5,3.0,"Amazing professor! great class if you are into poli sci ! Loved her way of teaching ,very easy, just take good notes! barely any hw so just make sure to do well on the exams or you will fail. "
496,536830,3.0,2.0,She is a decent Professor but she goes off topic a lot which is REALLY annoying! BEWARE: She has really bad BO! If you take any of her courses make sure to get a seat in the back row.
497,536830,2.0,4.0,Goes too fast throguh notes. Is funny but when it comes to the subject I did not enjoy it.
498,536830,4.0,3.0,She's awesome if you're into Poli-Sci. I loved her class and she definetley opens your eyes through a political perspective.
499,536830,1.5,2.0,"This professor should not be teaching any upper divisions, let alone poli sci classes. For individual rights she made us watch super size me, said it was going to be on the midterm. And guess wat&#63; That was not on the midterm. I felt like I was taking a intro to government class with her questions like...what is politics and civil rights/liberties."
500,536830,5.0,4.0,"I loved this class, she was very helpful and she always reaches out to her students. She is very organized. I really liked her class becuase even if you don't verbally participate, as long as you look interested and are taking good notes, she'll give you a good participation grade."
501,536830,5.0,2.0,"OMG! SHE'S AN AWESMOE LADY! I WAS ENROLLED INTO HER CLASS LATE AND SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO GO OVER EVERYTHING WITH ME IN PRIVATE. HER TESTS CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL, SO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE STUDY GUIDE SHE HANDS OUT!"
502,536830,5.0,3.0,She is a great professor......she knows what she is talking about. I love that fact that she knows everything right off her head......
503,536830,5.0,3.0,She is an outstanding teacher.  Probably one of the best professors I have ever had.  Can't wait to take more of her classes
504,536830,5.0,4.0,She tried to make it interesting.
505,536830,5.0,5.0,"She is very organized and expects nothing but the best from each and everyone of her students. But can sometimes treat you like a baby, by saying you can't chew gum or leave the class to go to the restroom. I hate that but I am not there to like her I am there to learn"
506,536830,5.0,3.0,GIVES GREAT LECTURES AND IS ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS I HAVE SEEN. IT'S A GREAT CLASS AND THE WORK IS NOT TOO DIFFICULT BUT THE MIDTERM AND FINAL ARE STRESSFUL.
507,993534,5.0,3.0,"Had him for palliative care and fundamentals, and was a great professor for both. Really clear about what his grading criteria are, and assignments are reasonable. Lectures are enjoyable since he's pretty funny. Exams are heavy on nursing interventions in the book, so get ready to read if you want an A, lectures will suffice if you want a B."
508,993534,5.0,2.0,I really enjoyed my gero course with Dr. Lemos.  His humor is refreshing and makes for more interesting lectures.  He is clear and concise and I am able to remember everything he says.  
509,993534,5.0,4.0,Awesome instructor. Knows his stuff and is really passionate about Gero. One of the best teachers at this sad school.
510,471299,4.0,2.0,"Took Lennon for Eng 1A. Didn't take her Eng 1B class. At first, she was strict and firm with the class. We were required to post our papers and other assignments in a blog. We had a few easy group projects. Overall, an easy and interesting class."
511,471299,3.0,2.0,"Participation is the most important thing in this class! You must speak up! You also need to be a huge kiss up in order to get an A I swear. Also there is a ton of group work, you will pick a group on the first day of class and this will be your group for the whole year so pick wisely!"
512,471299,5.0,1.0,"Amazing professor. Honestly one of the most interesting classes I've ever taken. Lennon knows what she's teaching and challenges her students in a way that benefits them. Her class is a real eye opener on different perspectives. She seems tough at first, but she makes it clear that she is not a pushover. Participation is key in her class! "
513,471299,4.0,3.0,Love HER! Best English Teacher Ever! 
514,471299,3.5,3.0,"A great teacher. She focuses on: reading and essays, as well as public speaking. You are expected to do your work on time, analyze the text &PARTICIPATE. If she doesn't know your name by the third week you better fix that. Don't be afraid to share your thoughts, your grade is based on work and participation. She is  nice & takes her job seriously."
515,471299,3.5,3.0,"She expects a lot from her students to learn from each other. Loves to assign group work. Sometimes not clear about what she wants with paper. Kind of unorganized and seems intimidating. Just participate and stay active in her class. If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask her."
516,471299,2.0,1.0,My only problem is that she is stuck on memoirs and writing essays about your personal experiences. Never in our class did we do a research paper. She basically expects you to know everything because you are in 1A. She is not boring and is a bit unorganized. It is an easy class just do your hw on time because she wont take late work.
517,471299,2.0,4.0,I see how she is a good teacher and she knows her things really well. I do not appreciate that she significantly shows she has favorites and love to pick on the others. I feel that she goes back on her strict critism.
518,471299,3.5,3.0,VERY GOOD PROFESSOR! She knows what she's talking about and is very upfront and real! she can be a bit intimidating and yes she does play favorites! just come to class and PARTICIPATE!!! your grade depends on it!!!
519,471299,5.0,1.0,I love professor Lennon. This is the kind of class you look forward to go to!
520,471299,3.5,2.0,"Easy Class, Just sucks cuz she plays favorites so just participate and you'll do great"
521,471299,5.0,3.0,"Lennon's class is kool but you have to do the work. You'll pass if you try! She's not a bad teacher, people are just scared of her. I enjoyed taking different courses with her for three semesters in a roll. I passed all three times becuase I studied and was interested."
522,471299,5.0,3.0,"Lennon is absolutely the best professor I ever had, I learned so much from her. I must admit she can be a little difficult but she is the best. African American Literature was the class I most enjoyed her teaching."
523,471299,4.5,3.0,"some people just aren't made for college. if u can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen!"
524,471299,4.5,3.0,I loved Lennon's African American Lit. class. I learned so muc from her and she kept me interested the entire time.
525,471299,5.0,5.0,"She demands a lot because she gives a lot. If you don't want a challenging prof. to learn from, then maybe you should reconsider why you are in college. Hats off to the best instructor I've ever had and learned from!"
526,471299,3.5,2.0,"She is a teacher who expects everything she ask for, when she asks for it. She treats you like an adult and takes no excuses. The essays she assigns in class are of good topic and they are reflections of yourself. her quizs are a bit hard because they go into detail of the reading."
527,471299,2.0,5.0,"Lennon is a very hard grader. I will admit that you do learn, but she can be so rude. She made some students cry, in class b/c they didn't do their assignment! It's a good class, but the instructor is a witch!"
528,991497,5.0,4.0,he keeps things intesing; very fair; cares about students
529,516366,1.0,4.0,"I was excited because I heard she was good, but the class was unnecesarily difficult. While the material is interesting- her teaching is the opposite. Tests were hard when not open note because she asked very specific questions. There were only 6 people in my class and some days only 1 or 2 would show up. We did make a fun pillow at the end though!"
530,516366,1.0,5.0,"I, like many of my classmates, learned pretty much nothing as the lectures and teaching style as a whole was pretty much useless. You are forced to print out hundreds of pages and fill in the blanks as ur notes. The exams are also based on really specific details that have relatively nothing to do with what u would think is the most important."
531,516366,1.0,4.0,Very inconsiderate of people having lack of resources in the pandemic. Wants you to print everything and doesnt tell you in advance. Too specific in the test. Too much memorization of very specific details. Thinks that her class is the only class that matters. I took her before and swore to never take her again but there was no other option :(
532,516366,1.0,3.0,Just do yourself a favor and do not take this class.
533,516366,1.0,4.0,"Professor Garry is nice but her teaching style is definitely not for me, and definitely not for many other people in my class. She makes us print out pages of her &quot;lectures&quot; and we literally just have to fill it in from what we read from the book. She doesn't focus on what's most important. Lots of tests, feel like I learned virtually nothing"
534,516366,5.0,2.0,"Professor Garry is very nice and understanding. Her tests are fairly easy if you pay attention to her lectures and review her power points and the book. She also does a few powerpoint presentations but she will give you a clear grading criteria for each one. Her attendance is mandatory, if you miss one day, you lose a lot of points."
535,516366,3.0,3.0,She is very particular about attendance and arriving on time. I was 5 minutes late to a class and she deducted attendance/participation points which I think is unfair to do at this level. She also takes some time to hand back papers which is not helpful especially if you like to receive feedback.
536,516366,5.0,2.0,"Professor Laurie Wright Garry was an amazing teacher and super nice. She is very understanding but do not think that it is a super easy class. Tests are filled with multiple choice, fill in the blank, and short answer essays that were very easy to understand if you read the book and listen to her lectures. Rarely gives out homework. "
537,516366,1.0,5.0,"the whole class is based on a book (test/ homework/lectures) if you're late, she takes points off your homework she asks for really specific details on the test. she chooses favorites and picks on the others.   She does not grade fairly, so try to be on her good side.  We don't learn much, save your money "
538,516366,1.0,5.0,"She is a nightmare. She teaches as if it's an eighth grade class. There is no critical thinking or analyzing going on, rather, all she wants you to do is memorize an unreasonable amount of specifics and then test you on these. She is rigid and very hypocritical. Watch out because her grading is also very arbitrary. The worst class I've ever taken. "
539,516366,1.5,3.0,She is not that hard. Read and go to all your classes. She is a horrible grader. If you dont know what she is thinking she will mark you down. Question everything you do with the presentations at the end because she marks down points for anything and everything. Know the book and the things she says during lecture and you will be fine on the test.
540,516366,4.0,1.0,Dr. Garry has very interesting and fun ways for the student to understand myth and religion. I really enjoyed her class overall. Her down fall is that she tends to be unorganized. But if you complete her assignments to a T and attend there shouldn't be a reason why you wouldn't get an A+
541,516366,1.0,1.0,Wow wish I could get those hours back into my life
542,516366,1.0,3.0,"It is past the middle of the semester and we have not received one thing back from her. She has assigned us paper after paper but we have no idea how we are doing becasu she hasn't graded anythign! Very frustrating class. Content is interewsting to being with, but the lecture do not progress in any of their ideas."
543,516366,5.0,4.0,"I learned so much in this class. As long as you participate, do the reading, and attend class you should do fun. Tough subject matter but rewarding class."
544,516366,1.0,4.0,Attendance is a must
545,516366,1.0,4.0,Do not take her online class for Intro to Catholicism! She tired to put an in-class presentation a week before finals! You have to visit 4 different churches and she is not very organized or prepared to teach an online class. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TEACHER!
546,516366,5.0,3.0,"I think Garry is a great teacher.  You can tell she really enjoys teaching, and likes to get her students to really think about the subject.  For one, I'm not a religious person but she didn't seem to hold it against me, and I ended up really enjoying her class.  Lots of textbook work, but she makes sure you really get what you're reading."
547,516366,3.5,3.0,"I ended up really liking her class. The first thing that struck me was that she just didn't talk to her class as if we were grown-ups - but she did take input from us in the end. I would not take her again, because I was so stressed out the entire semester that I MIGHT be late once and get dropped a grade. I have enough to worry about in my life."
548,516366,1.5,3.0,she's effing crazy!! she grades in-class NOTES and teaches like it's a high school. she would be a better teacher for high school or elementary but definitely not college. shE'S also strict w/ attendance & homework. careful w/ the grammatical errors cuz she's deduct points like crazy.
549,516366,3.5,2.0,"shes ok, the fact of the matter is, is that she gets   crazy about attendence, cant believe that she said that if we miss two classes, the highest grade we can recieve is a C... wow....   hold on.... wow...."
550,516366,5.0,2.0,"Good teacher. Most of the reading is easy. She gave up on giving us quizzes to test if we read early into the semester. If you're not big on participation, just do it once in a while. There is work to be done here, but it's pretty easy. I learned. I wouldn't mind having her for another class."
551,1857807,5.0,3.0,"Took her and another teacher for fys. Her part was about mindfulness. Such a great professor. She is very caring and cares about her students. The assignments were straight forward, she did like to have in class discussions about our assignments."
552,1857807,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bishop is amazing!! I have nothing but good things to say about this caring, respectful, down to earth, woman. She is a true gem. You will be touched if you ever get the chance to meet her sweet soul. Couldn't have gone through this program without her. Love you, Dr. B!"
553,1857807,5.0,3.0,"As a first year psychology major, Robin Bishop truly made my first psychology class very exciting and easy to understand. She is great at teaching until all students are clear with the subject. If students are confused, she will continue with a chapter until we all have a better understanding. Amazing professor!!"
554,1857807,5.0,1.0,Truly a wonderful teacher. Not many teachers are interested in the development of their students' or challenging them. Dr. Bishop is. I wish there were more educators more like her.
555,1857807,5.0,1.0,I loved this class! It made me change my major to psychology. Her study guides are very helpful. She is always avaible for help. Very very great teacher!! :)
556,1857807,5.0,2.0,Very nice and enthusiastic about the course. A lot of reading! Bishop is awesome!
557,1945871,5.0,4.0,Ronning is a fantastic professor. I would strongly recommend choosing her for 208A. I wish she taught more classes in the department. She is very accessible outside of class and responds to emails quickly. She cares about her students. Not an easy A but if you work hard and put in the time you can do well.
558,1945871,5.0,4.0,Dr. Ronning is an amazing professor! She is kind and considerate and is always willing to help with clarification. She understands how students' feels and makes sure that her students are doing all right and are ready to learn. Her stories are inspirational and always relate back to the topic we are studying. I highly recommend taking her!
559,2285841,4.0,2.0,WEEKLY MEMOS NICE AND VERY UNDERSTANDING PARTIPATE IN CLASS AND YOU WILL BE FINE
560,516369,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Zaferes is amusing, witty and presents the material in a clear way that makes music come alive for students that are non musicians as well as those that are familiar with music. He is fair, accommodating, passionate about music, encourages students to share their perceptions and points out that we all may interpret some things differently."
561,516369,5.0,1.0,"He's wonderful; i brought in my cds and we learned off of them.  he's a total genius when it comes to music, and he's got a great sense of humor.  definately reccommend him!"
562,516369,5.0,2.0,Intelligent and caring.
563,690457,5.0,2.0,"His class mainly consisted of reading the novel assigned, doing reading checks every class, and having a group discussions. His grading really pissed me off in the beginning, but he's honestly not harsh when it comes to essays. The two books we read were very interesting. He's really just that chill funny professor. Don't miss class!"
564,690457,5.0,1.0,"The best English Teacher I have ever had! I cannot recommend him enough. You do need to show up but his conversations with the class are chill. Easy A, just do the readings he puts. Funny and cool teacher!"
565,690457,4.0,2.0,"If you're taking creative writing, then yes there is a lot of reading, but you can write as much as you want or as little. After reading the comments, yeah you will not be criticized. He focuses on the positives maybe to push you towards it. He does speak in Spanish often and rarely translates. I missed one day though, and lost 100 points."
566,690457,5.0,1.0,One of the best professors I've ever had. He really cares about his students and his passion of reading and writing is shown through his teaching. Definitely take him!
567,690457,5.0,4.0,Read some amazing books and discussed them as a class which was really interesting to hear professor & student perspectives. He's really helpful and gives good feedback on papers to help you improve. What I really loved about him was how he really made you THINK
568,690457,5.0,2.0,Great professor!
569,690457,5.0,1.0,"Professor Villatoro is an incredible Professor! He is creative, smart and definitely has a different approach which many can easily dislike.  I however loved his style.  I learned so much from him, his lectures and his class over all.  I wish he would teach more classes.  He has inspired me in many ways.  Take a class with him and you will love it!"
570,690457,3.0,2.0,"Prof. Villatoro is an amazing friend to have, as a teacher tho, he is questionable. He seems to be wrapped up in his own writing style and he doesn't care to teach you much... Even in creative writing."
571,690457,5.0,2.0,"He's a fantastic teacher, nice, easy and very fair.  Everything is done on the point system and you have to go to class or you will miss quizzes and other points.  If you want to write creatively, he's awesome."
572,690457,3.0,1.0,"He's easy if you don't rock the boat. 90% of his papers due are 2 pages, that don't require MLA formatting, or anything. A good class to be creative in, but if you're really looking for instruction/lecture, go elsewhere."
573,690457,5.0,3.0,An amazing professor. I wish he would teach more spanish classes. He helps you reach your potential and does not discourage you like some other spanish professors. Mr. V is truly the best.
574,690457,5.0,4.0,great teacher wants to help students reach their potential. Very caring and compassionate. Haters stop hating he's a asset to the hispanic culture even if he learned spanish in college
575,690457,4.0,2.0,"I agree that he does need to be harder, but he's just a nice guy. EASY A!"
576,690457,5.0,1.0,"He's hot, and fun to have in class. Take him for anything in eglish he loves what you write!"
577,690457,4.0,1.0,"Again,like the others, PLEASE TELL ME I SUCK! If I ask for hard criticisim, I won't get it. Only praise, great if you're a narcissist. I have to say, in his defense, it's not an easy subject matter to teach."
578,690457,3.0,1.0,"Well, EASY A, okay subject matter. Great talking to actual authors. Really wish for him to just rip my paper to shreds and say it stinks. But he's too nice..."
579,690457,1.5,1.0,No Comments
580,690457,2.0,1.0,good for an easy A. he'll do nothing to help you develop as a writer and comes off like an interminable blowhard. just sit there and let him talk about how learning Spanish in college and going to a foreign country makes him an expert on Hispanic culture
581,690457,5.0,1.0,"He's passionate about writing, but also passionate about being a pacifist & catering to the lowest level in the class. It would be great to hear him say once, &quot;This is awful! You're a terrible writer!&quot; instead of pretending everyone is the next"
582,2234651,5.0,4.0,"I am glad I took Professor Vaughn for research. Her expectations are clear at the beginning of the course. She provides clear rubrics and explains that your grade is earned. There is a lot of reading and research that you need to do for your research paper, but that is the point of the course. She explains everything and is always so helpful!"
583,2234651,5.0,4.0,"Its really frustrating when professors are unorganized so it was refreshing to not have to worry about that with professor Vaughn. She had clear objectives for the class and was always happy to answer any questions. Shes only a tough professor if you slack off or dont take advantage of resources she provides! Anyway, Its grad school!Toughen up!"
584,2234651,5.0,4.0,I truly appreciate Vaughn &amp; her time spent helping me in many occasions. THANK YOU!!! I enjoyed every minute of her lecture. She is a wonderful instructor and very knowledgeable. If you desire to learn and master this subject she is the one to take. She is very dedicated to her work and to her students.
585,2234651,1.0,1.0,"lacks empathy, shocked she is a professor in psychology, shows no interest in helping students, very cunning personality, struggles conveying the material, weak lectures, loves powerpoint presentations, always cuts class short, usual by an hour. if i had her ratings i would have quit by now. someone mentioned that she might be burned out."
586,2234651,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I have ever taken. Vaughn is incredibly passionate about teaching, caring, and humorous. She cares about what her students take away from the class, and will put forth immense effort to personalize each class to the students. She is available for students and genuinely wants whats best for them. 10/10 highly recommend."
587,2234651,5.0,3.0,"she is amazing! my favorite graduate professor so far! I keep taking her classes because she is clear on what she expects from us. she has very detailed rubrics! approachable if extra assistance is needed. student that do not like her class, are just not ready for grad school. workload is manageable. Those who complain are just lazy!"
588,2234651,5.0,3.0,"Vaughn is one of my favorite professors in the grad program. She is structured, clear about her expectations (follow whats on her rubrics), knowledgeable and does a great job explaining material. She is caring, funny, and approachable... so if you're struggling with the material don't be afraid to reach out and ask for support. (PSY 268, 200, 241)"
589,2234651,5.0,3.0,"I would definitely take Vaughn again. Shes always prepared for class, great lectures, genuinely cares for the students. Learned so much, gives great feedback. Assignments are manageable, I mean we are in a graduate program."
590,2234651,5.0,3.0,Professor Vaughn does a great job at making her expectations clear from the beginning. She is approachable and makes learning easier. Reach search is difficult to learn but she makes it more than possible to understand. If you are willing to learn and grow take her.
591,2234651,1.0,5.0,"Vaughn is prepared for class and has a clear rubric, however she has been the worst professor I've ever had. She likes to make others feel inferior and is very sarcastic. If you take her class, switch out. And if you can't, well be prepared to do a lot of work that she won't even like."
592,2234651,1.0,5.0,"I don't think it is possible for her to be satisfied with anything such as questions, papers, her students, her students responses. She is the teacher if you become a teachers pet then you will succeed since you do every little thing for this micro manager to be satisfied."
593,2234651,1.0,1.0,You have to participate because you do not have a choice since she grades you on this (excluding attendance). You sign up for graduate school to further your education not to be ridiculed by your professor. You could engage in her class but no teacher should continuously be sarcastic 100% of the time. It is rare when people like her.
594,2234651,5.0,3.0,"Vaughn is my favorite professor at MSMU. People might say that she is difficult, but the level of difficulty is manageable. I mean we didn't sign up for school to do nothing. She is very knowledgeable and if you try to engage in her class you will see that she is not mean or sarcastic."
595,2234651,1.0,5.0,"She does put in an effort to teach but she lets you be aware it is a burden to teach you. From her sarcasm, to endless micro-faces she does not have the capability to be an effective professor. She allows her emotions and feelings to become dominant and that is not the right thing to do as a professor. Avoid her class! You will thank me some day."
596,2234651,1.0,5.0,Most people do not sign up for her class. MSMU is so small and has barely any staff or better teachers to take. You probably will take her because of limited teachers so just read your text and go to class. Go to different staff members to receive help and do not miss any class. After 8 hours of hw everyday you probably might learn something.
597,2234651,1.0,5.0,Save yourself now and dont take her for any class!
598,2234651,2.0,5.0,"Never take her for research. She is awful. If you dont want a teacher to answer your questions but only make you do things her way, or no way then you will love this class. She makes students do so much work! She is super rude and sarcastic! She thinks its funny! And be prepared to be called out, or called upon if you dont answer her questions."
599,2234651,3.0,3.0,"If you plan on taking her for Research, be prepared to work!"
600,1802527,5.0,2.0,"Professor Ensley is perhaps one of the best professors at the mount. His lectures are interactive and sometimes he might call on students, but you shouldn't ever be confused with the concepts he teaches. Reading is involved, you will use the textbook. So long as you are in class, you will pass! Always clear and open to everyone, listens to everyone"
601,1802527,5.0,4.0,"He is pretty straightforward. Doesn't have a lot of assignments so do the ones he gives. Lots of reading, but all interesting material. Tests were multiple choice and gave you your results right away!"
602,1802527,5.0,1.0,Professor Ensley was the best! He is always there to help you and will always be clear in explaining things. I would definitely take him again. He was very inspirational and his tests are easy as long as you pay attention in class which will never be hard because he's very clear and interactive with the class.
603,1802527,5.0,1.0,This professor is by far my favorite. Only two rules: Come to class and learn something! So clear to understand. If you pay attention you get an A guaranteed! Wish I could take him again!
604,1802527,5.0,1.0,"He makes the class very interesting. he really makes the students understand Sociology in real life situations. lots of group project, and you have to not be shy to present. The homework's and quizzes are very easy to do. It's a class where you do not need to worry about getting a bad grade."
605,1245483,2.0,3.0,I didn't learn ANYTHING in his stats class!!! He didn't teach us until AFTER our quiz was taken when it was already too late!
606,1245483,5.0,2.0,"I took his class my fall semester of my freshman year.  He's a really good professor and makes the lectures pretty interesting.  He gives quizzes for every chapter, but it isn't so bad, they're only 11 questions (one of them counts as extra credit) and they're all multiple choice.  as long as you read the chapter the night before you should be fine"
607,1245483,4.0,2.0,No Comments
608,2318645,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Gaynor was a great professor. Again, it is critical thinking, so obviously be prepared to answer questions that he asks during class. Along with that, ask questions! He elaborates on everything and provides study guides for every exam/quiz. "
609,2318645,4.0,3.0,"This class makes you think out side the box and I like that about it. Since it is Critical Thinking, after all. Gaynor is great, he helps a lot and will always answer questions. He is always trying to help all you have to do is reach out and try to get help. Sometimes the class can be difficult to understand but if you actually try youll pass."
610,2318645,3.0,4.0,"He is a very good professor I feel like he is just too smart and I feel like he thinks we understand him but we don't. Other than that study the study guides they help he is very understanding and will help you if you need help. He is just a good but hard to understand, I wish I was bit more smarter so I can engage with him and the lecture."
611,2318645,3.0,4.0,"The way he lectures is very confusing and does not explain things in simpler terms. Don't bother buying the textbook or doing the assignments on the syllabus. For quizzes and exams, they're based on the lectures and the study guides will help you big time! For EC, he has discussion posts where you can ask and answer questions about the study guide."
612,2318645,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor, will help you if you need help. Quizzes and tests are just like study guides."
613,557366,1.0,5.0,Very rude to students. fails you if she doesn't like you. 
614,557366,4.0,4.0,"If you want to learn she will definitely sharpen your skills. I would recommend you take her, but make sure you sharpen up. "
615,557366,5.0,2.0,Sweetest woman. Wants you to do well. BUT STUDY FOR THE TESTS! they are tricky!!!
616,557366,5.0,3.0,"I had her for Med Surg and clincials, & was very intimidated at first but you warm up to her. If you had her for both in the same semester, she definitely expects you to utilize what you learn in class in the medical field.  I have never been more inspired to continue nursing after being in her clinical group at UCLARR."
617,557366,4.0,3.0,"Her lectures are boring, they will put you to sleep!! but she is super nice and cute!!"
618,557366,4.5,3.0,sweetest lady ever. she's very helpful and approachable.
619,557366,4.5,3.0,Ms. G is the best teacher imaginable. I had her last year for a class and this semester for Pharmacology. Her powerpoints are very long and she talks a lot but it's all worth it. She gives a lot more information than the book so take good notes.
620,557366,4.0,2.0,What a wonderful woman and teacher. One of the most supportive in this school's nursing program. Too bad she can't run the whole program.
621,557366,5.0,4.0,"Ms. G is a great instructor, and she really cares about her students.  She is very knowledgeable, and she will do anything to help.  You are very lucky if you get Ms. G!"
622,557366,2.5,3.0,"Pharmacology lecture was pretty boring. Ms. G is really nice and had mother-like qualit and all, but other than going for a few notes... I was disappointed in the class. I felt like besides the notes I get from lecture I learn more by myself. Sorry Ms. G, But she's so much better in skills lab lecture sophomore year."
623,557366,5.0,3.0,No Comments
624,557366,4.5,2.0,"She is a lovely person. Like a perfect mom: warm and helpful, but can be strict when she needs to be. This class is on a credit/no credit basis, so you just need to pass. Be advised though, that you should study diligently nevertheless, since you will be lost in clinicals otherwise!!!"
625,465209,5.0,2.0,"Goes beyond the classroom lectures to ensure a positive educational experience.  Positive, collaborative, and enjoyable classroom environment. Rare at MSMC"
626,465209,5.0,3.0,I had her twice for BUS 192 and Small Business Management. She teaches both classes differently. She's harder in Bus 192. Make sure you choose a GREAT group for class projects because that will determine big chunk of your grade. She's strict with attendance and study for the exams. She's a good professor just requires work and studying.
627,465209,4.5,2.0,"She is a very nice, sweet and funny professor. Many complain that her lectures are confusing but actually if you read the textbook then you should be able to follow right along. I would have her as a professor again."
628,465209,3.0,4.0,"She might be a nice professor, but her lectures are very confusing and her exams do not reflect what is being taught in class. It seems like she is always in another world and not in the class."
629,465209,5.0,4.0,Don't take her as a fool because she is kind. She can see through B.S and your grade will show it if you slack off.
630,465209,5.0,2.0,"She makes morning classes so much more fun, I actually looked forward to going to class.  She's so sweet, so funny, and so helpful.  She wants everyone to do well, and she's willing to give extra credit.  I heart this teacher."
631,465209,5.0,2.0,"I think Janet is one of the nicest teachers at the Mount. She is very knowledgeable, helpful and so dang cheerful, you can't help but like her. Her lectures are engaging and she strives to make the class interesting to everyone. Reasonable amount of work."
632,2015546,4.5,3.0,"She is a very clear, concise, and straightforward professor, which I always like in my professors. She always starts her class by stating the agenda, which I really appreciate. She gives a lot of extra credit opportunities, both for quizzes and midterms. also replies to emails quickly."
633,2015546,4.5,4.0,"She was a great professor and I loved that she was passionate about the material. She was a little tough and her quizzes do require you to read; however, there are times where she reviews the material before you take the quiz. She is always available if you need extra help. If you do not pass it is because you did't reach out for help. "
634,2015546,2.0,4.0,"Moral Values was honestly one of my hardest classes this semester. I'm not a philosophy major, so the readings were difficult for me to understand. In class, she wouldn't explain the reading at all, give us a difficult quiz, then do a mediocre ""lecture"" on the topic (aka asking us awkward questions no one knew the answer to). Not helpful."
635,2015559,2.5,1.0,SO DISORGANIZED. Our semester was a mess. Barely learned any skills and then were tested on them. I wish we would have gotten more time to practice.
636,2052424,4.0,2.0,The novel we read in this course is now my favorite. I always looked forward to this class. 
637,2052424,4.0,2.0,She was really fun listen to. She does go off of her PowerPoints so pay attention and take notes. Her tests are relevant to the notes and the reading.
638,348490,1.0,3.0,"so scattered, gets a lot of facts wrong. read the book for your own safety. assignments are very unclear and she hasn't even put a timeline of some sort up and its the middle of the semester. Just take another professors class..."
639,348490,4.5,2.0,"She is a really good teacher. She is very nice and understanding. She is critical about attendance, but as long as you tell you why you're absent, she is understanding. Mostly, I just read the book and did well on all of her quizzes and exams. She even offers extra credit. Overall, a good teacher. I would take her again if I needed to."
640,348490,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Fine is a very nice and smart lady.  She does tend to jump around time periods in World History thought making it hard to follow the times. I did horrible on all of her tests, midterm, and final, but I did well on the presentations and essays and still got an A!"
641,348490,3.0,3.0,"Ms.Fine is a very cool teacher.If you keep up with your reading you will be Fine.(get it Fine&#63;Ms.Fine...)anyways.If you need help, she is always open to assist you.Cool accent"
642,348490,4.0,3.0,"She's a good professor and tries to make the material interesting. She may forget some names or dates here and there, but she still knows her stuff. Very smart lady. I would take her again."
643,348490,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Fine is really cool. I realy like her class. Shes always really enthusiastic and makes everything really interesting. A lot of the times she doesn't know how to say certain names and gets me confused, but its all good. She makes sure to go over everything that we went over last class and adds upon that. She is one of my favorite professors. She made me remember why I like history so much."
644,348490,2.5,3.0,"I had to pull from all three years of high school french. She's all over the board, she doesn't seem to have a clear path, teaches directly from the book and expects people to automatically grasp the concept. I personally don't have a hard time with the class because I have taken french before, but I feel sorry for the people who have never seen it before. Umm advice&#63; Study with someone who has they can explain it to you better than she can in class."
645,348490,1.0,2.0,"lol the students know more than prof fine,,,,,, shes a little scattered hahaha"
646,348490,1.0,1.0,No Comments
647,348490,2.0,2.0,"she's so disorganized...she mixes up her dates and always says, &quot;can someone double check that for me&#63;&quot; or she asks a student to make sure she's right. she's easy though...if you suck up to her, you'll definitely pass the class."
648,348490,2.0,3.0,Don't know what to expect in her class. She gets lots of dates wrong. I look through my notes and have several dates for the same event. This teacher is very scattered.

650,348490,5.0,1.0,Great teacher. Just stick to the idea the France is God. Wonderful and kind lady. Too bad she doesn't teach more classes!
651,348490,5.0,3.0,"Excellent teacher. Fun enthusiastic, very pleasant very helpful ."
652,2185547,5.0,3.0,"Always went over labs for students to better understand. If you are struggling, don't hesitate to ask! She always makes time for her students and loves when students make effort. I feel that if I took another professor I would of had a rough time. Always read the labs before class, there are pop quizzes, but fairly easy. Definitely recommend 100%"
653,2185547,5.0,3.0,"Professor Dahae is one of the best professors ever! No joke, take her if you can! She will explain things to you over & over until you understand. Takes time to go over homework. Dont miss class, no late assignments accepted. Pay attention & you will pass! You have to try hard to not pass. Loves to give extra credit! She understands our struggles."
654,2052427,4.0,1.0,Good professor. Good lectures. Interesting readings. Textbook captivating college class.
655,2052427,5.0,4.0,Taking one of Dr. Sanchez's philosophy classes was an opportunity that has contributed to my overall growth as a student and as a future provider of ER medicine. Dr. Sanchez has inspired me to think beyond my borders. He is always willing to help and guide students through their thinking and reasoning. I definitely recommend taking his classes.
656,2052427,4.5,4.0,He is a really awesome professor and his lectures are based off of the readings that he gives you. His lectures are engaging and detailed so pay attention and participate. He will make sure that you know what the lecture was about and if you don't he will help you understand it. I would most definitely take another class with him again. 
657,835917,1.5,4.0,"Disorganized, and makes up her own words, which makes it hard to like or learn in her class.  Nice person, not a good lecturer."
658,835917,3.0,3.0,"She is an excellent clinical instructor. She is the one you want when it comes time to do the hands on stuff. Lecturing is not her strong point. But if you make an effort to engage her, she can be very helpful."
659,835917,3.0,5.0,"A great nurse maybe but a terrible teacher. She spends most of the class telling jokes, and telling stories. Tells us to read the book, but tests us on whatever she wants to. She has left the word teach out of teacher. Half the class is flunking and she thinks it us. We did not get this far, if we were lazy or not smart. I hope she retires soon."
660,835917,2.0,3.0,Something must of happened since the last comment because she is not all helpful.  Her handouts of her notes are blank and need to be filled in by the students. Her only rationale for getting a test question wrong is &quot;to learn how to take a test.&quot; Hopefully she can change her teaching style before the next class has to take her.
661,835917,4.5,4.0,"Maggie is a terrific teacher. Only the 2nd decent teacher I have had so far at MSMC! She honestly cares about her students. She is tough, but is willing to listen to rationales on tests to drop the question. Very funny and approachable. Recommended highly! Tests are based on the books, do the Evolve website tests and CD."
662,835917,3.5,1.0,"Very nice, very helpful, very good person.  As an instructor, however, I think she is not especially well-organized and doesn't really teach clearly.  She is a competent nurse, no doubt(!), only some people don't translate such competency into teaching too well."
663,835917,5.0,3.0,More than reasonable when it comes to grading. You have to do your fair share of studying. Don't expect to pass if you don't study hard. It's not the teacher's fault its yours!!!
664,835917,4.0,3.0,Good lecture presenter and easily approachable person. Probably a good nurse but quizzes so far are completely her own spin on things. Her opinion of things are not from the book Potter & Perry or from notes. Class is in uproar. I'm settling on just passing. It just isnt fair
665,1141079,1.0,5.0,"Kk is a modern day Hitler! One of the most unfair, rude, dismissive, and demeaning people I have ever met! Such a horrible person to her students and staff. 100% Unprofessional. Yes, her lectures are interesting because her voice is strong and isn't monotone. Other than that, she will give you some of the worst experiences in your life."
666,1141079,3.5,5.0,"Give up your social life because this class is basically your life now. Never have I ever studied so hard for a test, only to get a low B/high C on it. If I put that same amount of time and effort in another class, I'm sure that would be a solid A. For people taking her class, may the odds be ever in your favor."
667,1141079,1.5,5.0,"most difficult class in the nursing department, you can know 100% of the content and every single word she says in lecture, and still only get a C on her exams. Exams are horrible, questions are difficult to understand. Pediatrics does not need to be this hard of a class, who even wants to be a pediatrics nurse? Its basically HER version of Peds"
668,1141079,5.0,2.0,"She is a great clinical instructor. She really lets you be independent but is there for any questions and to push you to do things you are unconfident about. Make sure you get your patients out of bed if allowed! Passing medications was easy, just be confident in your teaching. She is so passionate. I truly enjoyed clinicals with her."
669,1141079,5.0,5.0,"This class was by far the most difficult one I've ever taken in nursing. But I learned SO much, especially in test taking. I highly suggest going to office hours and getting a tutor. I probably would've done much better if I had one from the beginning. She is an amazing, passionate teacher. Study her slides and record her lecture!"
670,1141079,4.5,3.0,Kathy Kelly is one of the most knowledgeable and passionate nurses that I have ever met. Record her lectures and listen to them as many times as you can! Use multiple nursing peds nclex books to help you. Dont second guess yourself on her tests either. Basically if you think critically like her then you will pass the class.
671,1141079,4.0,4.0,"Her tests are challenging but after you took her class, you will feel that you have gained something in Nursing which may aid you later as a nurse. Practice pediatric Nclex questions.  Her lectures are very interesting and clear. Growth and development is a major topic and it would be helpful if you get it down in your head early on."
672,1141079,3.5,4.0,"Theme of the course: ""what would Kathy Kelly do?"" Never failed me. Go into her office if you need help and if you're struggling. Practice peds NCLEX questions to help you critically think and prepare you for her exams. ""NCLEX Questions Made Incredibly Easy"" is a book that will come in handy. Growth and development will follow you throughout the whole semester!!"
673,1141079,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher ever. She makes you think like a Kathy Kelly nurse, otherwise, you'll do terribly on her exams. When you try to talk to her, she is very condescending. Horrible person to converse with. She is very judgmental and will hold grudges. Never believes she is at fault. She is.. infallible.. AHH!"
674,1141079,5.0,3.0,No Comments
675,1141079,4.0,5.0,"Tests require you to think like a nurse, but not just any nurse, like Kathy Kelly herself! I do feel that her lectures and notes are good, though. I think she's a very nice person and a fair teacher."
676,1141079,3.0,5.0,"Shes very rude, not understanding. dosnt care that we have other things going on in life and other classes to worry about. Very unprofessional."
677,1806679,5.0,2.0,Heres pretty easy and his funny.
678,1806679,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lossada is the best. His lectures are clear, the book is not dry either. His study guides are helpful, pay attention and review your study guides and you'll pass with an A! His approachable and if you need extra help he is willing to help. He applies a lot of his real life experience which helps you connect everything. (Took for 1 & 12)"
679,1806679,5.0,2.0,"I love him! Took his class for my entire freshman year for Intro to psych & ChildHuman develop. He clearly wants his students to understand. Study guides are very helpful. As long as you listen to his lectures and study for the exams, you'll pass for sure."
680,1806679,4.5,3.0,He makes class fun. He shares funny stories and doesn't just stick to lectures. He doesn't believe in finals. He  also really cares about you. His class helps you see things differently and makes learn more about yourself.
681,1806679,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lossada is the best Psychology teacher ever! I love him, he makes going to class enjoyable. He is always updating grades and cares about his students! So glad I took his class!"
682,1806679,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lossada is a great teacher. Not only is he very clear in his lectures, he love teaching what he teaches. He makes you want to go to class because it's a class you can enjoy. He shows videos and shares personal examples, which is easy to understand. He drops the lowest grade and his test are not cumulative. I really recommend him!"
683,1806679,5.0,2.0,"BEST TEACHER FOR PSYCHOLOGY , he helps whenever you need it and tests and quizes are all starightfroward and he teaches you evrything you need to know! love him!"
684,1806679,4.5,1.0,Prof. Lossada is the best Psychology teacher I've had. His tests are straightforward. Some questions are straight from the chapter test in the book. He drops the lowest exam and quiz grade. He is reasonable with what he expects from his students. His lectures are pretty fun because he shows videos and shares stories about his own life.
685,1020253,5.0,3.0,SHE IS THE BEST COACH I HAVE EVER HAD!!! LOVE YOUUUU MILLIEROCK
686,1020253,5.0,2.0,"Prof Millie is so amazing!! She goes out of her way to help her students because she wants us all to succeed. She understands Nursing extremely well and gives the most detailed explanations & demonstration. Her in-class practicums are not too hard, so don't worry. If you study and practice on your own time as well as in class then you should pass."
687,1020253,5.0,2.0,She has being one of my favorite professors. She kept me at edge of my sit wanting to learn more. She makes the class interesting and gives real life examples on how to use the knowledge you are acquiring in class.
688,1020253,5.0,2.0,She tell you the real world way which doesn't always coincide with the text book way but she is still a great teacher.  Her tests are straight forward as long as you know your material.
689,1020253,4.0,5.0,"She knows her stuff, no doubt about it .Tests are tricky and hard , like the NCLEX , watch the math she might put meds that are not mixable ! Overall she is good and  you learn how to use critical thinking and to question EVERYTHING"
690,1020253,5.0,3.0,"Millie is very knowledgable and approachable. Her tests are fairly hard, but study the skills in Potter and Perry and you will do well. Not an easy class, but if you study hard, you can get an A."
691,1020253,4.5,4.0,"Millie is very enthusiastic when it comes to teaching. She is cute, funny, approachable and extremely knowledgeable. Her tests are difficult and tricky (NCLEX format) but once you get a feel for her testing style, you'll know the depth of what to study. I definitely learned a lot in her class!"
692,1511793,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Espinoza is amazing!  She's funny and keeps you interested in the topic.  You do need to pay attention in class and SPEAK UP!! That's what she's looking for - easy way to get an A, talk!"
693,1511795,3.0,4.0,"She assigns a lot, specifically at the end of the year. She does not input grades into the grade books until they are due. If you miss an observation, be sure to make it up. Her assignments are not hard, but are lengthy-- VERY. LENGTHY. Quiz on reading is given out every week. Only positive, very hands on with preschoolers at CD Center."
694,1042828,1.0,5.0,If your nursing do not take him... He does not help you at all. I went to office hours and everything he just wants to fail students. He never gave extra credit.... He just wants to fail you...
695,1042828,3.0,4.0,"The topic material (Cell Bio) was very interesting but sometimes his teaching was confusing. He is a really funny guy and was lenient on the tests. When he went over what we needed to know for the final, he totally put different things than what he told us! Be ready to be fooled. I had an A all semester and ended up with a B bc of the final."
696,1042828,2.0,2.0,"He just teaches what he's interested in, not what really should be covered so he's always behind and we don't really get the class we signed up for.  The extra-credit is fine, but he uses it to make up for the fact that he isn't trying to get us to actually know the material."
697,1042828,5.0,3.0,GREAT teacher. he is always willing to help no matter what. lectures arent too bad. he explains everything and is easily approachable. take his lab class! its an easy A++++ because of all the extra credit which boosts your grade up for lecture. he wants you to pass! just talk to him
698,1042828,3.5,2.0,I don't understand how people failed or did bad in this class. You basically need to study the powerpoint slides and you're good to go. I didn't attend class most of the time and still got an A-. He even gives you 20/50 of the questions that will be on the exam. How easy is that! Also take his lab.. he gives EC for going to a museum & more!
699,817550,1.0,5.0,"I am a weekend college student, our classes are co-ed and sadly my experience with this professor is that she is a neo-feminist, at times racist towards the ethnic minorities in class. In your ideas which are reflected in your papers are not aligned with her own ideas then you will be shut down and or thought of as wrong. I would not recommend her!"
700,817550,5.0,2.0,"I can't say enough good feedback about Prof. Houston as a professor nor the enriching experience I had in her class. She is somehow tough with a lot of requirements to be met to pass the class, but that's ok coz I wouldn't be challenged without them. She is inspirational, but raw, approachable, true professional. I will definitely take her again. "
701,817550,2.5,2.0,She is an excellent women's studies professor but a terrible Religion professor. She admits she is not a Bible scholar but still teaches a class on Christianity. My biggest frustration with her class was that she had nothing positive to say about the feminine Christian experience. Her class was exceptionally biased.
702,817550,5.0,3.0,"I've taken from Prof. Houston twice now, and she really is a true academic. She is passionate about teaching and is really devoted to higher education. She values your opinion, and is extremely helpful. She really instills in the student a desire to go out into the world and make a difference. One of my favorite professors at Mount St. Mary's."
703,817550,5.0,4.0,"Really passionate professor, cares about her topic and it made a huge difference.  She channeled differences of opinion into truly interesting conversations and learning points.  The class was just an elective, but I came away feeling like it really added something to my education."
704,817550,4.0,5.0,Jaye is great. She comes off a bit hardcore but I really enjoyed the class. Pay close attention to her lectures and if she feels that the class is partcipating she usually gives a midterm guide.
705,817550,4.5,4.0,She is great!  Very helpful and knowledgeable!  Class discussion amazing!  Really enjoyed having her.  You must know how to write to succeed in her class.  You MUST do the readings for the assignments-good readings!
706,817550,5.0,3.0,"She taught me to look deeper. NEVER makes you feel stupid! Also, she KNOWS her class material so well....."
707,817550,4.5,3.0,Jaye is awsome!  She is soooo knowledgeable about women's studies.  She is amazing.  Lots of info. but well worth it-lots of writing and reflections-DO YOUR READINGS!!!
708,2292114,5.0,3.0,He's a great professor that cares about to success of his students in and out of the classroom. He tailors his courses to real-world solutions that will leave you feeling more prepared for joining the workforce. 
709,2292114,5.0,3.0,One of the BEST profs here. TAKE THIS PROF! He is awesome. His GIS courses are tough and annoying if it's not your major/minor. But he is just awesome and so nice.
710,2292114,5.0,2.0,Professor Kahn is really laid back and a caring person! His class is easy and he is always willing to help you. I recommend taking his class 10/10!
711,2292114,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Kahn is the BEST professor out there. He is always willing to help, will answer any question you have. If you need to take GIS take it with him. The class can be a bit frustrating at times but ask questions he's always willing to help!"
712,2292114,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kahn is an extraordinary professor. Goes above and beyond to make sure your voice is heard and that you understand the materials. He gives extra credit and really values hardworking students! Im not a math person and he understood that, and was really helpful in helping to teach."
713,2292114,5.0,2.0,I took him at Pasadena City. He is very caring and readily available. He wants his students to succeed and always communicates and is very responsive to his students. He wants his students to complete all assignments even if not on time he will accept late work because he wants his students to succeed. He is very kind and caring to his students.
714,2292114,5.0,2.0,"Kahn is very kind, funny, patient and understanding. Willing to help if you request it, especially with GIS assignments. Class material is fairly easy if you read the readings, slides, and review quizzes. Drops lowest grade on assignments. Go to class to succeed if not you'll fail - incentive to go to class gives answers to ?s that will be on exam."
715,1819028,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Agner is kind & tries to help the class understand the essential components of what becoming a teacher entails, but at the same time she tends to stress everyone in the class out. It is difficult to pay attention during this class, even the grad students are just watching the clock or are on their phones, She is also amazing and knows her stuff"
716,1819028,4.5,3.0,Another GREAT excellent professor in the MSMC department. Professor. Agner has a lot of time consuming assignments. But it is only for the better :) have fun!
717,2433429,4.0,2.0,"The lectures were a bit boring. Had two major projects that were a huge percentage of your grade. Show up, participate, and do the projects and you should be fine."
718,2433429,1.0,3.0,Never taking another class with this professor! She does not reply to her emails and has no sympathy for her students! Her assignments do not post on the canvas calendar so it is hard to keep up with deadlines and such! Very cold hearted professor.
719,2433429,2.0,1.0,I will never take any of her classes again. She is an easy A however you can't email her bc she replies 2-weeks later. Just show up to class everyday and do all her work she gives u it is an easy A. BUT shes boring.
720,1819036,5.0,4.0,"Professor. Ganjavi is a joy. Her class is definitely difficult, but if you stick to the scheduled syllabus    (exams and writing) you will pass. Good Luck!"
721,471452,1.0,5.0,"I honestly hated his class!! He provides a lot of homework, when taking the class I had trouble bc I was taking molecular bio &amp; couldn't find time to study for his class when asked for help he just say look in the book or online he does not provide any sort of help &amp; when explaining math it is confusing, he is also very cringey &amp; shows favoritism."
722,471452,5.0,3.0,"He really loves what he does. He puts a lot of effort to make sure the students understand. He goes fast but its okay to ask him to wait. If you convince him that your answer makes sense, hell give you the points. Hes really really nice and FUNNY. He does this math jeprordy as a revision and gives out candy as the reward. Weekly quizzes + hw"
723,471452,5.0,1.0,"He very straightforward. If you show up,take notes, and do the homework. I guarantee you, YOU WILL PASS. He likes to keep the lectures interesting by throwing in jokes. He's a great teacher and you can tell he loves teaching math. You won't regret taking this class."
724,471452,1.5,5.0,"Started out as an online study but transitioned to in-class student. Instruction delves too much in areas that do not facilitate learning about Calc, which makes it difficult to score well on exams. Exams created are not in sync with class work. Class is so hard, he grades on curve. If possible take class somewhere else."
725,471452,5.0,1.0,"I hope Dr. Skidmore is very well paid because he's too good for this MSMC. I didn't care for math when I took his class and my major at the time at had little to do with it. After transferring out of MSMC, I ended up earning a bachelor's in economics. Thanks Dr. Skidmore, because what I learned in your one class helped my in many Econ ones."
726,471452,4.5,2.0,Very smart teacher that's always helpful!
727,471452,4.0,4.0,"Don't think you will pass this course will only small amount of effort. This class takes full dedication for learning and practicing exercises. The grade is reflected on exams. STUDY STUDY! If you have a question, do not hesitate to ask him in class or office. Show him you care!!!"
728,471452,4.0,4.0,"This class is intense if you are re-learning or just first learning calculus. Attendance is mandatory!!! If he doesn't call names, but just looks around... make sure he sees you! HW is a requirement for points and there is a quiz every Wednesday. The large % of grade is the exams, there is about 4 in semester. Be ready to study and pay attention!"
729,471452,5.0,2.0,Dr. Skidmore's explanations are clear and and thorough. He will explain the material as many times as you need. He made even the most challenging concepts understandable.
730,471452,5.0,4.0,Homework is due twice a week and there is a quiz every Friday. Exams are hard but are not impossible if you take the time to study and understand the material. Dr. Skidmore is very helpful and approachable.
731,471452,3.0,5.0,"Class was very challenging.  I'm not really a math person in the first place but I usually still get an A in the class.  But not this one. Dr. Skidmore is a good teacher, but the subject material is very difficult."
732,471452,5.0,4.0,I love dr skidmore with his songs to open class and his open toed sandals :) He was a great teacher to I never understood math untill I experienced his class. I cant wait to have him for calcu
733,471452,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Skidmore's class was very helpful.  I never had good math teachers in high school and I never understood the material, so I started at a low math level in college.  I thought it was going to be high school all over again, but Dr. Skidmore knows how to teach!  If you need help, he will repeat things as many times as you need.  He's awesome!"
734,471452,4.5,2.0,"He's a good teacher b/c he loves what he does; sandals with pants every day, best to pay attention and not be distracted by his way of dress."
735,471452,5.0,2.0,"Actually made the subject interesting. Take the notes, and study them. Tests typically follow the notes with few if any exceptions. Love the parrot. Great Prof."
736,471452,4.5,4.0,Class was hard. Lots of homework and project that made no sense. I learned alot and actually understood the material.
737,471452,3.5,4.0,"His classes are hard because the subject material is difficult. He is generally helpful and a nice guy, but sometimes he chews gum in your ear while looking over your shoulder at your work and its not fun..."
738,471452,4.0,4.0,No Comments
739,471452,5.0,4.0,"He is a very good professor.  you can tell he is very passionate about his subject matter.  goes out of his way to make you understand the material.  his lectures may be a might ewww, but he explains everything very throughly and well."
740,1460649,3.0,5.0,"Very caring professor, but the midterm/final will make or break whether you pass this class. Exams are very detailed w/ lots of select alls. Does not like to lecture, so get ready to do a LOT of self study in addition to all the homework that is assigned. Well intentioned and kind, but teaching methods need some revision."
741,1460649,2.0,4.0,Didn't dislike her class so much as how much her projects made or broke our grades.  I agree with the previous comment.  Her guidelines weren't clearly delineated and I did not feel open to asking questions nor answering them.  I did like her teaching style but wished she would incorporate more actual lecture in them.
742,1460649,3.0,4.0,"Assignments should be corrected before the semester is over. If she wanted us to do better on assignments, why not give us more guidelines along with what's in the syllabus. A lot of outside assignments that are meant for helping the student understand the material. In reality, not so much! Read because quizzes and exams are based on it."
743,1843629,5.0,2.0,"GREAT TEACHER!!! SUPER FUNNY, super interesting , he always makes you laugh. Definitely a fair grader and breaks down subjects and changes them into real life experiences. Overall his class is just basic and not super hard but you do need to study and practice. His personality is THE BEST ON CAMPUS !"
744,1843629,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor, very motivational. I have definitely improved my writing with his class. Mark Forte is easy to understand and explains his lessons clearly. He interacts with the class 24/7 he also challenges yourself. Best professor Ive had so far! I recommend taking any of his classes."
745,2142647,5.0,3.0,"The class was a lot of work, but grading was not too tough. The book is downloaded for free online, and the weekly quizzes were easy. You can tell the professor actually likes teaching. I learned a lot! I wish he taught more classes."
746,2138554,5.0,1.0,"Professor Sinuk really wants his students to succeed. The class consisted of 3 quizzes (20 pts), 2 exams (40 pts), 1 group presentation and Kaplan remediation. He doesn't try to trick you, everything is pretty straight forward. Always open and available for help via email. Overall easy and  super interesting class. Enjoyed the semester very much."
747,1481149,5.0,2.0,"GREAT!! Wonderful professor. She really help me understand the DSM-5. She is very passionate about her work an she really is passionate abut her students learning in her class. At first I thought she was going to be hard to understand and that I might not do well in her class. But her Mid term is straight forward, don't over think it its what it is"
748,2023882,5.0,3.0,Professor Davis is awesome! She cares for her students above and beyond the classroom. She understands how difficult econ can be for some to grasp and with her great knowledge and years of teaching she has figured out a way to teach it and make it interesting for those who struggle with the subject. I remain in contact w/ her to this day!
749,2023882,3.0,2.0,"Professor Davis is a good person and a good teacher. The absolute only negative thing I have to say about her class was how rigidly she stuck to her power point presentations. I mean, word-for-word.... zzzzzzz! I would have liked to see more casual discussion on the topics interspersed into the lectures."
750,2023882,5.0,2.0,"Don't get me wrong, HER CLASS IS THE BEST!!!! She makes econ easy to understand, but because we met once a week the 3 hour course can get boring after a while. Gives study guides for each exam, which are really helpful!! Love professor Davis! Take her if you have to chance!!!"
751,2023882,5.0,1.0,Best professor ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
752,2023882,4.0,3.0,She focuses on her powerpoints and she gives you everything you will need to pass her class. She is really nice and she loves helping her students and if you don't understand she will explain it. She is really fun but take her class seriously.
753,2390478,3.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Haley for Anatomy Lab (1 unit) course), and it felt like a 3 unit course workload. Her lectures were long and not helpful at all. Her instructions are super confusing and unclear. She tells you what NOT to study and it ends up being on the quizzes and exams. However, she's nice &amp; gives you extra points on your exams to boost your grade."
754,2390478,1.0,5.0,"This class was online, but it was a waste of 3 hours. This class could have been trimmed down to at least 1-1.5 hr. Her Lecture was not effective at all. All she did was read straight off the book. There were no power-points given or notes. She is not great at communicating with you. I definitely DO NOT recommend."
755,2390478,1.0,4.0,Prof. Haley's lectures are extremely long and she does not teach. She is never clear about what is going to be on her weekly quizzes and always puts the random figure she told us not to worry about. She makes you turn your camera on during class. TRUST ME DO NOT GET HER
756,2390478,1.0,3.0,Not sure if its because I took this class online but this class was a waste of time. I had her for Anat. Lab and the 3 hour class can be compressed into 1 hour if she stayed focused. she only reads from the textbook which we could do more efficiently alone. She is a very sweet woman but this class was very unorganized and stressful
757,2390478,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Haley was a nurse, so her for her Lab classes she basically gave a lecture on what you need to know based on her experience from nursing. She is very kind and understandable, and she helps SO much if you are lost and confused with a certain topic. In addition to this, she responds to emails ASAP."
758,2175449,5.0,1.0,"Professor Bardan has been one of the most amazing teachers at the Mount. She's really caring and funny. There are few assignments and if you need help make sure to ask, she gives excellent feedback."
759,2175449,2.0,4.0,"If you don't like participating I don't recommend her. She will call you out and make you participate if you don't raise your hand. With essays, they have to be exactly how she wants them to be. Everyone knows what you are writing about as she makes you tell the whole class and will critique you about how you want to write the paper."
760,2175449,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Bardan is really sweet &amp; cares a lot about her students. She's also a professor @USC and expects a lot from you. During my semester, we wrote about 4 or 5 papers. Nothing extremely difficult, you just have to make sure you follow the prompt. She is very nice &amp; will gladly meet you outside class to go over anything (this is VERY HELPFUL!)"
761,2175449,2.0,4.0,"- If your papers are not EXACTLY how she wants it, you won't get an 'A' unless she considers changing your grade at the end of the semester. - Announces your paper topic in class, by the time your paper is due the whole class knows who is writing what. - Critiques your paper in front of the class and points you out by name.  - Lectures are LONG."
762,1485274,3.0,3.0,"Professor Giang is cool, but he definitely needs to work on his organization for the class. If you're not a fan of working in groups, don't take him - we were placed in groups for the whole semester and required to give lower and higher scores in group evals (defeats the purpose of honest evaluations!). His class organization could use some work."
763,1485274,4.0,4.0,A good professor.
764,1485274,4.0,3.0,"Professor Giang is a bit fought, but he is fair. If you need help he will help you out. his classes tend to be group oriented, so that''s always a plus! Reading the textbook is a must, because the lectures are based from the reading. If you did not read then you won't be able to follow along during the class. Participating is part of your grade!"
765,1485274,2.5,3.0,"He's a nice person, but a terrible grader and never explains anything clearly."
766,1485274,3.0,2.0,He does ppt presentations but sometimes changes them to fast so you dont have enough time to write them in class. Final was in a group setting and by the end of the semester we took the quizzes online. you have to read a lot if not you will get lost.
767,1485274,4.5,3.0,"He is big on reading! The text + 2-5 articles each week. Over all his class is extremely fun and very ""hands on"" in terms of applying what you learn in class. He has weekly quizzes on the readings. He's very awkward! And tends to use the word ""sure"" a lot! But over all a very good professor."
768,1485274,4.5,2.0,Very helpful if you put in effort. He wants you to explore on your own. He is funny in an awkward way which can be very entertaining. If you have the opportunity to take him you should. All material is applied to real world.
769,1485274,3.0,3.0,He is an okay teacher. What he lectures isn't just going to be on his test but also what he doesn't cover on the extra slides he puts on the test. His test questions are a little tricky but we do fun activities
770,1485274,3.5,2.0,"He is a brand new teacher and at first, it was hard to like him. However, as the semester went on, I really enjoy his teaching and his test questions really have improved. He is also super awkwardly funny!"
771,2525658,4.0,4.0,She's pretty good. I would suggest taking her!
772,2525658,5.0,2.0,Professor Kroll's class was amazing! Make sure to study powerpoints and ask questions if you need help. As long as you study it's an easy A.
773,2525658,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, and understanding. make sure to pay attention to powerpoints and study and you should be fine. If you don't understand something make sure to ask, and she'll go over it for you."
774,143845,1.0,1.0,"This class is just a money grab. Their is absolutely no substance to anything taught in this Bachelor's level class. Aaron at best, is confused with his own thoughts half the time. The class follows trends of whatever the prof's want, not what is actually happening in the industry. AVOID THIS AND ALL BA LEVEL CLASSES FROM THIS PROGRAM."
775,143845,1.0,4.0,"I took his online class and I was not a good experience. He focused less on teaching writing skills than I hoped he would, and he wasn't very responsive. It would take him days to get back to students on multiple occasions, which made it hard when you had questions about assignments because they were due every few days."
776,143845,1.0,5.0,Wasn't very active in his online class. Worse class by far. I wouldn't recommend taking him online EVER
777,143845,3.0,1.0,easy.
778,143845,5.0,1.0,Professor Drane is passionate about what he teaches and is extremely cool and down to earth. You learn a lot from his class. We watch movies and read the books that go with them and he teaches you how to view both the movies and books with a new kind of clarity. He really is a fantastic teacher and has such a helpful attitude.
779,143845,5.0,3.0,Great teacher!
780,143845,5.0,3.0,"The guy is somewhat crazily passionate about what he's teaching, and it makes the class about a million times more interesting than I think it would otherwise have been.  He's seemed genuinely interested in the opinions of every student, which is a rarity in most of higher education (although not at MSMC).  I was going to CLEP, glad now I didn't."
781,143845,5.0,4.0,I love him! He allows you to have a difference of opinion... a rarity these days. He is brilliant and intriguing! I wish I could take him again!
782,143845,3.0,3.0,He is really helpful when it comes to Speeches. You really just have to talk to him to see what he is looking for. Nice Person

785,143845,3.0,1.0,"So easy! just butter him up. He's a nice person, just not made out to be a teacher."
786,143845,4.5,4.0,He is always willing to hear you out.He is very understanding/.Professor Drane is a professional writer himself.Hes views are that of a crazed writer and I found that very intriguing.His critiques are out of this world youll think “why didn’t I think of that”. He is awesome and very good looking.
787,143845,3.0,1.0,A complete mess.
788,143845,1.0,4.0,Terrible flake
789,143845,2.5,5.0,"Professor Drane is a nice man, very knowledged in English, however, it is very hard to pinpoint what he wants from you.  It is only after getting menial grades and numerous conversations with him that you realize you have to write like him!"
790,143845,3.0,3.0,No Comments
791,2841062,1.0,4.0,Very intimidating and rude. Would not recommend taking human anatomy with him. Most of the class had to drop/withdrawal. I have never had so much anxiety in a class til his class. 
792,143847,4.0,1.0,Easy A if you show up and do the work (the few times its given). The most important thing to complete are the group projects and the volunteer hours at Alexandria house.
793,143847,5.0,2.0,Easy A if you do the assignments. Lectures are very dull. Exams are easy and open notes.
794,143847,4.0,2.0,"Her class is pretty easy, but her quizzes/ tests are pretty difficult. HOWEVER, there are alot of other requirements that help your grade! I thought I was going to get a B,  but the service hours we had to do, and the (easy) presentations we had to present brought my grade to an A-. Overall, would recommend to anyone."
795,143847,4.0,2.0,"Professor Crawford is very nice and understanding. Although her lectures are pretty long, her quizzes and tests are pretty easy especially when she allows you to have open book. I would take her again."
796,143847,5.0,4.0,"Dr Crawford is especially knowledgable about history and her lectures are very interesting if you are into history. A lot of material is covered, ask questions. Study and read everything she asks you to. Review, review, review. Exams are hard. "
797,143847,4.0,2.0,"If you need to take a history course, take her class. As long you do the work, you will pass with an A. I fail my first paper, but she allows me to revise it and turn it in for a better grade. And there is one midterm and a final exam, you don't really need to prepare for those, follow her lecture, and you will be good to go!"
798,143847,5.0,3.0,Great class-learned a bunch
799,143847,5.0,3.0,"Made it all seem pretty interesting, even wars. I learned to write an essay."
800,143847,5.0,3.0,"Loved the class-lots of humor in a sort of dry topic, ancient civ. She made it interesting.  Enthusiastic."
801,143847,5.0,3.0,"Learned a lot-lots of new material but slides and lectures helped.  She is organized and clear, and I enjoyed the readings, too."
802,143847,5.0,5.0,Very helpful!
803,143847,2.5,3.0,"Amazing person. A little too easy, many take advantage of her kindness. Let's late assignments pass but gets angry after long period. Textbook is for our benefit only, no direct teachings from the book. Mini quizzes on novels she has picked out that correlate to what we're learning at the time."
804,143847,5.0,2.0,One of my favorite professors. She always provides helpful lectures. Second class I have taken from her.
805,143847,5.0,2.0,One of my favorite professors. She knows so much about history and provides insightful lectures. Second class I have taken from her.
806,143847,4.5,2.0,liked the service learning-some of the content was more interesting than others like any field
807,143847,4.5,3.0,lectures are combo of book and her own knowledge. Liked the slides. Fair to me.
808,143847,3.0,1.0,"this teacher has the most irrelevant lectures and assignments, and sorta unorganized cause she's pretty old. as easy as this class was, it was TOO boring that i had to find something to bring to do during class. this teacher is really sweet though and very lenient when grading."
809,143847,5.0,3.0,Learned a lot from slides and jokes:)
810,143847,2.0,1.0,"I've had her twice and had two different experiences. The first class was an upper division history class and the easiest class I've ever taken because she was so lax the second was the intro to the history department class. She lectured about irrelevant things and was completely unhelpful, so I didn't learn anything. Still got a good grade though."
811,143847,3.0,2.0,"Really boring lectures, but she is really sweet. Very easy grader, and she accepts late assignments."
812,143847,3.0,1.0,Easy class. Aced te course and i wasn't even there all the time. Make sure you are a good writer in that class. A lot of papers. But there easy
813,143847,2.0,1.0,Horrible Professor in terms of her lecturing.  It is painfully boring and you will not learn anything.  It is an EASY A however.  You can never pay attention and still get an A.
814,143847,2.5,2.0,Awful when she is lecturing and speaking about the subject. I did not like going to class at all. But her grading is rather easy and she lets you turn in assignments really late and does not lower grade because of it.
815,143847,5.0,1.0,"prof. crawford is such an adorable lady. She's very sweet and not strict at all. Her class is boring but she shows passion for what she teaches. she also knows what she's talking about. i recommend her, her assignments are easy."
816,143847,4.0,1.0,"Professor Crawford is a sweet lady who cares about what she's teaching and just tries to make her lessons fun. The subject isn't super interesting, but do all the homework assignments (every week), show up for class, and listen when she's reviewing for the test... and you'll ace the class."
817,143847,5.0,1.0,She is an awesome professor. One of the best. I wish I had her for all my classes. Her papers are easy and her lectures are very interesting. She definitely knows her stuff. She is more than fair and her grading scale is more than fair. I love her!
818,143847,5.0,1.0,"Even though her lectures are somewhat boring, it's amusing how passionate she is about it all. She's very helpful and kind. The midterm was take-home open book and the final was an open took exam. Do well on her papers and exams and you should ace the class easy. Highly recommend her if you want an easy history class."
819,143847,5.0,1.0,Her class is extremely easy. She is very helpful and very understanding. Make sure to buy the book because all of her test are open book and you will need it for the assignments. Overall great professor who is passionate about what she does.
820,143847,5.0,1.0,"I had her for Asian History, and she is just delightful. Although we never are tested much from her lectures, it's still an interesting class. She's not boring per se, the class was just 3 hours long. She's fun and easy and has a lot of passion for History :)"
821,143847,3.5,2.0,"fun teacher. lectures are quite boring, but she is sooo into them that it's cute. Nice & easy, just the way everything should be ;)"
822,143847,4.0,2.0,"Crawford is incredibly nice!  She goes out of your way to help you.  Class is really boring, but even if you miss, you will still get an A.  Be sure to keep up on the DQs and papers and you will be fine.  I didn't read any of the book until finals and I did fine."
823,143847,4.0,1.0,"Dr. Crawford is very nice but always looks tired and stressed. Despite this, she is pleasant to her students and gives good lectures. As a history major, I recommend her if you want to get an in-depth look at early Western Civilization."
824,143847,2.0,3.0,the woman is crazy....but i love her!
825,143847,1.5,1.0,"If you want an easy A this is the class to take.  She let's use notes on the Mid-term or you can simply just not show up and she'll let you take it home.  She also has take home test all the time, even the final.  You can miss a month and still get an A in the class!  Other than that she'll alright!"
826,143847,5.0,2.0,The review below says it all. Crawford is helpful and her classes are full of work and information but she makes them fun.
827,143847,4.0,2.0,"What is there not to love about Crawford&#63;  If you're a creative person, you will love her assignments.  She allows you to have fun with the work, while learning a ton of stuff!"
828,143847,4.0,3.0,No Comments
829,2060773,5.0,3.0,"Professor Oyuela-Kowalski is a gem. Her teaching style is like no other, she is genuinely kind and a true inspiration. I took her PSY187 class thinking I knew what I wanted out of life, only to realize that there is an infinite of possibilities. I interviewed professionals, spruced up my resume, and developed such a wonderful relationship that we continue to keep in touch. I highly recommend taking any of her courses."
830,2060773,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I have had. She has a great sense of humor and is very understanding of personal issues. A project and paper were due the same weekend of the Kaplan and she gave us an extension so the nursing students could focus on the Kaplan. She gives a fair amount of homework but she allows you to make it your own which makes it fun.
831,2060773,5.0,1.0,"She is nice and willing to help you with anything. You have a problem with anything she is your go-to person. I learned so much in her class. She might be considered a tough grader, but as long as you do your work, you should pass her classes. I highly recommend taking her classes."
832,2036205,5.0,4.0,Very kind! She makes class very interesting and relatable to our daily lives. I took her Religion and Marriage Class in World Religions. I enjoyed it and learned a lot. Thank you Professor for your hard work in making everyone engaged and also being very understanding especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. I looked forward to your lectures.
833,2036205,5.0,2.0,"Frykenberg is a cool professor, in class she just lecture &amp; expects you to participate when asked. Every other week we had quizzes based on the articles or text she had us to read. Overall the class was easy &amp; would recommend"
834,2036205,1.0,4.0,"Such a headache and so extra. Her grading scale is ridiculous need a 95% for an A and if you get 90% it would be counted as a B+. Took upper division so we had to write an essay which was fine however, before you turn in the actual essay need to write a summary of what your subject matter is and why you chose it along with an annoted bibliography."
835,2036205,4.0,4.0,"One of my favorite teachers. She is defiantly very challenging and some assignments are hard but if you participate, do the readings and show up you will do well. The material is very interesting if you involve yourself"
836,2036205,1.0,3.0,I disliked this class so much. i thought it would be interesting but it was boring and the class grade was based by few things. I would not take this professor again. If you can avoid Frykenberg then do so
837,2036205,4.5,4.0,"Very passionate. The class is very discussion-focused, so get ready to speak because participation matters a lot.  The class seems like it would be easy to pass due to the casual dialogue, but don't be fooled: her tests are very difficult and you will need to study hard to effectively prepare for them."
838,649725,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Levy was extremely helpful throughout my semester on campus. She always stayed after class to review questions with us. Whenever I was uncertain about any questions or theories, she would clarify it in a way I could really understand well. I appreciate her funny sense of humor during the lectures. Thank you so much Dr. Levy for all the support."
839,649725,5.0,4.0,I love her stories.  She is a great professor that cares for your education.  Loved the class.  I'd take it again.
840,649725,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Levy is worth every minute of the wait!  Great Prof but hard.  Not a cake walk by any means. You will need to study like no other because Psych is no joke.  The questions, the meds and just overall experience is different from all else but a great part of the journey!  "
841,649725,5.0,4.0,Dr Levy is the perfect psych teacher! Dont go into her class thinking it will be a cake walk ! I used her ppts and the book and ended up with a great grade but I had to work for it ! Her tests correlate greatly to her lectures. Shes an awesome clinical teacher and keeps you entertained in class ! Very funny woman ! 
842,649725,5.0,4.0,"Professor Levy always stayed after class to pass back tests and review wrong answers. Very funny woman; kept class extremely entertaining. It was challenging, but Professor Levy made it fun!"
843,649725,5.0,4.0,"Hands down one of the best teachers at MSMC. I nearly dropped out of the program (despite a great GPA) because I literally HATE the ADN program & the awful teachers MSMC employs, until this class. Dr Levy is hilarious, & very knowledgeable. She always gave clear examples & was always around for questions & concerns. Memorize the reader!"
844,649725,3.0,4.0,"Wonderful instructor! Her tests and quizzes (especially in the beginning) can be a little out there. Really understand the concepts! (Reader for the quizzes, textbook for the tests.) But she had us laughing and interested for the whole evening class, which was really nice!"
845,649725,1.5,5.0,Let me start by saying I passed. The test questions are the worst I have ever seen. Half the class didnâ??t pass her first two test and not one question was given back. You will have two test and a final. Quizzes in-between the test. Use slides for the quizzes and final and text for the test and final.
846,649725,4.5,4.0,Dr.Levy is well prepared and has the ability to make dull stuff interesting and funny.She's one of the best teachers I've had in the MSMC nursing program
847,649725,2.5,5.0,"Come's across as really cool but if you actually listen to what she's saying, she's actually kind of rigid. Also you have to buy her manual in order to get the powerpoints, syllabus, and assignments which is not cool. She also does not explain the answers to the questions on the test. Not a fan of her teaching style."
848,649725,5.0,4.0,Dr. Levy was so AWESOME (BuSpar!!!). She is by far the best instructor I've had at MSMC. Her lecture is always &quot;to the point&quot; and always funny and interesting.
849,649725,4.5,2.0,"great person.  sometimes material was a little ambiguous, but overall, great teacher.  she's personable and approachable, not to mention the fact that she makes the subject matter fun and yielded curiosity.  too bad more msmc professors don't care and are competent as dr. levy."
850,649725,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Levy was our Mental Health Nursing instructor.  While she is very smart and gives good lectures, her teaching plan is exactly the same as what she teaches at Glendale.  This would be fine, but we use a different book than they do and because our semester is split differently, you end up with days with 2 and 3 tests in a row. Not great, but ok"
851,1917462,5.0,2.0,He is very understating! One of my fav Professors
852,1917462,3.0,1.0,"I honestly think hes not fit to teach, he is unorganized and he has favoritism. I dont recommend taking him at all."
853,1917462,5.0,1.0,"One of my favorite professors on campus. He is very helpful, if you ever need help with anything he is always there for you. Very easy class, there are a few essays and quizzes but he goes over the essays with you before you turn in the final draft so you have 2 chances to fix it. He actually cares about his students I would definitely recommend!"
854,1917462,4.0,2.0,He is super chill especially when it comes to grading. He gives you chance to turn in stuff late. He gives conferences when giving you an essay so he goes one on one over your mistakes. 
855,1782299,5.0,1.0,Last and final edu seminar class! :( very overwhelming itinerary for future teachers but it is finally over!She's amazing.
856,1782299,5.0,1.0,"Very easy class!! Attendance is mandatory. But overall, it is fun to take."
857,1782299,4.5,2.0,Sr. Kieran is very nice and helpful. She is a very tough grader when it comes to writing BUT this is to help you with teacher state exams such as the CBEST and CSET.
858,2118181,1.0,5.0,"Never got a C in English before, she's super harsh. She could probably ask you to write how you're feeling and she'll literally give an F. That's how bad it is. Only take if it's your last option. All I can say is try your best and do all your work if you at least want a C. Good luck."
859,2118181,5.0,4.0,"Professor Glick is honestly the most amazing professor I've ever had. This is my second time taking one of her courses, and each time it has been my favorite class. I've learned so much from this class, and it has made me a significantly better writer. She makes learning fun, and focuses on things that matter. I am genuinely sad this class is over."
860,2118181,3.0,4.0,be prepared to do essays lots of them
861,1337895,1.0,4.0,This professor is so pretentious. She's unorganized and confusing. I literally did not get one assignment graded. I feel that she is so busy throwing around big words trying to impress us that she forgets to teach. I feel that she is judgemental I feel that she is too clinical with a prejudice against behavioral health.
862,1337895,1.0,5.0,Bull-rushed lectures with no time for questions. Our class had everything post-poned until the 4th week due to professor not uploading quizzes because she uses her own personal site instead of the school site. Essentially halfway through this class with nothing graded and everything due last minute. It's been a real nightmare.
863,1337895,4.0,5.0,Awesome professor.  Very knowledgeable.  Class lectures are fast and her tests are super hard.  Be ready its one of the toughest classes.  
864,1337895,5.0,4.0,"Professor Smith is literally the best teacher in the ADN program !  She is so motivating and makes you want to work harder than hard! You have to definitely study a lot in regards to her test, but if you study and put in the work you will have an awesome time and learn a lot ! Get ready to put everything you learned in med surg into use! "
865,1337895,5.0,4.0,"Professor Smith is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met, she is very knowledgeable about the material and helpful in explaining it if you have trouble.  Its only an 8 week class so fasten your seat belt because she moves very fast and there is a ton of reading.  he tests are not easy but she is very fair.  Thanks for a great semester"
866,1337895,5.0,4.0,"Great professor with lots of real-world knowledge about trauma/ER/ICU situations. Literally, Smith, Dr Levy, and Dr Bruning are the ONLY professors in the ADN department that are worth taking, prepare for the worst with everyone else!!!"
867,2279978,1.0,3.0,Why is he still even a teacher ! Horrible !!! 
868,2279978,5.0,4.0,"I have nothing but good things to say about Professor LaChance. He cares about his students and it shows, even if he's a little tough on you at times. I really learned a LOT in Med Surg II. I appreciate all of his efforts."
869,125493,5.0,4.0,"She isn't an easy professor, but always incredibly helpful if you apply yourself. Very interested in the subject and always encouraged class-wide conversations. Gives essay only exams, but they're easy if you do your work and actually attend class."
870,125493,5.0,5.0,Dr Dean is a GREAT teacher who actually TEACHES unlike most teachers at MSMC. She wants you to learn so she challenges you with difficult work. If you don't get it just go to her office hours! I would really recommend her to anyone who isn't afraid of working hard! If you want an E.Z A do not take her! If you wanna learn definitely take her class!
871,125493,4.0,5.0,"she is completely different from her stats class in social psych. her tests and work are equally hard but she challenges you so that you can understand what you learn. she is a good teacher, but you have to study. you must read. hard teacher but worth it."
872,125493,5.0,4.0,"To all you Mount alums:  As a former student Dr. Dean is one of the professors at the Mount that will challenge you to do your best work.  She is not difficult, but demanding and that is what leads to success in the real world.    Go ahead, challenge yourself."
873,125493,5.0,4.0,No Comments
874,125493,1.0,5.0,"The material she teaches is wrong and out of date. Since she doesn't know the material, she only offers essay exams and then grades on a ridiculous curve."
875,125493,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Dean is a great teacher. she's very helpful and clear in lectures and projects. she's tough but worth taking because i got a lot out of her class. for those of you who think she's hard, you just have to try harder in her classes. i think she's one of the best teachers here at the mount."
876,125493,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Dean is a bad teacher. She is very unclear and nothing she lectures about is on her tests. If your opinion is not hers she makes you feel stupid.  Studying wont help because no one knows what she is looking for or how she grades, since work is returned late."
877,125493,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Dean is not hard at all! She teaches very well and from my experiences with her, I have learned a lot! To people that think she's hard, maybe you should study more and pay attention!"
878,125493,5.0,4.0,Very helpful and offered extra assistance when it was needed. For people who think she is too hard: It's college! Did you think you could just skate by&#63;
879,125493,3.5,5.0,The class is hard and I have to take it again which sucks but i'm going to take her agian because she really wanted to help.....she met with me after class like every time.
880,125493,3.0,4.0,"She's Hard, Yes, but if you are not prepared to be responsible for your work, don't bother with her.  she's one of the few at MSMC who don't deal well with the lazy or with those who insist on a lot of proverbial hand-holding"
881,125493,1.0,5.0,WATCH OUT! I suggest not to take her.
882,125493,1.0,5.0,She's very direspectful and makes students feel insuficient.  As pysch. professor she should find ways in making her class successful.  Instead she makes her students insecure about the material being taught as well as the ability to ask questions.
883,125493,1.0,5.0,She is very unclear and only has her interest in mind.Her teaching styles are ancient and dont relate.Taking this course makes me want to change my major.When you ask her a question and shes wrong she still tries to validate hows shes right.WE NEED CHANGE
884,125493,1.0,5.0,"Dr.Dean is a very insensitive professor. If you ask too many questions, she acts as if she is irritated by your uncertainty. She shows EXTREME favortism and makes it apparent who she dislikes. WE NEED MORE STATS. TEACHERS BESIDES HER!!!"
885,125493,1.5,5.0,"NEEDS THERAPY FOR PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. SMILES ON THE OUTSIDE, AND A STICK-IT-TO YOU ATTITUDE ON THE INSIDE. THIS SCHOOL NEEDS MORE STATS TEACHERS !"
886,125493,2.0,5.0,"Makes the course harder and more difficult than it should be.  Failure rate high, students have to keep taking class over.  Not sensitive to students problems or that students have other responsibilities"
887,125493,1.5,5.0,She is so hard and she gives you too much work!!!!!!!
888,1735223,1.0,5.0,"Okay. just stay away from this lady if possible,  but if you are part of this program, you can't really avoid her. This is my second degree, so I have met many professors but by far THE. WORST. I wish i could give 0 instead of 1. well good luck. "
889,1735223,1.0,5.0,Beware.She tells you to read before class but it's useless because her exams are based on her lectures.Approachable but she does not answer questions and instead refers you to the syllabus or the book. You spend most of the time reflecting endlessly.Assignments are busy work.Does not know how teach. Makes the subject matter boring.Worst teacher.
890,1735223,1.0,5.0,There is a lot of busy work. Some of her exercises may be useful but she makes you reflect on it to death. She lectures directly from the book & then expects you to read as well. If not she will get angry & stop lecturing forcing the class to participate in unhelpful group work. Also be warned that asking her questions she will respond rudely.
891,1034808,1.0,5.0,"probably the worse professor in the world. his essays make no sense, he makes you read 3 books at the same time. at least 20 people dropped after the first day. would never tell anyone to take his class. LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN. he wont tell you how to fix your grade, he will just tell you that you are failing and doesnt use on canvas"
892,1034808,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN!! If you are taking him for a GE course please get out while you can. He There was good discussion, but as far as papers and quizzes, you do not want to have him."
893,1034808,1.0,5.0,HE is the worst. Gives too much readings and pop quizzes. Which won't tell you what's the vocab he'll tell you that's on there. Never seen a worse professor than he is. Unnecessary. Just no.
894,1034808,2.0,4.0,Unnecessarily difficult class for a pre-requisite.
895,1034808,3.0,5.0,This professor assigns a lot of reading each night. Very tough grader. Quiz at least once a week. I wouldn't recommend taking his class.
896,1034808,3.0,4.0,He's a very tough grader when it comes to essays. Grammar is a big thing for him. There is a lot of work to be done for him. Get prepared to read a lot. There are multiple readings every night. I wouldn't take his class again. 
897,1034808,3.0,4.0,Reading is a big thing in his class. This semester he introduced point loss for grammar errors in papers unless you meet with him or one of the tutors and they sign off on your paper.
898,1034808,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE this professor.. he is SO interesting as a person. VERY SWEET man.! you must appreciate his way of teaching & DO NOT question the novels he throws at u. they're used for a REASON, u don't have to LIKE it. APPRECIATE IT."
899,1034808,5.0,3.0,"Professor Perez gives a lot of work but he's very helpful and understanding. If you ask him for more time to write an essay and give him a reason, he will say yes. He is the most helpful staff at the Mount! Plus, he's pretty cool."
900,1034808,5.0,2.0,"All his instructions are clear and straightforward. He does give a lot of readings but he will always discuss every detail of the reading before taking a quiz on it. If you don't read, all you really have to do is listen to what he says in class. You will learn a lot with him, which is the whole point of being in college. I really recommend him."
901,1034808,5.0,2.0,"Due to some comments about Perez, many may be skeptical about taking his class. Honestly, his class is very straightforward. He is a professional teacher who cares about his students and takes time to meet with them, even if he is in a meeting with another individual. He will not quiz or test you on materials that you haven't talked about in class."
902,1034808,5.0,5.0,he is a harsh grader for essays which he happens to give a lot of but he is always available  for help & gives extra credit for stopping by office hours. the high amounts of reading assignments and pop quizes makes you do all the assigned work and study all the time. he's harsh but for good intentions.
903,1034808,3.5,4.0,"I enjoyed his introspection and how he related to characters or stories making them more accessible to even, the average student (me). He grades hard but will work with you on what you need to do to improve. Sometimes he gives a lot of homework but not ridiculous amounts to get finished in a given time."
904,1034808,4.0,3.0,he isnt that hard. you just have to keep up with your reading and work. Sometimes the quizzes and the essays are a lil bit hard but i you dont understnd just go and talk to him he will really help you.
905,1034808,5.0,1.0,"Mr.Perez is beyond intelligent; a true teacher in a world of people punching the clock. I learned. This teacher has actually inspired me to get my novel published.  I JUST closed the deal with Random House yesterday! i wouldnt have even tried if it wasnt for his knowledge, and inpsiring, challenging classes and guidance. Take his class and be ready"
906,1034808,5.0,4.0,"While it's true that his class was intense in the amount of reading and assigned papers, he is very understanding and allows for at least one late paper and make-up tests. I would gladly take any class taught by him in the future if he were to teach an upper division class.  Just be prepared to write and don't be intimidated."
907,1034808,1.5,5.0,I had this professor this semester and i hated every class meeting. I would not want him as a teacher ever again.
908,1034808,1.0,5.0,"Mr. Perez is the worst professor I have ever come across. He doesn't have feelings when it comes to his students' health, he is an absolute MONSTER. AVOID!!!! He will make you throw up every day. One time he wore a pink shirt and a white blazer to class, he thought he was in Miami Vice. He thinks that you are only taking his class. to be cont."
909,1034808,1.5,5.0,He was a substitute teacher for a month and only a month. He expected us to read TWO novels and write FOUR essays. The final essay was TEN pages long and he quizzed us every day if not every other class meeting on material we had to read. VERY critical in his essays and his lectures are all over the place. AVOID this teacher at all costs!!!
910,457280,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Rigone, is one of the best professor's I have ever had. She truly makes a difference when you don't understand a topic. I went into accounting not knowing anything and I came out of her course knowing exactly what my emphasis will be (accounting). She makes the process fun and it's easy to get an accounting thrill. Thank you Prof Rigone!"
911,457280,1.0,5.0,"Horrible Teacher, Very Rude"
912,457280,1.0,5.0,"Don't even think about yawning, glancing at the clock, twirling your hair, or twitching your leg because this will cause her to go in to one of her hysterical frenzy episodes where she feels the need to stop class and point out/make fun of what you are doing. Do not ask questions in class - because she will just make you feel ignorant."
913,457280,5.0,5.0,"One of the best professors at the mount. She is also one of the hardest. Her class is very challenging and requires a lot of hard work and dedication. However, it's all worth it. Thanks to her there are a few students working at the big 4 accounting firms and very successful. She's the best accounting professsor ever. Tons of love for Prof. Rigone"
914,457280,4.5,5.0,I love Professor Rigone! Her teaching method is very understandable. Although it is fast paced it is also to our benefit. She is a hard teacher but that is only for us to understand and love accounting as much as she does. She is very funny and believe me she will make you laugh a lot throughout the semester.
915,457280,4.0,5.0,"I love her approach to teaching! She uses a variety of teaching methods to determine the best way we can learn. She will not give you an A unless you truly deserve it. Be prepared to read every night. If you have little to no interest in learning accounting, then don't take her."
916,457280,5.0,1.0,"Yes, classes are fast paced... but whether you see that as a positive or negative is completely up to the student.  Prof. Rigone works her students hard (don't expect an easy A in her class) - but that is all to our benefit, believe it or not.  Nevertheless, Prof. Rigone is a wonderful professor and I owe much of my love for accounting to her."
917,457280,1.5,4.0,"Class was not enjoyable. Very fast paced class, The lectures were very fast and when you ask questions if you don't understand right away she gets upset when she didn't explain it clearly."
918,457280,1.0,5.0,"Hard grader! I hate her style of teaching, she gets mad if you don't know an answer to a question."
919,457280,5.0,1.0,"Excellent teacher. Absolutely love her.  Classes are fast-paced, engaging, and she makes everything understandable.  Her enthusiasm for accounting will surely rub off on you. Knows the subject matter very well and interjects a bit of humor into her lectures."
920,457280,4.5,2.0,No Comments
921,457280,5.0,5.0,Excellent teacher!! Goes over and beyond the expectatios of the students. Be prepared to work hard! One of the best teachers at the Mount.
922,1972806,3.5,3.0,"Doesn't really know what he is doing, but his class is not too bad. If you memorize the pre labs and post labs you should be fine."
923,1972806,1.0,4.0,His class is not super hard but the lack of helpfulness and clarity is what causes misunderstandings. He does not reply to emails. He does not have office hours. He was late most of the time.   Would not take again. 
924,1022539,5.0,3.0,"Such an amazing professor. You will not regret taking her. She is very understanding and caring. She helped me a lot with my writing, she also knows that we have other classes to worry about. She exposed me to literature that was so beautiful. She always went over the reading and discussions. Open my eyes to a lot of things i wasnt aware of."
925,1022539,5.0,2.0,"Professor Halperin is the nicest, most understanding professor ever. She grades by very few assignments/projects and is an easy grader. I thought I would fail because I'm not the best at public speaking, but I got an A. She understands that you have other classes, personal issues, stress, anxiety, etc. so will extend due dates &amp; go easy on you."
926,1022539,5.0,1.0,"The best and nicest teacher you'll ever have! She wants you to be comfortable, and yourself not forcing to do anything you are uncomfortable with. If you ever have any questions or concerns, she answers fast and gives help if needed. If you have an option, taker her"
927,1022539,5.0,2.0,"Professor Halperin was one of the sweetest and most understanding professors I've ever had. She made presenting so comfortable for someone who has anxiety like me and is willing to help you out when you get stuck. I absolutely loved her. Take her class, you won't regret it!!"
928,1022539,5.0,2.0,She is so nice! She is super understanding of everyone. She does not expect everyone to be the best speaker from the start. It was honestly a very easy class. I think the only hard part was coming up with a topic or simply making sure you got all the parts to your speech. She will help you during your speech if you struggle.
929,1022539,5.0,2.0,"I love her ! She's the most understanding professor at the Mount, as she understands if you have other classes that you are prioritizing and will allow you to do / redo your speech at a later time. As long as you follow her outlines and what she says, you should be fine in the class."
930,1022539,5.0,1.0,"Professor Halperin is one of the sweetest professors on campus. She definitely cares about the well-being of her students and gives great feedback when you talk to her. If there's any confusion you have, make sure to ask her and she'll more than happy to help. Just show up to class and do all your speeches and you'll have an A."
931,1022539,5.0,2.0,"She is on of the nicest professors you will ever meet. When doing the outline for your speeches, she will make sure everything looks good and as long as you deliver it well when you present then you will get an easy A. She is also very understandable if you are not able to do a speech the day you signed up for and will happily change it."
932,1022539,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Halperin is too pure for this world! Seriously, she is a sweetheart and an angel. Take her class, do the work, pass, and have FUN! :)"
933,1022539,5.0,1.0,10/10 recommend. super sweet and super easy. sometimes she talks too much but you can just put on your earphones and listen to music. you can't really ask for a better professor
934,1022539,5.0,1.0,"Professor Halperin was the sweetest! As long as you stay on top of putting together your speech outlines, practicing them several times, and presenting them to the best of your ability, this class will be such a breeze. Halperin is so caring and understanding about all of her students."
935,1022539,5.0,1.0,She is probably the easiest and friendliest Speech Professor at the Mount I wouldn't recommend anyone else.
936,1022539,5.0,1.0,Take her for SPEECH. Easiest class ever.
937,1022539,5.0,2.0,"Dara is the sweetest, she's so understanding and extremely helpful to all her students. Her class is a breeze. Show up, learn your speech, practice your speech, and then do your speech. That's it! You do that about 4/5 times out the semester then your DONE. Attendance is the only real thing that can kill your grade so be sure to come to class!"
938,1022539,5.0,2.0,She was very easy and very sweet and caring. Easy to talk to.
939,1022539,5.0,2.0,"TAKE HER FOR SPEECH! Prof Halperin is the sweetest lady ever! She truly does understand if you're struggling in other classes and need additional time to present. At the beginning of the semester she told us ""My class should not be giving you a hard time and if it is than thats an issue."" LOVE HER! She's the best!"
940,1022539,5.0,1.0,"Dara Halperin is an AMAZING professor. She grades you based on yourself, not based on others which is really great. Always ask for her opinions on your speeches because she is always willing to help make your speech better. This was a great way to be introduced to public speaking."
941,1022539,5.0,1.0,Professor Halperin was an inspiring and amazing teacher who is very helpful and gives good feedback in order to pass the class with an A. I really recommend you take her if you are nervous about taking speech because she will help you pass. 
942,1022539,5.0,1.0,"Professor Halperin gets people.  She really understands that people are people.  She also understands that most people on this earth are terrified of going up in front of people to talk to them.  You actually see improvement in yourself because she grades you based on yourself.  Her class is a delight, even if it is at 8:00 A.M."
943,1022539,4.5,1.0,"Halperin's the best. If you do your work and send her your outlines beforehand, she will save you some points on speeches. She's also hilarious and always caring about students. If you have to take speech, Halperin is the way to go. "
944,1022539,3.5,1.0,"Professor Halperin is so sweet.  She is super nice, and she understands what it is like to be giving a speech for the first time.  She grades you based on yourself, so you actually do see improvement in yourself."
945,1022539,5.0,2.0,Easy class with her! Very sweet and willing to help you in all of your speeches (if you take Speech) She likes to give A's and B's so it'll be hard to fail the class.
946,1022539,5.0,1.0,Love her.  Totally understanding and will go out of her way to help you.  She really cares about her student and is one of the sweetest ladies I've ever met.  She's such a saint.  She teaches well too.  
947,1022539,5.0,2.0,Super sweet & super hilarious! She made the class fun and definitely is willing to help you improve. 
948,1022539,5.0,2.0,Dara is such an amazingly sweet professor. She's very understanding and helpful. I would totally take her again and I highly recommend her as a speech professor.
949,1022539,5.0,2.0,"Prof Halperin is an amazing professor! While most people were scared and dreading this course, she made us feel at ease. She wants everyone to succeed and pass with an A or a B. As long as you show improvement and try your best, you will do very well in the course."
950,1022539,5.0,1.0,"Great class! I liked this class because it was such an easy-going, non-stress class compared to my other classes. She's an excellent professor!"
951,1022539,5.0,1.0,AWESOME
952,1022539,5.0,1.0,"Excellent professor.  I did not have much an interest in giving speeches prior to taking this course.  However, this professor made the class interesting and showed that she really enjoyed teaching.  As long as you show up for class and put in the effort you will definitely pass this course as well as enjoy it."
953,1022539,5.0,1.0,"One of the most amazing Professors at the Mount! She knows what teaching is about! She is so smart, thoughtful, helpful and cares! She's the best!"
954,1022539,5.0,1.0,"She's a fantastic professor. Really kind and understanding, willing to help if you're willing to ask. She's a fun professor and she really enjoys teaching speech."
955,1022539,5.0,1.0,GREAT TEACHER!!! Had her for both English 1A and Speech. Extremely fun teacher! Easy A as well if you know how to deliver your speeches and read the required material.
956,1022539,5.0,2.0,"awesome professor, very helpful! will work with you at any circumstance."
957,1022539,5.0,3.0,"Professor Halperin is one of the best professors at Mount St. Mary's. She is understanding, fun and interesting. This is my second time taking her and I hope they give her more classes so I can take her again."
958,1022539,5.0,2.0,"Very good teacher, really understandable and has fun assignments."
959,1022539,4.0,1.0,Very easy class. Prof. Halperin makes you feel comfortable to give  speeches in front of the class
960,1022539,4.0,3.0,Great Professor. Fun to talk to. Hip and down to earth. Should take speech class.
961,1022539,5.0,1.0,"Attend class EVERYDAY ON TIME, read the chapters for the quizzes (may need to memorize key topics/definitions), and practice those speeches (only four in a semester) and you'll do just fine. She's always willin to help and easy to talk  to."
962,2695760,1.0,5.0,"beginning of this class was great always interesting and fun. It wasn't till later on in the semester where I dreaded going to class. Although she preaches mental health, she sure does make you stressed out. Within the course of the last 2 weeks we had a presentation, powerpoint, essay, research paper, evaluations, and final. I suggest to stay away"
963,2079313,4.0,4.0,"Prof Khankan is very smart and passionate about all types of bioscience. It's true, the material is harder than other anatomy classes at other schools. She won't just ask &quot;point out the _______&quot;. She'll ask &quot;What muscle are you using when you _____&quot;. Lectures are boring, but labs are great. Getting an A is not impossible, but it's very difficult."
964,2079313,5.0,4.0,"It was a pleasure to take anatomy with Rana at UCLA Extension. I found her lectures interesting and that has to tell you something because let's be honest, who finds anatomy interesting?! she is professional yet down to earth. Loved the energy she puts in teaching. This class is what you make out of it. The final was approximately 140 questions."
965,2079313,3.0,3.0,"boring, just reads off the slides, very little real world relevance, just memorize and regurgitate, seems like that's what anatomy is about from this class."
966,2079313,5.0,4.0,"Rana is a phenomenal teacher. Really cares about her students' wellbeings. 7 weekly quizzes; easy if you study the lecture notes. 1 midterm, 1 final, 2 lab practicals. PAY ATTENTION IN LAB, GET HANDS ON AND ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. Textbook was extremely vital during this course. One of my favorite classes overall--highly recommend."
967,2079313,5.0,3.0,"Professor Khankan is AMAZING!!! I actually took anatomy with her at LAVC, and I loved her. It took me three times to pass anatomy, and I finally did it with her. She's very inspiring, and does not let you give up. I'm forever grateful for pushing me to work hard. Thank you professor!!!!!!!!!!!!  -L.M."
968,2079313,2.0,5.0,Great teacher with a great personality. Weekly quizzes were easy. Midterms were extremely difficult because you would literally have to know word for word everything from the lab book. Be ready to review each set of chapters after each class.
969,2079313,4.0,3.0,"Dr. K is an awesome professor. She understands that Anatomy Lab can be a drag, and does everything in her power to make it informative and interesting. Rana   is a really thorough professor who provides visuals and lectures to help you succeed . She does hold her students up to a high standard with challenging tests, but with effort they are doable"
970,2079313,2.5,4.0,"Tests are hard, and are straight from the book. She has a UCLA education, so she holds you to the same standards. A lot of the learning is done on your own, because there is not enough time in class."
971,2079313,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Rana is awesome. She understands how tired anatomy students can be because she was one, once. She knows your struggle. She is very down to earth and funny. However, she also wants you to be independent and strong. She wants you to work for her class. Study hard. There will be a quiz every week. Help comes if you ask for it, directly."
972,2079313,3.0,3.0,"She is pretty awesome. It was her first time teaching; she was not very helpful in the beginning. Over time, it changed. Spoiler alert: She has a quiz every week. They really do help you, especially because lab is a lot of memorizing. However, DON'T take the 3:00-6:00. class right after Dr. Liu's lecture. I drove myself mad. Test days were hell."
973,1213010,5.0,2.0,"She was an excellent instructor! She is very helpful in clinicals; She has high expectations; however, she only desires to bring out the best in her students. She is humorous and makes the subject matter more interesting."
974,1213010,3.5,2.0,"Definitely had some mood swings during clinicals. She was VERY helpful if you asked pointed questions. She expects confidence, preparedness, and a good attitude. Her fundamentals class was pretty easy. Take good notes during lecture and you'll do well. Don't cheat or you'll ruin class and clinicals for EVERYONE."
975,1213010,4.0,2.0,"As a clinical teacher she was very bipolar.  Some days she would be in a chipper mood and others you wish you could hide from her. She also showed favoritism. Just come to clinical, do the work and seem interested and you'll do fine. She doesn't grade hard if you so do."
976,1213010,4.5,2.0,One of the nicest clinical instructors. Shes very helpful and very understanding. She likes to joke around a lot so it's a very relaxing which is great.
977,725588,2.5,1.0,waist of my time. she needs to learn how to teach... very inapproachable!
978,725588,5.0,3.0,She's super cool.
979,725588,5.0,1.0,"she is so inspirational and she is very nice, easy SPR class and she likes to talk a lot. no textbook needed and well she is the kind of teacher u could just go up and say hi."
980,1602132,3.0,2.0,"The class was not too difficult, it depends how well you do on NCLEX style tests. I always studied for tests using the book. The professor is really funny and nice, which made class enjoyable. She went off topic a lot. Sometimes I felt like lecture was pointless. Get a tutor just in case."
981,1602132,4.0,2.0,She is very enthusiastic and warm. Can be unbending on certain issues but is very fair. Cares for her students on a personal level too. She can get a little scatter-brained at times too. she tries to make class fun and sometimes tells embarrassing stories. lecture was pointless at times tho. Overall she is a good teacher
982,1251926,1.5,1.0,"EXTEMELY EASY CLASS! 3 TESTS (PRACTICAL STYLE). NEVER PAID ATTENTION, and still PASSED WITH an A. HIS LECTURES DO NOT HELP FOR THE TESTS. ask what chps will be on the test and study them in the book. look at models in class, he uses them on the tests. as long as your answer is close to the CORRECT answer, he will give you the points"
983,1251926,3.0,3.0,"He also teaches Anatomy (Physci XL13) at UCLA Extension. He practically reads materials right off of the textbook. At first, it seems like he is covering EVERYTHING in the book but pay attention to what he says during lecture. Things that he comments on WILL BE ON THE EXAM. Exam isn't too hard but the challenge is that there is A LOT TO MEMORIZE!"
984,1251926,2.0,5.0,"Extremely HARD. Again, not surprising if you are a nursing major. TIPS: sit in the front because he speaks very very low; TAKE NOTES TAKE NOTES TAKE NOTES; communicate with him and maybe he'll reason with you; AND SHOW UP TO CLASS!!"
985,1602135,3.0,2.0,"This class was very tiring because she was very repetitive about the content. I wouldn't take this class in general. She was a nice and caring professor, but I don't think she was well prepared to teach this class."
986,1602135,1.0,5.0,"Teachers are supposed to be very supportive, but if you don't know something or if you answer a question differently from how she wants you to, she makes you feel really stupid. Though she encourages her class to be interactive during lectures, the class is afraid to participate because of how she reacts to our answers. She's also very big-headed."
987,1602135,5.0,2.0,"Amazing! She is really clear about what she expects. Gives tons of comments on assignments so you can correct your mistakes and is very understanding. Tips: don't print assignments at the hospital, chart ON TIME, relate to your patients and their parents, look for learning opportunities.Time management is crucial at CHLA. I'll miss her!"
988,1251927,5.0,3.0,"Dr.Senter is awesome!! He sometimes tends to drift off topic BUT, when it comes to the nitty gritty he will test you like you're suppose to be tested and provides power points,  test practice manuals, and homework examples. I truly enjoyed his class."
989,1251927,2.0,5.0,"he's a very nice guy and curves grades very generously. he's also very smart and he knows his stuff.. as far as understanding the concepts, it's very difficult. taking notes and attending class is not good enough. get a tutor or study vigorously on your own or with a group. i was horrible at it but i managed to get a C+"
990,1251927,2.0,4.0,"You can tell he really knows his stuff, but he's not very good at teaching.  If you go into his office hours, he'll explain things a lot better!  Overall though, I wouldn't recommend taking him!"
991,1251927,2.5,5.0,"Nice guy and reasonable with his students. He is very generous with curving grades. However, I had to learn the concepts independently. I did not understand what he was teaching and I recommend tutoring and/or study groups-- that is the only reason why I passed the class with a C+"
992,2259552,1.0,3.0,"There were so few assignments given in the class that if you didn't amaze her with every single one, your GPA is now permanently damaged. She also grades against criteria not listed on the rubric. So she then becomes quite difficult to placate."
993,2259552,4.0,4.0,"So far Ive taken a couple of classes with her and it is not hard to pass her class. She is not an easy grader when it comes to essays so give yourself time but she grades class assignments fairly easy. She breaks down the readings in class so dont worry if theyre hard to understand(they will be.) Last piece of advice, DO NOT SKIP CLASS!"
994,2259552,2.0,4.0,A LOT of reading in this class. The essays required after each novel are fairly easy but she is a tough grader and if you don't agree with her ideas she marks you down. Very unfair. She also says she's accessible outside of class but she will not respond for several days. Books are interesting but I do not recommend taking this class with her
995,1157760,5.0,2.0,"As another person stated, he is super helpful and gives a lot of extra info during lectures. His lectures are 3 hours long, but it's once a week, if you're busy it is totally worth it. Book isn't really necessary, but it is a good resource! Study off the slides. He puts a lot of chapters on his exams (which aren't many) he will either give 3 or 2"
996,1157760,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING professor! Probably one of my favorites! The people complaining about his class are the lazy students (if it wasn't that obvious already). He really knows his material super well from the top of his head and he is very helpful, if you ever have a question just ask and he will give you a thorough answer, also offers office hours."
997,1157760,1.5,5.0,"I would've been fine studying on my own if there weren't so many slides and chapters for an exam. First exam had about 10 chapters. Second exam had about 12 or more. Also, he missed several days of class before the second exam. The final was about 26 chapters, and focused on chapters 20 and on although we were told to review from the start."
998,1157760,4.5,1.0,Loved this class! Great at teaching Physio! Book is a waste of time. Know your slides and you will pass! Your grade will depend on how much you study your slides but if you put enough time (which is completely doable) you can and will get an A! Good luck mates! 
999,1157760,5.0,2.0,"Best of the best. Knows his stuff! The book wasn't helpful in this class, for me at least. Just listen to his lectures and know the slides! I got a B+ without that much trouble, but I got have gotten an A if I wasn't too lazy in the beginning. You guys can get an A in this class, just make sure to put effort from the start! "
1000,1157760,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! Really passionate about what he does. Involved in the medical field so he knows his material! Class is mostly based on slides, book wasn't really necessary, but it is a great help! Would definitely take again and am for second semester. "
1001,1157760,4.0,4.0,"I honestly loved this class, if I studied more I would have had an A-A. He talks a lot so printing out the slides and taking notes on them are helpful and probably the easiest way. 2 midterms a final and a research paper. Not too difficult. He's so smart it's ridiculous. He's very understanding and helpful. Take him!"
1002,1157760,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Dusick may be a little boring but he teaches very well. He's very straightforward and goes over as much as possible. He's prompt and never lets his students out early. All in all, he's an A+ teacher. I'm glad I took his class and got an A both semester! :)"
1003,1157760,5.0,2.0,"I had Dusick for both Anatomy and Physio this past year. He is an awesome teacher if you enjoy learning mostly on your own. All of his tests are based on the slides that he provides. Books aren't (in my opinion) necessary, although they do help around midterms and finals! All tests are multiply choice and pulled directly from the slides. Take him!"
1004,1157760,3.5,3.0,"Don't bother with the textbook. Just memorize everything on his slides and you'll be fine. Only refer to the textbook if something is not clear. Take advantage of the two midterms; the final was difficult. All in all, you should pass the class if you fully understood and read the slides."
1005,1157760,4.0,3.0,"Dusick was a good teacher. He stuffs a lot of info in at once and is not really thorough. If you learn well on your own you will be fine. He doesn't coddle his students, which shouldn't be the case when you are in college. All in all he is a good teacher. His tests are fair. Midterms are easier then the final."
1006,1157760,4.0,3.0,"Dusick is the middle ground between the other anatomy teachers at MSMC, and that's only based on likeability. His tests are absolutely straightforward. Study the slides after his lecture to retain more info. He's a bit monotone, too. Ask lots of questions, if you can. Don't bother trying to take notes; print out slides and write notes on that."
1007,1157760,5.0,2.0,"Basically in this class, you dont even have to take a laptop! Take your book and sit there && highlight the stuff he discusses and take some sidenotes.  The midterms are SUPER easy! Its either you know it or you dont he doesnt try and trick you.  GREAT PROFESSOR!! one of the few who KNOWS what he is talking about!"
1008,1157760,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Dusick is the best! Sometimes people complain about his lecture style-he does move pretty quickly. If you don't own a laptop, forget about taking hand written notes. Otherwise, USE the book and take advantage of your lab. Tests are straight forward, but know your details! He is a great professor, super smart, super nice and super cute, too."
1009,1157763,1.5,3.0,"This class was a time-filler. Classmates were either falling asleep or web surfing. The goal of the course was unclear. A paper is due soon, she has been out of town, nearly unable to reach. When she does respond, her tone is snippy.  If you have a family crisis, get someone to fill in for you or let us off the hook.  It's unfair to us as students."
1010,39560,4.5,4.0,great relevant class discussions.She made her research come alive and biology of Aging very interesting to all students!
1011,39560,4.0,3.0,Sister is helpful if you really use her as a resource. Not as scary and awful as most people say...
1012,39560,2.0,2.0,"Nice lady, but needs to retire"
1013,39560,2.0,2.0,No Comments
1014,39560,1.0,5.0,"Not very helpful, scary to talk to. She seems to favor MARC and students into research. I told I am aiming to be a cardioligist told me to be a teacher instead. It was too hard for a girl. so sad..."
1015,39560,1.5,3.0,"I was looking forward to this class but Bower started the class on topic then went off on tandems. There were no notes, previous tests were of no help, and her grading is whack! I honestly believe she favors MARC students and those she advises."

1018,2562700,1.0,3.0,If I can rate this woman lower than a 1 I would. She is HORRIBLE. She doesn't know how to teach. She is completely biased and has favoritism in her class. I have NO IDEA why shes teaching community/public health when she specializes in maternity. Shes a terrible instructor has a bad attitude and discourages students. 
1019,2562700,1.0,1.0,"Gotta hate this lady. She's pretty distracting when we're taking tests, and then if we make one small sounds she goes ballistic. Super annoying. Says she works in LnD, dunno what's she doing in community. She doesn't know anything about it. Terrible person."
1020,2562700,1.0,5.0,"Don't know why she's teaching a class she knows nothing about. Harsh grader. Only friendly to those with authority so too bad for students. It's black or white with her, no gray area."
1021,39563,5.0,3.0,Don't expect a good grade if you don't put in the work.
1022,39563,1.0,4.0,YouTube and ur textbook will be ur best friend because u cant count on stemp to teach u jack! Have a question? Ask your supp cause hell make u feel stupid. I have no idea why we pay thousands for THIS mediocrity. Id say to avoid this man at all costs but the selection of profs is so limited ur bound to have him at least for ochem. Good luck!
1023,39563,1.0,3.0,"He spends more time talking about his own life than teaching. when he does teach, he talks as if the students know what hes talking about when teaching a new idea. Its literally a self taught class. Best part is that he gives homeworks on mechanisms hes NEVER mentioned in class. You cannot get any homework done without attendin the supplemental"
1024,39563,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Stemp is a very cool dude but is not that great of a professor. He should be aware that his class is not the only course that students have on their plate and therefore should be reasonable when giving assignments. He also gets very off tangent talking about his life. Overall, it is a self-taught class."
1025,39563,3.5,5.0,Hardest class I took in college next to Advanced Calculus. Be ready to have no social life if you want an A!
1026,39563,5.0,5.0,"Take Dr. Stemp. Even though ochem is a hard class, he makes it understandable IF you attend class. His Exams are hard but he posts up practice exams so its not that bad. He is very caring and he really wants his students to pass. Hw are worth a lot of points so that dilutes your grades."
1027,39563,4.5,4.0,Take this class and fall in love....with ochem!
1028,39563,4.5,4.0,"This professor genuinely wants to help his students, I took organic chemistry with him in Fall 2012 and he is very clear about what he expects from you as a student. He gave HW to help with our course grades and was very helpful outside of class."
1029,39563,3.5,5.0,Took organic and biochem. Hes an amazing professor and has a genuine interest in students learning capability. His tests are HARD so STUDY! The material is not as easy as he makes it seem. USE THE BOOK
1030,39563,5.0,5.0,Study because exams are hard
1031,39563,5.0,4.0,gives interesting lectures and encourages independent critcal thinking.
1032,39563,5.0,4.0,Goes out of his way to help students; makes himself available; gives excellent and applicable lectures but exams are very challenging (you won't pass if you don't study!)
1033,39563,3.0,5.0,"He is a great teacher during class, but when it comes to the tests, he makes them impossible! He makes the material seem so easy in class and the tests are completely different. And he gets very moody when you ask him questions after class.."
1034,39563,5.0,4.0,study!
1035,39563,3.0,5.0,SUPER HARD in O-Chem and Bio-Chem

1042,39563,4.0,4.0,"Class was hard, but was lots of fun (sick huh&#63;) one word: STUDY"
1043,39563,4.5,4.0,Dr. Stemp is a GREAT teacher. Whoever wrote that from Che 6A needs to F- off and GO STUDY!
1044,39563,3.0,5.0,"Class is hard, need to read alot. However, he tends to prefer certain students and offers them more help."

1047,1421970,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Aloha is a really great, funny, beautiful teacher. She does a really great job at explaining the topic every meeting we have. I had her class online, she would make psychology so interesting and engaging for the class to enjoy. She would give us the opportunity to do extra credit to boost up our grade. I recommend 100% to take her class!"
1048,1421970,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Buenaventura was such a great professor. She was so hilarious in her lectures, but she made it interesting for everyone in the class. Be prepared to read, and she gives you the textbook online. She grades fairly. From the start, she gives you the criteria on what she looks for in the homework. She loves APA style. You have quizzes weekly."
1049,1421970,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Aloha is so kind and understanding! She was invested in what was going on in our lives and always made sure we were okay. She shares a lot about her life and I find her inspirational because of all she has experienced and gone through. She is an amazing professor! She does require camera on during Zoom, but her class is very doable."
1050,1421970,4.0,3.0,"Shes a great professor, I had her for psychology 1 and make sure to do the study guides for extra credit, the study guides must be based off the book. She gives 4 exams and will drop the one with the lowest score. Make sure you study for her exams ahead of time too. She also gives good feedback and makes the lectures fun."
1051,1421970,5.0,4.0,"She is amazing and I made really good friends with her. She is really chill, but her teaching style is really good!"
1052,1421970,3.0,4.0,"I love Dr. Buenaventura. She teaches amazing lectures and she is such a great and kind person. I really learned from her and she almost made me want to switch my major to psychology. However, her tests are hard. You MUST read the textbook and review the powerpoint on your own. What really helps is writing out the outlines, plus it is extra credit."
1053,1421970,5.0,4.0,"This professor is probably on my top 3 list of professors that I love. She gives lots of quizzes, but she prepares you for the future especially if you are a nursing student. She is amazing, she is beautiful, and SHE IS HILARIOUS! She makes class so interesting. She does interactive activities as well sometimes. Make sure you read before class!!"
1054,1421970,4.0,4.0,"Lectures are very engaging, fun, and never boring. Although she is a cool teacher, you don't really learn in the lectures. Exams were hard even if you studied, you have to actually know the material (which is why the book is needed for yourself) There were a couple of assignments, but she is an easy grader on that."
1055,1421970,3.0,4.0,"Very detailed with her powerpoints. Don't just know the material, you must understand the whole concept. She's funny and makes the class fun."
1056,1421970,3.5,4.0,She is amazing but she is a really hard grader. 
1057,1421970,5.0,4.0,"Dr.B is amazing. She really cares about her student. She is very organized; therefore, just keep track of the syllabus. Her exams can be difficult especially at the beginning because you do not know what exactly to study for. That should not be a problem because she is available if you need help. "
1058,1421970,4.0,4.0,She is an amazing professor! Period. I loved this class so much and I missed it. She makes the course interesting and that is why I'm taking a minor in Psychology. You have to work hard if you want to get an A. This is not an easy class but it's worth taking the class. Read the book and you'll do well on the quizzes. 
1059,1421970,4.5,3.0,Dr. B is amazing. I took her for all my psych classes at Doheny  and am so sad she does not teach upper division Psych classes. She explains the material well and makes the lecture easy to listen to instead of dry. She gives small quizzes every class usually about two questions based on what was talked about. They are easy if you pay attention . 
1060,1421970,5.0,5.0,"Take her class! Her classes are a lot of work, but she is such a cool teacher! She makes the topics interesting and is very funny. After each class, she quizzes you on 1 question that can be used as extra credit towards the quiz, which happens every 2 weeks. Read the book, because she quizzes on things in the book that are not in the lecture."
1061,1421970,5.0,4.0,"She is a difficult teacher!  She gives exams about every two weeks and the exam is based on 2 or 3 chapters. However,  said amazing! You will enjoy her class.  I am looking forward taking some of her other classes.  TAKE HER  CLASS"
1062,1421970,5.0,3.0,"I love her class,yes it is hard when it comes to the exams but that is if you dont study but other wise then that it is a fun class to be in she makes psychology sound very interesting,this is my second time taking one of her classes and i am planning on taking her again..I say take her and give it a shot!!"
1063,1421970,5.0,3.0,"She might be hard, but she teaches us the easy and the right way to do any assignment and how to study. It's a challenge. Who ever is brave enough go do it. She is awesome and makes psychology really easy to understand and fun."
1064,1421970,5.0,3.0,I love her class she makes the class fun with her stories and never was i ever bored.her exams are hard if you dont study but if you do.you get a pretty good grade. People may tell you not to take her but if you do want to learn something new take her class you wont regret it i know  didn't:)
1065,1421970,2.5,5.0,"not hard, challenging if you can't handle a challenge stay away from this class."
1066,1421970,4.5,2.0,"In this course, gender issues, professor Buenaventura is not extremely tough because she knows it is an elective course. However, it is expected that you keep up with the readings and all assignments. But how can you not&#63; This class is really interesting, fun and helpful in your personal. Make sure you participate actively!"
1067,1421970,3.0,3.0,Prof. B is a good professor. Her exams are hard only if you do not read the chapters prior to class. You MUST study for her exams. She challenges you to think critically.
1068,1421970,4.5,3.0,Very Fun. Urges class participation. Very Relatable.
1069,2345624,5.0,2.0,"Owens is probably my favorite professor that I have had so far. I high recommend taking him for PHI. The class was very easy, just show up and do the homework and you should be fine. There are quite a few assignments but they are very short and are based on cool videos or readings. For the class I took he provided us all readings."
1070,1421977,1.0,3.0,do not take this class if you enjoy learning anything. Take this class if you're looking to do bare minimum. Doesn't communicate ideas clearly and hardly shows up. Been in school over a month and have yet to see or hear anything about a grade and have also had a total of two classes. Not sure how this man became a professor but wouldn't take again.
1071,1421977,5.0,2.0,"He knows the material and shows a real love for Math. WHATEVER YOU DO, TAKE HIS CLASS. That way, no matter how much you pay, there will be a class that is worth the time and effort. He is inspirational and very loved."
1072,1421977,5.0,4.0,"He's very fair and if you miss a class you miss out on a lot of information. Normally, goes over a new lesson then does examples in class. Homework consist of examples that were taught during lectures. (It's important NOT to miss any classes) Exams are very similar to the problems he goes over in class &amp; HW. He's a really cool chill smart guy!"
1073,1421977,3.0,3.0,"If youre good at math youll pass, he gives partial credit on tests/quizzes for trying to attempt the problem. Lecture basically consists of him going over homework problems or textbook probs, goes pretty fast and not much time for questions. Cancels class here and there and is sometimes late, no biggy."
1074,1421977,3.0,1.0,"Class is extremely boring; he spends the whole time working thru problems, nothing ever changes. The textbook is NEVER used, don't bother getting it, he even tells you this the first day. He allows a ton of notes for tests, so as long as you have plenty of examples written, there's no way you should fail. He doesn't care if you're in class or not"
1075,1421977,4.5,2.0,"Super chill. Don't disrespect him by not doing the homework. You can ask him anything about the subject and he'll always answer you. (Tries on hats if you bring them in [insider]) Overall, I enjoyed taking this class despite the low interest in it."
1076,1421977,5.0,2.0,"Professor McDonnell is seriously the best math teacher I have ever had. I actually looked forward coming to class. He is clear and is a lenient grader on exams, he is hilarious, and he's really easy going.  TAKE HIM!"
1077,1421977,5.0,4.0,Such a great professor and guy. He is always willing to help out and is extremely understanding. He's really funny too.
1078,1421977,5.0,1.0,he's pretty chill. Takes many days off but when hes there he teaches everything crystal clear. Understands life happens. As long as you are polite he is helpful.
1079,1421977,5.0,1.0,"Amazing Professor! I learned so much, and Math became easy for me! I recommend him to anyone who hates math. I love it now!"
1080,1421977,5.0,5.0,"Mr. Mc Donnell is an amazing professor. He is patient and very helpful. I took his Math 10 class thinking I would fail. He is an educator, and his goal is to help you pass. The college needs more teachers like him. He has a way of making you understand something without making you feel stupid."
1081,1421977,5.0,2.0,"He's really funny and a chill professor. If you don't understand something, he is willing to help you out, you just need to ask. We only need to use our textbook when he assigned Homework."
1082,1895070,5.0,3.0,"Professor Taylor is incredibly intelligent, funny, and really cares about the success of her students."
1083,1895071,1.0,1.0,Bernard was my clinical instructor and he was the absolute worst. He will make you feel intimidated and stupid. I still got an A. Now I work at the hospital where hes the supervisor and hes still a bully. I think its funny he freezes when theres a code and dont help the nurse. He just runs his mouth. Haha
1084,1895071,5.0,3.0,I had Mr. Miller for two different clinical my sophomore and junior year. He really taught me a lot and would help me understand how to do certain tasks if i didn't know how to do it great yet. He is really chill and funny and will go hard on you at first to see what your made of but if you try hard and listen he will give you a lot of autonomy!
1085,1895071,5.0,5.0,"Mr. Miller is a great clinical instructor. He gives you the autonomy to practice like a nurse, but is still available to guide you when you need help. He sets a high standard for his students, but this only made me better prepared for Senior year. If I could have him as an instructor again I would. His teaching style gave me confidence in myself."
1086,1895071,2.5,4.0,"Mr. Miller was the hardest clinical instructor, but I have learned the most in my rotations with him. Although it may seem that he is being harsh & overly constructive, he actually tries to push you to be the best possible nurse that you can be. Because of him, I feel more prepared going into my other clinical rotations and confident in my skills. "
1087,1895071,2.5,5.0,"This man made me so nervous all the time. I was so anxious the entire semester because of him. Terrifying on the clinical floor. Likes to feel like he is the greatest person ever. Even nurses complained about him. He pushed us a lot to learn, but it was done in an inappropriate manner. "
1088,1895071,2.0,5.0,"I don't feel as competent as I should as a junior nursing student. Why? Because he is rude, says his job is not to teach, and makes you feel dumb for asking questions that even affect patient safety. He does not have the qualities that a nurse should have: flexibility, compassion, and willingness to teach. Be prepared to cry most clinical days. "
1089,1895071,4.0,5.0,"Really tuff instuctor, he pushed me passed my limits and made me be and do my best. Did not like his hard teachig metod but he made me become the best nurse ever."
1090,1825441,4.0,2.0,Read the textbook!! It will help you with the quizzes. Dr. Senter sometimes is a little confusing during lecture but he is very helpful during office hours. He is a super nice and reasonable guy too.
1091,1825441,1.0,5.0,DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. TRUST ME. TAKE DR. C.
1092,1825441,4.0,2.0,"This teacher is awesome! His classes consist of science LABS. He does notice if you attend and participate. The graded material turned in, he can tell if you put enough time in it. *Always remember to put a great title that ties on to the subject of the experiment on your report papers"
1093,1825441,4.0,2.0,"Take Professor Senter!!! Out of all the scientific concepts teachers he is the best. I am not good at Chem or Physics, but if you ask him for help he will get you through the class. If he sees that you try he'll take that into consideration."
1094,711336,5.0,3.0,I took Dr. Kelly for two courses and this was my second time with her. The classes have been late due to her job outside of the university. The schedule said 6-9 pm but we would be finished with the lecture by 8:30 pm. She would bring us snacks which was fun and she incorporated many real life situations from her experience into the lectures. 
1095,711336,5.0,1.0,When I took the class it was asynchronous so it was easy &amp; straightforward. We had discussions posts &amp; papers every other week. Since it was online I highly enjoyed it &amp; it was an easy for me.
1096,711336,4.5,2.0,"3 hour class, but goes by fast. Varies teaching methods like films, group work and discussions. This class made me highly interested in Medical Social Work. She is approachable, brings snacks and wants to see you succeed. There is 10 page paper, ask for help if needed, but you can do it. Trust me. Tests are easy if you study what she tells you to! "
1097,711336,5.0,2.0,Honestly best teacher I have ever had she made me be sure that I truly want to be a social worker. I hate 3hr classes but her class felt like a 1hr class because of how interesting class is never a dull moment and a must take for any soc majors.
1098,711336,5.0,1.0,"Professor Kelly is AMAZING! Her Medical Sociology class is what truly inspired me to go into MedSoc. Her class is not only interesting, but hands on and she makes it understandable and easy. If you have any problem she is very approachable and flexible. You can tell she cares a lot about her students."
1099,711336,5.0,1.0,Great professor class runs full period of time but it goes by very fast because is very interesting and funny...just do your work and you will pass.
1100,711336,4.5,1.0,"Shes a very good teacher has a good knowledge of healthcare system and helps u understand more. she is so sweet, she brings healthy snacks. Her class is worth going its fun and at times depressing due to movies. She can be easy but she grades hard on her papers make sure to proof read ur paper and follow instructions carefully. Worth taking!"
1101,711336,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely love prof. Kelly! She is very detailed with all of the information she shares with us as a class.Love the different real life stories from personal experience, as well as the energy she brings to the class!"
1102,711336,4.5,1.0,"She is so entertaining. Yo never get bored in her class. I love how she gives you snacks, thats so nice of her! Although she is easy, you have to come everyday, and pay close attention because it will be helpful for her tests. She makes class so entertaining that its impossible to daze off. You learn in her class because of that, so the test wont b"
1103,711336,4.0,5.0,- Make sure your paper gets proofread and follow directions exactly-otherwise you will get a bad grade on paper.  She is extremely liberal-grades your papers based on your political perspective.  If you want a good grade then write liberal papers.
1104,711336,5.0,1.0,nice n smart prof. knows her stuff!! very laid back!! we need more of these prof. at MSMC
1105,711336,5.0,1.0,"she is so cool!! class is easy and interesting. Discussions are interesting, she's helpful, tells you how much to study and what to study."
1106,1874602,5.0,2.0,Ive taken different professors for math here at the mount but Wang has definitely been my favorite. He cares about his students and is a great instructor. If i couldve taken him for every single math class i needed i wouldve
1107,1874602,5.0,2.0,"Wang is a really great math professor. You can tell he loves the subject and he makes the content relevant to his students lives which helps so much! . He really wants you to succeed in his class. Tests reflect the notes he gives you in class, no surprises. Prepare for lots of jokes! He's hilarious."
1108,1874602,4.0,1.0,"He gives you handouts that help clarify the concepts. There are a lot of concepts to memorize, although they are not complicated math. It is basically a review of simple math that we have all taken. He's really funny and enjoyable, never boring. If you can understand concepts in math without having it explained, you can skip class sometimes."
1109,1874602,5.0,3.0,"You can skip class and he won't dock you down, but trust me-- you don't wanna skip class. He is as clear and helpful as possible but the course is still difficult. Utilize him as much as possible and don't slack off on homework or you'll fall behind. Study in groups and keep going over your notes before exams."
1110,1874602,5.0,1.0,You need the textbook to pass. All homework comes from there.
1111,1874602,4.0,3.0,Professor Wang does his best to explain the lecture to his students until they understand the material. I recommend students to take him for Math 50. Lecture notes are very important so do not miss class.
1112,1874602,4.5,3.0,"I have always hated math so I was pretty scared to take this class, however professor wang was amazing! He is an excellent teacher and I would definitely take another one of his classes. He does assign homework but it is not an excessive amount and his tests are fair. As long as you study and do the homework you should be able to pass the class"
1113,1874602,5.0,4.0,Statistics is a difficult subject however professor Wang is great at teaching everything step by step which makes it easy to understand. He is super funny which makes the class fun. Just study your lecture notes and practice the problems on there and you'll do great! Ive never been very good at math however I managed to pass the class with an A (:
1114,1874602,5.0,2.0,"I went into this class very afraid because everyone would say Statistics is a difficult subject, but Professor Wang made it very easy to understand! He will always make sure that his class is understanding! He gives load of homework sometimes but is helpful to help understand topic. Study lecture notes for Exams as the problems will be familiar !"
1115,1874602,4.5,2.0,"The class itself was pretty difficult. Prof Wang gave wonderful notes and lectures and made them so easy to understand. If you miss class, It'll hurt you, but that doesn't mean you won't pass. Try your best and if you need help, ASK FOR IT. That's the best you can do."
1116,1874602,4.0,3.0,This class kicked my butt but Professor Wang is so helpful and patient. Stats is a hard subject and he makes it so clear. Make sure to go over lecture notes often!
1117,1874602,4.0,2.0,"Great Professor, very funny and easy lectures. I highly recommend for others to take this course."
1118,1874602,5.0,1.0,"This professor is the best I've encountered so far in my college career. He is clear and concise, his lectures are easy to follow, and he has a good sense of humor. He always managed to keep us (the students) well engaged."
1119,1874602,5.0,1.0,Professor Wang is such an amazing instructor! He's funny and kind and knows how to teach the material perfectly that we all understand the concepts and when we don't understand a concept he tries his best to help us out and show us how to do something until we all understand it and will not move on until he knows we all understand.  take him:)!!!!!
1120,1874602,4.0,2.0,"Professor is hilarious! All his lectures, homework, and tests are pretty easy because it's just basic math. He's easy to talk to and wants to help all his students succeed. Textbook is only used for the homework so just rent it. Really good class overall, I would take him again. "
1121,1874602,4.5,4.0,"Third time is a charm! FINALLY passed stats after taking it twice at other schools with professors who were so NOT helpful. Anyway, professor Wang sets you up for success and its up to you to give your best effort! It's a tough subject but he is very helpful! & he is hilarious which made the class so enjoyable. "
1122,1874602,4.5,1.0,This was the funnest class I have ever taken. I needed a math class so I chose his. Really glad I did. Every class period was hilarious and it was really fun to learn. Lots of  homework but just stuff out of the textbook and you can always ask questions about it in class. He actually tests on the material he goes over in class. The best math class!
1123,1874602,3.5,2.0,I would say he is a down to earth professor that understands his students. His lectures are easy to follow. If you don't get it he doesn't mind going back over it. He is very helpful and and responds rather quickly being that he is usually up late (assuming). 
1124,1874602,4.5,1.0,I recommend him. He tries his best to make sure everyone passes with the grade they want. You just need to show up and do your homework. Most of the homework questions are on the midterms.
1125,1874602,3.5,3.0,"Graded fairly.  Teaching style could improve. I would suggest  he shows more interest in the subject; he should also come to class prepared. Extremely helpful with all questions and would respond immediately. As long as you pay attention, have a good math foundation, and do the homework, you should be able to pass the class. However, stats is hard."
1126,1874602,3.5,2.0,The course itself was confusing but a little bit more of organization would have helped Understandable lectures and understands students
1127,1874602,3.5,2.0,Professor needs to be more organized and clear while giving lectures. Like the enthusiasm in the classroom.
1128,1874602,3.0,3.0,good teacher
1129,1395382,5.0,2.0,"Taking this online class was the best decision I have ever made. She only required 1 discussion, and 1 (2 page) paper every week. There was 1 (super easy) project and there was a midterm and a final. Thats it! No stress, easy A! Loved this class! :D"
1130,1395382,1.0,1.0,Um no! Thats a HARD NO!
1131,1395382,5.0,1.0,She's helpful and nice. Bases quizzes and tests straight from the powerpoints.  There are few big assignments but she's an easy grader.
1132,1395382,4.5,3.0,"Professor Cobos is extremely clear since day one, make sure to follow course schedule. She will count you responsible with anything that is stated on the Syllabus. Overall, she is a helpful professor! I enjoyed her class. "
1133,2058948,3.5,4.0,"- Weekly discussions that are due at the end of the week. - There's no other way to grade participation except through doing your assignments, quizzes, and papers.  - No tests, only quizzes. I didn't even find a final listed on my syllabus.  - No updates on grades, so I don't even know what my scores are except for the quizzes."
1134,1071815,4.0,4.0,"Great professor willing to answer questions from students. Does not over complicate philosophy, he really wants you to learn. "
1135,1071815,4.5,4.0,"He was a little of this semester, but still taught great. He talks a lot and he is clear. I thought this class was going to be hard but I learned a lot and I did not really study because he taught so well. Just focus in class and review and you will be fine"
1136,1071815,5.0,3.0,"He was great! just read, read, read and study, study, study! oh his textbook is in the LAPL"
1137,1071815,5.0,2.0,Stern is a great teacher. He keeps you involved and really makes you think. Some concepts get a bit tricky and he really breaks it down and makes it easier to understand. Take him!
1138,1071815,5.0,3.0,"I hate philosophy so I dreaded taking the class for Summer session, but after havingthis professor I loved it! In a matter of 6 weeks he taught me so muchand it was interesting!!! There is no class work, hej ust gets you thinking and his midterms and tests can be tricky, just listen to the examples in class. Overall amazing teacher!"
1139,1071815,1.0,4.0,"He was so boring and makes the material harder then it needs to be! We have so much homework that is collected at random so sometimes you do like 10 pages of homework for nothing. You have to go to class bc your grade drops everytime u miss. Hes a nice guy, just extremely confusing!"
1140,2253517,1.0,2.0,"She was not attentive to the class and did not answer or ask questions after the lecture. There were more than a handful of times where she was ending our zoom lecture and ended up cutting students off mid-question by ending the meeting. Read powerpoints while out of breath during our meeting. Doesn't answer emails, and does things last minute."
1141,2253517,5.0,2.0,Professor Alvarez is the best professor ever! If you study of her powerpoints and literally memorize them you will pass all the quizzes and exams. She is very helpful when you need her and when she teaches the material she gives real life examples to make connections.
1142,2253517,4.0,4.0,"For a recent graduate she's not bad. Whatever is on the slide is fair game, textbook wasn't really used only for hw but that can be taken from the power points. She assigns a good amount of hw that are not worth much, but she will deduct point left and right. Very helpful and caring, if you are having trouble DO NOT hesitate to ask for help."
1143,1790685,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Z was an amazing instructor for patho. She definitely comes off as very cold and harsh at first, but that is because she definitely expects the best from you. I struggled a LOT with the first two exams, but after reaching out to her during office hours, tutoring, exam review, etc., I improved dramatically on exam 3 and the final."
1144,1790685,2.0,3.0,A test would reveal a mental issue with her!!!!
1145,1790685,5.0,3.0,The MSMU ABSN program would be impossible without this professor!
1146,1790685,5.0,4.0,"you need to understand that she can be intimidating, but once you get to know her and just chat. shell be easier on you. but she can be a little mean sometimes. but you gotta do whatever it takes to get a good grade right? even if it means staying an extra hour at school to get your hw and labs checked."
1147,1790685,4.5,2.0,"She could seem mean at first but is actually very nice. Go to the LRC for HWLABS!! She will give you 100% if you stay and she will help you. Easy quizzes, sometimes she will make them online. Final is pretty easy, just study the powerpoint slides and you'll be fine! Also, the book helps but you dont use it in class at all!"
1148,1790685,4.0,4.0,"Took her my freshman year she is very tough, and does make you feel dumb. I hated her class  in the beginning because it was hard & i was scared to ask for help but i got over my fear &was at the LRC everyday. YOU MUST GET YOUR STUFF GRADED or you will never get 100% on her hw,or lab work sheets. I love Dr.Z now she's best bio & microbio prof"
1149,1790685,4.0,3.0,Her tests are tough  but she is available  most of the day for tutoring  
1150,1790685,3.5,3.0,She is a mean and strict professor. It's hard to approach her sometimes because of her attitude and that is one of the reason why I didn't like her class. She makes me feel stupid and dumb. Her tests and quizzes are easy if you study the slides but sometimes it's confusing.
1151,1790685,1.5,5.0,"Ok person,terrible professor.  The micro tests are what you would expect for premed students.  She teaches from power point slides --boring.  She often tries to tell jokes -- not funny.  She's not helpful in the labs.  Most of the students felt like they were teaching themselves. Get another teacher.  Either you have it or you don't.  She doesn't."
1152,1790685,2.5,4.0,"Pretty tough course, she can be rude at times , but also can act very helpful and friendly. DONT DARE GIVE HER ATTITUDE. she doesn't clarify labs, make sure before tests/quizzes you go to her office hours , or you probably wont pass, have her check ALL HMWRK/LABS before you submit them. Her tests are kinda easy though , MAKE FLASH CARDS THO!"
1153,1790685,1.0,5.0,"bad teacher,cant teach and needs to retire."
1154,1790685,1.0,5.0,Her class was super easy because everything she says in on the slides. Plus she does online quizzes except the final. She does NOT teach well. ALWAYS goes off topic and tries too hard to be your friend. if you want to actually learn something take someone else who can actually teach!!!!!!!!!!
1155,1790685,5.0,2.0,Her class was pretty easy. She took her time explaining concepts and made sure all her students understood the subject. Going to the LRC helps you get a better grade with her because she helps you with her assignments and labs.
1156,1790685,3.5,4.0,"I do not recommend her for BIO 3. Her lectures are okay, but her tests/quizzes are pretty tough. You would need to memorize every detail on the powerpoint in order to do well in her class. She makes the subject harder than it should be. Honestly, I learned more about Microbiology in lab at Chalon."
1157,1790685,2.0,3.0,Overall A HORRIBLE teacher yes i got the grade i deserve which was a B plus because i worked hard for it. She does NOT teach and is extremely rude. Basically had every quizzes online Except for the Final you have to teach yourself all materials because she does not know how to teach. Needs to improve her teaching skills & manners. Take Cheng!!!!
1158,1790685,5.0,2.0,"This professor is amazing. If one does not pass her class is because one does not try. Of course you have to study hard for the class but that is just because is Microbiology. Yet she is very helpful, and will help you throughout the semester. She is very nice, and friendly. Nobody can regret having such an amazing professor."
1159,1790685,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Z is great!  This is a class you definitely need to study for, but she posts all the powerpoints used in lectures so it's very helpful.  She's always in the LRC too so if you need to clarify, go see her.  I actually really hated Science until this class, interesting!"
1160,1790685,2.5,2.0,She has a bad attitude but great instructions
1161,1790685,5.0,2.0,"BIO 10_D1: If you are a non bio major, this professor is the best one to have! Her quizes and tests are from the powerpoints she puts up. She does not give out homework, maybe 1 or 2 assignments. She helps you out so much!"
1162,2370275,5.0,1.0,"Professor Richards is great, she only gave 3 assignments this semester. I've taken her twice for different classes and I've passed. She's very helpful and is lenient with the assignments."
1163,2370275,5.0,2.0,I've taken her class multiple times and I've learned a lot in all of them. She cares about her students and her students' learning. She also attempts to get to know everyone and promote unison for the whole class.
1164,2370275,1.0,4.0,"For a class on community, it didn't seem to promote it. She didn't really assign work that related to it. She should have given us group projects and made us work together rather than analyzing poems individually. She grades hard and treats the class as if it were an English class. She's 1-sided and likes to shove her opinions in people's faces."
1165,2591471,3.0,3.0,"I did not enjoy his lectures. He made such simple math really difficult to re-learn or understand, so I just taught myself for the most part. Also, he grades on a curve so if you don't like that, don't take him. It's essentially mandatory to go to class everyday because he gives a quiz every class session and homework is due."
1166,721659,4.0,2.0,Travis is the most helpful and easy class I've taken. All quizzes are online by yourself and group quiz in class. He's really funny and makes lectures fun and easy. I definitely recommend to take him. You'll pass with no lower than a B
1167,721659,5.0,1.0,"TAKE THIS CLASS!! This man is amazing! His lectures are never ever boring and he is extremely funny. WORD OF ADVICE: Although attendance isn't mandatory, it is important to show up in order to pass. Work load is very little but it is very important to do the little work he assigns. Other than that, EASY A! and you learn alot at the same time!"
1168,721659,4.0,3.0,Travis is awsome! His class was actually fun to come to. He gives group quizes and lets your use as many notes on the exams as you want. There is no homework and attendance is not madatory. He is really smart and really nice!!!
1169,721659,3.5,1.0,Very cool.
1170,721659,5.0,3.0,"This class was so much fun. I think this is one of the best professors in the school. It's isnt easy and it isn't hard. You must read and take really good notes, becasue you can use them in your tests. So just make sure you have detailed notes. Reading does take up a lot of time, but it's worth it!"
1171,721659,5.0,2.0,Wow... I love Professor Travis! He is such a sweet guy and extremely helpful! I wish he would teach all the psyc classes! His method of teaching is awesome with group quizes and open note tests. Take him if you can! If you're dedicated to his class you'll pass with no less than a B
1172,1772288,5.0,2.0,"She was a really good and thorough professor for a one unit course. I highly recommend her. She is very realistic and charming. She will allow you to turn in late work since the course was really busy. Overall, I was pleased. If you turn in all your work I am sure you will get an A+"
1173,2501378,5.0,2.0,"Literally the most adorable and best professor at MSMU. He truly is there for you to succeed just ask questions, participate, and show interest. "
1174,2501378,5.0,1.0,Professor Estephan is a great person. I enjoy attending his lectures and I can tell he is truly passionate about his job and his teachings.
1175,2501378,3.0,2.0,"Professor Estephan was a very sweet and caring man, however, he was awful at lecturing. He never spoke clearly about the material, ranted about politics, and made math so boring. You are basically on your own in that class. Do ALL the homework and study well and you will pass."
1176,2501378,5.0,1.0,"he is an amazing professor and he is so nice and funny,. such a cute man who really cares for his students. we love him! he is really easy as well as long as you pay attention"
1177,1864456,5.0,2.0,One of the most memorable and impactful professors I've had. Truly a great person. Would recommend her to anyone.
1178,1864456,4.0,3.0,She is a fantastic professor. Her exams are based on her lectures. You will enjoy her class. She never makes you feel stressful. She is helpful and clear. Her class is like a conversation between her and classroom. No power point but very interesting.
1179,1864456,5.0,3.0,"Pay good attention to her lectures, and don't skip class!  Your notes will help you greatly for exams and quizzes, so take good notes.  You'll use the book at least once or twice for quizzes/exams.  It's a good idea to use the book for her weekly reflections though, so keep it on hand.  All in all, Dr Cesario was a great professor to take!"
1180,1864456,5.0,1.0,I LOVE PROFESSOR CESARIO! She's an amazing professor and her intro to sociology class was really fun. She just lectures the whole class so you need to just take notes on the things she says. Her quizzes and tests are straight from lecture but they are really easy and straightforward. Easy A class if you put the effort to take good notes.
1181,1864456,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Cesario's class was hilarious, and there was never a dull moment even if there are no PowerPoints and all she does is lecture. There are weekly responses due each week, and she gives some opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester!"
1182,1864456,5.0,2.0,"Super funny! She encourages discussions. Ask her about her traveling, she has a lot of cool stories. Take her! There is never a dull moment during class, and she draws funny pictures. Bring a white board marker, because she always asks for one!"
1183,1864456,4.0,2.0,"Amazing professor and a great human being. She teaches and share very important information that captures your attention. Plus, shes very funny and has a great personality, everyone loves to be around her. "
1184,1864456,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Cesario is a phenomenal instructor. Her lectures are like no other, you learn a lot because she is great at teaching. Her tests are manageable, pay attention & review your notes and you'll do good. Final paper of 10-16 pages and a presentation. Although it might seen intimidating, you an do it. Ask for help if needed. Overall great experience!"
1185,1864456,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Cesario is an amazing professor. She is really clear on her directions and will give you an opportunity to turn in homework late, but the homework is fairly straightforward. She will tell you when quizzes or an exam is coming up and they're pretty much lecture based. "
1186,1864456,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Cesario is a phenomenal professor, her lectures are always interesting. She also really supports in class discussions and student participation."
1187,1254152,5.0,4.0,Prof Tong will give you the root to everything.  Her class is so good and NECESSARY!  She is not easy and students do fail.  So do not take her class lightly.  She is great with helping you succeed.  Great Professor!
1188,1254152,5.0,3.0,"I took this pharm class over the summer, and I loved Professor Tong! She is smart, nice, and wants the best for her students. Her tests are based on her powerpoints and she likes to call on people in class (which forces you to pay attention). I wish I could have her for more of my nursing classes! I studied a lot and earned my A! "
1189,1254152,5.0,1.0,"Professor Tong is amazing!! Best Professor I have encountered at this school. She is approachable and more than willing to help students. Her power points are clear cut in regards to quiz material, and she has a very warm demeanor to her. Highly recommend!"
1190,1254152,5.0,2.0,"Professor Tong is GREAT! Her power points are crystal clear, and right to the point, they cover the corresponding chapters to the T, and she will do her upmost to help her students when she can. The book I will say was semi necessary because she would sometimes throw a question on a test from the book."
1191,1254152,5.0,2.0,"Professor Tong is the best teacher i had this semester.  She knows the subject pretty well. She only have 2 hrs of lecture but she manages her time well.  Very helpful and fair.  I wish we can have more teachers like her. Overall, she's great teacher!"
1192,1254152,5.0,2.0,"EXcellent Professor.Organized and helpful.Her classes are dynamic, and if you study hard its doable.She will give a fair treatment to students that want to better themselves and lots of support for Math.Great example for the rest of teachers, wish all were like her!"
1193,1254152,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher. Very organized and professional. Extremely sweet. If I hadn't started out with her when I started the program, I would have quit. She goes above and beyond the call of duty."
1194,1254152,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Tong is an excellent Instructor. She really knows her business, and can lecture very well. She doesn't sit there and read her powerpoints. She responds to emails, or request for help immeadiately and is very well organized unlike the rest of MSMC where you get last minute information all the time!"
1195,1254152,5.0,4.0,Best teacher I have had so far in that school. She really cares and wants her students to do well. She will do whatever it takes to help you succeed. Take her class.
1196,1254152,5.0,4.0,very very organized! Her notes are better than the textbook and way easier to understand. She talks really fast which takes some getting used to. But will stop and explain anything to you if asked. Her slides are very interactive with lots of pictures which help keep you awake during looong lectures :)
1197,1440523,5.0,5.0,She's a great professor. She helps you grow with your critical thinking and writing skills. She also really cares about her students doing well. =]
1198,1440523,4.5,2.0,"Great Professor! She is easy enough, but you have to work for that A.  She is passionate and cares about her students.  I would definitely recommend that anyone take her classes."
1199,1440523,3.0,4.0,"This class was not even a real class. You would just go in and work on essays. At the end you would have to turn in portfolio. Even if your grade is like a 79.8%, she will not give you that B-!"
1200,1440523,3.0,3.0,She was a very good teacher. Loves to talk and she is amazing when she come to speaking about oneself. Motivates you to be the best person you can be. She is sometimes unclear about what she wants in her writing and if you wait till the last minute then it will be alot. Keep up with her.
1201,1440523,4.0,3.0,Classes are very interesting and loves to class discussions.  You have to be responsible for everything in the syllabus.  Not a hard essay grader and is helpful if you go see her.
1202,1440523,3.0,3.0,"Makes the class very interesting, but need to keep up with reading and other HW that is on the syllabus. You have to be more responsible of your work because she won't remind you."
1203,2579211,3.0,5.0,Just do her assignments well and ASK IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. As the class progresses it gets harder and harder. ALSO DO THE LAB ASSIGNMENTS they are important for your 29-30 page paper. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PARC AND EXTRA CREDIT.
1204,2579211,1.0,5.0,i really hate this class. take advantage of her EC since the final will be worth a lot. lets just say my grade dropped 25% because of the final
1205,2579211,1.0,5.0,SW 118 is a mandatory class for all Social Work majors. Please avoid taking her AT ALL COSTS. She grades so hard and is not flexible. I thought she would be with everyone going on. Overall take this class with someone else.
1206,2579211,2.0,4.0,"Honestly, I do not know what I'm doing in that class; that's the very first time I ever felt that way. You have to teach yourself most of the time and read out of a book that you will not understand. She makes you take useless quizzes. If I do not pass this class, then I will not be able to graduate. TAKE RESEARCH IN YOUR THIRD YEAR"
1207,2401048,5.0,5.0,"Professor Livas is a tough professor, but she is one of the best. She is one of the most realistic professors and prepares you early for the tough classes you are going to face. Take her if you like to be challenged. If you are lazy, you will not pass."
1208,2013976,5.0,3.0,"He's such a chill professor, he's super clear in what he wants on his speeches and notes. I had him online for the Fall 2020 semester and honestly it was one of my favorite classes. Make sure you ask him if you need help, he'll give you good feedback on either your notes or rough drafts of your speeches!"
1209,2013976,2.0,3.0,"I get pretty nervous when it comes to speeches so I was a little intimidated the first week of class. Despite this, the speeches are relatively easy. However, his grading criteria are not clear and he is very meticulous on presentation rather than information. Many of his lectures are not organized and he cannot get a clear point across."
1210,2013976,5.0,3.0,"He knows the material and shows a real love for Speech. WHATEVER YOU DO, TAKE HIS CLASS. That way, no matter how much you pay, there will be a class that is worth the time and effort. He is inspirational and very loved."
1211,2013976,4.0,2.0,"I was scared at first especially because I hate public speaking, but this course helped me a lot especially because of him! There are 4/5 speeches, everything is straightforward in his instructions. If you're having trouble, make sure to reach out to him. Overall, very easy class! Make sure you do all the written work- credit or no credit."
1212,2013976,5.0,2.0,"This class was an easy A. Just do what he tells you to do, follow all his instructions as best you can, (and for god's sake speak up!) Not much homework assigned, and the homework that was assigned was easy. He had extremely clear instructions. All you have to do is follow them (and not be absent more than twice or during discussion classes)"
1213,2013976,5.0,2.0,Easy A you just need to dress nicely and speak loud and clear! DO THE TED TALKS!!!!!! any extra credit he offers you should really do!
1214,2013976,5.0,1.0,"its speech, its easy i got  a A. give great loud speeches and dress appropriately, don't look like of u just rolled out of bed. and you'll pass. if ur on the verge of the next grade up. DO A TED TALK. by doing this he raises ur lowest speech by 5%, which is about 1.5% in your overall grade. good luck ! also attendance is 20% of ur grade. 2 free abs"
1215,369463,4.5,3.0,"Great instruction, goes above and beyond to help, even hosting EXTREMELY HELPFUL study sessions on weekends or evenings prior to tests for anyone wanting or needing extra practice. If you pull your weight in the class, you can't help but learn from him. Excellent insights on life, too. Recommended for the serious student. :-)"
1216,369463,5.0,2.0,"The professor was extremely helpful and resourceful.  He was always prepared for class.  I learned something new everyday and if I didn't understand a concept in class, he was always available during office hours.  He takes time to help students understand the subject.  I highly recommend doing the homework even if he does not collect it."
1217,369463,1.0,3.0,Very inaccessible and unhelpful to his students.  Lazy attitude and poor preparation.
1218,369463,4.0,2.0,"Ehh.. he's not easy but he's not hard. He's not a good teacher, but he's not a bad teacher; he is simply mediocre. He is open to questions and his quizzes & exams aren't that hard if you pay attention and study. He likes to joke around & talk about his family.  He held a study session over the weekend to help students so I admire that."
1219,369463,4.5,3.0,He was very helpful and understanding. He always made sure everyone in the class was on the same page before continuing to a new application. Even though you don't turn in the homework I would recommend doing it anyway. A huge portion of the tests and quizzes are from the homework questions. He is one of the best professors I ever had.
1220,369463,5.0,3.0,He's the reason I graduated! Very helpful professor and he's the main reason many students get jobs at KPMG.
1221,369463,5.0,2.0,"Simply the best!  Gives clear explanations and cares about his students. Do all your homework, attend class and you'll do fine."
1222,369463,5.0,3.0,"I loved Professor Alhanati, granted he tends to talk alot about how much money he makes, that doesn't matter.  I love accounting thanks to him.  I had actually failed accounting the first time around with a different professor (I can't remember his name) becuase he didn't make sense to me but I retook it with Alhanati and gave me a whole new perspective.  In my book he is the greatest."
1223,369463,3.0,4.0,No Comments
1224,369463,5.0,3.0,"Very clear and makes sure students understand before  continuing. Gives work but does not check... I would suggest you do it any way, because he references homework problems for tests."
1225,369463,5.0,1.0,My 6th class w/ Prof Alhanati.  He's absolutely the best acctg prof. He knows his stuff well & delivers clear lectures. He makes use of transparencies but only to go over homework fr the texts. Prof Alhanati teaches multiple classes in trad & WEC programs-maybe that's why graded tests take longer&#63;
1226,369463,1.0,1.0,"He is the worst professor ever. He does not teaches Accounting, he just copies the answers from the transparency.  He is a very lazy professor. He takes forever to grade our stuff. He usually does not knows what he is talking about and mostly talks about his life and the life of his neighbors."
1227,369463,5.0,3.0,Prof. Alhanati is an amazing instructor.  He made difficult and challenging material accessible through assignments and in-class activities that built the knowledge needed to master the content.  I took three of his classes and all were rewarding and fulfilling learning experiences.
1228,369463,4.5,3.0,very helpful
1229,369463,4.0,5.0,Good Professor... gives lots of homework.
1230,369463,5.0,3.0,He is an excellent professor and advisor. He looks our for the interest of the students and does everything possible to make sure you understand the material. He gives lots of homework but only does it as a preparation for the tests. Excellent rating!
1231,369463,5.0,2.0,His lectures and in class exercises make accounting interesting and easily understood.  He really cares about student's success and will help you outside of class.  Attend class and do the homework and you'll do well.
1232,369463,5.0,3.0,Very good teacher.  Supportive and wants the student to succeed. No trick assignments.  Just wants the student to learn. He enjoys accounting and his enthusium rubs off on the students
1233,369463,5.0,3.0,Very practical in his teaching.  Definitely learn from him when it comes to business.
1234,369463,5.0,1.0,"One of the best teachers there is.  Accounting majors or if you just need to take business electives, take him.  Clear and engaging lectures, fair amount of work, light reading, superb professor."
1235,39736,5.0,3.0,She was a great teacher
1236,39736,1.5,5.0,If you can avoid this class. She appears a sweet but was rude most classes and she keeps over class time.
1237,39736,4.5,1.0,"Love Sr. Teresita. no actual class meetings, just show up to the events. had lots of fun. GREAT CLASS. TAKE IT WITH FRIENDS!! :]"
1238,39736,1.0,3.0,"By far the worst teacher I have ever had, she can not give you a straight answer for the life of her which is really annoying.  She is a bit of a snob, and I really reccomend not taking this class.  Its boring, she repeats lessons, cant hear, and can not give a clear answer for the life of her."
1239,39736,4.5,1.0,INT class was fun. I love this professor. She's very nice but a lot of people take advantage of her kindness. Don't be that assh0le.
1240,39736,4.0,3.0,Sr Teresita is the nicest professor ever. When you see her you just want to hug her. Unfortunately her class is extremely boring and the exams are mainly memorization
1241,39736,3.5,4.0,"Music Variations. Such a cute teacher, so sweet. She loves when you participate.. make sure she knows your name.. also you HAVE to show up to class 100%, she dislikes tardiness. Lots of memorization.. but if you already know the basics of music, you fly by perfectly.. she also tells great drama stories. take her, she's worth it."
1242,39736,2.0,4.0,"Dscvring Music Fundamentals... OKAY in the 1st half of the semester. BUT, I feel it gets harder in the end... ESP. if you don't know your Music Theory. If I didn't know my music theory beforehand... and I didn't know any music theory at all I feel I would have failed. For harder stuff she doesn't have good teaching methods. I KNOW. She's nice tho."
1243,39736,2.0,2.0,"Love music but hated this class! Topics so irrelevant to what we were studing... If I had had no sence of music, I dont what I would have done... BORING!! Had to take candy to wake me up!"
1244,39736,4.0,1.0,She is so Sweet and so cute(as in awwww) She's a great person overall.
1245,39736,5.0,2.0,"There was a lot of memorization for her class and she gave lots of notes, she encourages active participation and is very open to questions."
1246,39736,5.0,1.0,Guided Exper. in the Arts is a credit/no credit class so do yourself a favor and show up to the required events or else you won't pass. She usually gets cheap tickets for everybody & the choices are good. Fun events & cool idea for a class. I liked it!
1247,39736,5.0,1.0,"Guided Experience in the Arts was a fun class.  You get to experience cultural/artistic events around L.A. for very cheap. It's an easy class. However, GO TO THE EVENTS, don't be a dumbass and take the class knowing it's an easy A."
1248,39736,2.5,3.0,really really reall really reall really boring
1249,2214724,5.0,4.0,Really smart and cares about his students
1250,2214724,4.0,2.0,He is such a great and cool teacher. Great feedback on essays & he makes you want to read and participate. The essays are not too hard they're actually interesting to write.
1251,2155342,1.0,2.0,"The class is not hard, she is just not flexible at all and does not extend deadlines. The class was asynchronous and she did not give any feedback on any of the assignments and just grades on completion."
1252,2155342,5.0,1.0,Took her for FYS and it was super easy. It's impossible to get under an A in her class.
1253,2155342,5.0,4.0,"She is a lovely professor, and I thoroughly enjoyed taking her class. She gives so few assignments, but every assignment counts! She does not give extra credit, nor does she extend deadlines."
1254,2155343,5.0,4.0,"Dr J seems to really know her stuff but she's funny, too! I learned a lot from her.  She expects a lot but she's fair.  Show up to class, read the syllabus carefully, and you'll pass no problem."
1255,2155343,4.0,4.0,"Quiz on the first day of every week. Sometimes she can get sidetracked and forget what point she was trying to make. She is clear in the syllabus about deadlines, but she is open to extending dates depending on how much the assignment has been touched on."
1256,1755999,4.5,3.0,"This class was challenging! However, if you go and see the professor during his office hours, he will help you! A lot of people complain about his class being hard, and that's because they didn't give much attention to it. There are classes way harder than this one!"
1257,1755999,1.0,4.0,"I do not recommend his class if you have never taken Physics or Chemistry in high school. He reads off his slides and does not explain what it means. If you are forced to take his class, I recommend getting a tutor. His quizzes are kind of easy if you read the chapter."
1258,1755999,1.0,5.0,"NOT HELPFUL AT ALL, USES Physics first then Chem!!! Who does that! He expects you to know everything. Yah after high school except to learn everything about Physics?? Do NOT take! He is a horrible teacher! DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
1259,1553249,5.0,2.0,She is awesome.  A great artist herself.  Combines a bit of art history with instruction.  The class was Visual Thinking.  Awesome reading materials and great lessonsprojects.  Very inspiring.
1260,1553249,5.0,1.0,This has been one of my favorite classes at the Mount.  Susan is amazing!!!! I had no art instruction prior to her class and Susan provides you with an introduction to various mediums and styles.  Everyone in class loved it! I wish there was a part 2 to this class.
1261,1782629,5.0,4.0,"French sets the stage for you to succeed in her class. Attendance & participation play a major part in your grade, so be sure to come to class. She gives clear full lectures and expects class participation. Notes should be taken prior to class in order to participate during lecture. She expects the best from her students so don't disappoint!"
1262,1782629,3.5,2.0,Great Teacher!!!
1263,1782629,1.0,1.0,"Dr. French is a good lecturer, but I do not feel she cares about her students. :("
1264,1782629,5.0,1.0,"I honestly wish Dr. French could teach every business class in this college. Interesting, though-provoking, sassy, and (best of all) EASY A"
1265,1782629,3.5,1.0,Easy. Organization Behavior. Quizzes are only on vocab (open note). She assigns you vocab for homework. Just write the definitions. 3 papers (super easy). A couple case studies (hope you get a good group). Easy breezy.
1266,1782629,5.0,1.0,Great teacher.. easy.. her quizzes/test is open notes and hmwk is just vocabulary
1267,2679654,5.0,3.0,Fetchko is great but I would suggest paying attention during class because her lessons are descriptive and helpful. Always do the reading before coming to class because she calls on people during discussions. But other than that she is great and gives thorough feedback to help you. 
1268,2679654,5.0,3.0,"I had Professor Fetchko for English. The class is normal on the amount of essays. An easy class but you must put effort into your writing and she is more than happy to give help and feedback. I don't think class is mandatory but if you want to succeed and get a good grade, great attendance is a must. I would take a class with her again1"
1269,1880937,5.0,1.0,"Even though he speaks in a very awkward manner, and acts very awkwardly & childish at times, he really knows what he's talking about. He is very clear and will not lecture you for 3 hours. He lectures for an hour max, then uses the 2 extra hours to tutor anyone that needs help. Oh, and he's like super good looking. Too bad he left & is back in WA."
1270,1880937,3.5,1.0,"He is a little monotone and awkward, but very cute! Everyone gets an A in his class. If you don't then something is wrong with you."
1271,230259,5.0,2.0,"Professor Green is really flexible when it comes to submitting assignments.
I was a bit hesitant to take his class because of the reviews on here, but I'm glad I did
I took the course to fulfill my GE requirements & had no knowledge of philosophy but still managed to pass with an A
He does give a lot of homework but it's simple & easy to understand"
1272,230259,1.0,4.0,"Professor Green is absolutely terrible, I asked him if I could change my status to asynchronous instead of remote synchronous because I have work and the class seemed easy. He relied to me with about 3 paragraphs and told me Im doing the worst in the class and that he recommended I didnt do the class asynchronously."
1273,230259,3.0,4.0,There is a lot of reading required outside of class and class lectures are made up of reviewing the homework and answering the questions. The tests are difficult and the study guide acts like it helps but the answers to the tests are subjective to the professor himself.
1274,230259,2.0,3.0,he's nice &amp; a good person. youd always have to participate in his class. he also grades hard. busy work and his classes are boring. not a good professor. he made it difficult even though its only a fys class and i just did not see the point of him making us do all that work.
1275,230259,4.0,3.0,"In his class, you are divided into groups. He uses this as a way for the students to engage with and learn from each other rather than always asking the same questions to him. (I thought it worked well.) He generally makes sure everyone participates in class. He fell behind on the schedule, but he doesn't rush through lectures to try to catch up."
1276,230259,4.0,3.0,"Good professor, down to earth person. He wants students to succeed. Not a lot of reading, mostly pay attention to the lecture and notes he gives out. If you read the text, pay attention and do your work, then I do not see how you can not pass this class. There is a lot of group work in this course, so be prepared to work with others."
1277,230259,4.5,2.0,"Good professor, down to earth person. He want students to succeed. Not a lot of reading, mostly pay attention to the lecture and notes he gives out. If you read the text, pay attention and do your work, then I do not see how you can not pass this class. There is a lot of group work in this course, so be prepared to work with others throughout the class"
1278,230259,4.0,2.0,Dr. Green is a great professor. He teaches well and he will review the material before an exam. Nice guy and will repeat material (for a while) if you don't understand the material.
1279,230259,3.5,3.0,"He's makes Intro to Philosophy really interesting because he made the course associated with the Matrix trilogy. You have to pay attention and take good notes to do well in his class. Make sure you do all of your homework to. If you're willing to learn more about Philosophy and yourself, this is the class for you."
1280,230259,2.0,3.0,"He is a nice & funny man but fails when it comes to making the material clear the first time. Gets wrapped up in what he is saying so he doesn?t explain instructions to his projects clearly. He recommends the Analytic Skills Tutor but don?t do it. Go to him directly for help & him make time for you ahead of time, since he?s not very accessible."
1281,230259,2.0,4.0,"He grades really hard on your papers.  I worked really hard, and I got a D in his class.  He has limited office hours so forget getting help."
1282,230259,5.0,4.0,"I  was so intimidated by Medieval Philosophy class, but I love it!  He is great and very supportive!"
1283,230259,2.5,4.0,"Nice guy. Unfortunately, a lot of busy work and a lil bit of a bore."
1284,230259,3.0,3.0,Sweet man -- not so awesome professor.
1285,230259,5.0,3.0,He is a great professor! His lectures are interesting espesically when he talks about the movie The Matrix.
1286,230259,5.0,2.0,Keeps you entertained!
1287,230259,5.0,2.0,He was very clear about outlining the different kinds of arguments and why some were not logical.
1288,230259,4.0,3.0,"Nice professor, sweet, and tries to help you.  Though Philosophy is not in my interest I did very well in his class.  Highly recommend him."
1289,230259,5.0,1.0,One of the best professor's at the college.  teaches the class in a very fun and interesting manner.  Never have been so interested in Philosophy and the different types of arguments.
1290,230259,4.0,1.0,"He is a generally nice guy. A warning: do not take his class if you hate group work like I do. He always makes you get into assigned groups to do classwork. It is very annoying. Otherwise, he is very understanding and helpful."
1291,230259,5.0,5.0,"Excellent Professor, he is interesting and made Theory of knowledge the best class I have ever had. Very imformative and if you are able to choose a class for fun take this one. There is a lot of reding, critical thinking but it is worth the work."
1292,230259,5.0,1.0,Dr. Green is a pretty fun guy. His personality is really upbeat and he's a very effective professor. I could have done with less work in &quot;small groups&quot; but the assignment to write your own fairy tale was fun. Overall a pretty easy class.
1293,1813376,5.0,1.0,"Music Masterpieces fulfills the art/music GE and it is pretty easy. I would suggest taking this class.  She really helps you out if you ask her about a piece and her stories about the composers are really cute. The only thing is you have to attend a few concerts and it costs money sometimes and it might be on a weekend. Overall, an easy class :)"
1294,1788802,5.0,3.0,She is a great teacher who cares about her students. Just as any class at the college level you get what you put into the class. If you don't care than you can pass with a decent grade but you have to work for that A. My favorite class of my quarter hands down.
1295,1788802,5.0,2.0,I loved this teacher. Her way of teaching is very interactive. I felt that taking her class helped me on a psychological level.
1296,1788802,1.5,2.0,WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER TAKEN! My experience with professors thus far has been quite positive until I took this class. She is extremely unorganized (frequently lost students assignments even though we email everything). We didn't receive a syllabus until 3 weeks into the course and made racial comments numerous times throughout the course.
1297,2567052,5.0,2.0,"I took him my first year both semesters online because of COVID, and it was asynchronous. He is very understanding, and if you need an extension on a paper, don't be afraid to ask. He does require a textbook and be prepared. It's a lot of reading. This will help you out with the weekly discussions and quizzes. He is pretty fair and nice."
1298,2567052,4.0,3.0,"He does assign a lot of homework but it isn't difficult, attendance is mandatory, however, if you copy another students notes and show it to him he will give you credit for that day, he is pretty funny and he tries to make sure that you understand what he is lecturing if you have questions he will explain everything until you get it."
1299,2567052,3.0,5.0,"Took this class for Summer. SO MUCH WORK! I've never done so many discussions in my life. I would never take it again, not looking forward for the next RST class. Either way, he's a pretty great teacher and knows what he's doing. Take him if you don't mind doing a lot of work lol."
1300,2769810,5.0,1.0,"Professor P was amazing! she was awesome at giving lectures, and she motivated her students. i was not very fond at getting up in front of a crowd to give a speech.. after this class i feel so much better and confident!"
1301,2098067,4.5,3.0,"Great Professor! Really wants every student to pass her class! I would recommend her to anyone! You must of course.. study to pass, but anyone can do it!"
1302,1530785,4.0,5.0,"She is a tough professor, but you learn alot in her class. She can be a bit intimidating, but is willing to help you if you ask."
1303,1530785,3.0,5.0,"she is tough. she may explain everything and make it seem like it's easy...but once the quizzes or exams come, she wants the EXACT response and if you dont mention EVERYTHING, she deducts it half point right away.she's stern.i feel like it's useless to even study so hard for her exams."
1304,1530785,4.5,4.0,"The class is tough, but you learn a lot. She explains everything very well and you can tell she is passionate about the subject. She is strict, but she is personal and even tutors us after class!"
1305,2171809,5.0,4.0,"Professor Koid is amazing! She cares about her students and gives us a lot of resources to help us prepare for exams for lecture and lab. Do not hesitate to ask questions, she is there to help! If you do the readings, pay attention & participate in class, take good notes, do the homework, & use her resources you will be prepared for exams!"
1306,2171809,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Koid was absolutely amazing! if you don't know whether you should take her or not, just do it! i was motivated to take her course for microbiology lecture and lab and i loved it! super easy if you pay attention, if you dont know something- ASK! she is willing to help always, she loves when people participate. "
1307,2171809,5.0,3.0,Koid is very approachable and her lectures aren't just her reading the slide. She takes the time to answer questions as much as possible and encourages participation. I used the textbook for answering learning objectives which helped prepare for exams. Review the powerpoints. There was also a big final paper to write.
1308,2171809,5.0,3.0,Very detailed during lectures. I was able to understand her completely but anytime I had questions she would answer in a way to help me better understand. I love her teaching style and her test are not that hard as long as you pay attention in class. Go to review sessions and tutoring she does they are very helpful for the exams.
1309,2171809,5.0,3.0,"She is an amazing gem! I always read the book but her lectures are just as sufficient &amp; she explains concepts beautifully. To study her exam and quizzes, I recommend prioritizing MASTERING &gt; learning objectives &gt; study guide. If you purely study mastering you'd probably get Bs. If you don't understand anything go to office hours! She's always open."
1310,2171809,5.0,4.0,"This was my 2nd time taking micro and I'm happy I took her. You really have to pay attention during lecture, take good notes and draw everything. I got A's on every quiz, exams and the final and I just studied the powerpoints and notes. The material is hard but you just have to read and use all resources (homework assignments/practice quizzes)."
1311,2171809,5.0,3.0,"She really wants her students to succeed in the class. She love it when you come to office hours because she gets to know you and she guides you on what to study I order to pass the exam. Come to class as much as you can, it really helps! She is wonderful and she is Lecture based so anything on the lecture is on the exam, which helps a lot!"
1312,2171809,5.0,4.0,Professor Koid is an amazing professor! She teaches really well and easy to understand lecture. You can pass her class if you put in the effort to study really heard. Come to class prepared and read before class. Don't miss any assignments!
1313,2171809,4.0,3.0,"Great lectures, makes it interesting. She grades specifically when it comes to online assignments or labs, she gives a lotto half points but if you go speak to her about it she will give you the full point (ex: 9.5/10) it makes a difference..."
1314,2171809,5.0,4.0,SHES AMAZING. She will break everything down if you do not understand the material. She's great. I wish she taught all other science courses.
1315,234408,4.0,3.0,I have had Dr. Brosamer for multiple classes and he is also my academic advisor. He is super knowledgeable and helpful. He does a great job of breaking down and explaining material (with humor added in.) Make sure to show up to class and take notes because all midterm and final info comes from lecture.
1316,234408,5.0,2.0,"Pay attention and take really good notes; he mostly focuses his testing questions on stuff he has talked about in class. He does a really good job of explaining the material and answering any questions you have while be entertaining at the same time. His class is not one that you can doze off in, if you want to get a good grade just pay attention."
1317,234408,4.0,2.0,Professor Brossamer is brilliant. I had him for Literature and the Human Experience. He based the semester class on horror novels and changes the theme each semester. He mostly lectures. To pass any of his classes you need to record him during lecture as well as take good notes and review the recordings later and before the test and for papers.
1318,234408,2.5,5.0,"He's passionate, but doesn't prepare us well for tests, which is where most of our grade comes from. No study guides, no notes allowed on tests, never multiple choice & never open book. DO NOT take this class unless you're passionate about Mythology, because that is the only way you'll get a decent grade. If you just need GE credit, keep looking."
1319,234408,5.0,2.0,"Brosamer's English classes are the modt interesting you will ever take. He explains the meaning, plot and symbolism to difficult texts in the best way possible."
1320,234408,3.5,4.0,"If you don't really take notes, you better start. His lectures are long but thorough. In this particular class, he did not use lecture slides, so you had to write down nearly every word that came out of his mouth in order to do well in the class. He is a rather easy grader. Essay prompts get to the point, yet they give you room to be creative."
1321,234408,3.0,4.0,"He is a brilliant and interesting guy with a lot of knowledge to share, but his expectations of us to read a large novel per week is quite ridiculous. It is doable if you hardly have any classes, but as a nursing student it is almost impossible. I failed all tests but got an A on the paper. Overall, great professor and very funny. "
1322,234408,4.0,3.0,"I am currently taking his Shakespeare class. Not an eng major. Tbh it is an amazing class although his tests can be hard. He grades fair on essays. He is EXTREMELY knowledgeable & that makes me want to learn more since not an expert on shakespeare. I would love to take him again. Awesome teacher, fun class, really explains if still having hard time"
1323,234408,5.0,3.0,"If you're an English major, you'll love him. His middle english courses are hard because of the Middle English, so STUDY, because he's known for including quotes and having you identify them. He only quizzes once. Shakespeare's History plays get confusing so read a summary before and then READ. West Lit is the easiest of them all, though dense."
1324,234408,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Brosamer is an excellent professor. He not only lectured about the various authors' backgrounds, but also provided historical background in the time the works were written and read. Was his class challenging? YES!! His quizzes, midterm, and final are horrendous!! BUY FLASH CARDS :)"
1325,234408,4.0,4.0,took his Shakespeare class & he does make class interesting. very interesting. his quizzes & tests are nerve wrecking
1326,234408,4.0,4.0,"Currently taking his Shakespeare course. It's a pretty difficult class since the material is sometimes hard to understand, and if you aren't lazy (unlike me) you should be fine. He's a really great professor with a good sense of humor. Coming from someone who hates shakespeare, if you're going to take a shakespeare course, take it with him."
1327,234408,4.0,4.0,His Shakespeare class was the only class I enjoyed last semester. I learned a lot and he made learning about the plays super interesting. Other people have said you need to read the book but I got on fine by mostly just taking notes and reading sparknotes. I admit that I probably could've gotten an A instead of a B if I had read more.
1328,234408,2.5,4.0,"All he did was read to the class out of the books, there was little class interaction and it was him mostly reading what we had read the night before. Other than that it was ok, uninteresting material to me"
1329,234408,3.5,5.0,"Dr. Brosamer is amazing! He is so smart and he knows his Shakespeare, but my goodness his exams are HARD!!!! Unless you have a photographic memory, then you need to do all of the readings at least 3 times and memorize all of your class notes.  But he's so kind, as long as you do well on everything else and participate in class you should be fine."
1330,234408,4.5,4.0,"To the majority of students, Shakespeare is less than fantastic - Brosamer makes it riveting. You cannot pass the class without completing the reading. He grades fairly - the quizzes and tests aren't easy but if you complete the reading and attend class you will do well."
1331,234408,4.0,4.0,He is very funny and very interesting to listen to. but work is challenging. But i enjoyed going to class.
1332,234408,3.0,3.0,"You MUST read, or the class will be boring. However, he doesn't really grade papers on the content, he's more interested in proper grammar/spelling."
1333,234408,5.0,5.0,It is important to attend class because all of his test and quizzes come straight from his lectures. His test and quizzes are fair. Take good notes. Excellent professor. Best english course I have taken at MSMC.
1334,234408,3.0,3.0,"Shakespeare- Good class but the quiz's make absolutely no sense and are hard to do well on, you have to be listening to every single word to ace them. Other than that, he is a great teacher with interesting insight"
1335,234408,5.0,5.0,"Excellent professor. He is difficult, but I learned so much. Exceedingly helpful. I adore him!"
1336,234408,5.0,4.0,"Very intelligent, knows his stuff.  That makes him hot."
1337,234408,5.0,4.0,"Challenging, fun, interesting professor."
1338,234408,5.0,5.0,"If you study what he tells you to, you'll do well.  Keep up with the readings or else you'll fail his quizzes."
1339,234408,5.0,3.0,Great Professor.  Very intelligent to the point of being a total nerd but he's proud of his nerd status. Very helpful and compassionate. However his exams can be nit picky and in some cases just evil.
1340,234408,2.5,4.0,"if you like talking in class, take his class. you write a lot of essays like once in two weeks (short papers) and two long papers. i had a hard time in his class.i actually sought for tutoring. i started wih a C ended up with B+ cuz i put a lot of effort in that class!overall, my writing inproved.you get some days off too..."
1341,234408,4.5,2.0,Great teacher who actually teaches english... i felt i learned a lot from this class whether it be writing related or not. Class if very chill and Mr. Brosamer is very reasonable. Just write essays and proofread as much as possible and you'll be fine :)
1342,234408,5.0,3.0,"He's awesome-the best prof by far that I have had here. Incredibly smart, well read (not just about his subject), and while not altogether socially adept, funny and kind nonetheless. He is helpful to no end (even if disorganized), and the challenges in his class are refreshing  Basically he's great."
1343,234408,5.0,2.0,great prof
1344,234408,4.0,5.0,He's is an okay professor. I don't love him I don't hate him.
1345,234408,5.0,4.0,Prides himself of teaching challenging but interesting classes. Also one of the sweetest and most helpful prof.s if you go to him for help. He really enjoys the material he teaches and it shows.
1346,234408,5.0,3.0,"Very passionate about the subject. Extremely informed. Intellectual lectures. A fine professor. Hard grader, but rightfully so."
1347,234408,3.0,4.0,"Mr. Brosamer is passionate about his work but unless you have time to read, read, read, write papers, and read don't take this class."
1348,234408,1.0,3.0,No Comments
1349,234408,5.0,3.0,"Brosamer is VERY passionate about his subject.  I learned so much from his class.  More than I evcer wanted to know, but when I came out of his class I was very impressed with how much I knew.  His class made me more of a wordly person."
1350,234408,5.0,4.0,Great teacher. Very helpful and fair.
1351,234408,4.5,3.0,"Professor who's passionate about his material (Middle Ages & Shakespeare) and he really knows his stuff. A bit disorganized, often late to class, takes forever to return papers/exams, but overall a great class. Doesn't assign excessive reading/homework."
1352,234408,5.0,5.0,"Read, read, read, write a paper, read, read, read, take a test, read, right a paper, read, read, read, read, nap, read, read, read, take the final, GO DRINKIN'!!!"
1353,1889192,1.5,3.0,"Does not explain assignments. Forgets assignments. Forgets how she explained assignments. Talks down to you. Treats you like a child. Dismisses you if you correct her. Teaches things that are not relevant to a real classroom. Wastes most class on her ""Soap Box"". Does not respond to email. Takes points away from students for technology use in class."
1354,1889192,4.0,2.0,As long as you turn in your assignments and participate in class you should be fine. 
1355,39856,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bryson is awesome! He's done a great job adapting discussions to the zoom format and makes sure everyone gets a chance to talk. He's given me so much good feedback and he truly cares about his students! He also does a great job choosing books for class, especially by women and POC. I haven't finished his class yet but love it so far."
1356,39856,3.0,5.0,"Do not take him unless you are an english major. You will sit in class and wonder why you are even there. devotes entire class meetings to useless ""discussions""that are sometimes inappropriate for school and pointless. Does not plan lectures ahead of time and tends to ""wing it"" by reading passages aloud and then forcing discussion. do not recommend"
1357,39856,2.0,5.0,He is a tough grader. He sticks to the syllabus.
1358,39856,2.5,3.0,"5H is based on literary analysis, so if you do not enjoy writing Lit papers turn back now! That being said  5H was a pretty good class. The books that Dr. Bryson assigns are the most interesting books I've read in quite some time. Dr. Bryson's lectures on the material were also pretty great. However, he is a harsh grader, so follow all suggestions!"
1359,39856,4.0,4.0,"He expects you to follow directions and do what you are told, which is not necessarily bad. He intends to have you do what he wants how he wants it. He can be vague, but you are allowed to ask as many questions as you would like. He is tough on grading, but his feedback is helpful. READING IS ESSENTIAL."
1360,39856,3.5,4.0,"Bryson's class was pretty difficult, but he helped me become a better writer. He is very specific of how he wants things done, and doesn't really give room to be creative. That being said, make sure you do all the reading assignments and be prepared to work hard."
1361,39856,4.5,4.0,"Class was really fun and engaging. He's a great professor. I'm a really confident writer but he made my abilities even stronger. Picked some awesome literature to be covered in class, almost all were interesting. You should be ORIGINAL in class during discussions, he's more interested in good discussion with you than talking about the same stuff."
1362,39856,1.0,5.0,"With other professors if they’re fussy about your work or criticize you, most of the time you’ll concede they have a point but with but he would take issue with petty details and often not even try to understand you. He doesn’t just make hurtful comments to his students he will allow other students to attack each other. Class is mostly discussion."
1363,39856,4.5,2.0,"This class was easier than any high school class that I took, including AP Lit. He is a tough grader on essays, but he is fair and his critique makes you a better writer. Always read for the assigned reading, because he will quiz you. The reading quizzes are really easy points."
1364,39856,4.0,4.0,"This may be tough for some people, but always do the assigned readings. He quizzes you on it every morning. The questions aren't difficult if you're fully prepared. He grades hard on the essays but he is fair about it. There is also a group web project near the end of the semester and he will expect A LOT on that, so manage your time well."
1365,39856,4.5,3.0,Really great professor! I enjoyed his class and the books he uses are very interesting! =]
1366,39856,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Bryson is a great professor.  You really have to do the readings though and insure that it is careful and detailed reading because he will quiz you every class on every reading.  As long as you do the readings and participate, you will enjoy the class.  He is very helpful and always makes himself available for questions."
1367,39856,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bryson was, by far, one of my favorite English teachers. He is very helpful and really picks apart novels; giving them a whole new meaning. As long as you do the homework, come to class, show some interest, and get involved in his discussions, you will do great in the class."
1368,39856,4.5,5.0,"You learn a lot from Scott's classes.  Just make sure you follow his instructions completely and entirely.  He is also very helpful with assignments, if you ask ahead of time.  Never miss a class."
1369,39856,4.0,5.0,Full of information.  Sometimes difficult to know what he wants.  Unforgiving with late work turned in.
1370,39856,2.0,1.0,doesnt he look exactly like conan o brien&#63;
1371,39856,1.0,1.0,can you believe he had the nerve to say the college hired him because hed add culture to the school&#63; hes a white male&#63; how diverse is that at a womans college&#63; and why is he teaching latina literature&#63;
1372,39856,4.5,4.0,Loved the class!  He is a great teacher who really challenges his students.  He also encourages class discussions that make the class interesting.
1373,39856,4.0,4.0,"Tough grader, but he taught me a lot. I think he's a great teacher and his grading isn't too bad if you read what he tells you to. The quizzes aren't hard at all. Just basic stuff."
1374,39856,5.0,5.0,He's an awasome teacher he's tuff but very good teachign skills highly recommend
1375,39856,2.0,5.0,very arrongant teacher needs to go take a hike! What a pathetic looser.
1376,39856,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor.  Loves his subject and it permeates through his teaching.  Wants his students to succeed.  Need to communicate with him consistently to get great feedback from him. Very direct in what he's looking for.  Tough grader.  Prepare to work hard.
1377,39856,5.0,5.0,Prof. Bryson is very knowledgeable and very demanding.  You will gain a deeper understanding of English Literature if you are ready for the challenge.  You will also become a better writer.  Be prepared to work hard and the experience will be rewarding.
1378,39856,2.0,3.0,"Yeah, he's full of himself.  Everyone knows this.  But the reading material is usually interesting, so just try to avoid personal contact and you'll be fine. And about his grading...just make sure you do your reading and its not bad."
1379,39856,3.5,4.0,It was actually thru his class I became a better writer in papers. His class forced me to become a better writer. He DID help me (somewhat) when I went to him. But for little things he wants you to go to the Learning Center 4 help and that's understandable. I like the books he chooses 4 class.
1380,39856,5.0,5.0,"Excellent teacher!! He challenges us to read and write at the level that all college level students should be in, and accepts nothing less. He gives lots of reading assignments, but nothing that can not be done. Anyone who expects to sleep through classes should not register for any of his!"
1381,39856,1.0,1.0,I will never take a class with this man ever again. I got an A- so it's not about the grade. He is not a good listener and I did not learn much.
1382,39856,4.0,4.0,"He was cool, I think that he picks good books but he is a very harsh grader. He bases his grades on daily quizes...."
1383,39856,1.0,5.0,"Narcissistic, blowhard!  Thinks he sets the world on fire and acts like he is a major figure in the field.  Avoid at all costs . . . unless you want to hold the mirror for him as he looks at himself and self-proclaims &quot;greatness.&quot;"
1384,39856,1.0,3.0,Is the Mount crazy...this guy is a nut.  I will take my class from anyone else but him.....he is too into himself
1385,39856,1.0,3.0,"Obnoxious, not helpful at all, just an unpleasant person. Gives low grades (unless you are his pet) and has 0 suggestions on how to improve papers. Only way to get a decent grade in his class is to really, really, kiss his ass."
1386,39856,1.0,3.0,Boring. Subjective. Ripped into my essay tests w/ little clarification. Based the whole grade on 3 tests. Not understanding of personal issues. Wouldn't offer an audit at the end of the semester when a family member fell very ill.
1387,39856,1.0,3.0,totally into himself...zero help and very subjective.never again
1388,39856,1.0,5.0,"This teacher completely ripped my papers, but he did not offer any ideas on how to improve on them."
1389,39856,1.0,5.0,If you are looking for a course where you learn about his life and nothing else this course is the one for you. He will only help you if it does not interfere with his personal life.
1390,2100145,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Reguant encourages students to be better, open writers in this class as you spend the semester writing your autobiography. She is a difficult grader, but she will help as needed. Though she is well meaning, she tended to be pushy towards me about opening up about detailed, traumatic experiences."
1391,2100145,3.0,4.0,Overall I enjoyed the class and the topics covered but there are too many assignments due every week. It is a very time consuming class and I don't recommend taking it if you have a lot of units. Quiz and three discussion boards per week. As well as midterm essay/multiple choice and other assignments. Good Luck!
1392,2100145,3.5,4.0,"I was disappointed with this course due to the amount of reading spent on a textbook, rather than practicing writing skills since it is a writing lab. To make this short and simple, I like Dra. Reguant as a person, but not as an instructor. She has high expectations which are not bad, but she is not very clear about what she expects."
1393,2100147,4.5,2.0,"Professor Fredrickson is great! Textbook assigned was easy to read and to the point. Some of the religions that were lectured include Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity, Judaism, Taoism, etc. Guest speakers came to class, the papers assigned were short and simple, one group project and no exams more like reviews. She is very easy going and clear."
1394,721848,2.0,4.0,"Though she does provide extra credit her grading policy is unfair. She grades work based on her liking and if it is not up to her standards you will sometimes not receive any credit for at least doing the assignment. The lectures are also very boring and she talks completely too fast all over the place, sometimes becoming confusing."
1395,721848,5.0,3.0,"taken a bunch of classes w Roberts, she's a gem! very insightful and understanding. best way to reach is email. lots of reading but it's interesting! exams are all written essay, based on readings and lectures so PAY ATTENTION. make sure to have good writing skills, get to know her, it's totally worth it."
1396,721848,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Roberts is clearly interested in her line of research and encourages students to be informed about global issues, especially as women. Most of the grades come from tests, which are based on the many articles and chapters that she assigns for reading. Even when going remote for half of the semester, she was still engaged with students."
1397,721848,3.0,2.0,"Roberts is a cool professor she is passionate about the topic she teaches and tries to engage everyone in class. She does not provide a lot of assignments, but she does give out a lot of text she expects you to read, but tbh I never read any of the books/ text &amp; I still manage to pass with a good grade."
1398,721848,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Robert's is one of the best professors, if not the best, that I have ever had! She is so engaging with students and truly shows that she wants us to learn. She is very easy going. She is always willing to help you if you need an extra push. As long as you pay attention and take notes during lecture then you should be fine!"
1399,721848,5.0,3.0,A wonderful professor at MSMC one of my favorites. I have taken numerous classes with her and she will teach at more of a graduate level. You MUST do all the readings for the class and listen in her lectures because her exams are essay style and will deeply incorporate the texts as well as her lecture notes. If you need any help understanding anything she is there for you. Its most important to her that her students walk away having understood the relevance behind the discussions of global politics. 
1400,721848,5.0,3.0,"Very good professor. Assigns a lot of reading and a paper at the end of the semester. If you don't get something, she is more than willing to help you understand the material. As long as you read and take notes, you should be fine."
1401,721848,5.0,3.0,"She's an amazing teacher. I've taken multiple classes with her and really enjoyed all them. She does expect you to actually do the reading and there is a lot of it, but as long as you keep up with the assignments you'll do fine!"
1402,721848,4.5,4.0,I TOOK DR. ROBERTS FOR GLOBALIZATION. SHE IS A WONDERFUL TEACHER AND ENJOYS WHEN THE CLASS PARTICIPATES IN THE LECTURE! IF YOU DO YOUR READING YOU WILL DO GREAT!!!
1403,721848,5.0,3.0,"She is such as great teacher, very passionate and knowledgable.  You MUST do all the readings and work fo class though, and do not get behind."
1404,721848,4.0,5.0,"She is a Great Professor! you MUST do the reading, she is challeging, speaks rapidly, but is very fun, and intuative."
1405,721848,4.5,4.0,"Comparative Govt & Politics- Great professor really interested in what she is teaching, but you must must must must must do all the reading (and that is a lot of reading) to do well. It is very possible, just know it's going to be a lot of reading and work."
1406,721848,4.5,3.0,No Comments
1407,721848,4.0,4.0,"Great class, but make sure to do all of the reading! Lots of material covered, but fun."
1408,1180604,5.0,1.0,"The syllabus is very detailed and a bit intimidating.  Follow it and you should be fine. Professor Sanborn always seems to be in her office.  She even came in to meet with me at 6:00AM one day.  She is very fair.  She is accommodating when there are family emergencies, but is not a push over.  Be honest and work hard and you'll do well."
1409,1180604,1.0,5.0,"SAVE YOURSELF AND DO NOT TAKE HER. Think you have an opinion? Think again, not in her class!"
1410,1180604,4.5,3.0,"I was not very interested in the topic before the semester began, but came away very interested in bioethics.  Prof. S really makes you think outside the box and beyond what society say is acceptable.  Although this is a religion class, you don't have to be religious or Christian to be successful. I highly recommend her class."
1411,1180604,3.0,2.0,"Professor Sanborn may seen tough at first (since her first lecture is ALL about plagiarism, and apparently you can plagiarize yourself BUT overall she has a good point. Sanborn explains things in various ways-you just need to do the readings (or skim) atleast read the titles! OH BTW learn proper Turabian Citations. :)"
1412,1180604,4.0,2.0,"She is an excellent professor. There are essays that are about 15-20% of your grade. Make sure to use quotes and properly reference them. There are quizzes on reading, but for our class it was only in the beginning of the year. Make sure to participate in-class."
1413,1180604,5.0,4.0,"Professor (soon to be Dr.) Sanborn is great!Despite what everyone says below, don't be frightened by her class.She is willing to help those who ask for help, gives extra credit and all you have to do in class is read ahead,show up and participate at least once to get points.The papers are worth a lot so put in the effort and you'll end up w/ an A/B"
1414,1180604,1.0,5.0,"She is a HORRIBLE teacher! The average curve grade in our class was a C. She is extremely hard and is very very unfair on her grading! I am going to complain to the dean at the university. Please future students, stay away from her class."
1415,1180604,1.0,5.0,"I am going to have this professor investigated by the Board of education. She knows nothing about the subject taught and only speaks about &quot;personal experiences.&quot; She took off points because I was late, and another student who was ABSENT got a perfect attendance grade! She plays favorites, and is VERY HARD! She should not be teaching at all!"
1416,1180604,1.0,5.0,"She is a horrible teacher! She picks favorites and spends most of the lecture talking about her &quot;personal experiences,&quot; never teaches out of the text book, but all her tests and quizzes are on them. She knows absolutely nothing about the subject she teaches, and if she doesn't like you, she will fail you. Stay Away! She is crazy!"
1417,1180604,1.0,5.0,"She is a horrible teacher. She picks favorites and grades on how well she likes you and not on the content. She is very hard, and unless you memorize every word in the chapters you will fail her class. I plan on writing a complaint about her to the dean. Her grading scale is very unreasonable. And she takes off an entire grade for stupid things."
1418,1180604,5.0,3.0,"In the beginning I hated her class, failed most of the weekly quizzes.  If you do good on both papers you will be fine!  We did have a midterm and an optional final.  They were pretty easy since she gives you the questions before hand.  If you do take her, it all works out well in the end.  I had a D/F for half of the semester, my final grade, an A"
1419,1180604,2.5,4.0,Starts every class with a prayer. Unless you are a devout Catholic you are going to have problems. Read the text and the powerpoints because thats what the quizzes consist of. Also make sure you say something every class session. As long as you are polite and strong with your beliefs it is possible to pass. I did and I am a heathen!
1420,1180604,1.0,5.0,"I like how she opens up with prayer and her enthusiasm and that's about it. Her quizes in the beginning were unfair, unless you memorized everything you read or are a religous nut. Later she made them written. She grades highly on participation. She fails to grade students correctly on case studies, she is unfair. This teacher picks favorites. She"
1421,1180604,5.0,2.0,Her class is very interesting and engaging. And no studying for the exams or finals!The we have weekily quizzes but they are not worth much points. just do well in two major assignment and you will get an A. we had a take home finalthat i finished in two hours.She's so cool!
1422,1180604,3.0,4.0,"She's very religious so if you're not into that, you will not like this class. Her weekly quizzes asked for verbatim quotes from the text--that's crazy! She does listen to the students' feedback, though. The subject is interesting and saves the whole course."
1423,1180604,2.0,5.0,GEEZ!! DONT TAKE HER!! SHEZ FRICKEN NUTS!! Her TESTS are hard! She would ask questions that are unreasonable! You would have to spend more time studying and reading for her class than your care plans!!!
1424,342977,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Boutrous is an awesome, friendly professor interested in seeing her students succeed in the practice of mock appellate advocacy. From beginners to returning students, she is patient with them all. As for grading, she does base the grade on mostly 2 exams and one final appellate brief, so make sure that you are thorough in your writing."
1425,342977,5.0,3.0,The BEST teacher in the entire world. She really cares about her students and will do anything to help you succeed if you make the effort. She is the best advisor and mentor. Even if you're not pre-law or poli sci i totally recommend taking at least one class with her your time at the mount.
1426,342977,5.0,3.0,LOVE DR. B!!!! SHE KNOWS HER MATERIAL AND ENGAGES THE CLASS IN STIMULATING CONVERSATION. SHE IS NOT ONLY A GREAT PROFESSOR BUT A GREAT ADVISOR AS WELL. SHE ONLY ASSIGNS ONE PAPER AND TWO SHORT ANSWER EXAMS SO YOU HAVE TO BE ON TOP OF YOUR STUFF! OVERALL DR. BOUTROUS IS A PASSIONATE PROFESSOR AND IT SHOWS WHEN SHE PRESENTS THE MATERIAL!
1427,342977,5.0,4.0,"DR. B is AWESOME! She is both my professor and adviser and I don't think I would want anyone else guiding me through my college career! Dr. B is very sweet, intellectual, and very professional on all levels! She is really passionate about teaching Politics and very knowledgeable of the subject. She is always out for your best interest. Best @ MSMC!"
1428,342977,5.0,2.0,Her lectures are enough to get through the class if paid very godd attention too. Great professor!
1429,342977,2.0,4.0,"People say she's easy, she's not. I don't have interest in political science. Majority of the class we're pol sci majors. Favored them over others. Tests are ALL ESSAY FORMAT @ short answer. Can't bs in this class. No hw or quizzes so you have to do well on 3 tests or your screwed."
1430,342977,5.0,3.0,"Professor Boutrous enjoys teaching her political science classes. She is very interested in the subject and can get way ahead of herself in debates and candidacies. She does refer a lot to the textbook, so if you want an A in her class you must take very good notes and read the text thoroughly."
1431,342977,5.0,3.0,great professor. take notes. all tests are with blue books.
1432,342977,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Boutrous is the best professor at MSMC. I've taken several of her classes and I am still amazed by this woman. She is so intelligent, professional, and responsible. Although her courses are difficult if you put in the effort it is definitely possible to get A's. TAKE HER CLASSES! It'll be the best thing you ever did."
1433,342977,5.0,4.0,she is amazing...never had a prof that made a class as interesting as she does! id come to the mount just for her!
1434,342977,5.0,5.0,Dr. Boutrous is the best!! I have taken her for alot of my Political Science classes and I just fall more in love with my major!! She is very helpful and wont let you down when you need that help.
1435,342977,5.0,3.0,Excellent
1436,342977,5.0,3.0,Amazing
1437,342977,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher. When she walks into the room, you just can't look away. Her lectures are never boring. If you pay loads of attention to her lecture than the exams will be easy."
1438,342977,5.0,3.0,she is the absolute best prof. for tests just listen to the lecture and you will be fine. Highly recommend her...if you are not a poli sci major you should at least take one class with her...you'll switch
1439,342977,5.0,1.0,The best teacher at the MSMC!
1440,342977,5.0,1.0,Brilliant teacher!
1441,342977,5.0,1.0,GREAT !!!
1442,342977,5.0,2.0,"Dr. B is awesome, she is always there for her students, her class may be difficult, but she is always there for you, she will work with you and try her hardest to help you do well."
1443,342977,5.0,3.0,"Best professor ever, she is the complete package rolled into one. She is challenging, but in a good way. She is incredibly intelligent, she knows everything there is to know about law and politics, and she makes everything so interesting because she walks into class like it is a court room and makes you pay attention to her with her charming witt."
1444,342977,5.0,2.0,"Moot court is great and she makes learning all the objections, rules and demeanor in the court interesting. She is very helpful and a great teacher, you feel that she's on the ball and knows what she's talking about"
1445,342977,5.0,2.0,"She's a geat professor, I love her way of teaching. She keeps her students interested."
1446,342977,5.0,3.0,"Great Prof.... She makes her class very interesting, and she throws out topics that really makes you think outside the box!!!!!!"
1447,342977,5.0,3.0,Really clear and very passionate about her work in law and politics.
1448,342977,5.0,3.0,"Very good professor, tests are based on lectures &amp; text. You will diffinetly learn alot from her. She is also very fun and funny."
1449,342977,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher and great lecturer. The tests are a little difficult so you really have to study hard, but it is very possible to get an &quot;A.&quot;"
1450,342977,5.0,2.0,"Okay, such a fun class! Very interesting, cool project with the debate. Lots of notes, tests are based on the lectures. Hard tests, but fun class and cool professor!"

1453,342977,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Slightly hard tests. Lots of fun. Very informed. Great lectures, very interesting."
1454,2118611,2.0,3.0,"She talks SO incredibly fast! I could not follow along when in class, so I was forced to rely on my own reading when taking quizzes. She does not post grades online when you need her to, no matter how much you beg. Weeks can go by before you see a grade from the start of the semester."
1455,2118611,4.0,3.0,"C'mon Coello! Really, you don't have that many reviews, yet? Here goes: Professor Coello cares about her students; she has your back. Oh, the shade she will THROW if she knows that a professor is not being fair! She is such a sweetheart.  Yes, she does get flustered a lot, and she talks fast. However, she's there for you; you can learn from her."
1456,2118611,3.0,3.0,"Professor Coello talks really fast during her lectures, so be sure to hone your note-taking skills because it is one of the only ways you'll remember what she says.  She can be frustrating because she expects a lot of you, but she also understands that you're one person.  She is not that patient; her timing isn't great. However, her class is doable"
1457,2118614,2.0,3.0,while it seems she has a good heart I don't know If it's the heart of a teacher. tends to come off aggressively to some questions and it is easy too feel judged. Goes on tangents very frequently which can make it hard to focus on the subject matter and absorb any class-related content. Wouldn't recommend taking if you actually want to learn. 
1458,2118614,1.0,2.0,"super weird. never explained anything! she would answer aggressively when you had a question. literally wouldn't assign homework, but then assign 100 assignments in one week due back to back! "
1459,2118614,4.0,4.0,Professor Khamou is extremely knowledgeable and is very efficient in getting the tough concepts across. She can come off and a bit cold/mean but I think that’s just her personality and nothing to take to heart. The class is difficult but she makes it do-able. I would recommend! 
1460,2118614,1.0,3.0,"Khamou is a cool professor up until it's lecture time. She goes off a lot of tangents. If you take her, be prepared to teach yourself. Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you don't attend class you will not know what's happening."
1461,2118614,2.0,2.0,"Lectures/zoom meetings only help when she does worksheets but she rants/goes off topic way too often so it extends how long we spend on each chapter. She can be rude at times, the work and tests/quizzes she gives are easy, but she doesn't grade homework or worksheets on time."
1462,2118614,2.0,1.0,"Khamou is an okay professor, in lab she always came late &amp; starting ranting about random things leading us to start lab late &amp; end late. When the fire happened she when MIA &amp; at the end of the semester she gave everyone B+ for lab. She also have favorite students, she never remembered my name &amp; always called me friend or aren't you ___ friend."
1463,2118614,4.0,3.0,"Professor Khamou is not a difficult professor. However, she is kind of rude sometimes and rants way too much. She was also always late to class. I dreaded going to lecture because it did not help much. Just learn how to use all the equations in chemistry and physics. She only grades the homework (for each chapter), two quizzes and two exams."
1464,2118614,5.0,4.0,"If given the chance, take Professor khamou! She is one of the few in the department that ACTUALLY cares about her students future and shes very helpful. She is a great advisor as well and very approachable! Dont be afraid to ask her for help or introduce yourself!"
1465,2118614,3.0,2.0,"She is a great professor, knows her stuff however takes her time. Goes off on a lot of tangents. My anxiety got worse in her class because she wouldn't just get to the point. She has strong opinions don't let her downgrade you."
1466,2118614,2.0,3.0,"Took a class along with her lab a couple of years ago... she talks way too much, goes way off topic and then complains when students get bored and use their phones. The only thing I would say that sucks is how easily distracted she gets. Her grading isnt too bad and overall she cares about her students."
1467,2118614,4.0,4.0,"I don't recommend taking this class along with another class. It's easy to fall behind in an accelerated class like this when you have a lot of reading to do and group assignments to turn in multiple times per week. She's clear with grading. Two exams, a final, and quizzes for every section."
1468,2118614,4.0,5.0,Professor Khamou is very caring and will help you if you ask she will have office hours by appointment. Read the book and study the slides she provides you with. You will really have to work for your grade she isn't an easy a but will prepare you for things such as medical school.
1469,2118614,5.0,4.0,"I took the Scientific Concepts online course with professor Khamou. I must say this class was intimidating since I always feared Chemistry and I had never taken Physics before, but she provided me with the resources necessary. I won't say it was easy, but I worked hard for my grade. Professor Khamou is quick to reply and gives great feedback!"
1470,2118614,5.0,5.0,"Professor khamou is a fantastic and kind science professor. Her class requires plenty of dedication and commitment to studying and reviewing the material that you learned in class. She does expect students to participate in class, therefore pay attention because she may call on you. Take the homework packets seriously and do not be absent to class"
1471,2118614,5.0,5.0,"Professor khamou is a fantastic and kind science professor. Her class requires plenty of dedication and commitment to studying and reviewing the material that you learned in class. She does expect students to participate in class, therefore pay attention because she may call on you. Take the homework packets seriously and do not be absent to class!"
1472,2118614,5.0,4.0,"She is amazing!  If you pay attention in class, ask tons of questions, study her lectures and past exams you are golden!  Her exams are very straightforward, if you study what you are supposed to, you will do well.  Focus is more on application of material than concepts."
1473,2118614,1.0,5.0,She is not available for outside help.
1474,2118614,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Khamou makes sure you understand the material.  If you're not the best with chemistry or physics, take her because she will make sure you understand the fundamentals before proceeding.  She was fantastic!"
1475,2118614,4.0,2.0,"Professor Khamou is one of those who try to be funny, but the fact that she's trying is funnier than the joke, itself.  She might go on a tangent, but she stays on track trying to make sure that you understand chemistry and physics.  She's a professor that wants you to try.  She won't shame you if you need help, and she's aware that you have a life"
1476,1539032,5.0,2.0,"She gives essays, but they're doable. She clarifies what she wants in the essay as well. She's very nice, but be sure to do the assignments and homework she gives!! I enjoy her class although there will be times where it can be a little boring. In addition, she'll tell you what the midterm and final will be on. She's a really good teacher!"
1477,1539032,5.0,2.0,"she was really cool, except that she gives you to much essays to do. Then someonetimes you have to rewrite it. also, her finals and midterms are so dumb because they are from lectures she gave us that she didn't really specify on"
1478,2184159,4.0,2.0,"He's a really good professor! Really teaches you what you should know for the tests during his presentations. If you study his powerpoints, you will be able to pass the weekly quizzes and the midterms. Also curves the midterms really well to help boost up your grade."
1479,1479651,1.0,5.0,"Do not take Comiso for lab. She NEVER explained ANYTHING and when you asked for help, she never really helped you. I would recommend taking Turjman for lab instead"
1480,1479651,4.0,3.0,"I had Comiso for Micro Lec &amp; honestly it wasn't that bad. She's super nice &amp; if you are ever confused she'll take the time to explain. As long as you do the study guides, you'll pass. Everything you need to know for quizzes and exams are on those study guides. You have to stay on top of your material &amp; study, but I'd definitely take her again."
1481,1479651,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Comiso is caring and considerate. I had her for lecture and lab. Both classes were asynchronous. Attendance isn't mandatory, but attending them is helpful. Dr. Comiso knows what she's talking about and is very willing to help her students understand the material, just reach out. Her exams are straight to the point. Study and you'll pass."
1482,1479651,3.0,4.0,"She's a nice teacher. Her class is pretty difficult, didn't really learn anything. She gives a lot of homework and I'm not even sure if her tests relate to the work."
1483,1479651,4.0,3.0,I took Dr. Comiso for microbio lab and lecture and received As in both of her classes. She is super sweet and always willing to answer questions. Her lectures can be very unclear at times as she trips over her words often but her tests are never out of the ordinary from the material she goes over and assigns. Just study well and you will pass!
1484,1479651,1.0,3.0,"Professor who teaches primarily lower division biology courses for nursing teaching an upper division biology course to bio students? Was confused often on what she was explaining herself, read off figures, I can do that myself. I wish the biology department would have gotten our regular biology professors to teach not a nursing professor."
1485,1479651,1.0,3.0,Had not taught Immunology in years and decided to teach Fall of 2018. She definitely needed a refresher because she could never answer students questions. I would never take this professor again she is not a good lecturer. BEWARE! Take course somewhere else if you can.
1486,1479651,3.0,5.0,"Maybe this was her first time teaching an online class. Who knows, but tests were extremely hard and irrelevant to the readings. She did not use a textbook, but maybe that would have been better than the free online material as it was too broad and difficult to navigate. HW and discussions were interesting,but would not recommend this class online."
1487,1479651,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Comiso is best! She's really sweet! I had her for Microbio Lab and she really wants everyone to do well in her class. As long as you write enough for the lab reports and study all the labs needed for the midterm and final, you should be okay. Make sure to study every aspect of the background, procedure, and results of each experiment!"
1488,1479651,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Comiso is the BEST. She is very clear and provides in death explanations and is so interested in what she teaches! She is always willing to help and always offers office hours, so take advantage! A lot of dense material and diseases, etc. but it is doable and really fun. Great experience, would definitely take her again, she is so great!!"
1489,1479651,5.0,3.0,"Comiso is a great professor. She is always there to help you when you need it. The class itself is really fun. Make sure you do the reading beforehand though, because she does often give pop quizzes."
1490,1479651,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Comiso is AMAZING! She is very clear in what she wants. Study the slides and take notes in lecture and you'll pass. If you don't get an A, it really is something that you aren't doing. Easiest pre-nursing science hands down. "
1491,1479651,4.5,1.0,"Dr. Comiso is a great teacher. Her tests and quizzes are very easy if you retain info from slides. She does not go into too much detail on certain concepts, which is nice. Study the slides thoroughly and passing will not be a problem. Many opportunities for points in this class. Show up to class because participation accounts for much of the grades"
1492,1479651,2.5,2.0,"Attendance is MANDATORY and really helps with your grade. Her tests and quizzes are easy, but her class is VERY boring. Tests&quizzes are based on lecture slides. Memorize them and you'll do fine. Don't wait till the night before to study though, it's A LOT of material."
1493,1479651,4.0,4.0,"Comiso is a pretty good teacher. Compared to the other microbiology teacher, she's a saint! All quizzes and tests are based MOSTLY ON POWERPOINTS! use the book only as a reference, otherwise you'll end up going too in depth on subjects and you will lose the general idea."
1494,2143220,3.0,4.0,"Her class was pretty difficult. I especially hated the multi-part weekly discussion posts that were only worth 5 points. They took me anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours or so to complete, only for 5 points. It seems ridiculous. However, she had good informative PowerPoints, and they helped a lot with the tests."
1495,2143220,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Yusim was not the greatest professor I took. Her wifi was bad all the time, so she would cancel the class, or it would take her forever to fix it while she was teaching. Her instructions were at times unclear, which made it hard to complete assignments. There was always a lot of homework to do and people were confused half of the time in class."
1496,1496083,2.5,2.0,"I would say her class is not hard. There is one field trip to a museum, then you have to write a short paper. The majority of her lecture is picture of art. To pass her quizzes, mostly study the pictures, dates, and artists. "
1497,1496083,2.5,4.0,"Her class is so boring, she does not try to make it interesting. Her so called ""quizzes"" are more like exams!"
1498,1496083,1.5,4.0,"Dont take her class!! avoid her class,take something else its not worth it.her lectures are all powerpoint,she makes the class go super slow. and does not make art sound interesting at all!"
1499,1496083,4.5,1.0,"Only uses powerpoints which can be boring. But she is nice, she will help if you talk to her. Highly recommend participating. Other than that she is not hard to pass be on time and participate if you want an A."
1500,662550,4.5,1.0,Professor Johnson made the class fun and inspired a lot of students with her many adventures and movies about the west. She is a great writer and allows you to re-write your papers for as long as you want till you get a perfect A. She also does not have any deadlines for homework so you could turn it in whenever you want. 
1501,662550,3.0,2.0,Prof. Johnson was a great!! truly recommend her. 
1502,662550,4.0,1.0,"English is really easy with Proff. Johnson! She always said ""Good Writing is Rewriting!"" She literally regrades your paper until you are happy with the grade you want to get! Although attendance is mandatory, They are simple lectures. I would definitely recommend you take her for English!  "
1503,662550,5.0,3.0,Professor Johnson is one of the best English teacher I've ever had. She makes English interesting and fun. We went a couple of times to watch a play and it was a great experience. These are not mandatory nor for credit but you will love going for your own knowledge. I can't wait to take another class with her.
1504,662550,3.5,2.0,"She is very cool, being a theatre person she is very mellow. You can tell she enjoys talking and lecturing in class, as she often talks about her own life. Overall very cool class, very chill, but she can be vague at times with assignments and midterms. Just pay attention and you will survive. Participation leads to a higher grade in class."
1505,662550,3.5,2.0,"Textbooks ARENT NEEDED. Make sure to listen to what she wants, and participate. Don't just sit in class and expect to get a good grade you need to voice your opinion and share your stories . A great class, not many assignments, very easy, enjoyable, but if your looking for a SUPER hard English class with tons of work probably not this one."
1506,662550,3.0,1.0,Prof. Johnson is very sweet. Her beginning lectures and teachings on gangs and prison was SUPER interesting. At times she talks about herself the entire class time but only because most don't participate in the convo's. I myself ALWAYS would participate in discussions in her class. She's an easy A if you participate and get involved in class!
1507,662550,2.0,1.0,"Grade teacher, talks about her life and lets you out early. No textbook needed,attend class because she is entertaining. Such a sweet professor. No due dates until end of semester."
1508,662550,2.0,4.0,She talks a lot and nothing is really based on anything that we did in class. It is an easy class but you do have to make sure you are always there and do everything she asks. Make sure to participate it will help your grade. Even though you hardly have work make sure you do absolutely everything she ever said to you.
1509,662550,5.0,1.0,One of the most amazing professors I've ever taken. She will teach you a lot more than English and is challenging but makes you reach your full potential. She has a world of knowledge about EVERYTHING! You leave her class wanting to take more of her classes whether or not you need them.
1510,662550,4.5,1.0,She is too easy. All you have to do is attend class and listen. I went to her office every chance i could and that also what helped me pass ! Take her !
1511,662550,5.0,4.0,No Comments
1512,662550,3.0,1.0,She lectures ost of the time. She isn't a tough grader. As long as you turn everything in on time and you show up on time you will be fine.
1513,2065431,5.0,2.0,"I had Professor Dinsmore for FYS, and his class was very easy. No exams or quizzes. Just written assignments and participation proof for attending workshops and events. Very kind Professor and cares for his students. Easy to get an A if you just do the pretty simple assignments and attend class. Very reachable and understanding."
1514,2065431,5.0,1.0,"Amazing teacher! Super easy, funny, and great class. I would take it all over again because he made English enjoyable."
1515,2065431,5.0,3.0,"Professor Dinsmore is so understanding. He really loves when students participate in class. He is super engaging, and I never found his lectures boring. His essays were very interesting to do, and he is always open to help with your work if you need it! I highly recommend him."
1516,2065431,5.0,1.0,"He is such a great Professor highly recommend, he is helpful with giving out feedback with your essays. He keeps the class interesting as well, never a boring class."
1517,2065431,5.0,4.0,"Hes very interested about what he teaches and has great energy. Youll love the class, I took him for both semesters my first year and I dont regret it was an amazing class and would definitely take him again."
1518,2065431,5.0,2.0,"Professor Dinsmore is a real gem. Hes funny and offers great feed back. He even makes lectures interesting by changing up his voice, similar to role play. Expect to write some papers but theyre never too difficult. Dinsmore is a sold choice, hes great."
1519,2065431,5.0,2.0,I love Dinsmore he has made a big positive impact on my academic education I wish I could have him for the rest of my college years ! Best professor hands down .
1520,2065431,4.0,1.0,Very chill teacher! He gives great advice on papers
1521,2065431,5.0,3.0,Professor Dinsmore is a great English professor. I enjoyed taking his class because I learned so much about grammar and structuring essays. I enjoyed the positive academic environment and his funny jokes.
1522,2065431,5.0,2.0,"Took him for 6A and 6B, definitely a great professor! There are weekly discussion posts/reflections based on credit or no credit. Grade is based on basically  two essays assigned the whole semester. Everything is straightforward on the syllabus, and the class focuses on other essays as well as watching movies and documentaries. Easy A class!"
1523,2065431,5.0,2.0,"Glad I took him for both 6A and 6B. Both courses are based on books that have articles and essays within them. You watch alot of movies/documentaries that make the class not boring. Homework are easy A submissions online credit or no credit and he only grades on  the 3 essays assigned the whole semester.  Easy class, very cool teacher."
1524,2065431,4.0,3.0,I would take him again his syllabus is pretty straight forward.
1525,2065431,4.0,3.0,Made himself available to help with essays. your whole grade is based on essays and attendance.
1526,2065431,5.0,2.0,"Not always that fond of English, it wasn't my best or worst subject. But he makes it a lot of fun to learn the subject definitely take him if you have the choice.! This won't be a stressful class as long as your'e in class do the 3 essays max that are double spaced on 3-4 pages and blogs you shall pass. By far one of my favorite teachers."
1527,547863,5.0,3.0,"Professor Patchell is a great professor. You can tell that he is passionate about what he does and he is very understanding and cares for his students. I highly recommend taking one of his courses, I learned a lot and I enjoyed attending class."
1528,547863,5.0,3.0,"The workload is very manageable, the professor is good at teaching the material, and the lectures are great. There are opportunities to improve your essays in class, the readings are interesting, and this class helps you understand important writing and readings techniques. Lastly, he is a lot of fun!"
1529,547863,4.0,3.0,"Good teacher, straight forward class. He gives good readings and you can tell he cares and wants you to pass."
1530,547863,1.0,1.0,"If I were you, I would not take his class. Whenever I would comment on anything and it wasn't to his liking, he would put me down and poke fun at what I would say. Although, I was a hardworking student. He would usually put me down."
1531,547863,2.0,5.0,Terrible teacher. He makes you read lots of essays and expects you know how to write one. I did not learn anything from his busywork
1532,547863,4.0,3.0,"Sweet teacher, full of enthusiasm, possibly one of the funniest i have had.  Makes an english class totally fun to go to, infact, i have only missed one class all semester!"
1533,547863,5.0,3.0,very good teacher.keeps class entertaining.
1534,547863,5.0,2.0,"I actually took him at Cuesta Community College. He is such a good teacher I had to write about him here. He was so helpful, and he is very easy to talk to. I always got D- in English in high school, but with his help I had more confidence in my writing, and I received a B grade."
1535,547863,5.0,2.0,"His class is very cool. He's super funny, and very helpful. He gives good writting advice. He's alot of fun!"

1538,547863,5.0,3.0,"LOVE HIM, SUCH A NICE GUY.  Great professor, love his lectures he relates everything to us in order to make something easy to undestand. if your not gonna take a class with him, atlest get to know him, Love his kids too.  Now this is what professors should be all about."
1539,547863,5.0,4.0,"He is a hot Irish professor, besides that he was cool and helpful."
1540,547863,4.0,2.0,he was coo'
1541,547863,5.0,3.0,AWESOME PROF
1542,2612258,5.0,3.0,I had Dr. Andersen for physiology lab and I liked her a lot because she explained everything clearly. I suggest you pay attention to her lectures and handouts because they are basically the content you need for quizzes and exams. 
1543,2612258,4.0,4.0,"She is working in a medical environment and knows what she's doing. Her quizzes are hard (weekly) but the truth is you either know it or you don't. I finally was able to pick my grade from a C the 2nd 1/2 of the semester. If you take her, LISTEN even if it is 3 hr class and Quizlet is your BEST friend for identifying and SPELLING IS EVERYTHING!"
1544,2544674,1.0,5.0,She literally gives you 50 assignments a week. don't do it.
1545,902189,5.0,4.0,"I had taken chemistry twice in high school both regular and AP chem, but chemistry doesn't always stick after a few years. I personally do enjoy chemistry so I loved Deprele! Her class is difficult, but if you study and practice a lot you will do good! She is really nice so stop her when you don't understand. I recommend her!"
1546,902189,4.0,4.0,"Dr. D is very intimidating. However, she is the sweetest woman ever. She genuinely cares for her students and wants them to succeed. If she notices that you are not putting in enough effort, she will begin to focus her attention on students that are. She has high expectations, but this is what being a science major is. It only gets harder."
1547,902189,4.0,4.0,"Dr. D course is challenging but doable, for a intro chemistry class her class is an accurate insight on what is expected of you as a science major. If you don't like to ask questions in class and don't want to meet after hours then you will struggle in this class. She has a high expectation but she always wants her students to succeed. Take her!!"
1548,902189,1.0,5.0,Worse professor Ive ever taken at the mount. She expects you to already know the material. She skips through so many slides because theyre easy. She will sigh and roll her eyes if you dont understand something. Ive never seen a professor like this.
1549,902189,5.0,5.0,LOVE HER SO MUCH
1550,902189,4.5,4.0,Great professor
1551,902189,1.5,5.0,"Dr. Deprele really wants her student to understand the material, so class participation is a must. However, she does not teach. Her class is more like a problem solving class. She expects you to know the material before lecture. She has favorites. Her heavy French accent is not a problem, but she needs to speak louder. Extremely hard. Practice! X2"
1552,902189,1.0,4.0,Answer a question correctly? Get 520 for not writing an explanation on how you got the work even though your steps are ALL THERE. If I wanted to write essays I would've taken an English course. Gives no challenging questions during lecture but slams you with them on the exam. Advice for those who dread chemistry: PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE.
1553,902189,1.0,4.0,"Avoid this professor at all costs. She asks four hours minimum each week which makes sense since it's a ONE unit class. However to get an A you're going to have to make sure to bend over backwards to achieve the hours she wants. Don't bother going in after hours to do research because if she doesn't see it, then it never happened. Waste of time. "
1554,902189,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Deprele is one of my favorite teachers I have ever had. Yes, she is tough, yes, sometimes the material is hard. But she shows genuine care for her students; she is always willing to spend time in her office with you if you need extra help. Her quizzes and tests are difficult, you MUST study, but bonus problems are always given."
1555,902189,1.5,5.0,"She expects you to know everything right away. She does not come enthusiastic most of the time. She seems like she doesn't want to be there. Basically you learn on your own. She is nice when you go ask questions in her office. Nevertheless, learn from the book because that's what she uses for quizzes and exams! Overall horrible teacher!!!"
1556,902189,2.0,4.0,teacher is horrible. she expects you to know it off the bat. she is very intimidating and her quizzes are usually not what you learn in class. they are mainly questions from the text book. not a great teacher at all!
1557,902189,3.5,4.0,"Very intimidating. Expected everyone to know how to do problems she JUST taught. Thankfully she curves ALL quizzes AND tests. Study power points, a lot of questions come from there. my suggestion: GET A TUTOR!"
1558,902189,3.0,3.0,"Deprele is sweet, her accent is adorable. I think people overexagerrated her accent because I have bad hearing and yet I still understood her. Once she explains a concept and does an example it really is not that hard. Just make sure you ask her questions if you truly don't understand it. Other than that she will continue on with the lesson."
1559,902189,5.0,4.0,Greatest teacher at MSMC. All the other comments are from nursing students who don't want to work for anything.  Dr. Deprele is a great teacher who is very helpful and explains things perfectly.
1560,902189,2.5,5.0,Can be more helpful because class is difficult.
1561,902189,3.0,4.0,Cool. Nice to talk to. THe subject can just be draining if you're just there for a prereq instead of a genuine interest in physical science. Should be a breeze if you paid attention in physics and chemistry in high school.
1562,902189,1.5,4.0,"Very confusing teacher.  She doesn't explain things very well and a lot of the times she will ask her class to help her pronounce some of her words. (She has a French accent).  She assumes the class already knows the material and could never explain anything.  On the positive, her grading scale was easy."
1563,902189,5.0,4.0,"The topics-Physics and Chem. are pretty hard, but you need to study and do the work. For others it comes naturally. You have to show up to class b/c the lectures are important. She hands out her own notes and gives you exactly what will be on the quizes and tests. She is also easy to reach and very helpful. Great personality as well."
1564,902189,5.0,5.0,Very Nice and Smart
1565,902189,2.0,3.0,"she really does not explain the material in a good way. maybe its her acent, but she assumes like you already kno the material..you should just try to learn the material on your own."
1566,1864767,4.0,2.0,I took Professor Berry in a joint FYS accelerated course and she is great. Any time you have questions shes got answers and shes always willing to help.
1567,1864767,5.0,3.0,"I love going to Professor Berrys class! Shes hilarious and passionate. She truly cares that you learn what she teaches you. She makes English fun. If you take her class, expect the unexpected."
1568,1864767,4.0,2.0,Professor Berry is an amazing teacher who genuinely cares that her students succeed. She is engaging and fun but holds you accountable for doing your part. I am looking forward to taking another one of her classes.
1569,1864767,4.0,1.0,"Professor Berry is a sweetheart. She's a caring woman, and you should make time to talk to her and get to know her. If you're struggling to do work in her class (which you won't), talk to her and ask for help. She ended my class at 12:30 because she knew our cafeteria would get full by 1."
1570,1864767,5.0,1.0,Berry has a good sense of humor and she does not make the class boring at all. She responds to emails very quickly and she does her very best to help students.
1571,1864767,4.0,2.0,"Very chill, sarcastic, and funny. She is realistic and doesn't make you get all deep, more straight to the point. Gives great feedback on your essays and is super understanding if you do not understand the assignment, miss class, or miss a homework. I enjoyed her class because we read interesting stories. No quizzes or tests just essays."
1572,1864767,5.0,2.0,"She is the chillest teacher, and really funnyyyyyy!!! Just be nice to her she is an amazing professor!"
1573,1864767,5.0,3.0,"Professor Berry is the best! I learned a lot and loved going to class. She made poetry interesting. She's very knowledgeable and if you're not getting something, she will take extra time with you."
1574,1864767,5.0,2.0,Professor Berry is amazing! She is kind and considerate and makes the whole class intrigued in the subject. I wish she taught more classes at the mount. I am never bored in her class and she gets the entire class engaged in the subject. I would highly recommend taking her
1575,1864767,4.0,1.0,"Would take her again for any classes she teaches, like her style. I found the material on-line."
1576,1864767,3.0,3.0,"Boring class. We never knew what she was going to teach from day to day, she didn't even know. Seemed like she made it up as she went."
1577,1864767,2.5,1.0,"Professor Berry is really disorganized and she says a lot of inappropriate things. The class is easy but she takes forever to give you your grade on a speech. Do not waste your money buying the book, because she doesn't even use it. If you can, take Halperin for speech. Many of my friends had her and thtey really enjoyed her."
1578,2395201,5.0,5.0,Challenging course but very helpful professor
1579,795713,5.0,4.0,Professor Helston is a great professor! Pay attention to the syllabus because it is a crucial tool that can be used for success in his class. Attendance is a major factor in passing your course with a high grade! Be there every Friday for a problem sets! Take Aleks topics seriously because you are expected to do plenty of hours and work on it.
1580,795713,5.0,2.0,Helston deserves a PERFECT rating. He is hilarious and gives easy assignments. He is avaible during office hours and before class. He assigns group worksheets every Friday which he goes over and even gives an opportunity for extra credit if you volunteer to teach it to the class. Easy A ! You'll love him!
1581,795713,5.0,2.0,Professor Helston is there when you need help and helps clarify on problems.
1582,795713,4.5,4.0,"He expects a lot, but is willing to help. Very easy to access this professor and he explain things clearly with examples. Especially in office hours, email or one-on-one. If you ask for help you will get it, but expect to put in long hours on homework."
1583,795713,5.0,2.0,All you need is AlEKS.
1584,795713,5.0,4.0,"we used an online ""textbook"" called ALEKS"

1587,795713,5.0,4.0,"Josh saved my semester. He loves math and will help anyone that needs help, almost always available. His class room setting invites students to laugh and participate. In addition, he has his student do an online math program called ALEKS aka our ""boyfriend"" for the semester. It's a great program and Josh individually chooses each course."
1588,795713,5.0,3.0,"Josh is a great professor, he is available. He explains things in detail, fun, and exciting way. He loves math and applies math to aspects of daily life.

1595,795713,5.0,3.0,Great professor!

1610,844866,5.0,2.0,"I took her fys class online due to covid. Shes really nice and shes probably the only professor in this school that accepts late work and gives full credit. She did really interesting topics this year, such as BLM. Its an easy class and she doesnt ask for much honestly. She didnt make us buy any textbooks either."
1611,844866,4.0,3.0,Easy class. I took it as an FYS class so it was kind of boring because of the subject I chose to learn about. The class can get veryyyy boring.
1612,844866,5.0,2.0,Great teacher ! She really like it when you participate. She's the most understanding and really wants her students to succeed.
1613,844866,4.0,4.0,She really pushed me to write better essays. She gives great feedback and is very understanding.
1614,844866,4.0,3.0,"She is amazing! I received an A- in this class, but decided not to because of the schedule. Just attend the class, do the readings and you will be set. She makes the first draft be do on a certain day, where she gives you feedback with out it being graded, then in a week the final draft is do. It is a helpful process. "
1615,844866,4.0,3.0,"She is a good professor over all. I would say she is a easy teacher, as long you do most of the readings and you will be fine for the quizes. There will be a quiz every friday, so don't plan on skipping classes. "
1616,844866,4.5,2.0,"She is a great professor! We have discussion posts which are very easy points to get. Your textbooks will be your best friends because everything in the readings will be on the quizzes. She can be very picky when it comes to essays; however, her writing conferences are very helpful. Take her advice, edit your paper, and you will get a great score."
1617,844866,4.0,1.0,She was so easy! Her class was fun and easy. Shes so sweet and will help you whenever you need it. You have fun debates! Almost no homework and only two papers the whole semester. She is late to class like every day though! but other then that the class is an easy A!

1619,1391698,5.0,3.0,She helped me a lot when I asked questions
1620,1391698,1.0,1.0,"This teacher is a threat to the integrity and status of our school. Not only did i learn nothing the entire semester, she also did not help her students find a spot for the internship practi****that is a requirement to graduate. Needless to say, none of the people in our class have a spot. Take Shifrin instead, she's much better!"
1621,1391698,1.0,5.0,If you want a teacher that doesn't teach - take Dillard. If you want to learn absolutely nothing - take Dillard. If you want to feel bored - take Dillard. Beware of her. I've never had a worse teacher. She is dispicable.
1622,1391698,1.0,1.0,DO NOT TAKE DILLARD! BEWARE!!!
1623,1639511,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Nogaj is my favorite professor at the Mount. You will need to study a lottt. Ask if you can record her lecture. She allowed me to and tbh, it was very helpful. I mostly studied off her slides and listened to the recordings for explanations. Ask her for help when needed. She is really nice and wants you to do good!!"
1624,1639511,5.0,4.0,"super kind professor, always willing to help, totally worth getting to know so do it! office hours are always avail, PAY ATTENTION TO POWERPOINTS AND SLIDE TITLES, definitely helps on tests and with organizing info. She is really kind and always answers questions in class. Make sure to study, you will need to! Gives quiz hints during lecture."
1625,1639511,1.0,5.0,She expects you to know &amp; understand everything when you dont understand she replies with why/how come she even told a student she disappointed in them bc they got a B she over works us &amp; sometimes test us on thing we did not learn in class when we had a fire &amp; she still gave us tests and heavy lecture which lead most of the class to fail
1626,1639511,5.0,4.0,"OMG one of the best professors I met thus far. She is smart, funny, approachable, and willing to work with students. She actually cares about her student and the class. Everyone wants to be in her research."
1627,1639511,5.0,3.0,Great teacher!
1628,1639511,5.0,3.0,"Best professor ever. She is sweet and very approachable. However, you do always have to go to class. She hardly(mostly ever)takes role but her tests are only on the notes. You won't be totally lost though because she will recap the lecture on the next class. Her class is easy but dont let that fool you, you cannot pass her class if you dont study."
1629,1639511,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Nogaj is the 1st upper division professor I ever met with an open door policy. She is very nice & sweet but that doesn't mean she will hand you an A. Study everyday, take good notes, go to class, know the slides, reference the book, & visit her in her office! Her policy:&quot;I don't have a problem giving A's but I do have a problem giving F's&quot;!"
1630,1639511,5.0,2.0,"She is a good educator, though she is very nice.... and she might explain the material easy, one needs to be on top of thier game in this class. She loves when students ask question and come to her office."
1631,1639511,5.0,5.0,"An amazing professor. Very sweet and willing to help. In order to get an A, must be willing to attend class, take good notes, and memorize each and everydetails in her slides."
1632,2442331,5.0,3.0,Very kind and patient. If you struggle with math he's a good choice because he explains the material very clearly.
1633,2442331,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Nicholas Graham is one of my favorite professors thus far at the Mount. A lot of pop culture material and easy to understand lectures, especially if you fear math. Fear not however, he makes material in easy-to-digest chunks and makes statistics manageable. Plus, the man is hilarious and enjoys student participation. Attend Friday lectures!"
1634,2442331,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Graham is very knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches, he always seeks participation in his students! As long as you show up to class and practice the problems he gives, you should be fine. Very helpful and cares about his students. You do have to do well on the tests though, as it is a big part of your grade."
1635,2442331,5.0,3.0,Dr. Graham is a great professor and is good at lecturing. You can tell he likes his job and cares about the student's overall success. He's a great person! I would definitely take him again!
1636,2442331,5.0,4.0,"I truly enjoyed Dr. Graham's course. He is understanding &amp; lectures very well. Dr. Graham is very passionate about stats and definitely wants his students to learn the material and take everything to heart. At first, I was scared about taking stats because I believed I am not great with math, but this class gave me more confidence and I succeeded!"
1637,2219111,5.0,3.0,Professor Stern is very understanding and I truly enjoy her class! I hope I can take her class again! Just do the work and study everything she tells you too and you will do great!
1638,2219111,5.0,3.0,"Omg! Shes one of the best profs at the mount, def take her! She has weekly quizzes but theyre easy &amp; her lectures are so amazing, she loves when you engage in convo. What I enjoyed most was her passion for psych in general. Her exams are a little difficult but study and youll do fine"
1639,2219111,4.0,2.0,"She has quizzes after every 2 chapters, but they're only 10 questions. She can be a bit of a bore during lectures. Her exams are partner exams, so you can work with a friend when doing them."
1640,1969257,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Sadrpour is a good professor. She makes time to meet with you if you have any questions regarding her class. I took physiology and physiology lab with her. You need to study for the exams and quizzes; if you fail one exam, it will be challenging to raise your grade. Her courses are just very challenging if you do not study."
1641,1969257,1.0,5.0,I recommend you take another anatomy lab teacher!! Her quizzes and exams are hard. She is a sarcastic person who does not care for her students. I went to her office hours and she did not help. 
1642,1969257,3.0,5.0,You either know it or you don't. She gives trick questions. Her quizzes and exams are hard. Some of the questions she asked she didn't go over during the mini-lecture since she expect us to know it already. Tough grader.
1643,1969257,3.0,5.0,"super difficult! she is very precise, and wants everything perfectly. take at your own risk"
1644,1969257,5.0,2.0,"Professor Sadrpour is wonderful. She is very helpful if you ask questions and she is really nice. There are quizzes every week, so make sure you are prepared for them. Even though the class says it is 3 hours long, it usually isn't. we finish early and the labs are usually a lot of fun."
1645,1969257,3.0,4.0,"For the most part, she is very specific. Fast paced but a good teacher. NOTES ARE YOUR LIFE, she does power points but doesn't post them but lets you copy.  Gives a short quiz before doing new lecture.; pay attention; tests are usually free response and fill in the blank, you either know it or don't so STUDY STUDY. Anatomy is just in general alot ."
1646,1969257,3.5,5.0,"Dr. Sadrpour will not give points to answers that are spelled wrong. She's a very tough grader, gives quizzes every week that are sometimes hard sometimes easy. Her tests are practicum, multiple choice, matching, and mostly fill in the blank. Half of our class dropped out due to grades."
1647,1813620,3.0,2.0," She is really sweet and super funny, but when it comes to learning. You don't learn much. She reads straight off the slides and gets all her test questions from the Med-Surg study guide. Not a challenging class. I felt more hindered in her class in comparison to other Med-Surg classes. Learned nothing."
1648,1813620,4.5,2.0,"Mrs. Rowan is a great teacher. She is straight forward about what is going to be on the test. The class is pretty easy if you paid attention in physiology. There is one paper due, which is graded fairly easy. Great  teacher, great class."
1649,273525,5.0,3.0,"Really interesting class. Participation is EXTRA CREDIT, it helps a lot if you don't do too well on exams. Professor really tries to involve students and their lives in scenarios that happen in law. Let's you use study guide for exams. Amazing professor!"
1650,273525,4.5,2.0,Management Seminar. All presentations. Really helps you with public speaking in such a comfortable environment. A few papers to do as the midterm. Didn't have a final. He's the sweetest and I would def. take him again in a heartbeat. Love Dr. Leese!!
1651,273525,5.0,2.0,easy class.
1652,273525,4.0,2.0,he tries to keep it fun!
1653,273525,4.0,1.0,Dr. D a.k.a. Gramps! he is nice and a good professor but dont judge a book by its cover he has a double side to this nice proffesor face. BE WARE! hes like the big bad wolf but still nice!
1654,273525,5.0,1.0,"It's really easy to get an A in any of his classes... if you can stay awake. He is pretty boring and talks A LOT. But he does throw a joke in here and there, so he does try. And he is very helpful, like if you are ever confused about anything he will explain it to you until you understand. So i recommend you take him. Two words: Easy A."
1655,273525,5.0,3.0,"Really interesting class.  Professor really tries to involve students and their lives in the discussions.  One of the more captivating classes I've had.  The cases he has you study were precedents decided decades ago, and I'm thinking that's how old the xeroxed copies are (missing pages and all).  But other than that, amazing professor and course!"
1656,273525,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite classes at the Mount! Dr. Leese is very understanding and patient. I only remember one group project, but he grades individually so don't worry about slackers bringing you down."
1657,273525,4.5,1.0,"I really enjoyed this class, he has a lot of discussions so be ready to participate, he likes participation. Most of his class is based on essay writing, but it is not difficult, just make sure you do the writing and you will be fine. It's easy to get an A if you do the work. His classes can be slow but he's funny and lighthearted."
1658,273525,2.5,3.0,He is a really nice professor but he made the class fall asleep most of the time. His lectures are really boring and thats what the 16 weeks consist of. Make sure you do not write your papers the day before because those papers make up most of your grade.
1659,273525,5.0,3.0,"He does assign group work, but I only had one project in the class, with a girl who didn't do anywork. I spoke to him about it, and he took care of it. she didn't affect my grade at all. Very interesting, and easy to talk to."
1660,273525,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Leese is the greatest asset MSMC has, do make sure you participate in class, listen and enjoy all his stories of his experiences,  what you learn in his classes you will remember in the real world. Best classes Bussiness Law &amp; Real Estate Law"
1661,273525,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Leese is great. His classes are interesting, the reading material is good, and he honestly enjoys teaching it. He brings in lots of supplementary materials (movies, etc). Usually just 3 5 page papers and participation is your whole grade-very reasonable. I will take his classes again!"
1662,273525,4.0,3.0,"awesome, possum!  love his classes!"
1663,273525,3.0,3.0,"Even if you can write, participation is enough to bring your grade down 1 letter.  Make sure by the end of the semester he knows who you are and that you raise yoru hand a lot and it should be ok"
1664,273525,5.0,3.0,"He is a very interesting professor and he lectures and gets everyone involved in the class discussions. The group work is not bad at all. ONLY ONE GROUP ASSIGNMENT, big deal!"
1665,273525,5.0,2.0,"Pay attention, ask questions and it will be a breeze."
1666,273525,3.0,3.0,"3 words: Detestable Group Work!  He's interesting and an ok professor but loads on the group work so if you don't like working with people who don't tow their weight, steer clear!"
1667,273525,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Leese only teaches one English class, American Experience. It's a shame he doesn't teach more English classes because he's an asset to the Department. He's stimulating, interesting, and challenging.  Great class."
1668,1813622,1.0,3.0,"Keeps asking if I have mental issues and then always tells me to go to psychological services. Keep in mind, I haven't shown any behavioral problems. Just a bad grade or two. After asking around, apparently she tells other students to go to psych services too. She actually MADE me. I didn't have an option of not going. She tells at students too."
1669,1813622,4.0,3.0,"I love Seitz so much and I am thankful I took three of her classes. She is brilliant and and has a nerdy sense of humor that I love. She is amazing at teaching and helping us understand concepts and connecting concepts. She is not easy though, but if you follow the powerpoints and practice test questions you will do fine! "
1670,1813622,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Lectures are interesting/relevant/funny. Study ahead & ask questions/utilize office hours if needed. She's very helpful & understanding but you need to do your part, no slacking. Pay attention & participate in class, use her PowerPoint notes, they're perfect. She's very sweet, but tough. No sugar coating. Learned SO much."
1671,1813622,5.0,2.0,"This is a very interesting class. There is a lot to learn, so don't wait until the last minute to study. Seitz tests fairly. Her tests aren't a walk in the park, but they aren't hard if you pay attention and study. Do socrative and all of the quizes and you should be fine!"
1672,273528,4.5,2.0,"You do not need to share the same opinion she does, just keep an eye out for what she disagrees with. Make note of it. If you love reading in her subject area and take notes, you will do well in the class. The exams are open book, so be sure to use quotes and background information. I've taken numerous classes with her and have enjoyed them all. "
1673,273528,3.5,5.0,"*Difficult grader, but tests are open-book, open-note. * Test questions are predictable if you pay attention to topics that keep coming up in discussion  *Class is like a book-club. *Reading Sparknotes won't cut it *Class is hard, but professor is VERY helpful, so don't be afraid to go to her.*Find out her interpretation and agree with it, or else."
1674,273528,5.0,2.0,"Every time I've had her I've had a good experience. But I'm an English major. She's fair, gives open book/note exams. Challenges students; if you can't support your point with hard evidence, GOOD LUCK. Everyone complains about that, forgetting they barely have a degree. Reading is necessary, you won't pass the class by looking through summaries."
1675,273528,2.0,5.0,"The books in this class are awesome. She's a good lecturer but a very tough grader, however tests are open note so I guess that's why. Unfortunately, this class REALLY made me reconsider my major. She doesn't seem to be open on interpretations not her own, which sucks if you choose to write your paper on a theme she didn't suggest."
1676,273528,3.5,3.0,"Basically just show up to class, take a short quiz on it, discuss the book/play/poem, and that's it. Discussions are a bit boring though. We did about five essays are pretty easy and she's always willing to help. And she discusses your essay one on one and grades it in front of you."
1677,273528,5.0,3.0,"It is always surprising to me that students expect to be handed a grade. Dr. Brueck is incredibly fair in class, on papers and on exams (they're open book and open note!) Her classes are conversational, she answers each question asked regardless of how many times it has already been asked and goes over all material thoroughly."
1678,273528,4.5,4.0,English Lit 1700-1900 may not be the most interesting course but Brueck made it incredibly enjoyable. I genuinely looked forward to this class due to her vast knowledge on the topics and the conversational nature of her class. If you complete the reading and participate in class you will do well. Her exams are open book and graded fairly.
1679,273528,1.5,4.0,"This professor likes people who listens to her and agrees with everything she says. Honestly when you take her, notice I said &quot;when&quot; because there is no dodging her in upper division, just agree with her. God knows i wish I knew this info before I took her class"
1680,273528,2.5,4.0,"Interesting class material, interesting class discussions, but when it comes to the tests and grading it's very hard to get a decent grade in this class. She is very interested in what she teaches and her classes are fun because you are able to fully discuss the reading, but if you two are not on the same page you will not receive anything higher t"
1681,273528,5.0,4.0,"Kind, knowledgable, and helpful"
1682,273528,4.0,4.0,"She's a great professor, and if you highlight the passages she reads aloud in class, that's what's on the tests. (in all her classes) but she has a specific interpretation of things, and she Does NOT like it if you disagree."
1683,273528,4.0,2.0,"Such a great professor! Great selection of books and totally discussion based course. She's really open minded to different interpretations, which is so great!"
1684,273528,4.5,2.0,"The material covered in the class is interesting. The class is mostly discussion of the reading assigned. She allows you to make up papers, so she gives rewrites. BUT she takes off points for mechanical errors, make sure you proof read and don't make any gramatical errors because she'll take off points and you wont be able to make them up. She allows extra credit, and the quizess are on the reading assignment. She also has conference times and class is either cancelled or cut short. Great Class!!!"
1685,273528,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher, very smart, knows EVERYTHING!!!"
1686,273528,4.5,1.0,just read through the books you are assigned and make sure you study for the quizes so that evry point counts! rewrite any papers you did poorly on!
1687,273528,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher, very helpful, and great personality."
1688,273528,5.0,3.0,THIS CLASS IS NOT THAT EASY BUT YOU WON'T BE STRESSED OUT OR ANYTHING.  I THINK SHE GIVES GOOD LECTURES AND GRADES PRETTY FAIRLY.  I PLAN TO TAKE THE MODERN TEMPER CLASS NEXT SEMESTER.
1689,273528,4.0,3.0,"pretty easy class. do the readings and show up to class. she grades kins hard, but there are only 4 3 pg papers, and a 5-10 pg term paper. there are reading quizes but they are easy, other than that, no tests, final is an essay"
1690,273528,5.0,5.0,"Hardest class ever!  Combines heavy philosophy with LOTS of intellectual reading.  Tough concepts to grasp.  She's a good prof., but this class is way difficult!"
1691,1029246,4.5,1.0,Very nice and understanding teacher. Makes mental health less scary. Very approachable as well. Arranges many learning experiences through the hospital. Share your experiences with her and she'll share hers with you.
1692,728191,5.0,2.0,Dr. C is an AMAZING professor. Anyone can get an A in this class as long as they put the time into it. I received an A by going to the extra credit sessions and doing all of my mastering chem. I also paid attention to what she emphasized during lectures and studied the power points and her problems.
1693,728191,4.5,1.0,Scientific concepts was so easy! I loved going to class! There are 8 really easy quizzes! Just pay attention in class and it'll be an easy A. Tests are just like quizzes.
1694,728191,5.0,1.0,the class itself is easy. she is very approachable. gives out alot of practice questions before quizzes and exams.
1695,728191,4.5,4.0,"Dr. C plays no tricks, she tests on what she teaches.CHEM 1B is hard, but if you go to problem session, extra-credit session and ask her for help, you should be fine. Many people didn't do well in my class but that was because they were taking BIO 1B at the same time or didn't put in effort.If you can't survive this class, you won't survive O-Chem"
1696,728191,5.0,1.0,"A lot of my friends were struggling in scicon because they had horrible teachers, but I breezed through scicon! She makes physics and chemistry so simple and easy. We rarely used the textbook. (only for homework assignments) She gives out a lot of practice problems, which are very helpful for the quizzes and tests! :)"
1697,728191,4.0,3.0,"I had a different professor before, and he didn't make any sense so I dropped his class. Dr. C is awesome, she goes over things carefully, has practice problems and is easy to understand. She's great!"
1698,728191,4.5,5.0,Dr C is AWESOME!
1699,728191,3.0,3.0,Chem 1B is MUCH harder than Chem1A..so prepare yourselves. Get a tutor because the slides don't help most of the time and we don't even use the textbook.
1700,728191,5.0,2.0,Very nice and helpful teacher. she has tons of practice problems posted on the angel website.
1701,728191,5.0,3.0,Dr. C is a great teacher. During class she lectures on some slides that she puts online. She also goes over practice problems in class. If you attend class everyday and pay attention you can pass her class. Just make sure you really do understand the material.
1702,728191,5.0,1.0,she is the coolest teacher ever!                                               love your studants
1703,728191,5.0,1.0,she is too easy and not challenging
1704,728191,4.5,3.0,Very good teach.
1705,273540,4.0,2.0,great teacher! If you are passionate about your work and it shines through he will notice. Lots of reading but it is interesting. I took the online class and his expectations were doable and reasonable
1706,273540,5.0,2.0,"I loved this class! Although I am not a Soc major, his lectures were very interesting! The work required wasn't too difficult, but you do have to spend some time on it. His grading, however, was extremely fair... maybe even a little lenient, but overall great! Would definitely take again if I have to take another Soc Class!"
1707,273540,3.0,3.0,"I registered for this class because I had an interest in it.  So much for that.  If you're looking for a class where your online exams are 15 pages long, analysis papers are 15 pages long and reading assignments over 100 pages- then take this class.  This was my most hated class of my entire life.  The work load was insurmountable.  Next please!"
1708,273540,5.0,3.0,"Bunce is one of the most brilliant professors I have ever had. He is incredibly knowledgable, and his classes are fun, interesting, and well organized. He uses many different teaching techniques such as powerpoint, class activities, and movies related to the topic. Bunce is always in a good mood and super funny. Take a class with him!"
1709,273540,4.5,2.0,"Great Prof. Very down to earth and he knows his stuff. Make sure to do at least some of the readings prior to class, it helps with class discussions and future test/papers."
1710,273540,4.0,4.0,"I'm taking his online class, and while it's really interesting and he does a good job of laying out a time management format that really helps and keeps you on top of the work... the one problem with him is that he takes FOREVER to grade the work. We have two weeks left in the semester and I'm still waiting for my Midterm grade...."
1711,273540,5.0,2.0,Bunce is great just as long as you keep up with the school work.  Do not fall behind!
1712,273540,5.0,2.0,Professor Bunce is one of the coolest teachers at the Mount he is very down to earth and always brings movies that relates to the lessons. He is also funny and works in the best interest of the student. *Take him
1713,273540,5.0,3.0,No Comments
1714,273540,5.0,2.0,"He is so cool, hes young like us so we get what he is saying.not too much work,easy test.great guy who shows knowledge in his lessons. fun class. He is totaly not bad to look at.REally HOT"
1715,273540,5.0,3.0,"Bunce is way cool. He's young like us so he can relate. He doesn't assign excessive reading/homework & he uses a variety of teaching materials to keep it interesting (videos, slides, PowerPoint+). His exams are medium toughness, & the papers are a cinch."
1716,1559686,5.0,1.0,"He is a great professor and pays attention to students' needs. If he sees you zoning out, he'll ask if anyone needs anything repeated or give a short break. He keeps everyone involved and makes lectures memorable, which is helpful when exams come around because they are based on lectures. TAKE HIM"
1717,1559686,5.0,1.0,Cool Guy...Best Professor Ever...taught my Immunology perfectly. I learned many things and i feel better prepared for Med School.
1718,1559686,5.0,1.0,"AMAZING prof!Makes complicated concepts easy to understand and moves at a reasonable pace.Approachable,loves his job and wants u to pass.Attendance is mandatory since exams are based directly off lecture so take good notes.Very keen on involving u in the lesson so be prepared answer a few questions.You WILL learn tons of neat things in this class!"
1719,1559686,5.0,3.0,"Milstein is an amazing teacher. Learned so much and didn't have to pick up the book once. He is repetitive, meaning he drills the information into your head. There are only 2 exams and a few papers to read. If you prepare you are sure to get a good grade. He is very clear on what he expects! TAKE HIM"
1720,273551,5.0,1.0,he's everything you'd want in a professor. super easy A
1721,273551,3.0,1.0,"I printed out a paper again for him to go over his edits together and he grade it still, and the same exact paper went from a C- to a B+. You don't have to go to class just initial all the dates at the end of the week or have your friend do it for you."
1722,273551,5.0,2.0,"Not enough good things can be said about Fr. O'Brien.  If you've got the chance, take him!  His papers aren't overbearingly difficult and he gives you ample time to fix them before giving you a final grade."
1723,273551,4.5,1.0,"Father O'Brien's ENG 1B class was an enjoyable experience. The essays are not too hard, and he always gives you the chance to review your essay with him before turning it in. He is a very nice person who genuinely wants you to be a better writer."
1724,273551,5.0,1.0,"Father O'Brien is the sweetest teacher. His class is very easy; he gives you a lot of class time to do assignments  so less homework. He also gives very good feedback on essays and really loves what he does. If you take his class don't purchase the books, you can just look it up online."
1725,273551,3.5,2.0,"Easiest english professor you'll ever have. Unfortunately, his class doesn't really prepare you for other classes when it comes to essays. Easy A."
1726,273551,5.0,1.0,"Amazing professor!!! Super helpful and definitely has a passion for what he does. If you receive a bad grade on an essay, you are able to rewrite it for a better grade. Ask him to read your essay, he will give tips on how to improve it before you turn it in."
1727,273551,5.0,1.0,Father O'Brien is the BEST teacher ever! He is an 80 year old man who loves his job and teaching English.  He always wants to help people with their essays and allows re-writes after he passes them back.  I got an A in his class both semesters (1A and 1C)! TAKE THIS CLASS! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! :)
1728,273551,5.0,2.0,"Father O'brien is the best!  He's super nice and he wants to make sure you succeed in his class.  His class may be a little boring at times, and it's hard to stay awake (because it's pretty early in the morning), but other than that his class is great!  I'm going to miss having him for english!!"
1729,273551,5.0,1.0,Wonderful professor!
1730,273551,5.0,3.0,I took several english classes with Fr. O-Brien.  He is great and very supportive!  I consider him a friend.  Great teacher.
1731,273551,5.0,1.0,Great Professor!! Would Definately recommend him!!!

1733,273551,4.0,2.0,Awesome instructor who truly cares about his students.  he's always willing to help and make sure that you get a good grade.  Would recommend to anyone!
1734,273551,5.0,1.0,Great teacher. Offers help. Gives time in class to work on papers. Cares about the progress of the class.
1735,273551,4.5,1.0,"He's great. He really helps you get a good grade in the class. He is very understanding. The course overall is really easy: papers (easy), movies, and basic stuff. Highly highly recommended!"

1737,273551,5.0,1.0,Love this guy! He does everything possible to make sure you get an A... it's up to the student to take advantage
1738,273551,5.0,1.0,Totally cool guy! Great Prof! Would love to take again! Easygoing and great for a freshman no-brainer class!
1739,273551,5.0,2.0,"Fr. O'Brien is the best! His teaching style is caring, gentle, and nurturing. His classes are interesting (especially Fiction to Film) and he's very approachable. Great guy, great professor! Thank you, Fr. O'Brien!"
1740,273557,4.5,5.0,I loved Dr. Frick.  I learned so much from him.  I am grateful.  World Scritures is a very complex and really difficult subject.  If you are purely religious you will have  a difficult time.    It really is about spirituality!!
1741,273557,5.0,4.0,"He was one of the best teachers I've ever had, for reasons I can't explain. He taught as though he were one of us. We really understood and enjoyed his teachings."
1742,273557,3.5,3.0,"Best Professor I've ever had. Avoid if you're easily offended, but if you learn more with laughter go for it. His study guides are on the board when you walk in to class, easy to follow. Exams are a bit hard but if you open your textbooks and copied all the notes on the board you'll be fine. Do the optional papers, you won't get an A without them."
1743,273557,4.0,5.0,"I've been getting C+ in his classes but I couldn't care less. His exams are really hard but... I love his classes. I think that his so-called bad attitude actually helped me be more open-minded. He is very helpful IF YOU approach him. Only open-minded people will enjoy his classes. Otherwise, you'll cry and whine like most of the people here."
1744,273557,1.0,5.0,this man  is waste of space on the face of the earth with horrible comments that are on the lines of hate towards the gay community and the nuns and priests in general
1745,273557,1.0,3.0,"I was really excited to take this class. When I got there he was very sarcastic and he constantly used foul languge. To be honest, I didn't learn ANYTHING from his class. I was disappointed and I regret taking his class."
1746,273557,1.0,3.0,"His teaching style is aggravating, his notes on the board are ridiculous.  His tests are so wordy.  He loves to say****ola, crapola, donkey, and he loves to call Cardinal Mahoney a retard.  Also, Paul doesn't know****:  if you're easily offended and really religious don't take this guy. Annoying."
1747,273557,1.0,2.0,"This man is a terrible teacher, you basically sit in class for an hour listening to him spout off about life from his screwed up perspective. His lectures are centered around his favorite terms like crappola,bimbos, and oh yes my ever favorite, my dog does, says, eats, hell you add a verb and he has probably said it about his dog! Avoid him!"
1748,273557,3.0,3.0,"The falsetto he goes into sometimes can set your teeth on end - but having said that, I did't mind his cussing or controversial remarks one bit. Not for their amusement value, but because it was quite evident to me that he was one of the most learned prof's that I had ever had. His opinions are based on a lot of study and insight. Very interesting."
1749,273557,2.5,3.0,No Comments
1750,273557,5.0,3.0,Sarcastic and informative. The take-home tests allowed me to grasp the information moreso than if they were in-class. Take good notes and get notes from days you missed and you'll do fine on his tests. He's not for people who easily take offense to cussing or are highly sensitive wussies that can't comprehend logical thought. He is for people who are open-minded and want a broader knowledge of world religions.
1751,273557,1.0,1.0,be afraid VERY AFRAID!
1752,273557,2.0,5.0,Bad talks evey religion but his own.  Hard to follow.  Only reason why most of the students did well in his class was due exams they had from previous years (since he never changes his test).
1753,273557,1.0,5.0,"He cusses way to much. I learn better when people dont cuss. I understand he's trying to be funny, and i must say that i do laugh in his class, but he talks way too much of Blasphemy."
1754,273557,3.5,1.0,"EASY A!! I had Dr. Frick for Death & Afterlife and for World Religions. He's a very easy professor, he has an outline on the board before each class so you can follow along. I learned a lot. Then again it also helps to have previous years tests because he never changes them! Find people who have taken the class & you are set. DO THE PAPERS too!"
1755,273557,4.0,4.0,"THE CLASS IS PRETTY HARD, BUT YOU WILL GET THROUGH IT IF YOU DO THE WORK. HE IS SARCASTIC, BUT HE IS A VERY INTERESTING AND SWETT PERSON.  ANYONE WHO IS CRITICLA OF HIM PROBABLE DIN'T GET A VERY GOOD GRADE IN HIS CLASS."
1756,273557,1.0,5.0,"He's horrible! He doesn't allow for discussion, lectures the whole time. Is utterly sarcastic and can be quite offensive.  Avoid him, if possible.  And he allows everyone to cheat on his take home tests."
1757,273557,4.5,2.0,No Comments
1758,273557,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Frick is sarcastic and sardonic, and his style is a little rough-around-the-edges, but he's informative and clear. Don't let his take-home tests fool you; they're nearly impossible. Definitely do the &quot;optional&quot; paper or you won't get an A."
1759,2147478,5.0,4.0,Professor Levitt's background shines through her lectures and tough criticism.  Some students find her style a little caustic but my own belief is that it is purposeful and serves to help break bad habits in students and force critical thinking.  Having her teach in the early stage of the program helped prepare for more challenging courses later.
1760,2147478,1.0,5.0,"This is the worst teacher I have ever had.  She used the ""f"" word AT my group and announced in front of the whole class that we had failed the assignment.  She gives excessive work for a one unit course. She asks us to use Stats when most have not had Stats and she does not teach it.  She is a failure and an embarrassment to Mount Saint Mary's."
1761,1696917,4.5,4.0,I really enjoyed Professor Teays' class. We get through a lot of content and I feel like I learned a lot. The content itself was not hard but for her quizzes you had to pay attention to small details. It's a lot but doable if you work hard. 
1762,1696917,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Teays loves philosophy. She is a really nice down to earth person. Lectures are clear & not long. If you are struggling in the class, she'll help you. Will have to read text. Her quizzes are not hard, easy if you read and pay attention. The exams are what kills you. First exam was a full blown essay question and she does not proctor the exams. "
1763,1696917,3.0,4.0,"Class was challenging. If you don't pay attention in the lectures your will do bad in her quizzes. Also, reading material is important. Don't fall behind! She is very lenient with the grades. I enjoyed her class."
1764,1696917,2.0,4.0,Teays is an awesome person outside from the classroom. But her class is difficult. You have to pay attention to small details for quizzes and she is very unorganized. She frequently changes the syllabus and makes the class even more confusing.
1765,1696917,1.0,3.0,It says that this a philosiophy class. BUT it's MORE like an English class. I have NOT learned ONE thing about the philosophy of the Native Americans.
1766,1696917,1.0,4.0,Teays' class isn't really that hard (material wise) but she is so scattered it's almost impossible to do well.Her quizzes are SO detailed it's next to impossible to know the answers unless you have a photographic memory. She changes instructions and assignments after they're due - completely insane. Says one thing and does another.
1767,2290859,5.0,3.0,Professor Hannah is really good at explaining lecture material. She has really good feedback. I've been in her class for 6 weeks and i am sad her class is ending. So far I feel like she has taught me really valuable info.
1768,2290859,5.0,4.0,"pretty cool professor, she makes class fun."
1769,2290859,5.0,3.0,"Have been in Hannah's class for 3 weeks and already am lamenting that this will be the only course I take with her this semester. Asked her if she was still a practicing NP, to which she answered yes. Teaches and still practices!? Right on. She's super experienced, helpful and comical. She is definitely a great professor at the mount."
1770,2290859,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Hannah is condescending AND horrible. She turns the lights out to get your attention(our we in Kindergarten?) , gives WAY to much homework. She thinks we have our entire lives to sit there and do her work. HORRIBLE -I hate her class. Thinks of no one but herself and this is not fair. If you WANT an abusive Parent in your life- take her class"
1771,2290859,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Hannah is condescending &amp; horrible. She turns the lights out to get your attention(our we in Kindergarten?) , gives WAY to much homework. She thinks we have our entire lives to sit there and do her work. HORRIBLE &amp; I hate her class. Thinks of no one but herself and this is not fair. If you an abusive Parent in your life- take her class"
1772,1506482,5.0,2.0,"When I took her class, I was able to learn a lot without having much stress. Our tests were open book and open note, so it was hard not to pass."
1773,1506482,5.0,1.0,Dr. Moulton is a great professor! Her class was hybrid (2 days online & 1 in class). Classwork: make sure to turn in ALL online posts&replies on time. Tests: she gives a study guide 1 week in advance. it is pretty much the test. just memorize all the slides.
1774,1506482,5.0,2.0,Love her!!! Definitely recommend taking her for Social Psychology. Lots of presentations but it's definitely manageable!!!
1775,2333880,5.0,4.0,Group work was required and grading was equal among peers for some assignments. We had a midterm and final exam related to lecture and textbooks. I would take again.
1776,2333880,4.0,2.0,I enjoyed taking psychopathology. I learned so much and I enjoyed the professor having weekly PowerPoints that detailed each diagnosis. 
1777,2333880,3.0,2.0,I enjoyed taking psychopathology with Dr. Habibi because it challenged me to familiarize myself with the DSM. We had weekly vignettes and I got so much practice with diagnosing. I am excited to work with future clients. 
1778,2333880,5.0,3.0,"By far, one of the best professors I have ever had - if not the best. Her classes and lectures are amazing! She's so knowledgeable, approachable and supportive. I love her lectures. I love how she incorporates group work/activities into her classes. I've taken her every chance I had. It's because of her that I feel ready to be a therapist."
1779,2333880,1.0,1.0,Overall her class was super easy but she's not the best teacher as she tends to ramble on and on. At times you're left confused and she tends to ignore emails or fails to respond in a timely manner. Not sure how she is the head of the psych department.
1780,2333880,4.0,2.0,I took her Gender Issues in Psychology Course which was completely online. Each week we were only graded on the discussion and weekly quiz. Not a difficult class.
1781,2333880,5.0,2.0,"I've been studying at Valley College for over two years, taking classes with many teachers, but I must say professor Shani Habibi is unique. I am taking stat 101 and she does everything she can to make the student succeed, her lectures are not difficult, she's great, amazing professor, just wowowo, one of the kinds. I'm very happy I took her class"
1782,2333880,5.0,1.0,Shani Habibi is one of the great professor in the psychology department. She is hilarious and she makes the class fun and interactive. AND you will love Abnormal Psychology because of her! I would take her again!
1783,2333880,5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors I have ever had! If you are going to take any psychology course I recommend to take it with her. She is very caring and makes sure that her students are clear on the material. All of her quizzes and exams are online, meaning open book. She makes the subject very interesting and fun."
1784,2759867,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Perrins is an incredible lecturer. He adds all his PowerPoints on Canvas, so you can listen in class and take notes at your own speed later. My class was at 8 am, which sucked; however, his humor and positive attitude made up for it. We had very little outside homework, only a book report and a final. Take a class with him!"
1785,2759869,5.0,4.0,"This class was really hard for me, but Professor Taylor is such a great teacher! Yes, you have to work for it, but Taylor is very helpful. If you need help, go to her office hours. You will have homework and daily readings, but it's not too long. She does randomly call on people, so make sure you are paying attention. She cares about her students!"
1786,2759870,4.0,1.0,"Having FYS with the President was awesome. Unfortunately, it seemed like she was always too busy to invest in our class truly. She missed class several times, half-explained assignments, and was kind of unorganized. However, the class was very easy and the assignments were not very hard. She does care about her students, she is just very busy."
1787,1864901,4.5,3.0,A very challenging class. Makes you think about things you have never thought about! Very amazing woman! I love her
1788,1567951,5.0,1.0,"Her class lectures and opportunities to practice are essential and helpful.  You are required to practice coaching at your school site, but your are given a guide to follow.  Very organized and helpful."
1789,1567952,3.5,3.0,ahh she's a bit of a tough grader. But overall a doable class. If you complete all assignments and you are not absent more than 2 times you will receive an A. Don't slack off!
1790,1567952,2.5,2.0,She's very confusing.  Her lectures are boring and she doesn't put any enthusiasm when teaching.  The assignments are doable but the rubrics are difficult to follow.
1791,1567954,5.0,4.0,"Love Dr. Tochluk! She is my favorite professor at MSMU. She is really passionate about the course material and she brings great energy into the classroom. She is a tough grader, but she makes it very clear on what she is looking for on rubrics. She also gives great feedback and some extra credit opportunities if you need it. EVERY point counts!"
1792,1567954,5.0,4.0,you work hard in this class but you learn so much. She is really likable and makes you feel like you can ask her about anything. Really knowledgeable.
1793,1567954,5.0,3.0,She's amazing! She Has a major passion for future teachers and goes the extra mile to make sure you become a successful educator :) take her!!
1794,1567954,5.0,3.0,"She is a great professor. Class was long, but was always interesting. She loves what she does, which made us love her class."
1795,1567954,5.0,4.0,"She's very passionate about what she teaches.  She's very organized, but she expects a lot.  Each assignment is long and can be complex."
1796,2532564,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed taking Professor Stewart, topics are clear and understandable and I am not good at chemistry nor have I ever taken a physics class so I was unsure how I would do but honestly this class is not bad at all. During lectures she gives examples/practice problems that are similar to homework and exams and offers extra credit."
1797,2532564,3.0,5.0,"Shes a good teacher but if you dont have any experience with chemistry or arent good at it, this class may be a little difficult. She gave us a lot of opportunities for extra credit."
1798,2532564,2.0,4.0,"Does not know how to explain the lesson, you will have to do extra work at home to understand the topic. If you have a strong understanding of chem you're good but if not, you will have a hard time understanding any topics bc she expects you to know everything. The exams and quizzes aren't hard, just study. The class is doable but won't recommend.."
1799,1801439,4.0,4.0,"Professor Tregenza really was an eye opening, stimulating, challenging , and very supportive teacher for film philosophy combined with cultural history.  I really enjoyed all that I learned and did soar by the end of her class.  she was very communicative and caring.  I took her Philosophy of Film class at MSMU in Spring of 2017."
1800,1801439,5.0,1.0,Professor Treganza is wonderful! Key is to never skip class and study. Her mid-term and exams are easy if you study. Class was a piece of cake!
1801,1801439,5.0,5.0,Wonderful teacher. She challenges you to think and exposes you to great philosophers. She is very open and flexible with students and shows that she genuinely cares about her students and learning.
1802,1801439,3.5,2.0,"We only had a midterm, group presentation, analysis paper, and final. She gives you the exact questions that will be used on the day of the midterm and final. Must attend class to receive points for attendance. Note-taking while she is lecturing and reading the textbook will help you ace her midterm and final. Overall, I liked her class!"
1803,1801439,3.0,3.0,"Professor Tregenza is bright and engaging. If  your critical thinking skills are mediocre or sub-par, you don't have a chance of getting an A in this class.  Class consists of: Quiz,Case Presentation, Analysis Paper, Mid-term, and Final"
1804,2532576,5.0,4.0,Dr. Fahey is the best teacher I've ever met. She really knows her stuff and makes the content come to life. I really like that she challenges us to think about how we would change the justice system and incorporates statistics in a way that makes sense. Just be ready to participate -- she knows everyone's name and will call on you. 
1805,2532576,5.0,4.0,Totally different than her intro class and she makes you do more writting. She still brings in real world information into every lecture though. I did office hours with her and she remember my career goals. Seriously she can remember every detail of conversations you have with her and really cares about her students.
1806,2532576,5.0,4.0,Dr. Fahey is the best. She makes you want to be a sociology researcher. This was the best class I took this semester.
1807,2532576,5.0,4.0,Honestly the most caring professor I've ever had. She really cares about social justice.
1808,2532576,5.0,4.0,Dr. Fahey is the best professor I've ever had. She really cares about students and knows what is going on with us. She won't make you buy a book but the readings she picks are amazing. Her lectures are entertaining especially when she tells you about research but does it like a story. You feel like you were really there collecting data yourself.
1809,2532576,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fahey is the best Professor Ive ever had. She cares more about us actually learning the material not just about the grades. She is the only professor that has compassion for her students and considered the hardships that students experienced during the pandemic. She also accepts late work, gives out extra credit and makes the final optional."
1810,2532576,5.0,4.0,"Loved Dr. Fahey!! Her class was interesting and fun. She goes over the content very well, also uses current real world examples during lectures. I learned a lot during this class her lectures were amazing."
1811,2532576,5.0,4.0,Her methods are unusual but you really learn from her. She makes it fun and uses real-life examples even social media.
1812,2532576,5.0,5.0,Best professor I've had. Her class made me feel empowered to change the juvenile justice system and help kids in our community who are at risk. I learned so much and her lectures are fascinating.
1813,2532576,5.0,4.0,Kind of a hard professor but you don't notice it because she makes it interesting. I thought online would be awful but her format helped me learn. She picks readings from the real world. Dr. Fahey opened my eyes to the reality of juvenile justice.
1814,2532576,5.0,4.0,The semester just ended but Dr. Fahey is still showing how much she cares. She worked with me on some stuff I had questions about and is messaging the whole class about documentaries to watch during summer! She is so nice and passionate about criminology that it makes it worth it how much you have to study to pass.
1815,2532576,5.0,4.0,Criminal profiling was the coolest class. Dr. Fahey gave amazing examples and let us practice real cases. The papers are long but if you put in the effort you learn a lot. It is different than her intro class but she is just as funny. Do yourself a favor and take her classes.
1816,2532576,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fahey is of the best professors I have ever had. She is the type that gets you excited to go to a three-hour class at night. Her course is fairly easy because she teaches everything you need to know. Plus she is entertaining since she knows how to relate to her students.
1817,2532576,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fayhey was always well prepared to give engaging lectures on Sociology; she never failed to make her students laugh with funny images or relating what we were learning to social media trends (or something similar). Very easy to talk to and was very understanding as we switched to online courses due to COVID-19.
1818,2532576,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Fahey made a three hour class bearable! She is so outgoing and 'woke'. She was very straightforward about what to study, and what she expects from us. Homework is assigned every week, and her exams weren't so difficult if you study all the terms. She truly cares about her students, and is open minded to everyone's opinions. She is a real gem."
1819,2532576,5.0,2.0,"This class is amazing, I loved the curriculum. I actually enjoyed reading the material for this class and am considering changing my major. If you pay attention and read youll pass. Professor Fahey is honestly amazing. Hands down the best Professor Ive had thus far. Shes very lovely, sweet, smart, and funny. She makes class fun and interactive."
1820,2532576,5.0,2.0,"She is hilarious and such a gem! She is fabulous at teaching and we all as a class collectively understood her topics, she makes me want to change my major! &#55357;&#56877; Take her if you get the chance, totally recommend! 10/10"
1821,1756391,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, very enthusiastic. Just show up to class."
1822,2522345,5.0,3.0,She is very knowledgeable and fair. I have a hard time with some science stuff but she broke it down in practical explanations. 
1823,345325,5.0,4.0,Hands down the best math professor I have ever had. She makes learning math enjoyable.
1824,345325,5.0,2.0,Excellent professor with crystal clear explanations. She knows how to explain difficult concepts in a straight forward way.
1825,345325,5.0,1.0,Wonderful math professor. Crystal clear explanations.
1826,345325,5.0,3.0,She is a wonderful teacher and very patient. She truly cares about her students. Consider yourself lucky if you get her for a class.
1827,345325,5.0,3.0,She really takes her time to make you understand. Her notes are very important in her class and every part of them is a must know. The subject is difficult but she breaks down all the steps for you to comprehend.
1828,345325,5.0,3.0,She is a great teacher. She is always willing to help you. Show her that you're trying and she'll be cool with you.
1829,345325,5.0,2.0,Do the work she assigns and you'll be fine.
1830,345325,5.0,3.0,"she's very good.  there's no way you can be unprepared for a test if you do the assignments, pay attention in class, and especially do the &quot;suggested review&quot; for a test."
1831,345325,5.0,2.0,"She's a good teacher, she goes over the topics in class before she assigns homework, and then goes over any problems that students have with the homework during the next class session. She offers extra credit assignments, and she drops the lowest test score off your grade. But most importantly she knows what she is talking about and can explain it to you unlike other teachers who spit out what the book says and change the emphasis on the wording."
1832,345325,4.5,3.0,"She knows what she's talking about and she's very interested in math, she takes it super seriously.  She's organized and helpful and gives progress reports after every test so you know how your doing.  She's kind and soft spoken and very friendly.  Her lectures can be hard to stay awake in, sit next to a friend!"
1833,345325,5.0,2.0,"She's a good math teacher. She assigns homework every week but gives time for questions on the homework. She also gives extra credit. She's very organized and after each test she gives progress reports, so you always know how you're doing."
1834,345325,3.5,4.0,"Her classes can be difficult just because of the nature of the subject, but she is willing to help you. She is a very nice woman in addition. My only criticism would be that her lectures can be very boring..."
1835,345325,4.5,4.0,No Comments
1836,345325,5.0,1.0,Excellent teacher and helps everyone who is slow at understanding the easy concepts.
1837,345325,5.0,5.0,"This class is very difficult,but yet the instructor is VERY helpful. She also gives extra credit so she helps students on their grades."
1838,345325,5.0,4.0,She is a great Professor. SHe teaches a difficult subject but is knowledgeble about the topic.
1839,1881331,4.0,3.0,"The class as a whole is about a 5 in easiness. The final is definitely a 1. All his quizzes were 5 questions long (multiple choice and fill in the blank). His final was only 3 questions. The catch? Each question had to be answered in no less than 2 pages. I was NOT prepared for that. If you answer 1 question and have an A in the class, you'll pass."
1840,2116852,5.0,2.0,"Macs lectures are an absolute joy to sit through. He's very funny, engaging, and informative. He is a fair tester who only tests on what he has discussed in class, so you'll never be blindsided. The book he chose is an easy read with short chapters, so it's very easy to keep up with the reading."
1841,2116852,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor, one of the few great professors left in the nursing department. Makes lectures entertaining and makes an effort to engage the whole class. Got an A without ever reading the book, but showed up to class every day and listened during lecture."
1842,2116852,5.0,2.0,"Professor Mac is funny, engaging, fair, and knowledgeable. The book used is easy to work with and has fairly short chapters. Read and outline the chapters and there's no reason you wouldn't finish the class with an A."
1843,2116852,1.0,1.0,"He just reads off the power point.. so it's boring. There are 3 major projects and 1 final. The 2 major projects are worth more points then the final itself. There will be a group project and presentation. Pick your group wisely!   He wasn't helpful to me. I just figured everything myself, he wasn't much of a professor. He's sassy, so beware!"
1844,2116852,2.5,2.0,"He did not make his own lectures, so he doesn't know his own material. He literally reads off of the PowerPoint each and every lecture, it's the most boring thing ever and a huge waste of time. I wish I could have taken this class online because I could have read the power points to myself. Easy A but boring, for the tuition I pay I expect better."
1845,1871096,4.5,3.0,She is a very fun professor. Complete all your work and you will receive an A.
1846,2147577,5.0,4.0,Very professional and passionate about teaching philosophy. He is one of a kind.
1847,2147577,5.0,1.0,The g.o.a.t of philosophy professors. If possible take this man he is amazing.
1848,2147577,5.0,1.0,"best prof here, would take again. easy grader. have the book. pay attention and you'll pass."
1849,2147577,5.0,4.0,"Best Phil class I've taken! unlike all the other boring phil classes. He's so passionate & enthusiastic about phil, which makes his lectures so interesting! He's very laid back and funny, its hard not to pay attention! Tbh as long as you put your part you'll do great. Btw, study guides are so on point with the exams. Best phil professor ever!"
1850,2147577,5.0,2.0,"His class was one of the best classes I've ever taken at the Mount! His lectures are very interesting, he knows exactly what he's teaching, and he's extremely fair with his grading. You do need to study for the exams but its definitely doable. He also tries to spark enthusiasm and laughter in the class, which I loved!"
1851,1871100,5.0,3.0,Great teacher! Really prepares you for education work.
1852,1871100,4.5,2.0,Professor Yarnes and Weiner were great this semester. There class was full of assignments that will help you as a future educator. Get ready for all the work :)
1853,1918206,1.5,5.0,"Very unclear, disorganized and not tech savy."
1854,849151,3.5,5.0,"I had Professor Gabbidon for my first clinical class on the med surg floor. She's an amazing instructor the majority of the time - she's tough, but a &quot;good&quot; tough. She'll make sure that you get the material you need to take good care of your patients. She can be sarcastic and snarky, but you just have to know what that is in order to understand her"
1855,849151,5.0,5.0,"First Day u might freakout!& Last day of ur clinical u gonna miss her!I did!I'd not be where I am or who I want to be today as a person and in future as a great caring nurse,if i didnt have her! dont be scared! she gonna put you down! then she gonna make you a strong person!Hello you wana work in hospital!sheis preparing u for the real nursing life"
1856,849151,4.5,5.0,First DAY of your clinical..you gonna freak out! last day! you gonna miss her! She tought me how to be a real nurse like her! She is a wonderful person.She broke me and made me a new  stronger person!Dont you want to be a good nurse&#63; then she is the one that will help you!just hang in there! dont quit!
1857,849151,5.0,5.0,"Before attending clinicals i heard a lot of comments on how bad and mean she was However by the end of my rotation I can say that all the rumors were wrong she is the best clinical instructor, If it wasn't for her I wouldn't have learned as much as i did. She is the best, but if u don't want to learn anything and just waist time then shes not d one"
1858,849151,4.0,5.0,"If you want an easy clinical instructor, she isn't.  If you want someone who is going to challenge your knowledge base and have you apply what you know about nursing, then, she's the clinical instructor for you.  If you don't know your stuff she will dog you... think about it, do you want someone who doesn't know their stuff taking care of you&#63;"
1859,849151,1.5,5.0,Extremely disrespectful. Demoralizes students  and spends more time making personal attacks against students rather than teaching.  She may be a good clinician- I would never know she spent more time talking down to us than providing actual instruction. Total waste of valuable time.
1860,849151,1.0,2.0,"One of the most incompetent, inarticulate, inconsiderate, selfish &quot;instructors&quot; I believe I will ever come across. In her classes, we solely relied upon reading r textbks because she was always REALLY late, couldn't get thru reading her ppts VERBATIM, & couldn't explain ANYTHING. Attempts @ explanations were often wrong. Idiot. I pity her students."
1861,849151,1.5,4.0,"really unclear in lecture delivery. never prepared/practiced lectures ahead of time, and always was late to class. often could not answer questions students asked in class."
1862,849151,2.0,4.0,don't take anything during your clinical rotation personal.  cultural differences and expressions- that's all.  good luck.  KNOW everything- rationalize and give an answer clearly
1863,1871102,4.0,1.0,"This class was a joke! her assignments were super easy, BUT do not underestimate her quizzes and test. I did not receive an A because I did not receive good scores in both of these. STUDY. She's nice."
1864,1871103,5.0,3.0,Professor Owens was very thorough when going over lecture. She assigned summary/reading each time we met but take a few minutes to complete. Amazing professor and caring.
1865,1871103,5.0,2.0,"She is a really great professor. I learned a lot from her and really enjoyed her class. She has a great sense of humor and is a very likable person. She doesn't grade participation, but there are a lot of class discussions so pay attention. She gives a fair amount of homework but it is very manageable even for a pre-nursing student."
1866,1871103,5.0,2.0,"She knows the material and shows a real love for World Religions. WHATEVER YOU DO, TAKE HER CLASS. That way, no matter how much you pay, there will be a class that is worth the time and effort. She is inspirational and very loved."
1867,1871103,4.0,2.0,"I love Professor Owens. She is very kind and is always eager to assist. You are expected to complete quiz every week online. They are only 10 questions; however, it is timed and you must read the chapter before. The answers are not always short and can be extremely long. You will be placed in groups and the project is time consuming."
1868,1871103,3.5,1.0,easiest class I had. Don't really need to read the book and the class is a hybrid so we didnt meet for 2 weeks staright. You'll be making a website in groups but its really easy.
1869,1871103,4.0,1.0,"For starters, she is an easy grader. In groups, we had to create a website after we completed a chapter. The website was the final project, along with having to present it."
1870,1871103,4.0,1.0,"Getting an A in her class is incredibly easy. Do the work, and you will get an A. She is an easy grader. In groups, we had to create a website after we completed a chapter. The website was the final project, along with having to present it."
1871,1871103,4.5,1.0,This is an easy A class. Seriously one of the easiest classes in college. 
1872,1871103,5.0,1.0,"EASIEST class you will ever take at MSMC. If you do not receive an A, it is because you choose to. Do not even stress."
1873,2346251,5.0,2.0,"This man has a special place in heaven waiting for him. Teeter was super flexible with deadlines. After talking to the class, he would often push back deadlines. He even canceled our final exam after realizing how stressed and busy we students were. Teeter also gives encouraging feedback. I wish I could've had his class in person. Take his class!"
1874,2346251,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher, really seems passionate about what he teaches. Anyone can get an A if they show up an actually listen and take notes."
1875,2346251,5.0,3.0,Insanely nice guy! Always cares about his students. Gets right to the point. Final is hard but the quizzes are easy if you go to class and take notes! He literally tells you when he is going to use a quiz or exam question!
1876,1881356,5.0,3.0,I love Santos so much... He is the most amazing prof ever. I walked out knowing my stuff with so much confidence. I would take him many more times...
1877,1881356,5.0,3.0,"His course really makes you think. Be prepared to participate in class. Do not be afraid to ask questions, he encourages questions."
1878,1881356,5.0,3.0,Santos is absolutely amazing. Im going to miss taking his classes. You truly walk out knowing your stuff.
1879,1881356,5.0,4.0,"Santos is by fair the best professor I have had at the mount! He is so funny &amp; entertaining. He is very passionate and that comes out during his lectures, so they really do not get dry. He always lets us out as early as possible (considering its a night class). He is also very understanding and very thoughtful when it comes to deadlines and exams."
1880,1881356,5.0,4.0,Professor Santos is by far my favorite professor as well as the best professor at Mount. He is so incredibly knowledgeable of what he is teaching and explains things extremely well and relates experiences that we know in order to understand the material. Going to each class is crucial and he will help you until you understand everything well.
1881,1881356,5.0,2.0,He was an awesome professor. He gives out the study guide for exams weeks before so you have enough time to complete them and the exam questions are straight from the study guide. He also says what questions will be on the exams so if you attend class and pay attention you can easily get an A. He's hilarious and gives extra credit which is nice!
1882,1881356,5.0,4.0,I have had Santos for 3 classes because I love his teaching style. I learn more in his class than in any other class from other professors. Planning on taking a fourth class with him!
1883,1881356,5.0,2.0,I loved Personality Theory! This was the first class I ever had with Prof Santos and he is my favorite Psych prof. He is very clear in his lectures and makes good connections with the material. He also has helpful study guides before each exam and understands the needs of students. I had to have him again for Military Psych as well.  
1884,1881356,5.0,2.0,I plan on taking Santos again because he is THAT great a professor. I enjoy how he relates the class to experiences we may have had. It helped us grasp concepts better. He rarely tests.
1885,1881356,5.0,2.0,He's a really good professor! His notes are clear and he makes his lectures interesting. I'm not even a psychology major but I loved this course!
1886,1881356,5.0,1.0,"Child Development was a very interesting topic, and the class was also very easy. The midterm and final are just based off of the online quizzes and the observation paper that's required is also easy. Definitely take Professor Santos. He's easy and makes the class interesting."
1887,1881356,3.0,4.0,Hard class
1888,1260816,5.0,3.0,"My favorite teacher, ever.  Yeah she's hard.  It's biology.  It's suppose to be hard.  But she doesn't try to pull a fast one on you.  Everything on her tests, she covers.  I had flash cards, I tape recorded her.  I worked my butt off in that class.  In the end, it made all future classes easy."
1889,1260816,4.5,4.0,"I was scared taking this class because I heard she was hard.  She's really nice, and she tries to make it fun.  But her exams are really hard.  She explains everything well and lets us ask questions, but it was just too hard for me."
1890,1260816,4.0,5.0,"I have never worked so hard before in my life.  She is super hard, and her exams are hard, but fair.  She doesn't ask anything that hasn't been covered.  She expects a lot out of you.  She doesn't mind answering questions.  If you work hard, you will do fine.  She knows her stuff."
1891,1260816,2.5,4.0,No Comments
1892,949540,1.0,4.0,Just take another professor for biomedical issues! Many very lengthy discussion posts. I have never met a professor who gives a 6-8 page paper and another 12-15 page paper due in the same month and continues to give lengthy homework assignments until I met her. Its being inconsiderate. Also not very clear on what she wants. It's a no for me!
1893,949540,1.0,4.0,Save your mental health and pick a different professor. She will never respond to your emails. She doesn't grade on time. She is rude to students.
1894,949540,2.0,4.0,"I took the online accelerate course and I can say that she was a really easy grader BUT she assigned 3 essays, one of which was 8 pages minimum, within 2 months. And her discussions have a word count that you have to meet, including your replies. So, it's a lot of work."
1895,949540,1.0,5.0,I do not recommend her. I didnt find her helpful and did not enjoy her assignments. I dont think she likes teaching.
1896,949540,5.0,3.0,She really does an amazing job covering bioethics. She provides all material either hard copy or on canvas. Has a lot of experience to share with the class and knowledge on the subject. She is willing to work with you so don't be afraid to ask her for help if you need it! She offers plenty of extra credit opportunities! 10/10 highly recommend her!
1897,949540,5.0,3.0,Great lectures! Learned so much about nursing ethics and human dignity. Very interesting class.
1898,949540,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, had online course, easy to follow, great topics very inciteful material. If your not organized and tend to slack off dont bother taking, although she was nice to some that didn't deserve it."
1899,949540,1.0,4.0,She threatens to fail at any chance she gets. Not helpful and not clear. Avoid this witch at all cost.
1900,949540,5.0,1.0,Her lecture material is interesting and very relevant to practical nursing application.  Everything is tested from her reading material and study guides.  She gives plenty of extra credit.  One long paper was a little tough to get through but she is overall a great teacher.
1901,949540,5.0,3.0,"I'm amazed that no one else pointed out how HOT she is!  And very clear and helpful, to boot!  A great woman and a great teacher!"
1902,949540,4.5,2.0,"A teacher that goes by the book, in course material and by rules. Good and friendly teacher, but subject is very dry."
1903,949540,5.0,2.0,Sorry I accidently rated her a 1 in clarity when I ment 5..crystal clear. Please disregard the clarity sectio prior to this new comment thanks!
1904,949540,3.0,2.0,"She is one of if not the best teachers at Mount St. Mary's. She is clear, and she knows what she's talking about. Furthermore she is very helpfull nice and caring. I recommend her highly to anyone!"
1905,949540,3.5,2.0,"Very nice teacher. Small tests every week. One class presentation and one research paper. Class was interesting, learned alot. Teacher is good lecturer, very knowledgable of subject being a chaplain herself. Grades fairly."
1906,949540,4.5,3.0,"Very nice teacher. Her lectures are interesting, subject is somewhat interesting. Quizzes are not too bad. No midterms or final. 2 papers due."
1907,1762597,5.0,2.0,"She is a great teacher and really encourages participation. Some material was bland and some interesting, depends on you. The class itself is not difficult; probably one of the easiest in senior year. Tests were straightforward, making study guides with the objectives really helped."
1908,134438,5.0,1.0,"'Coach' is so awesome! :) He is very accommodating to your schedule and he is always trying to keep the class interesting.  We've had a crazy semester, but it was really fun and we learned a lot. My friends and I even use some business terms out of class haha. DEFINITELY recommend this class!!"
1909,134438,5.0,3.0,Professor Gist runs an amazing class. I have taken him for Business Law II prior to my Communications class and enjoyed every minute of it.  He's the type of person you want to hear talk for hours on end.
1910,134438,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Gist is a dream come true.  He made business communications interesting through: powerpoint, internet media, and class involvement. He was also very understanding and approachable. You can tell he cares for his students genuinely.  Group tests and short written assignments - can you ask for anything more&#63;"
1911,134438,5.0,1.0,"A little too good to be true. Very interesting class. It is up to the student whether or not they will learn in his class, but everyone gets an &quot;A&quot;"
1912,134438,5.0,4.0,Loved his class
1913,1735975,5.0,2.0,He is funny.
1914,1735975,5.0,2.0,Provide clear instructions for the lab. The lab is fun!
1915,1762600,2.0,4.0,"Not very helpful at all. When he grades work he does not give feedback, so you don't even know what you really got wrong. Quizzes are harder than exams. Does not finish lectures and just reads off the slides. There's no point in going to class other than that it affects your grade because you are practically teaching yourself the material. Meh."
1916,1762600,5.0,5.0,"This class was definitely really difficult in my opinion. The material is dense but interesting. Tests were really hard, they definitely took a lot of critical thinking and understanding of the material. The professor explained the materials well and was always available for questions and clarification. I learned a lot."
1917,1762602,3.0,1.0,"This class can be really interesting because its about current issues in nursing. The class can be pretty boring. The professor is not as familiar with all the new technology in the classroom. The Angel site for this course is disorganized. Tests are very straightforward. As long as you read, you'll do fine. Really nice professor."
1918,1535277,1.0,2.0,He doesn't really care about the class. Learn on your own and then expected to know it. Don't expect much guidance.
1919,1535277,5.0,1.0,"Participating is good, his tests are not hard as long as you pay attention & the textbook he used was easy to understand, it was not dry. He did require a presentation on Prezi, not difficult just be prepared to talk in front of the class. His class made me change my major to Sociology, great experience. (I took this class Fall 2012)."
1920,1535277,2.5,3.0,He did not care about the class. He briefly goes over what needs to be covered. The class seems chill because you do not do anything but come the midterm he expects you to know everything he did not cover.
1921,1535277,5.0,3.0,"Professor Thwaits is a witty, multi-talented film making genius. His classes are entertaining, and he makes the material enticing. Thwaits has an amazing energy, and is very passionate about his work. Plus he's super hot."
1922,1535277,5.0,2.0,"He's a really fun professor, very youthful and a lot of fun to listen to.  Very engaging.  and cute!"
1923,1535277,4.5,3.0,What's not to like? He's hot and a great professor.
1924,1318200,4.0,3.0,"Now, she frustrated me initially.  I swear I could have died in this class but once I made my way through, I understood her teaching style.  It is different.  She tries to get students to think differently.  I love her.  Great mentor.  Very helpful and will meet with you.  Unlike others!  Worthwhile!  "
1925,1318200,2.0,4.0,"Shes an ok teacher.  Lectures were very dry, and she would talk to students like they were NPs, it was too much. She tries to shrug of student concerns. The first quiz is the hardest! you must read every little section in the book in order to pass her tests and her powerpoints do not help the slightest ! "
1926,1318200,5.0,3.0,"She is very knowledgeable in her specialty and really tries to use different techniques to teach material, have to read the book in order to do well, test is straight from the book.  She seems a little scattered at time, she has a lot on her plate but is a great teacher and really wants her students to be successful."
1927,1318200,4.5,3.0,Knows her stuff
1928,1318200,5.0,5.0,"Love this professor but hated Peds. I just couldn't get into the lecture but truly enjoyed clinical; lecture is super long to fit in all the info. She was an AMAZING clinical instructor and despite absolutely hating MSMC ADN program, she is one of the best instructors in the entire school. Clear, well planned syllabus and expectations."
1929,1318200,4.5,1.0,"Excellent Professor, very professional. Her class is a mix of lecture, videos and group work , she keeps you awake if you are in the evening cohort. If you study well you'll do well Loved her class !"
1930,1318200,1.0,3.0,Horrible Instructor!!! the worst!!!
1931,1318200,3.5,4.0,"Professor is very nice, but lectures are incredibly boring! Most test questions are from the book and NCLEX questions on-line on the book website."
1932,2428222,5.0,3.0,RECOMMEND TO TAKE! GREAT PROFESSOR! -kp
1933,2428222,5.0,2.0,"Professor is very clear as to his expectations in his class. He explains everything well. He has a thick accent, however he is aware, and does not get bothered when you ask him to repeat himself. You have to really not do anything to fail his class."
1934,2428222,5.0,3.0,"Professor Cai is very thorough explaining the math problems. I enjoyed the class because he will take the time to make sure you understand the problems. And gave lots of examples in order to understand. He is very patient , and patience is key when learning math."
1935,2428222,5.0,3.0,Professor Cai is the type of professor who sets up his lectures for you to grasp the concepts. He is very helpful and willing to repeat any portion of the lecture that you may feel you want clarification on. I took him during spring weekend college and the course breakdown was easy. You need to show up to all classes.
1936,2428222,5.0,2.0,"Professor Peter was super helpful and patient throughout the whole semester. Granted, we only had 5 people in our class but he really takes the time to work with you. Theres no way to fail his class, unless you dont show up at all.- TDL"
1937,2428222,4.0,3.0,"He is very consistent with the work that is given, clearly specifies deadlines and due dates. If you have any questions, he is more than happy to answer them during class. Let's make corrections on assignments for extra credit! There are small easy points in group projects, very patient and tries his best to explain questions more understandable."
1938,2428222,5.0,3.0,"He wants all his students to succeed. Will make time for you if needed beyond the classroom. Gives specific notes that really help with tests/quizzes. Easygoing and funny lectures. Make sure to go to class, usually based off of attendance."
1939,2428222,5.0,3.0,"Good professor, helps us review before quizzes"
1940,2428222,5.0,1.0,"Peter is a great professor, very funny and very knowledgeable. He definitely wants all of his students to succed"
1941,2428222,5.0,2.0,Peter is a great professor and it is important to go to class since he gives participation points. He gives out extra credit and wants his students to pass. He gives out handouts of the notes which makes it easy to keep track of work. I would take his class again he is great!
1942,2428222,5.0,3.0,"The class is not hard just show up &amp; do all your work it's an easy A. Every lecture he hands out class notes which helps in understanding the lesson &amp; also offers a lot of support by giving extra credit to raise our grades. He does have an accent, but you are still able to understand him. He is also very funny &amp; likes to joke around which is cool."
1943,2460992,5.0,1.0,The class was asynchronous which means it was completely online w/o professor instruction bc of this every week we had one assignment along with the chapter of the week the class was very easy &amp; straightforward. Highly recommend if anyone wants an easy A.
1944,2460992,1.0,5.0,"His feedback is abrasive, he's extremely disrespectful. You can't make an appointment to meet with him on campus because he's a remote professor. Webb is really just the worst professor i've ever had. If you can avoid him DO NOT TAKE HIM. And he likes to make you redo papers and still give you a bad grade. He's very petty."
1945,2460992,1.0,5.0,"His essays prompts were unclear and full of grammatical errors. He is never specific on what he wants on his assignments, but when asked he gives a very vague answer. Since it was an online class, good luck contacting him because it takes a full week for him to respond. He only cares about the quantity of your research paper rather than the quality"
1946,2460992,1.0,5.0,"He is a stickler for APA format and word count, but not as concerned with context. He will never give full credit for a paper if its under word count even if it answers the prompt completely. The prompts are confusing and filled with grammatical errors. He does not give clear feedback and will not share how he grades. I wouldnt take again."
1947,2460992,1.0,5.0,"Will never, ever take him again. Too many papers to do every week and I regret signing up for his class"
1948,2096449,5.0,4.0,"She is clear in her teaching, however her quizzes are tricky. Also, she is a hard grader on lab reports so do not!! do not!! leave it for last minute. Do not underestimate her."
1949,2284867,2.0,3.0,"Longest 3 hr class, lame group project towards end of class counts as class participation  have to stay for whole lecture (will rush class to do activities) Rambles about how much she LOVES what she does &amp; older people &amp; gets mad if you don't put the work she THINKS you should have. NO CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA. GRADED BY FEW THINGS. LECTURE HEAVY."
1950,437572,3.0,3.0,The grading scale in her class is weird (A= 93%+). She also only takes submissions through email. She also puts in grades towards the end of the semester which can be frustrating as she grades hard with little feedback. Summaries almost every week. She does offer extra credit though which helps a lot. She's sweet just sucks at teaching.
1951,437572,5.0,2.0,"I knew her before I took her class but she is extremely sweet. Put a twist on ethics I didn't expect to point I was able to grow in my faith as a Catholic, but also learn how to deal with the outside world and specifically how that applies to the nursing field; def taking lessons learned into the future!"
1952,437572,4.0,3.0,"I only had her for a little because she got injured, but I loved her. She was funny and I actually liked her class. I wish she was still teaching it."
1953,437572,5.0,1.0,You need the what she assigns. In the next class you'll have class discussions. She'll know you have read based on your participation. Expect two 5-7 page paper and the rest are 1 page reflection. Grades based on what your thought are about the reading and the topic. Final is optional is you are happy with you final grade. Final will never bring do
1954,437572,3.5,2.0,"She will like you if you agree with everything she says. Favor her and be on her side of her beliefs and this class will be fun but if you say something she doesnt like, then get ready for war. Very disrespectful when you dont agree with her beliefs. If you take her make sure to stand by what you believe in. overall she is ""nice"" but its boring"
1955,437572,3.5,1.0,"When I say ""expect homework,"" what I mean is this: she assigns weekly reflections that are expected (but not required) to be 500 words; it gets tedious. This class happened to be hybrid, so, as a MWF class, Friday was online. Friday was the due date for the reflections, and you had until midnight to turn them in unless otherwise stated."
1956,437572,5.0,3.0,"Sister Darlene is one of the best teachers at MSMC. I took her for my first RST class and she was phenomenal. She teaches you about life and what being a catholic really means. She talks about the real issues going on today and stirs up emotions in her student?s. If you?re interested in learning about real issues, take this class."
1957,437572,5.0,2.0,"Sr. Darlene's class is awesome. I had absolutely no interest in this class until I took it. It challenges you in so many different ways. Its not a class that shoves religion down your throat, which is what I expected. Instead it is a testament to all of the issues going on in society. VERY INTERESTING ISSUES! Sr. Darlene is awesome plain and simple"
1958,437572,5.0,3.0,Sister Darlene is amazing and one of the reasons I am so thankful to be at the Mount.  She is so smart and knowledgeable.  She is inspiring and a great listener as well as advice giver.  She is AMAZING! I wish I could take more classes with her!
1959,437572,1.0,2.0,Darlene Kawulok is a bad nut. She is knowledgeable but leads the cruel world of favoritism over some students. She thinks she can inspire students by saying she will wear a black evening dress if we do well in class... Sorry for the Religious Studies department! They should get rid of this woman or Nun..
1960,437572,5.0,2.0,"Sr. Darlene is phenomenal.  She is fun, energetic, and REALLY knows the buttons to push to make you question everything you have ever believed in (in a good way).  Her classes help tremendously in finding yourself and your values."
1961,437572,4.5,4.0,Sister Darlene is pretty beast. She can get a little touchy feely about some subjects but she is an extraordinary advocate of making her students think. If you participate in her class and do the assignments you should have no problem getting at least an A- in her class. Take notes and show up everyday. Great Teacher..
1962,437572,3.0,4.0,"you have to go to class...there is no other option. you will get points off if you miss it. this class had a big journal/book project worth half of your grade, intense project but in the end, you learn alot about yourself. take the class if you are willing to keep up with the reading, actually go to class, and participate in class. she's ok/good"
1963,437572,4.0,2.0,"She really makes you think about the world today. Her class is fun becuase she encourages open discussion about topics relating to the subject matter.  I would definitely take her class again. If you just attend class and do the assignments you will pass her class. The only thing is her grading scale, it's a little challenging but manageable."
1964,437572,5.0,1.0,"Best religion teacher i ever had....she's nice, interesting, and knows what she's talkin about, n funny. Plus: NO QUIZZES or EXAMS!!"
1965,437572,5.0,3.0,"I love Sister Darlene, she is awsome. Her classes are so interesting and she is always willing to talk and help you. If you want to have a real learning experience take her class."
1966,437572,5.0,2.0,"Loved her teaching... She demonstrates her passion towards making a diference in the world! Believe me, you'll be different after you take her class!"
1967,437572,5.0,3.0,She is a great teacher I love her humor! I learned how to read a bible and I learned about the 4 Gosples. I'm planning to take her again for a different course in the Spring.
1968,437572,5.0,1.0,"Very easy class, if you need to fullfill a Religion GE take it.  She doesn't fit what most people might think a Sister would be like, very laid back and really fun to talk to.  Her class is straight forward, and she happily celebrates relig. diversity."
1969,437572,2.0,4.0,Borrrrrrrrrrring!!!!!!!!!!
1970,437572,4.0,4.0,Sweet person! She's very helpful if you ask for help. Cares a lot about what she teaches and it shows in her classes.
1971,437572,5.0,2.0,She is the sweetest person.  I love how she takes the time out to explain things about the Bible you don't understand.
1972,437572,3.0,3.0,She is a very good professor. very passionate about what she is teaching. she has a great personality and is available for anything you might need! Had a great time in her class.not a harsh grader...she is the complete opposite :)
1973,437572,1.5,5.0,"Harsh grading, not very helpful, and puts you down. Kiss ass and maybe you'll do well."
1974,2139468,5.0,4.0,"I had a brain injury during this class, but Professor April made sure I had all the support I needed. The irony is that the course was BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR. She was always available. Excellent instructor."
1975,2139468,5.0,1.0,"Professor Baker-Griffin is a sweetheart and she understands her students very well. At the end of the year, we had to do a big presentation project on certain topics related to cognitive aspects of our brain. But for the project, she gives us a lot of leeway on the materials we wish to present the class. She cares if she is not overstressing us."
1976,2139468,5.0,1.0,She is the nicest teacher and is so lenient with assignments. She isn't a tough grader and it's an easy A class. What else would you need? I would definitely take her again!
1977,2293070,1.0,1.0,Attendance is mandatory. You have to take a bunch of pointless notes because there are no powerpoints. Difficult to concentrate because she does have a monotone voice. She can get rude when no one knows the answer and when you ask questions. No one knew their grades through the semester because she didn't put anything on canvas. Do not recommend
1978,2293070,1.0,1.0,"First off, I wondered if she was even a real professor because she is so unorganized, her lecture is very boring and it seems like she's unprepared for class. I didn't even know my grade the whole semester because she never published the class on canvas. She was very rude and seemed to be in a bad mood every morning. I would not recommend."
1979,1543504,5.0,1.0,He's amazing! You will learn so much! Take his courses.
1980,2614610,4.0,2.0,"Katharine is a librarian so shes a very useful source. I took her for summer pathways &amp; was fairly easy. Do her assignments and youll pass. Theres no test or quizzes, mostly just reflections on a book we read. Very easy A, not a harsh grader :))"
1981,902486,1.0,5.0,I saw that she is teaching the class again and I would like to warn others.Please if you care about your mental health. Do not take her class and look for another professor for microbio.More than half of my classmates had to drop out of class by the end of the semester.The school didnt even allow her to teach the next semester class but here we are
1982,902486,1.0,5.0,just dont take her AT ALL. she is super hard and you will have mental breakdowns because of her class
1983,902486,2.0,5.0,She was a very difficult professor. She is NOT open to any suggestions and she will not let you join her office hour unless you are at a quiet space.
1984,902486,1.0,5.0,I had never taken a class where it affects my health. This teacher is so tough and is not open to any suggestions from her students. She thinks she knows everything that will be good for her students. 3 units are not worth the anxiety and headaches.
1985,902486,3.0,5.0,"She downgraded my class a lot, by the end of the semester no one was willing to answer her questions or turn on our cameras for her (which she had required us to do) that being said, her lectures werent very helpful and I learned a lot more from the textbook than the lecture. Her quizzes and tests were always pretty hard as well."
1986,902486,2.0,4.0,I got a 79.7% but with her system that somehow made a B in the course. I DO NOT recommend. She lectures and she knows what she's talking about but she didn't treat her students well and you HAVE to read the book 2-3 times a chapter or else you WILL NOT PASS. Her lab is even worse I ended up dropping the class it wasn't worth the pain for 1 credit.
1987,902486,3.0,5.0,"She is a very tough grader on homework and espeially on exams. She expects her students to be familiar with the material before she teaches it. She wants her students to succeed, but her approach is a bit off. However, she is actually really kind and offers a lot of help outside of class too. If you do take her course, go to her office hours!"
1988,902486,3.0,5.0,"I took Arvand and it was the toughest class I have taken. Quizzes and tests are extremely difficult, and if you do not dedicate hours to this class, you will not pass. She does not offer extra credit, and I had to pay for tutoring to relearn difficult material. If u are pre-nursing I do not recommend her. This class will bring you lots of stress."
1989,902486,2.0,4.0,"Professor Arvand is one of the toughest professors I've ever had. As my first teacher for this COVID pandemic remote learning, she made me not want to go back. She does provide a lot of information and expects a lot of you, but she is stuck up and only believes in herself. Be ready to have sleepless nights and not get much help without a push."
1990,902486,1.0,5.0,"I'm usually a great student, but Dr. Arvand's tests are completely irrational. Despite reading the textbook, attending lectures, and office hours there was no saving my grade. As the semester came to an end I decided to take the W instead of the F. Unfortunately this put me on a 5 year nursing track instead of a 4 year one. DO NOT take her!!!!!!"
1991,902486,2.0,5.0,"In your first semester, Arvand will make college seem impossible, put you on 5-yr track, or quit pre-nursing. She expects students to study 20+ hrs/week for JUST her class-- literally. Verbatim. And she's 100% right because you WON'T pass if you don't! I didn't, withdrew, &amp; changed majors. Beware! Class went from 30+ to abt 13 by end of semester."
1992,902486,5.0,4.0,"THE TEXTBOOK IS YOUR BIBLE, IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO PASS. She was the most difficult teacher I've ever taken, but it was all worth it in the end. She cares for all her students, but she is ruthless on grading (esp FRQ). You HAVE to read the book because she is very detail oriented. Despite the difficulty, she taught me how to study and I learned A LOT"
1993,902486,2.0,5.0,"Prof Arvand takes herself way to seriously and she's kinda degrading. Lectures are dull and she's super condescending. Tests are very hard. More than half of my class dropped- there were 14 of us left and no one got an A. If you're trying to get into nursing, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage. She's by far the hardest micro prof."
1994,902486,5.0,5.0,"She is the real deal. She is the prime example of how every grad/med school professor is going to treat you. And thats how it should be. College isnt meant to babysit you or if you am easy ride, shes there to push you to the max. Ive never met any professor thats cared for her students as much as her. She is a great resource. Can learn a lot"
1995,902486,4.0,4.0,College is not a place for easy A's. Dr. Arvand 's class is especially challenging for first-year students but she will give you the practice and study habits needed for college.
1996,902486,1.0,5.0,"She is a respected teacher, but gives too much when I have other classes to focus on."
1997,902486,3.0,4.0,"I can say that Dr. Arvand does really care for her students. It can be hard to see that oftentimes because her class is tough to say the least. This class will demand a lot from you as Dr. Arvand is the most challenging professor for Microbiology. If you must take this class with her, don't take the 8 a.m. Everyone's grumpy at 8 a.m."
1998,902486,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Arvand really does care about her students and wants them to succeed. However, my experience in her class was rough. Her quizzes aren't so bad, but her tests are extremely hard. You have to really master the concepts in order to do really well on her exams. For me, the hardest part was her short answer portion. READ AHEAD AND TAKE LOTS OFNOTES"
1999,902486,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Arvand is hands down one of the best professors at MSMU. If you are looking for an easy A, go to a different teacher. While she was a little challenging, it was nothing beyond reason. As long as you stay up to date with the workload and study the book as well as the power point, you will be fine. She cares so much for her students."
2000,902486,1.0,4.0,She does not help whatsoever she expects you to know thing that aren't even in the book.
2001,902486,2.0,5.0,"If you are taking her for microbiology in order to get into the nursing program please, please take someone else. She is very intimidating and condescending.  If you take this class get help from an upper class man that passed  with an A.  If you want to be a nurse take someone else."
2002,902486,2.5,5.0,She is a tough grader and expects everyone to be present in class. If you miss a lecture day you will extremely fall behind. Reading the course material before class is extremely helpful. Overall she does care for her students but you have to be on top of things if not you will easily fall behind
2003,902486,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Arvand is an excellent professor. She can be intimidating at times however is very helpful and wants you to do well in her class. She uses great examples during lecture that make concepts easy to understand. A little challenging, but will prepare you for nursing classes in the future."
2004,902486,4.0,5.0,"Test and quiz questions are meant to make you think. Read carefully, study hard. Pay attention and participate! Know that you care and she will help you."
2005,902486,3.5,4.0,"Be prepared to read through the whole Micro book. Tests are hard, multiple choice was confusing and wordy, short answers are pretty difficult. Participation and attendance are part of your grade."
2006,902486,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Arvand is a great Micro professor! Her lectures are thorough and engaging. Although she has a reputation for being a tough , if you pay attention to the lecture and complete the Mastering Microbiology homework you will do well.  Oh, and participate in class! If you do so she will be more open to help you both in class and at her office hours."
2007,902486,3.5,4.0,"She is actually a really good professor compared 2 other professors I had. If u are willing 2 learn, u will succeed. If u enter that class thinking she's a bad teacher, u will fail. She divides the chapter 4 her readings so it's not a lot. Her readings, HW, and quizzesexams are not hard if u study. UNDERSTAND, do not MEMORIZE."
2008,902486,4.5,3.0,This lady is crazy into her students. She is overall an amazing teacher that takes everything seriously. Anyone can pass this class as long as they put the time into it and go to class EVERYDAY. you cannot miss her lectures because she always emphasizes the major things that will be on her exam. Her final is super easy.
2009,902486,5.0,4.0,Class is great if you read VERY well before class. She makes everything outrageously clear through her lecture. She uses great examples that make the class fantastically easy and even fun and enlightening. She can make you feel stupid when you ask questions but she's really well-intentioned. Lots of work in the class to enforce your knowledge!
2010,902486,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Arvand is a great professor. She made concepts that were unclear in the book very clear in lecture. Her class teaches amazing study skills that I will use for the rest of my college career. As long as you read your textbook and pay attention in lecture, it is possible to get an A and come out with a great understanding of the material."
2011,902486,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Arvand is an amazing professor! She was one of my favorite professors this year. It's not impossible to get an A, there are a lot of opportunities to raise your grade (via quizzes, hw, and exams) unlike other professors that grade you based on only 3 exams. Make sure to STAY AHEAD OF THE READINGS and go to her office hours, she's very helpful!"
2012,902486,2.0,4.0,"She does make you feel dumb when you ask her a question lol. Im doing well, but honestly Im learning by myself. I just use her power points to know which topics to study for. You can memorize the book, but UNDERSTANDING the concepts matters for her tests. Its possible to get an A but its not easy, so study very hard. Good luck."
2013,902486,5.0,3.0,Everyone saying she requires you to memorize the entire textbook is exaggerating or not looking at the material properly. Her tests are VERY fair and require decent study effort. Microbiology is a CONCEPTUAL subject and not about pure regurgitation. Her tests look for understanding concepts. Figure out whats important and make sure you know it.
2014,902486,2.5,5.0,"This is a professor who makes an already difficult subject even harder.  I wouldn't recommend her.  You will be stressed out the whole semester.  If you want a good grade you better memorize the entire book, yes THE ENTIRE BOOK.  Otherwise there is no chance. take my advice take it with any other professor so you don't regret taking her."
2015,902486,1.5,4.0,"She is an okay teacher, she says to use her office hours for help but when you try to ask her anything she just makes you feel stupid. Alot of applying though and alot of hours have to be put in her class. Difficult class forsure!"
2016,902486,4.5,3.0,"This class is intense.Ready to do: several assignments and write EVERY deadline in your planner. The senior thesis is a large % of your grade, so make sure to know your thesis. If you struggle with this, get help from your PI asap! (Peterson, Nogaj, or Chotiner) and later verify with the Prof. Though she is very intimidating, she is very helpful."
2017,902486,3.5,3.0,Very good teacher who wanted you to grasp everything that was discussed in class. For quizzes make sure you read EVERYTHING! She is very detailed and will make you work. Read the entire book and take DETAILED notes in class. Then you will be fine.
2018,902486,5.0,3.0,"Dr.Arvand is truly helpful and a great instructor, LOVE HER! :) I got a B in her class because i would study the day before for the quizzes and the exams but you can do this if you truly follow her objectives and base your studies from them."
2019,902486,1.5,4.0,calls students out. says shes here to help but when i went to ask questions after class she was extremely rude. treated us like we've never taken an exam before and went over how to do multiple choice questions. exams and quizzes are ridiculous. expects us to know every little detail.
2020,902486,3.5,4.0,"This teacher isn't as hard as people make her out to be. She can be really polite but watch out for getting on her bad side. Read the book every day, pay attention, and ask questions and you should be able to at least pass the class."
2021,902486,1.5,4.0,"This professor should not be at the Mount. She says she wants to help then she loads the work on, not to mention pointless work. A SENIOR class where class is mandatory or she will take 5% off... HARD class. AVOID if you can"
2022,902486,4.0,5.0,"Dr.Arvand is an exceptional teacher.The class is difficult,but she does anything in her power to help you find a studying method. Prepare to READ,and I mean actively read and take notes. If you believe in yourself and study then it is not impossible!Don't let what other say turn you away from taking this class you learn A LOT!(good thing)"
2023,902486,5.0,2.0,"She is a great educator. One needs to take this class seriously!Her class load is a lot, but its there for a reason. All the HW and online quizes are VERY helpful. Students do drop out, not because she is mean, but because thier not strong enough for the Biology load."
2024,902486,1.0,5.0,This professor needs to be fired. She is no help. Every year a bunch of her students always fail or drop out. If thats not a sign then I don't know what is.
2025,902486,1.0,5.0,"goog luck passing, virtually impossible"
2026,902486,5.0,5.0,"Professor Arvand is an exceptional teacher. Anyone that takes this class should be prepared to study, study, study (hello, welcome to college). If you work hard you will be successful! She really tries to help in any way that she can. It is not an easy class - but so interesting!"
2027,902486,2.0,5.0,"basically everyone complained about her the WHOLE SEMESTER! for biology. im pretty sure she's a good teacher in nutrition, but biology wise, unless you LOVE BIO, good luck. actually u hv to take her SHES THE ONLY TEACHER. and guess what theres like only 1 physics professor basically. lame."
2028,902486,3.5,5.0,Can be difficult
2029,902486,4.5,4.0,"Her class isnt tough if you have the ability to memorize an entire biology book! She is so detailed,uptight and efficent about everything,dont expect to have fun.Her quizes are as tough as her exams & the wording in em are ridiculously confusing. Study as detailed as possible & do all hw and talk in class to get on her good side. BE READY TO WORK!"
2030,902486,2.5,4.0,"This lady is really nice, but her class was horrible. A chunk of the class ended up dropping. The class was too time consuming; I am thankful that I passed."
2031,902486,4.0,4.0,Dr. Arvand teaches Nutrition and that's the class that I took. She's an outstanding professor with a method that's very structured and organized. She expects you to know everything so reading the chapters is vital to receive an A. Her expectations of you are supper high so give it all you have. In the end it is you who benefits!
2032,902486,5.0,5.0,great teacher!
2033,902486,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Aarvand is one of the best, if not THE best professor I've had so far. She is more than willing to help you understand anything that is confusing to you, she honestly cares most of all, that you learn and understands the concepts being taught. She has a passion for what she teaches, and goes well into detail. Not easy, but very motivational."
2034,902486,3.5,4.0,No Comments
2035,646497,4.0,3.0,"She was always putting us into groups for discussions so get ready for that. Also don't miss class! More than once and you're done for. But otherwise, she's really nice and clear with her lectures. Some pop quizzes but if you've done the reading you'll be fine."
2036,646497,5.0,3.0,"Professor Taheri is great.  She is very organized and follows schedule strictly.  Attendance is mandatory, and I wouldn't recommend being absent, as she explains the material in detail (which will help you in the exams).  I took 2 classes with her, I would take more if I had space in my schedule.  She is a sweet heart."
2037,646497,5.0,2.0,She is helpful gives extra credit if you come to every class no quizzes just midterm and final
2038,646497,2.5,4.0,She is friendly but teaches the material the class session after it is assigned. She also never collects or even checks if people did the homework; people started slacking off. She rushed us through all of the materials from the classes she was absent from the next day. She tell us not to refer to the book because it is wrong numerous times.
2039,646497,4.5,1.0,"awesome class, real easy to pass"
2040,646497,4.5,2.0,Professor Taheri was the nicest professor I've ever had. She tries so hard for everyone in the class to understand the material. Exams are easy if you read the text and pay attention in class.
2041,646497,5.0,1.0,omg i love taheri! this was an easy A for me.she is a very helpful teacher and makes sure everyone understands the material. im sorry but only people who are friccin retarted wont pass her! if you dont understand her the book is pretty easy to understand as well. will definintley take her again!
2042,646497,5.0,3.0,Professor Taheri is such a nice person. She truly wants everyone in the class to have a clear understanding of the material. You can tell that she  wants all the students to do well in the class. She gives you all the material you need to know for the test in her notes.
2043,646497,5.0,3.0,"She is really cool. She's really nice and wants to make sure that we understand all of the material before we move on. She is very helpful and tries to make the materual easy. There is always reading due, so if you read it you're good for the class. If not, she still always goes over everything that we read the previous night and clarifies any doubts we may have."
2044,646497,2.0,2.0,No Comments
2045,646497,2.5,2.0,This class was horrible. She taught on the subject after she assigned the homework. It was a bad learning experience and the assignments were consistently unclear.
2046,646497,5.0,3.0,One of the sweetest most understanding professors I've had. Before taking Philosophy 10 i was not looking forward to it!!! I truly enjoyed her class!! I loved the way she got us all involved and made the assignments clear enough for the students to learn from. Definately one of my favorite classes at the Mount. I would recommend her.
2047,2291048,5.0,3.0,"Kind, polite, charming, witty, and cares about society. I wish all my professors exuded the level of skill, knowledge, and professionalism as Professor Anderberg."
2048,2291048,2.0,3.0,"Rude, sarcastic and unprofessional."
2049,2291048,4.0,3.0,"Professor Anderberg is great! As an FYS teacher, he really helped us understand issues occurring in our world right now. Compared to other FYS teachers however, he gave more work. They weren't hard at all, but I didn't think it was always necessary to have one."
2050,2291048,3.0,3.0,Took Anderberg for Fys was pretty good but you have to participate and do your readings. Aside from that was a pretty easy going class.
2051,1445224,2.0,5.0,He's test are extremely hard!  And he does not like to be corrected--even if you are just clarifying something from the lesson.
2052,1445224,2.0,4.0,Mr. Cresencia should not be teaching.  He may be a good nurse but he is the worst teacher I have ever had.  His tests are the most unfair tests I have ever experienced in all my college years. I have taken him at West coast university
2053,1975659,1.0,5.0,do not take this class. he reads the textbook word for word the entire semster and you have to teach yourself everything.
2054,1975659,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Warkentin is a great professor. He is a sweet man who cares for his students because he encourages class interaction, provides tons of examples, and tells you what is on the exam."
2055,1975659,5.0,2.0,I don't know why others students are giving Dr. Warkentin such a low rating. I think he is a sweet professor that is ready to explain something you don't understand. His lectures are slow and may be boring at some points but I least I comprehend what he is explaining. I enjoy that the class is interactive when he asks questions or provides examples
2056,1975659,1.0,5.0,"Warkentin reads from the online book and doesn't actually teach. His voice is monotone which makes the class boring on top of hard. He only gives tests and quizzes and if you don't do very well on those, you won't pass the class. His tests are extremely hard because he doesn't generalize the chapter he looks at the small details. Stay away from him"
2057,1975659,2.0,3.0,"This professor is so boring. His voice is super monotone and he basically &quot;lectures&quot; by reading the text book online. He doesn't give any specific main things to study for so his tests are always hard. I had to self teach myself to even pass his class. He only grades tests and quizzes so if you do bad on those, you're screwed. You've been warned!"
2058,1975659,5.0,3.0,"He's an amazing lab instructor, be very thorough on your lab reports, bc he well dock off point if something is spelled/missing. He is VERY HELPFUL will describe the lab procedure & perform it before, will walk around class and make sure you are doing it correctly. Anyone that complains was probably slacking off. Makes GREAT a pie/cake on last day!"
2059,1975659,3.0,3.0,"He's monotonous, but he's such a sweet man!  However, if you can't stand boring lectures and self study, this isn't the class for you."
2060,1975659,4.0,3.0,"- 5 pop quizzes - 1 midterm and final - Final split in two: gram stain and multiple choice exam; he didn't have a gram stain for his other class. I assume it was the difference in class size. Our class was very small - less than 10, which was why he was able to help us individually. He doesn't explain the lab worksheets so good luck with those."
2061,1975659,2.5,1.0,"This is an easy class; however, sometimes sitting though lectures can get quite boring. Be prepared to do some self teaching because you will miss things because of his monotone voice. He tries to make the class less boring by playing videos, but still it is hard to pay attention. This class is pretty easy to pass though overall."
2062,1975659,2.0,1.0,Lecture: read read read. read the sections in the book that correspond to the powerpoints. quiz yourself with the questions in the back of each section. Lab: review each lab before and after the procedures are done. itll make life a lot easier when it comes time for the midterm and final. take really good notes on the virtual lab.
2063,1975659,1.0,3.0,He does not help at all when doing a lab. He can be sometimes as confused as your are when reading the assignment. You're on your own for daily labs.
2064,1975659,2.0,4.0,I felt as though Professor Warkentin doesn't actually teach. Most of the time he would go off on a subject that would not be a part of the exam. His lectures did not help you prepare for the quizzes or exams so you're kinda on your own.
2065,1975659,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Warkentin was a pretty good Professor for Micro Lab. As long as you read over each lab (in case of a pop quiz) and complete each lab for credit, you will be fine. When you are performing each procedure it may feel like Dr. W is not going to help you,  but he wants you to try until you NEED to seek help. Also, his final & midterm are easy."
2066,1975659,4.0,2.0,I liked this class for lab! Just do your work and you will be fine! 
2067,1975659,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Warkentin is more animated in lab than he is in lecture.  That being said, he is a firm believer in letting a person make their own mistakes.  If you mess up or need help, he can be visibly annoyed.  However, he will help you if you ask."
2068,1975659,2.5,2.0,"He is rather monotone, but he does try to get you interested in the subject.  He tries using multiple types of media to get his points across, but you might be asleep as he does.  He is a nice guy that is easy to approach, but he wants to throw you for a loop to make you think."
2069,1975659,3.5,2.0,"Dr. Warkentin is monotone and his lectures can be boring, but if you do the readings in the syllabus his tests and quizzes are easy. Just be careful in lab because he will give out 5 pop quizzes when you least expect it. He's very approachable and if you need help just ask him."
2070,1975659,2.0,4.0,He is very monotone and one of the most boring professors ever. Avoid taking his class. 
2071,1975659,4.0,3.0,"there will be pop quizzes, brace yourself"
2072,1975659,3.0,3.0,he cool
2073,1594733,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Campbell is intelligent, very knowledgeable in the intersecting areas of law and other disciplines, and considerate. You will love her teaching style as she always carries a positive mindset. Introduces lively stories to her lectures to show you where your major and field can most effectively be applicable. She is hilarious--you will enjoy her!"
2074,1594733,5.0,1.0,"This professor now is at CSULB as a social work law and policy professor. She is very kind, and willing to go the extra mile with her students. 1 mid-term, 1 final, 1 paper. Provides study guides that are very helpful!"
2075,1594733,4.0,3.0,"First thing to note is that she is open to questions. She used a lot of videos to teach the class in order to cater to the learning styles of the students. Student filled out a survey where they selected which teaching styles they prefer. I understand this is helpful to many students, but this did not work for me."
2076,1594733,5.0,2.0,Great teacher and great person!
2077,1594733,4.0,3.0,Great teacher!
2078,2016623,2.0,4.0,"Do yourself a favor and don't take her. Assignments are uncleared( doesn't explain well nor provide examples). I didn't sign up for her class, I was assigned to be in her class. Pretends to be sweet and nice at first. She isn't too approachable. Tough grader!!! Expects perfectionism on assignments. Unprofessional by having her son in zoom class"
2079,2016623,4.0,4.0,"She's nice but a tough grader. Also, she's unclear on her grading criteria."
2080,2016623,1.0,4.0,She really makes it impossible to pass. She is very strict with grading and does nothing to help you improve your grade. Takes long to grade assignments but grades very hard. Expect long discussions post for an 8/10 at best. I was 1% away from a passing grade and I got disqualified from pre-nursing because of this course. Take anyone else.
2081,2016623,1.0,4.0,"Avoid her for SOC1; both in class and online, she is a very strict grader regardless of how much effort you put into anything, such as discussions or group projects. She always expects more than what you turn in, and getting an A is almost impossible."
2082,2016623,1.0,5.0,booo
2083,2016623,1.0,4.0,"Felt as though the class had an unfair and unclear grading scale. No matter what you did, it wasn't ever enough despite all the effort. Do not recommend ever taking, and would not take any course with her again."
2084,2016623,1.0,5.0,Do not take her class. You spend more hours focusing on her class than any other of your major classes. She is unfair with grading and tries to make sure you DO NOT get the grade you worked so hard for. I was at an A throughout the whole semester and she tried every possible way to bring me down to a B in the class when grades were due. AVOID HER.
2085,2016623,5.0,4.0,She is amazing! Pay attention and make sure your phone is off.
2086,2016623,4.0,4.0,"Higareda is a great professor if you are unsure of what you want to do because she really loves sociology. Be warned: she is a tough grader, and she does expect a lot out of you if you want an ""A"" in her class. She does have favorites; those favorites are the people who actually pay attention in her class. So, it is within reason. I love her!"
2087,2016623,2.0,4.0,"Most young professors grade the worst, not sure why that is. She seemed nice, but can be harsh with grading. I've done very well in my classes except for hers. Until today I don't know where I need improvement, I just know it wasn't the caliber of work she wanted."
2088,2016623,4.5,4.0,"As long as you go to class and keep up with your work this class is manageable. She breaks up the research paper and has you complete it and turn it in in stages. She returns it with great feedback. At the end of the semester, as long as you utilize the corrections she made the class is not as scary as you think it will be."
2089,2016623,4.5,3.0,"Professor Higareda is very nice and helpful but although she gives study guides to help out with the tests, her short essays need to be answered specifically in order to get full points. Make sure to listen to her lectures and to also do well in presentations. Also, make sure to be present at all times because you lose points for activities done."
2090,2016623,5.0,2.0,I thought she was really thorough as to what she expected from us. You really need to study the material to do well in the class.
2091,2016623,5.0,4.0,This course is an upper division class that requires time. It is a great class to take if you are interested in the Social Work field. Professor Higareda encourages her students to do great and she is willing to give you the extra help if you need it. There is group presentation and papers but she guides you through them. Overall great experience.
2092,2481529,5.0,4.0,"If you are looking to learn the proper way to complete a case conceptualization, take Professor Chavez's class. I gained in-depth knowledge on how to differentiate between multiple disorders. Her teaching approach is relevant and personal. Professor Chavez is clear about classroom expectations and assignments and has a great sense of humor. I highly recommend taking Professor Chavez PSY 140 course."
2093,2481529,5.0,2.0,"Professor Chavez is a really relatable and sweet teacher who really cares about her students. Her lectures go along with her power points and are very useful when learning. Just show up! There were group activities for credit but not annoying ones, they were fun and educational. I would take her for any class if given the opportunity again!"
2094,2481529,5.0,3.0,"One of my top 3 professors-I will let you know when I graduate if she was #1! Her class is so much fun, you learn a lot and she implements self care activities to start the class which is a new took you can use with clients. She makes class relevant and keeps things real! Quick grader and she gives you freedom to develop your own thoughts and style"
2095,2481529,5.0,4.0,Amazing. My absolute favorite professor at MSMU. She brings different activities everyday to not only help us decompress but she explains why the activities are useful and how we could use these activities with our future clients. That alone makes her different from so many professors because she really cares for you as a student and your future.
2096,2481529,5.0,3.0,"She is a genuine person and professor. She cares for her students education and future in the field. She is so eager to teach &amp; creates an effective learning environment. She really breaks down the material so well. Everyday she brings excitement, tips to what to expect in the field, recommendations or activities. She is simply amazing."
2097,2033021,5.0,3.0,"Took him this spring and he was amazing! Attendance was ideal but if you emailed him, he would understand. Gave chances for extra credit."
2098,2033021,1.0,1.0,He is ok he could def be better. I have him for my abnormal class and he takes forever to grade assignments and reply to emails and should be more serious when teaching.
2099,2033021,5.0,2.0,just great!
2100,2033021,5.0,3.0,engaging and encourages learning &amp; you do! He wants everyone to do well and get the most of the opportunity.
2101,2033021,4.0,2.0,"I've taken his class multiple times and I've learned a lot in all of them. He cares about his students and his students' learning. He also attempts to get to know everyone and promote unison for the whole class. Class assignments consist of online quizzes, reading, and fun presentations."
2102,2033021,5.0,2.0,"He is passionate about his job and students. I would take his class a million times and not get bored, he is hilarious. You will not be sorry for taking his class!"
2103,2033021,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, he obviously cares about his job and students."
2104,2033021,5.0,3.0,"He knows the material and shows a real love for psychology - and caffeine. WHATEVER YOU DO, TAKE HIS CLASS. That way, no matter how much you pay, there will be a class that is worth the time and effort.  He is inspirational and very loved."
2105,2033021,5.0,2.0,Great professor and would recommend anyone to take him for any of his classes
2106,2033021,5.0,3.0,"I love this class. It's the only class I do not dread attending. It is fun. There are quizzes almost every weekend, but they are only 10 questions long and easy as long as you actually paid attention in the class. It is definitely worth taking if you want to take an intro to psych class. Good luck guessing the professors age though."
2107,2033021,5.0,3.0,Professor Alvarez really is an amazing professor.  He shows a passion for psychology. This was my favorite class. I highly recommend taking any courses with  him. You will really enjoy them.
2108,2033021,5.0,1.0,"Really nice guy, best teacher I've had."
2109,2033021,5.0,1.0,"He was my favorite teacher this semester, and he made me not want to miss class. He is really funny and is an amazing teacher and easy to get along with. You won't regret taking his class and as he says he's changing lives and changing majors."
2110,2033021,5.0,1.0,"He uploads his powerpoint presentations before class so that you can follow along in your laptop during class. His weekly quizzes (most of them 10 Q's) are based on material he reviews and stuff from the powerpoints, although he'll put a gimme question sometimes. He is always simple and clear while being an inspiration."
2111,1105278,5.0,4.0,"Honestly the best clinical instructor Ive had. She does challenge you, but leaving my med/surg 3 clinical having her as an instructor sure made me learn the last few things I would need before being a RN on my own. She does expect you to know your stuff, and if you dont know READ, AND FIND OUT! She's great, will challenge you but in a positive way!"
2112,1105278,1.0,5.0,"Prof Burrell is a soft spoken, nice lady but she has a long way to go as a teacher.Class is 4 hr long, BORING to death ,and full of personal stories that are not relevant.Class should last 2 hr top and to the point.The only thing she does is READ the PP .Prof has not idea how to teach or clarify the already boring Roy model.Waste of time and MONEY."
2113,2262418,5.0,3.0,"Prof Neufeld was such a great teacher! He is passionate about phil and he makes the class very interesting (even if you don't like philosophy). I can say this class contributed to my knowledge about life. He grades hard on papers like grammar, structure, etc. A lot of reading but ur good on all the tests if you take notes in class and don't read."
2114,2262418,4.0,5.0,"I liked Prof Neufeld, but I had a hard time understanding the material in class. I would take him again, I would just be extra prepared to read more and study more. I did not pass his class but I would recommend him if you enjoy philosophy. He is very passionate about the subject."
2115,2262418,4.0,3.0,I enjoyed the material we were learning in class &amp; he lectures on the chapter we do homework on and gives quizzes frequently. I would suggest doing the homework because it helps understand material better. His 2 papers are difficult bc you have to research on opinion based articles. If you take notes and study for all his tests you can earn an A.
2116,2262418,5.0,4.0,"I don't usually enjoy Philosophy, but Professor Neufeld makes the class very interesting. He also believes in each one of us and it's very inspiring knowing that he is there for us. He is very passionate about Philosophy and he made the class enjoyable. Listen to his lectures and take notes all the time!"
2117,2262418,2.0,4.0,"The class was 3 hours long and torturous. The final paper should not be on the book he chose. He knows the class did not read the text every week because it was a lot to break down so, for him to have the final be on it is just setting up the class to get bad grades. The final paper topic should be changed."
2118,2262418,1.0,1.0,very hard
2119,2360726,1.0,5.0,Avoid
2120,2360726,4.0,4.0,"Professor Kulmac Butler is a sweet, genuine guy. He clearly loves philosophy and knows what he's talking about. The reading material is pretty difficult to read but he is very open to discussion and dissecting the material. He gives study guides, 2 papers, 3 exams, and small reflections. He is open to reading drafts, which is helpful."
2121,2756003,1.0,3.0,He was always late and missed classes unexpectedly sometimes without notifying students. He is also not very professional
2122,1840549,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Silverman personally is great on lecturing his materials, but his grading criteria are quite fair yet tough for an introductory history class. He grades strictly on reaction papers, mid-term, quizzes, final, participation, and presentation, and nothing else. He gives a class an extra credit opportunity, so take it!"
2123,1840549,3.0,4.0,Professor Silverman is a History genius whose lectures are thorough and detailed but he is not able to engage with his students. There is a social awkwardness that keeps students from really getting into discussions with him regarding the subject matter.
2124,1840549,1.0,3.0,"Not clear when it comes to what he wants you to do on reaction papers. When emailed about it, never responded until the 6 hours after it was due. He did not even answer the question I had asked. He gave a very basic and vague response. He was late to class almost every single day. Blamed it on traffic, but always had a Starbucks as he entered class"
2125,1840549,3.5,2.0,"At first he was really tough. A lot of people still dont like his class. In my opinion, take notes on his PPT, not so much on lect.  Gives ""pop"" quizzes(tells you in advance), his quizzes are on vocab thats listed on the beginning of every PPT. WRITE those words down and MEMORIZE word for word the def for the vocab in his PPT. you'll be fine!"
2126,1840549,4.0,1.0,"His lectures consist of reading of his personal PP. With that being said, his class can be intellectually stimulating if one likes history and appreciates it. But the prof overall could use other teaching techniques to enthuse his students. He was ok in my book."
2127,1840549,1.0,2.0,Was not prepared for class .
2128,1840549,1.0,5.0,He is not prompt. He does not post the slides on time. He does not lecture in way that is effective.
2129,2475435,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Anne Richards is a wonderful professor, but you will definitely want to participate in class! The more interested you are in the material, the better. During personal struggles, emailed me to check in and make sure I was okay. Very kind and caring. Make sure to read the books! She usually assigns good material."
2130,2475435,1.0,5.0,"You need the books she asks for, for the weekly papers she makes you write. If you go to her she won't help you. Her lectures are boring. She makes you check in your phones in the beginning of class. I advise you look into different professors."
2131,718257,2.0,4.0,No constructive criticism is provided.  Responses were short and did not contribute to the overall mission of the school.
2132,718257,1.0,4.0,Does not respond to email. Very disconcerned with teaching the MBA program.  Arrives to class unprepared unshaven and disinterested.  Refuses to
2133,718257,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gosselin is not hard, but he is for the serious student. He goes beyond the call of duty to ensure a good understanding of the subject. He's not bad on the eyes either."
2134,718257,4.5,1.0,love hime the easiest class every in the world...just memorize everything...you will pass with flying colors
2135,718257,5.0,2.0,"I took him for Principals of Marketing, Advertising, Finance, MIS and Consumer Behavior... by far the easiest class if you take pretty good notes and study/memorize all the slides. For Bonus point questions remember the movies or articles or special things he mentioned that are not in the slides."
2136,718257,5.0,2.0,great professor! really nice and understanding. Wants all his students to do well and really cares! one of my FAV's
2137,718257,3.0,5.0,"Finance is a very difficult subject, but Professor Gosselin is approachable via email or after class for questions. This class is VERY tough.."
2138,718257,5.0,2.0,He is a very understanding professor. Very clear on explanations and does not continue until everyone in the class understands! He is absolutely fantastic!!
2139,718257,4.0,2.0,Easiest class I've ever taken at the Mount. Just memorize everything on all of the slides.
2140,949687,4.5,3.0,O'Callaghan is one of Mount Saint Mary's prominent professors of philosophy. He keeps his students engaged and eager to learn.  His focus on ethics (bio and economic) improved the quality of my life.
2141,949687,4.5,3.0,Dr. O'Callaghan is funny and a good teacher.  You will get an A as long as you argue your point using the criteria he gives you.  It also helps to come to every class even though some may feel it's not necessary.
2142,1385915,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Samuels' class was like a breeze. It was online, but all the homework/exams/quizzes were manageable since it was all at my own pace. The homework did get repetitive, but it was easy to go through. "
2143,1385915,5.0,1.0,"When I took her class it was asynchronous so everything was done myself &amp; my pace bc of this the course was very easy. We had about 3-5 assignments depending on the week but they were simple like discussion &amp; short assignments. I really enjoyed the class, it was an easy A."
2144,1385915,2.0,3.0,"Prof. Samuel is nice, but just so boring, my god! Its hard to sit through her lectures without wanting to leave. She gives excessive amounts of work that only ends up being worth 5-10 points. I really did not see the point of the course in general. All of the info covered were things most people should already know about life after graduation."
2145,1385915,5.0,2.0,Lots of assignments but really easy points. There are quizzes every week but you get 3 tries. There are 8 short papers and project due at the end of the semester but she tells you about it in advanced. I did all of them the night they were due and got full credit but don't procrastinate. If you do the work she will give you the full points.
2146,1385915,4.0,1.0,"She IS boring, but I don't see how a math class could be taught in a fun way. This class was hybrid, so on Fridays, we had online quizzes due. The bright side was that the quizzes stayed open from the beginning of the semester until the day it's due. Exams were online and only open for 24 hours, but you could open a quizexam and come back later."
2147,1385915,3.5,3.0,She is boring and predictable but good. She follows the same format for all of her classes.
2148,1385915,5.0,1.0,"Read the book and you'll do fine. Lectures arent too great and her in-class activities make you feel like you're back in high school, but she is very nice and helps with any questions you may have."
2149,1385915,5.0,1.0,"She is unbelievably nice, but JUST SO BORING. It's hard to sit there and listen to her go on for an hour and a half. Her tests are very easy, as are assignments. Sadly, attendance is mandatory so you can't just skip out on her boring lectures."
2150,1385915,4.0,1.0,"Attending class is not necessary, you just need to read the textbook in order to pass. She assigns homework everyday and there is quiz every other class, so it can get tedious to study all the time for"
2151,2307522,5.0,2.0,She is a fantastic professor I would take her again in a heartbeat.
2152,2416098,4.0,4.0,"Like most people I know, math is not the best subject. of course, for someone who does not enjoy math, this class was fairly difficult for me. Dr. Jun had amazing lectures and knew exactly how to explain the sections, if you have questions she is available 24/7! very sweet and empathetic towards her students. "
2153,2416098,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Jun made the course asynchronous, so you do have to be on top of it. She gives a lot of homework, and she does give extra credit. The class was easy. She would upload videos showing the math problem step by step. It was clear, and if you need assistance, you can meet up with her through zoom."
2154,2416098,5.0,3.0,Amazing teacher who genuinely cares about her students and wants us all to succeed. Gives tons of extra credit opportunities that help boost your grade. Will answer any question and provide great feedback. This course helped me score better on the math portion of the Kaplan.
2155,2416098,1.0,5.0,"Professor Christine Jun for Math 02x will give quizzes every Monday each class will provide you with 3-5 pages of homework to do in which you need the textbook for every course. Won't explain the material and will move very quickly, if you need help with a math problem go to the SRC and have them tutor you because her office hours aren't much help."
2156,220650,1.0,4.0,"Horrible woman she oppose everything and anything you say. Gives a very ""highs chool""  like project that's totally bogus and a waste of you time and money. She not very helpful when you ask her questions , loves to talk about herself and not very accommodating.... why is she even teaching"
2157,220650,1.0,5.0,NO.
2158,220650,1.0,3.0,"Dumont is an egotistical self-righteous woman. DO NOT take this class expecting open discussion. If your views oppose hers, she will instantly dislike you and make it well known. Textbook is the ENTIRE Narnia collection and the final exam is a horrific oral group interview; no notes and you aren't allowed to repeat anything that anyone else says."
2159,220650,1.5,5.0,"Horrible teacher. She says she wants everyone's opinion but in the end only hers matter. Our textbook was Narnia. Her final exam is oral and if she doesn't like where it's headed she'll cut you off. My advice, avoid her at all costs."
2160,220650,1.0,4.0,"Far from being the only ineffective professor as MSMC, Dumont is probably the most blatant. Her class will involve an alarming amount of her stating her opinion on everything. The global market economy, U.S. foreign policy, historical interpretations, cinema, theology, The Constitution, gender, her problems with her mother I had to hear it all."
2161,220650,1.0,3.0,"Extremely rude! Whatever is goes on w/ her personally she brings it to class. She is paranoid and completely crazy. Everything taught also has her two cents. DON'T TAKE HER. Do yourself a huge favor and just don't. She's a monster. She may enjoy the subject but does not enjoy teaching or students. If you're different, she'll point you out."
2162,220650,1.0,5.0,"I have never met someone so rude before. I feel bad for whoever will take her in the future. You are in for a big treat. I am warning you, DO NOT take her. Take Taheri! SHE is way better and loves her job and students. Dumont is not only rude to her student but people who are NOT in her class. She needs to take her attitude and rudeness elsewhere."
2163,220650,3.5,3.0,Professor. Dumont was great. She was a bit dramatic at times but overall a good professor. Her power points are awesome and she is really organized. She expects you to the reading because she will quiz you next class meeting. Highly recommend her if you want to learn different philosophical views .
2164,220650,1.0,2.0,This woman is psychotic! Do yourself a favor and avoid her class at all costs. She hates white girls and is extremely rude. She singles out students and makes them look bad in front of other faculty and the rest of the students. She is terrible with communication and expects you to read your mind. She's also extremely paranoid. worst decision ever.
2165,220650,3.0,4.0,"She is a brilliant teacher. She is a little hard, but she really listens to you and is very helpful. A lot of info is crammed into 1 semester, so you have to work for an A, but she is very fair, very sweet, and I hope to take her again. She is an excellent professor who really knows her stuff. She listens to you and values you as a student"
2166,220650,3.5,1.0,She can be intimidating....but don't let it get to you...just be prepared for every class (read) and you'll do fine.
2167,220650,5.0,4.0,"This woman's what Urban Legends are made of. Everyone at the Mount speaks about the dreaded Dumont; I had her a total of 5x before I graduated (I was a philosophy major) She is a brilliant woman and an excellent teacher! Tips to live by: 1. FOLLOW instructions 2. NEVER be late 3. PARTICIPATE in class 4. Don't be intimidated, she will respect u"
2168,220650,3.0,4.0,"Her class taught me some valuable things. It really depends on what idea you're learning to see if you are interested. She is nice if you take her class seriously and do the work. If you don't, you're in trouble. You won't stop hearing it. Besides her grading scale (a 90 in her class is a B+) her class isn't too hard. It's tolerable."
2169,220650,2.0,5.0,"Rude, Opinionated and Unclear on her assignments. The discussions are interesting, although she always cuts the students off. Will never take her again nor would i advise a friend to take her! Stay away!"
2170,220650,1.5,3.0,"At first she is cool, but as the semester gets going, she becomes rude and puts her students on the spot. I was really irritated with her. She also always let us out of class late."
2171,220650,5.0,2.0,Thought the class was interesting and appealing. It is all discussion so prepare the night before and just do the readings. The readings are not all that bad and they consist of these easy narratives about moral movies and books. She plays devils advocate a lot but it is just to make you think. She's helpful if you do not understand a concept.
2172,220650,5.0,1.0,No Comments
2173,220650,3.5,5.0,"Most of the class was open discussion. Be prepared for a lot of written work and reading. Come to class prepared! The grading scale was unfair but the class was well worth it. She can obviously be a bit looney. If you look past her personality issues, you'll learn a lot. Take it for what it is. I'm glad she stands up for causes. A lot of professors don't want to politicize themselves and that's a shame."
2174,220650,4.0,3.0,"Though she is strict, I enjoyed her class very much.  She has no problem with you having a different opinion than hers, I told her I do not agree with homosexuality and she actually thanked me for being honest with her."
2175,220650,2.5,4.0,"Very interested in her class, 85% of it was in class discussion. Needs to be more organized, and not loose papers. Ohhh, needs to work on approachability."
2176,220650,2.5,2.0,Weird class.  She says that there are no right or wrong answers because this is a very subj. class but it's only right if it's the same as hers.  Easy class if you think in her mindest.
2177,220650,3.0,5.0,"I took her as a freshman in '00, and I was scared to death of her.She gets a bad rap because she expects a lot from her students.Many prof's @msmc let students slack, she pushes and pushes and pushes, its a good thing. I have not met anyone as scary or demanding as the Dumonster."
2178,220650,1.0,4.0,"u don't know how your doing in the class because she doesn't give papers back. she considers friends sitting together &quot;****&quot;. MAKE SURE U USE THE BATHROON BEFORE CLASS or else forget about it, she won't let u leave. the assignments r about your opinion BUT if your opinion isn't hers then your wrong! write what u think she wants not whats right"
2179,220650,4.0,3.0,"Good teacher, likes to curve grades, and very nice."
2180,220650,5.0,3.0,her lectures are very interesting
2181,220650,1.0,2.0,"She is the antichrist. Do not ever miss her class. If you get sick, that's too damn bad, cause she won't excuse absences for anything. And it doesn't matter whether or not you know the material-she just has a huge chip on her shoulder and hates everyone. You will hate phi after this class."
2182,220650,3.5,3.0,"I had her a year ago. Her class is pretty alright. I say: Particiapte @ least 1/2 the time, do ALL reading & REMEMBER it. I agree w/ one of the ppl below-be openminded (u have your opinion and let her have her own) if there is no common ground. I did well in her class. Just PREPARE b4 each class!!!"

2184,220650,1.0,3.0,this teacher is ill.  And anyone who defends her is either her or a flunky friend of her's.  She is mean spirited and prejudiced against any conservative thinker.  She encourages class warfare and just inappropriate in her dealings with students.
2185,220650,2.0,3.0,Berates students.  Encourages innapropriate discussions.
2186,220650,3.0,5.0,"difficult, yes, but the talk about having to agree with her to get a good grade is bunk.  if you are diligient, know what you're talking about and are fairly articulate, you'll do fine.  in other words, the weak of mind need not apply."

2189,220650,1.0,3.0,If you value a class like philosophy and look forward to taking it.....don't take her...what a waste.  I witnessed her condescension to students....it was ridiculous.
2190,220650,1.0,4.0,"Unkind towards students who do not take on her beliefs. She will grade you according to your beliefs, not the actual quality of your work. Easy subject matter, but a crazy grader. It doesn't matter if you understand the material, she plays favorites."
2191,220650,1.0,4.0,rather visious and has her views.  Her views are all that count.  She is not nice at all and makes fun of students behind their backs and in front of the class......talks down to you like you are an idiot if you disagree with her.........
2192,220650,3.5,5.0,"Dumont herself, some would call her crazy. However, the class itself- challenging, a lot of reading/writing (worth it). She gave insight, intelligence, and encouraged open dialogue among the class- no matter what your political or social beliefs."
2193,220650,1.0,4.0,unbelievable....if you do not espouse ultra left wing views you will be a gonner.  Loves to humiliate students in front of the class.  Not worth the time or effort or money.  Basket weaving would be more worthwhile.

2195,2416112,5.0,1.0,Dr. Gamson is a caring and very educated professor. Her classes were fun and she helped many students with anything they were confused about. I wrote around 4 essays during her class. We read many short stories that were interesting and crime-related. Her attendance is important but she is very accepting when it comes to doctor notes. No textbook.
2196,2416112,4.0,2.0,"Professor Gamson was an incredibly nice and caring professor. She was easy to talk to and cared about the wellbeing of her students. Whenever I needed more time to submit an essay, she would usually give me leeway, and always left great feedback. The downsides are that she takes forever to grade assignments and gives a lot of quizzes and essays."
2197,2416112,5.0,2.0,She is such a nice professor! Gives weekly homework but nothing too hard.
2198,2416112,5.0,2.0,"Sandra Gamson is the most caring human being ever, shes a very good teacher as well, and a fair grader! I would totally recommend for you to take her class its a very cool class!!"
2199,2416112,5.0,2.0,"Professor Gamson is the best teacher I've had and I highly recommend her to any students. Although she assigned a good amount of essays, they were easy to write and she was a fair grader who provided amazing feedback. She's also really sweet and lenient w/ late work. You could also skip class here and there."
2200,2416112,5.0,1.0,Professor Gamson is the best English professor you can get because she genuinely cares for her students and will work with them. I learned so much from her because she is excellent at explaining and will pick out great topics. She is a comfortable A because I enjoyed the class. Not a load of coursework.
2201,2053619,5.0,3.0,Professor Teng is a very knowledgable professor who has a passion for teaching. She is a very caring lady who will go out of her way to help her students when they don't understand the concept. I had her for the summer semester and her lectures were heavy but very informative and I learned a lot from her. Please ask questions if you need help!
2202,2053619,3.0,2.0,"Prof Teng is very kind! She wants you to pass so ASK QUESTIONS! Sometime she doesnt know how to solve a problem but shell eventually figure it out. Not tech savvy so its hard to message her. Class consist of exercises, quizzes, &amp; a final. Pretty easy &amp; straightforward bc there were videos along w/ the course. She has an accent but it doesnt bug me"
2203,2053619,5.0,3.0,"She is such a kind person, and she goes into detail with her lectures. Just make sure you ask questions when you don't understand. Also, she does take attendance every class so make sure you show up."
2204,2053619,5.0,3.0,"She is so kind, very easy to talk to, and funny. Go to class! Attendance is part of your grade. The class is straight forward so do your homework, go to class, do well on the tests and you'll get a good grade. She gives a lot of homework but you have a lot of time to complete it so don't wait till the last minute. I would take her again!"
2205,2053619,5.0,3.0,"Shes the best, easy class but honestly I didnt understand anything from her class. Just study and youll be fine when taking exams"
2206,2053619,4.5,2.0,"Loved her & her class! Math is her passion! She's always there to help when ever you need it. She's very kind and flexible for days you miss, but don't miss too much class because then you won't pass. If you participate, do your hw, review your notes, it's an easy A. Tests are similar to her note's examples so pay attention :)"
2207,2070007,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Matchulat is one of those people who doesnt realize hes funnywhich makes him hilarious. He kept mandatory philosophy courses (which can be dull) interesting, and always validated his students. I felt seen in his classes, which really encouraged me to speak up both in his course and in my others."
2208,2070007,1.0,4.0,"He enjoys the content he lectures on. He gets you thinking deeper and intellectually. However, he is inconsistent and leaves a lot of gray areas for you to fill in. He is a very tough grader when it comes to the many papers you will right."
2209,2070007,5.0,2.0,Uncommonly gifted at teaching. Both excellent at lecturing in an accessible way and guiding constructive class discussion.
2210,2070007,5.0,3.0,A rare combination for a philosophy prof: both a good teacher and he knows his stuff. Refreshing.
2211,2070007,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Matchulat's class was kinda boring at first, but I quickly began to enjoy it. The texts are interesting and I liked how he connected everything to theology so we could better understand it. Be prepared to do the reading as he will give pop quizzes, but they are usually right off the reading guide. Exams are literally right off the study guide."
2212,1621495,5.0,5.0,"Dr. B is definitely passionate about psychology, teaching, and most importantly helping other students. I appreciated how she would always check in to see how we were getting the information and if we ever needed help she would zoom with us."
2213,1621495,5.0,5.0,The professor was absolutely amazing
2214,1621495,5.0,5.0,Her exams definitely were hard but I loved this class. Professor Benveniste was an amazing professor who encouraged her students to strive for their best. She is probably one of my only professors that I felt comfortable talking to and would not be afraid to ask for help. Her assignments were always fun and interesting.
2215,1621495,5.0,4.0,Dr. Benveniste spent an extra hour on zoom after class to help me when I didnt understand a concept about memory. No other prof has helped me or took the time like she did. She is very busy but if you email her she will take the time with you but you have to ask. You just have to email and she always makes time.
2216,1621495,4.0,5.0,I loved this class. We did some visual imagery exercise with art and she tried to incorporate as much as she could virtually. I am definitely changing my major to psychology because of her after this semester.
2217,1621495,5.0,5.0,This class was really hard. I just met with the professor and I feel much better. She will take the time to go over your specific needs if you email and ask her or ask during class. Even though zoom was hard she worked through my learning and I really like that about her cause this was a hard subject and no other professor did that for me.
2218,1621495,5.0,3.0,"This was a difficult semester for me to do on zoom during covid. I love this professor, had her before. But not being in person and having to learn over zoom was really difficult. Hoping they offer in person next year."
2219,1621495,4.0,4.0,A lot of difficult exams. It was hard during covid to focus. I wish there were more paper assignments.
2220,1621495,3.0,4.0,"Tests were hard, only allowed 30 minutes for 25 questions! Readings are long (40+ pages) so they were hard to understand and keep up with. I am a slow reader. Also, posts assignments very late, which was annoying. She is a nice person, but not a good professor. There were no lectures, just awkward breakout rooms. :/ Get ready to teach yourself."
2221,1621495,5.0,4.0,The guest speakers in crisis intervention were really great.
2222,1621495,5.0,4.0,Good intro to psychology course. The quizzes and tests are challenging but as long as you show up to review sessions you should be fine.
2223,1621495,4.0,4.0,Just finished positive psych with this professor. Anytime I get the chance to take her I do. She also keeps in touch and encourages us to further our education no matter what. Even during covid she helps me to believe in myself and to not give up.
2224,1621495,5.0,4.0,Had benveniste for social psychology and practicum. Both courses were really amazing. She has great guest speakers and really works with you to help you on assignments. Even during a pandemic it was really good.
2225,1621495,5.0,4.0,Great intro to psych class. There was a lot of work but she made zoom class something we look forward to each week.
2226,1621495,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Benveniste was absolutely amazing, I loved this play therapy course. I learned so much and im considering changing my major due to what I learned in her course."
2227,1621495,5.0,3.0,Professor Benveniste is one of the most engaging and invested professors I have ever had. She has incredible teaching ethic and is very present with the class.
2228,1621495,5.0,3.0,Great psychology in foster care class. She is very passionate about foster care.
2229,1621495,5.0,5.0,Our class went online in the middle of the semester because of covid and she was still one of the most passionate professor Ive ever had. This was our thesis class and although it was extremely hard it was a good kind of hard because of her detailed feedback.
2230,1621495,4.0,4.0,"Her online course had a lot of assignments. She responded fairly fast, and gave good feedback. The topics were interesting, just would have liked more opportunity to raise my grade."
2231,1621495,5.0,4.0,"I had her for her online sociology class which wasn't bad at all, but it did require a lot of work. She was very clear on what she wanted from us as an online class. She is also very understanding once you make it clear to her what you are asking from her. I would totally take another class with her. Would recommend to any person."
2232,1621495,5.0,4.0,Shes an inspiration to all of us girls on campus. I was just explaining to a csj that if it wasn't for benveniste taking the time to help and guide me through family and financial issues I wouldnt be making it through college. Not only is she making people care and learn about social work she is being a social worker for us too :)
2233,1621495,4.0,5.0,Good professor
2234,1621495,5.0,4.0,"Great social work class. She demonstrates what a perfect professor is, super pretty, we all love her. Shes intimidating at first but once you talk to her in her office hours shes really helpful. She helps write letters of recommendation for graduate school which is good."
2235,1621495,5.0,5.0,"The introduction to Soc has a lot of work on top of mandatory volunteer hours. I love this teacher, shes so inspiring but volunteering was a lot for me! Although you learn a lot."
2236,1621495,5.0,4.0,Professor Benveniste helped us raised funds for undocumented students so they could buy textbooks and taught us how to fundraise which was something we learned outside of class. She will teach you how to be a successful social worker and college student. Shes really busy but I always tell students to take her shes the best!
2237,1621495,5.0,1.0,I LOVE Professor Benveniste. Very clear about everything and very understanding. She knows what college students go through so she tries to work around anyone's struggles. I looked forward to going to class. She will let you know what you will be tested on so show up to class as much as possible.
2238,1621495,5.0,4.0,Awesome prof.
2239,1621495,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Benveniste made this class something we all looked forward to. She wanted to make sure we learned certain things and she made it so interesting. Not jus the lecture but the way she talks to us and other students, even the difficult one, she made us feel so inspired. I almost failed her class she worked hard to make sure I would pass her class"
2240,1621495,5.0,4.0,Cool class. Recommend for intro to soc for non Sociology majors because she applies it to all majors and makes it more interesting.
2241,1621495,5.0,4.0,Just got back from mlk walk with this prof! She is really inspirational. There is a lot of work for this course but the other events we attend and the volunteering part is actually great. Better than expected.
2242,1621495,4.0,5.0,"Really knowledgeable in the material for multicultural health class. Just a busy professor and you have to schedule an appt. to get quality time. Im applying to USC Social work masters program because of her, so she is worth all the hard exams."
2243,1621495,4.0,3.0,"She is super nice. Caring about her students, but bad with replying to emails even though it is urgent. Your grade basically depends on your exams."
2244,1621495,5.0,3.0,"Amazing, chill class"
2245,1621495,5.0,4.0,Must take for freshman students. Must take her soc01 class!
2246,1621495,4.0,5.0,Her exams make or break your grade! If you're not good at exams take another class. Otherwise good lectures.
2247,1621495,5.0,5.0,Her marriage and family class was my favorite by far. she made us learn so much in such a short time for school and our personal lives. I definitely recommend her marriage and family class to nursing majors.
2248,1621495,5.0,5.0,She is one of the best professors at this school. One thing I love is she is always so positive and kind on top of being very smart and pretty.
2249,1621495,5.0,5.0,She is one of the best professors at this school. One thing I love is she is always so positive and kind on top of being very smart and pretty. If you want to go to USC make sure to get to know her!!
2250,1621495,4.0,4.0,The service learning project does makes it harder than other classes. It was a great class and learning experience but if you can't do volunteer hours outside of classes or don't do well on multiple choice it will be hard. And attendance counts! She's great though very smart social worker.
2251,1621495,5.0,4.0,Good class. The volunteer work and hours can get difficult on top of everything but it's a good learning experience.
2252,1621495,4.0,2.0,"There are a couple group projects based on just teaching terms, one paper, and weekly discussion posts. The paper is based on service hours you are required to do. Other than that, theres a midterm and a final on vocabulary.  As long as you do the work and study the terms you'll get a good grade!"
2253,1621495,5.0,4.0,Seriously smartest and prettiest professor ever! Take her!
2254,1621495,5.0,3.0,Took her for mandatory intro to SOciology. Great professor for nursing majors!
2255,1621495,5.0,3.0,Great prof!
2256,1621495,5.0,3.0,"I am going to USC Masters program this coming fall because of this professor. I came from poverty, violence and immigrated from from Mexico. This prof. is a light on this campus, she gave me hope when no other prof would. It is rare for someone to encourage and love every student, but she does. I feel lucky to have met such an amazing human being!!"
2257,1621495,5.0,4.0,Her soc1 course is the best! She's so passionate and smart.
2258,1621495,5.0,4.0,Awesome professor!
2259,1621495,5.0,4.0,She is really amazing like everyone says. Her lectures are insightful and you can tell she is so passionate. Her exam questions are hard so just make sure to study!
2260,1621495,5.0,3.0,Because of Prod. Ben  I am going to get my masters at USC! She is the best professor to prepare you as a future woman of success. A group of us who just graduated just  Talked about how we would have dropped out of it wasn't for her believing in us. She is very busy but very special.
2261,1621495,5.0,5.0,Awesome professor! I changed my major to sociology because of her. If you are a freshman you have to take her!
2262,1621495,3.0,2.0,Professor Benveniste is very nice and encourages participation. At first she seems like she's an easy grader and you think you have an A in the class but at the end your grade just drops without any explanation. I had a 96% the entire semester and at the end I had a B-. It sucks because she is very busy and meeting with her is very hard
2263,1621495,5.0,3.0,What an amazing professor!!! She is brilliant and gorgeous and cares. Her marriage and family class was the best class I have ever taken in college. I just wish I was a Soc major.
2264,1621495,3.0,5.0,She makes it impossible to get an A. Which is frustrating. She's a great prof really passionate just wanted more opportunity to raise my grade.
2265,1621495,5.0,5.0,The only challenge was group projects in this class. It was difficult and the multiple choice on her exams were really hard. Besides that it's a great course and a hard subject to like because caring about the elderly is a challenge. But after this course I have much more respect for the elderly and prof Benveniste. She is really amazing!
2266,1621495,4.5,3.0,What a great professor passionate about social work and social justice. The only issue was she is very busy and has little extra time for you. But if you make time for an appointment in advance it is so worth it! She helps you and your parents understand the field especially if you change your major.
2267,1621495,4.0,4.0,This professor changed the way I view the world. She showed really great documentaries and compared to other professors really cares about the students. I recommend her if you have a sociology course to take she is amazing!!!
2268,1621495,4.0,4.0,"Great professor, this class made me change my major to Medical sociology and now I am excited about my future. She provided us with so many network opportunities and really made a great ending to my first year in college experience!"
2269,1621495,4.5,4.0,"Her marriage and family class was my favorite class in college yet. So insightful about human sexuality and relationships. She is not only gorgeous but so smart, she is a great professor to take for this class. Even though it was only an elective for me, she made me choose my minor in sociology and human rights! awesome awesome awesome prof!!!"
2270,1621495,4.0,2.0,"She is absolutely an amazing professor. I would recommend to take her, she is very clear and made my first semester of college a lot more clearer.  She guides you at the beginning of the course so when you do it on your own you know what to expect!"
2271,1621495,5.0,4.0,She takes the time to help you time manage her course work. She does assign projects and papers. If you take time from your schedule to ask for help she will set time for you. She is busy but if you need that time with her I suggest to look for her because that time she spends with you is very helpful. She is also a good person to talk to if needed
2272,1621495,3.5,4.0,This professor was really amazing. She made me want to go into social work. She walks in the class not only gorgeous but with a lot of passion that is contagious. If youre are interested in gerontology or sociology she's a great teacher to take. 
2273,1621495,4.0,4.0,She's an amazing prof. But if you don't like group work or presenting in class then don't take her. She likes to challenge students which is good but also difficult your first semester. Geeat lectures but exams are tough and long too many terms and concepts to remember. 
2274,1621495,4.5,5.0,"Great prof! Really motivates you to be a better person, and go for your dreams. Her work is a lot and busy, but it really does help you learn to do it all. I always tell people to take benveniste if they want to enjoy learning to be successful and learn sociology in a awesome way! And i am not even a soc major! Wish she was a nursing prof too!!"
2275,1621495,4.5,4.0,Great professor! She was so good I changed my major to sociology!
2276,1621495,5.0,4.0,"She is amazing! I did not think mediation and negotiation would be interesting, but this professor always makes her lectures amazing. Adding information, inspiration and a lot of development for women. You learn so many more things than just the text. I always try to fit this prof. in my classes even if it's a night class because she is so worth it"
2277,1621495,4.0,4.0,"This prof is THE BEST! I have discussed with other classmates who are seniors, we all know we would not have made it through college without Benveniste. She dedicates her life as a professor. Students actually look forward to seeing her in class, and listening to her lectures. Ignore petty reviews of girls that fail her class, they are just bitter!"
2278,1621495,3.5,3.0,"This class takes a lot of extra time in your schedule outside of homework. She challenges the way you think and inspires you to care for people in poverty which I like. She really does care for her students like her own, but doesn't really have the availability that I would like. She is a great teacher for Soc students, I am not sure about others.."
2279,1621495,4.0,3.0,"A lot of assignments! Especially for a general requirement class, it seems excessive. She has long exams on top of it. I enjoy her lectures, but she makes you do group work which I don't enjoy and she has unrealistic expectations that students can do everything, because she does. She always looks amazing, and inspires, but won't have time for you!"
2280,1621495,3.5,4.0,"Good teacher for the first time having her. She seems very busy. I would suggest students to know college more before taking her, sometimes its confusing and advanced and she just kind of expects you to know what to do instead of explaining how to do it. So expect to be a self-learner or make an appointment months in advance!!!"
2281,1621495,3.0,3.0,"She is one of the prettiest, strongest empowered women at the Mount. She gives a lot of help to students and she gives many advices and inspirational quotes but in terms of the class, she is highly disorganized. Sometimes she would give us assignment and she wouldn't collect it. She doesn't really teach sociology, more likely about life. "
2282,1621495,4.0,4.0,"This prof really is THE BEST like people say! Although, she is extremely intimidating at first, because you can tell she is one of those superwomen who do and know everything, she really is there for the students personally and professionally. This class was more like a law class and was sometimes boring topic, she is honestly like Elle Woods!!!"
2283,1621495,5.0,2.0,"THE BEST Sociology professor out there. She is very nice and easy to talk to. Always willing to help and cares for her students. If I could take her class agin, I would. Very motivational and gives inspirational talks from time to times, constantly reminding us to work hard."
2284,1621495,5.0,4.0,Professor Benveniste is amazing! Her classes are always interesting & she really helps people overcome their fear of presenting and speaking in front of class. She always makes time for her students even if it means she has to stay late. Make sure you keep up with all the reading & attend class she deducts points every time you miss.
2285,1621495,5.0,4.0,She is a great teacher. She is always available when you need her. She can be lenient since she knows that there are a lot of other things going on
2286,1621495,5.0,1.0,She is a great  professor. I love taking her classes. she helps her students pass her class. she knows how hard school can be. you wont regret taking her.
2287,1621495,5.0,1.0,"She is a great professor. Her class is always interesting because she uses a variety of teaching methods such as lecture, videos, and group work. She wants her students to pass her class. You won't regret taking her!"
2288,1621495,4.5,4.0,"This prof was good. She comes off nice, but once you get exams back you realize she isn't as nice as she is when she lectures. She has a lot of experience making class interesting. But make sure to read the chapters!!!"
2289,1621495,4.0,1.0,"Good prof., a bit too easy to say the truth.. Maybe because she is nice, it makes me forget that she's supposed to be challenging and helps us stretch out brain out. Wish she could be less nice and more challenge  oriented. Especially since we pay so much for our tuition."
2290,1621495,5.0,2.0,"Loved her! She is so helpful and nice, she knows a lot about every subject, SHe really enjoys showing videos and hands on projects. If you are shy do not take her she enjoys a lot of discussions and give participation points. Overall pretty easy, but such a genuine person. You will learn so much from her!"
2291,1621495,4.5,3.0,Extremely nice and very supportive.
2292,1621495,5.0,2.0,I love this prof!
2293,1621495,5.0,1.0,"Super nice, is always willing to help with any school problems as well as fashion problems.Does not only use book she uses a variety of ways to teach material such as: movies(documentaries, clips, music vids), group work, essays, presentations and powerpoints. Always doing something different which is fun."
2294,1621495,5.0,2.0,"She is a great instructor. She has a lot of experience and is uses relateable material to teach her course. I'm actually taking her for 2 courses and both are extremely intersting. She doesn't grade hard, just fair. A lot of group work and a decent amount of book work."
2295,2510344,5.0,3.0,Such a nice prof! Took Real Estate online over the summer and it was pretty accelerated but very doable. Make sure you read and user the book. She loves examples!
2296,2510344,5.0,4.0,The class was very informativa and I learned about how many government programs are available in the real estate world.
2297,2510344,5.0,4.0,Professor answered all my questions and concerns.
2298,2510344,4.0,4.0,Very nice professor. Always giving helpful feedback!
2299,2510344,5.0,3.0,Very detailed in his explanations on assignments which made it much more easier to work on them. I would email and he would respond right away. Lots of assignments but was needed for this class. I really enjoyed this real estate class.
2300,2510344,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor! He challenges you, but its so you can learn. I learned so much in his class and he really cares about his students."
2301,2510344,5.0,4.0,"Great and approachable professor who not only gets it but is very knowledgeable in his field. Even though it is an online class, he is very quick to respond and is always there to help. Would recommend 100%!"
2302,2510344,4.0,3.0,"Professor EG was really helpful in making sure that we are aware of what the expectations are for each course. Additionally, she makes herself available for any questions and concerns."
2303,2510344,5.0,4.0,"I took Prof. Gjenaii Enciso Givhan aka Prof. EG this Summer for BUS 170 REAL ESTATE. It's Challenging, but, fun. I felt comfortable asking questions when the course got a little tough. The way the course was taught (layout of discussions and assignments) made it very nice. She gives great feedback and is there when you need her :) Luis F."
2304,970258,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Romero is a reasonably easy teacher; you have to start on your assignments a bit early instead of doing it last minute. During the discussion, you have to cite your opinion to get full credit (including responses). I have known this from experience. Overall, I would gladly retake her."
2305,970258,1.0,3.0,Absolutely do NOT waste your time taking this class. Midterm and final have questions that we never went over. You will be annoyed the entire semester.
2306,970258,1.0,3.0,"Lecture is just stories about her life. The class isnt difficult but it is the most tedious. Discussions have to be exactly how she wants them or she will doc points. I took her during covid19 pandemic and she continued the class as if students werent deeply impacted by the outbreak &amp; gave a midterm, 2 quizzes, and a discussion in the same week."
2307,970258,1.0,4.0,"Class is graded by attendance, 16 quizzes, 4 discussions, a midterm, and a final. Missing class drops you about 6%. She doesnt grade assignments for whole MONTHS. Lectures are crap, just goes off on tangents. The textbook was the worst, chapters are 24+ pages, &amp; you must read them each week. The midterm &amp; final arent even on the lectures or book."
2308,970258,5.0,3.0,Romero is the nicest ever! She makes class easy and fun. She really cares about her students and wants the best for everyone. Tests are easy as long as you read!!
2309,970258,4.0,4.0,"She is an amazing professor! Be prepared to do a lot of reading and weekly assignments. Be warned, her assignments are based more on the textbook readings than her lectures. Her grading is very clear as well. Lastly, If she is offering a class, I always enroll (she's that great)!"
2310,970258,2.0,4.0,"Prof. Romero would make an amazing friend, as a teacher tho, she is questionable. Be prepared to read lots of chapters, lecture doesn't reflect readings, assigns homework on things we haven't gone over. Be prepared to teach yourself. Takes her time to put in grades"
2311,970258,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Romero is an amazing professor! She is compassionate and considerate. She is genuine excited about the material that is being taught in class which in turn helps engage and make the class even more enjoyable. I would definitely take more classes with her. Though it does take time to get the grades back, she is still an amazing professor!"
2312,970258,1.0,4.0,"She does not teach. The first time I took the class, the students taught the course. Students would miss important information during these lectures and she would not say anything about it. She would take forever to grade assignments and give back work. Second time taking her, hasn't changed one bit in her grading technique."
2313,970258,4.0,4.0,"She is an awesome professor, but she definitely makes you work for the grade. If you're struggling, it is best to ask how you can improve your grade. However, there really isn't extra credit, SO DO THE WORK!"
2314,970258,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Romero is a great professor and a tough grader, but you learn so much!  I would take her again because she is very helpful and amazing!"
2315,970258,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Romero is one of the best professors I've ever had. She breaks down the information for you very well. She spends each class making sure every student understands and can move forward. Do all your homework, read, study for exams and you will be fine. I never felt like dropping this course or felt like I would fail."
2316,970258,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Romero challenges you, she is a tough grader but she is willing to help you. There were online quizzes, a group case conference project, writing assignments, and seminars. My advice, if you don't understand something ASK! This  is ONE of the MOST important classes for SOC majors, so try your best. I learned a lot and enjoyed it too!"
2317,970258,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Romero knows how to break down Statistics, especially if math is your least favorite subject. She definitely helped me get rid of my math anxiety, she is very helpful and wants to see you succeed. Do your hw, in class assignments, and study for your quizzes, midterm and final. Seems intense, but she guides you through it. Afterall, I passed! :D"
2318,970258,4.0,4.0,"Work seems tough at first but its understandable. So far one of the best I have taken here so far, compared to a new professor I have, I wish I had her again."
2319,970258,3.5,3.0,very straightforward.must study for exams. attendance is crucial.
2320,970258,5.0,2.0,She's such a nice teacher. Just do the work she asks for and you'll be fine. Study her study guides well because she uses those for her tests. She's very straightforward so just ask questions if you have any.
2321,970258,5.0,3.0,She is an inspiration! She is beautiful inside and out!  She sees the big picture in her role as a Professor- she is helping create great future stars in the community!  Thank you :)
2322,970258,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, sweetest lady ever! Very helpful and goes out of her way to help her students, keep up with the lectures and you'll do great! I'm happy that I took her because I learned a lot."
2323,970258,5.0,5.0,super nice and easy teacher. hot!
2324,970258,5.0,5.0,super nice and easy teacher. hot!
2325,970258,5.0,3.0,"This professor is AMAZING! She's brilliant, smart, funny, interesting, and just plain makes you want to learn! I double majored in soc just because of her! I would def recommend her!"
2326,970258,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2327,853528,4.5,2.0,"She is always willing to work with you, but it is absolutely vital that you make time to do the work on your own time. She tells you what you could do to improve, which is always helpful."
2328,853528,5.0,1.0,She is sooo fun and easy!! Interesting projects for the future classroom.
2329,853528,5.0,2.0,if you're lost... she will help you make your art look awesome!! she was great!
2330,853528,4.0,3.0,"Painting was a fun class. She's very helpful and nice. I admit, taking a 3 hour class is tiring, esp. from 6-9PM. However, I think this class is worth it. I love all that I've learned and accomplished in the end. Plus, I definitely feel I've become a better painter. =)"
2331,2192920,2.0,3.0,"Get ready to sit through a long lecture with no student interaction. The class grade is only based of a midterm, a paper, and the final. Little room for error. He looks at you like you should already know most of these topics. Would've taken a different professor for this class."
2332,2321956,3.0,3.0,loved her for most of the semester except when it got around to the big project. Definitely felt like she couldve gave us more details to on what exactly she wanted and when confronted about it she got defensive. I almost felt like she didnt understand we had other classes to worry about. Overall she was good and made it interesting.
2333,2321956,5.0,2.0,"Professor Haggard is a great teacher and is an easy grader. Make sure to participate and pay attention to her lectures and you'll succeed in her class. You have online quizzes, but as long as you read the book you'll be fine. Professor Haggard is very intelligent, passionate about women's rights, and keeps up with what's going on in society."
2334,2321956,5.0,2.0,"Professor Haggard is a great professor. She is really smart and passionate about what she does. She encourages participation, doesn't assign a lot of work and isn't a tough grader. I would definitely take her class again."
2335,2321956,1.0,1.0,This class is horrible. If you want a real perspective about Film &amp; Media and the oppression of women and POC don't take this class. She will continue to ask &quot;What is your why?&quot; until you give up and just say okay and leave.
2336,2321956,1.0,2.0,She is fantastic as a GE professor because she doesn't teach you or makes you read however she is annoying. She seems woke but often misgenders people and makes assumptions about students easily. Don't take her if she is for one of your core classes though she will spout gibberish and not help you succeed in your career.
2337,882214,5.0,3.0,"She is the only professor in my entire career that seems more than a professor. She does everything to help! Fun class, inspirational personality, and very fruitful explanations."
2338,882214,3.0,4.0,This class was fairly unpredictable but once we were brought all together things were made clear. There was a lot of helpful group work and the opportunity to learn through activities. Michal definitely cares about her students and rewards students who try their best to understand the material. Definitely recommend this course.  
2339,882214,5.0,3.0,Excellent teacher who has a tremendous amount of enthusiasm. I highly recommend her class.
2340,882214,5.0,5.0,"Love her! Michal rocks--wish she could teach every class. Great spirit, witty and generous."
2341,882214,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2342,1087027,2.0,3.0,Has a disconnect with students - hard to stay engaged or motivated in class as her teaching style for her labs is majority lecture. Can't speak on classes outside of her labs but if they are anything similar I wouldn't choose to take it. 
2343,1087027,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Peterson really cares about her students learning, but she will not let you get off easily. You really need to put in the work to get good grades in her classes. Shes tells you everything that you need to know to pass her quizzes and exams, you just need to put in the effort."
2344,1087027,1.0,4.0,Awful.
2345,1087027,3.0,4.0,You have to answer with percise and exact terms of definitions and analysis that are given to you if not you will be marked down.
2346,1087027,1.0,4.0,"She pushes you off to a tutor because she doesn't bother explaining  anything. She gives one example in class then she expects you to know how to do everything else. Her grading lab reports is merciless. The first exam the class average was C-, the class average drop per every exam after that. There only one A the time I took her."
2347,1087027,4.5,3.0,Not an easy A. You really have to memorize her slides. Fortunately it's really hard to fail because she gives extra credit on the exams and you can get easy points on the presentation projects she assigns. Managed to pull off an A- for the semester after getting C's on the first two exams. She is a cool professor and willing to help.
2348,1087027,4.0,5.0,"I hated genetics in college, I could not care less about meiosis. If you are having any difficulty, GO SEE HER in her office asap. Dr. Petersons lectures can get confusing but she is willing to sit with you until you figure it out. Do I still hate genetics? Yes, but at the very least, Dr. P helped me to appreciate the value of the subject material"
2349,1087027,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Peterson is a difficult professor. But you will learn an outrageous amount of stuff for one semester. She makes you really confident about biology if you do well. You have to read the textbook, study her slides AND take notes on her lecture. She's understanding about certain absences and gives great extra help. She's really excited about bio."
2350,1087027,4.0,3.0,"This class is not impossible! It is challenging, got to admit. Make sure you study!!! Ask questions, she gets kind of frustrated when the class seems to be ok with the material, but when they are about to take an exam... then the questions are being asked. If your embarrassed of always asking, go to her office! no excuses."
2351,1087027,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Peterson is not as bad as everyone say she is.  I went into the class thinking it would be the worst class I ever had, but that was not the case at all! Her tests and quizzes are hard but not impossible if you just study her notes. Don't let people talk you out of taking this class. I got a B in the class and actually enjoyed it.:)"
2352,1087027,4.5,4.0,"She's helpful, only when you understand what she's talking about. On the exams, try to get as much points as possible! Every point counts, even if you don't really know the question ESPECIALLY ON THE FINAL. Memorize her slides. Study after each lecture, it helps. Ask her questions to get her to notice you."
2353,1087027,4.0,4.0,"Excellent prof. and is dedicated to the subject! overall the class is quite difficult, her tests are quite challenging and not merely just memorizing information but knowing concepts! She does go over everything in class drng lecture, but people tend to slck off, thats when you use your book! take the class seriously, my only regret :("
2354,1087027,2.0,5.0,"Overall, she is an okay teacher. She is not the type you can kid around with. She takes Microbiology very seriously. She was way tougher than the other Microbio teacher, Comiso. Her tests are more applied knowledge rather than just memorizing content, they are very hard. Rarely uses textbook. Just memorize her slides and you'll be fine."
2355,1087027,3.0,4.0,"In order to get an A just memorize all of the powerpoint slides and make sure to know any mechanism she explains. Be ready to add a lot of material to the ppt slides. In all, this was a pretty challenging class."
2356,1087027,3.0,3.0,"If you basically memorize the notes you'll do fine in the class. Attendance really helps your grade out at the end of the semester just be sure you sign in or have someone sign in for you. As soon as you get those notes, MEMORIZE MEMORIZE MEMORIZE. Only use the book to do SI assignments and to look at the figures (sometimes tested/quizzed on)."
2357,1087027,4.0,4.0,"Everyone thinks that she is such a hard teacher but in reality, they just don't understand how much work they need to put into the class. If you just go and talk to her, get to known her, and show her that you are interested in her class, she is very helpful. Her tests are challenging, but if you put in a lot of time studying, it's not too hard."
2358,1087027,1.5,4.0,Just don't take her classes.   She has no idea how to teach.  She puts up ppt slides but she doesn't put them on angel so u have to type them up and then she doesn't give u study guides and she says to study everything for the exam.  When you ask her a &#63; she doesn't know how to help.  She really is useless as a teacher.
2359,1087027,2.5,4.0,"It is her first year teaching so she adjusted a lot over the course of the semester. Her lectures were somewhat confusing and her tests were really hard in the beginning. Towards the end, she got the hang of it and her lectures became more clear, but her tests and quizzes remained hard."
2360,1492547,5.0,5.0,He is an amazing teacher! He is very knowledgeable and is willing to help any student. He incorporates different elements to his teaching which helps keep the class interesting. MUST READ!!
2361,2514502,5.0,1.0,Perrins is one of the best history professor at the mount! He very caring and passionate about his work &amp; students. He really trys to help everyone he give extra time for assignments &amp; most of the time its like only 3 assignments. The only complaint i have is he a heavy lecture &amp; class is like 1-3 hours long. I highly recommend taking his class.
2362,1998423,5.0,3.0,Second time taking Navarro. She's a great teacher I suggest taking her. It's math so of course there are a few things that are going to be pretty difficult. She's also very nice and understanding.
2363,1998423,5.0,3.0,"One of the best teachers at the mount, she helped me when I was struggling. I had for her pre-cal &amp; she was the only math professor that I had that was willing to help me w/o being mean about it!! she also gave our class extra credit to help students to boost their grade in order to pass the class. Hands down the best math professor."
2364,1998423,5.0,2.0,"It's a math class so of course an assignment every time. Other than that, she's a great teacher that'll hear you out. Her class is pretty cool so I recommend!"
2365,1998423,4.0,3.0,"This is my second tome taking Professor Navarro and shes a fantastic Professor. I enjoy her teaching style, I usually have difficulty understand math concepts but she lectures in a way I understand. Shes always willing to offer help after class or at office hours. Also her online class is a great class to take! Cant go wrong!"
2366,1998423,4.0,3.0,"Shes very sweet and is happy to help when you are confused. Shell even explain homework problems so don't hesitate to ask questions and utilize her office hours. Shes makes math easy to understand if you pay attention. I will say she gives a substantial amount of homework, class work, and many pop quizzes so be ready to work for your grade."
2367,1998423,5.0,4.0,Always willing to help her students. There are three tests containing 2-3 chapters each. Gives out study guides with solutions. Notes are mostly uploaded on canvas and available to print out before lectures. Homework is due weekly on mastering math for each section taught. There are group projects.
2368,1998423,4.0,2.0,"Gives you notes to print out before class. Tests are about 2-3 chapters. Quizzes are given every week and are way harder than the exams. Exams are fairly easy, just review the notes and you'll get a good grade. Didn't show up to the class that much and still received an A. Overall she is good at explaining the material and will answer any questions"
2369,1998423,5.0,3.0,"Honestly, in this class you see math in a different way. I really liked her method of teaching using different examples and providing activities to make it fun and interactive. We did a few group projects and we had homework, not a lot, the problems were just a lot of work to do. Professor Navarro is a great professor, nice and easy to talk to."
2370,1998423,5.0,3.0,"She is literally an amazing professor, she clearly knows what shes doing ! I loved and enjoyed every single class I took with her. I completely recommend her. She is humble sweet and most importantly she cares for her students! Loved her!"
2371,1998423,5.0,3.0,"Professor Navarro is caring and wants all her students to succeed. Quizzes were given but she would give the heads up so we could study in advance. Test were on about 2-3 chapters. If a question was asked, she would go over the problem step by step making sure to answer the students question. Would definitely take a class with her again."
2372,1998423,5.0,2.0,"I enjoyed her teaching style. I appreciated the fact that she would give many examples in class, and would answer any questions we had. I also enjoyed the in-class study sessions. In-class study session consisting of fun activities helps keep students interested in the subject. It was fun, yet helpful for exams."
2373,1998423,4.0,3.0,Her syllabus clearly explains what she expects and I found that most helpful. She's glad to help any student who needs the additional support. She is very down to earth
2374,1998423,5.0,3.0,"Her lectures are very detailed but gets to the point quickly. Shes very understanding of shy students because although no one might ask her to repeat a step or problem, she will go out of her way to just clarify some steps that she thinks might confuse students. Her homework will help to guide you on tests and quizzes as well."
2375,1998423,3.0,3.0,"Professor Navarro is super nice, very patient and takes her students time into consideration. Exams are 2-3 chapters at a time so the workload isn't too bad &amp; homework is reasonable. She lectures heavy so we don't really engage with her or our peers, but occasionally we do play interactive games. I wished she allowed us to use a calculator though."
2376,1998423,5.0,4.0,Professor Navarro is very patient and kind with each of her students. She takes her time in and outside of the class to address course related questions in order to help her students improve. Her lectures are very easy to comprehend and she provides just the right amount of assignments and tests for each student to succeed.
2377,1998423,5.0,4.0,"Professor Navarro has a great teaching style. She is very patient with her students and will take her time to clarify any misunderstandings. She is accessible outside of class to get extra help if needed. Her lectures are easy to understand and she assigns a descent amount of homework. Overall, I really recommend students to take her course!"
2378,1998423,1.0,4.0,"This professor isn't clear when lecturing. When students have a question, she doesn't look up from the podium. Very unclear. I wouldn't recommend taking this professor. Avoid if possible. She doesn't explain things very well."
2379,1998423,1.0,4.0,"This professor isn't clear when lecturing. When students have a question, she doesn't look up from the podium. Very unclear. I wouldn't recommend taking this professor. Avoid if possible. "
2380,1998423,1.0,4.0,"This professor doesn't know how to teach. She is never clear in her lectures. She doesn't interact with her students. Students try to ask questions but she never looks up from the podium. I would NEVER take a class with this professor again. If you can avoid taking her as a professor, do so. "
2381,1037928,2.5,1.0,"She's ok as long as it's not an important class and you don't care what grade you get.  She's a breath of fresh air after you've had Taylor, Behles, and Shealy.  She's the least of the awful professors in the MSMC BSN Acceleration program that could win the prize for the worst professors on earth."
2382,1037928,1.0,5.0,"Prepare to read a lot. Highlight, rewrite notes, make flash cards because you'll be teaching yourself. Expected everyone to know the material front and back. Didn't go into explaining material unless asked to clarify, and she wasn't even clear. She also didn't want students to email her any questions about quizzes, exams, or anything else. Beware."
2383,1037928,4.0,4.0,"Teacher is very knowledgeable and direct.  Definitely challenging, but you will learn a great."
2384,1037928,4.5,3.0,"She might seem mean and unapproachable, but when you show that you mean well and you are trying to do your best, she will help you out. I think shes great.."
2385,1037928,1.0,5.0,"Most disrespectful teacher/dean I have ever met in my life!! She will talk down to you, Yell at you, point a finger in your face. Can't believe MSMC would ever hire such a person...First commenter was right-RUN!!!!!!!"
2386,1037928,1.0,5.0,There is no words. RUN!!!
2387,1812074,1.0,2.0,"So, I had to take her class because she was the only one left. Honestly, you guys are better taking online English. She is a good person unfortunately she should not be able to teach English she mixes Spanish terms with English and there different in English. I didn't learn squat."
2388,1812074,4.0,3.0,"Fonseca is a good, tough professor who is very passionate. She doesn't really go over topics in class so you need to learn it outside of class or review beforehand and ask her questions. Quizzes are long and worth 100 points. She is very understanding and made me enjoy learning more about spanish in college."
2389,1812074,1.0,5.0,"Worst Spanish teacher I've had (and I've had dozens). I LOVE this subject, but she's so boring that she took all the fun out of it. She can get her facts wrong and teach you things that the book says are WRONG. Doesn't seem informed or passionate about Spanish. AVOID this instructor if you want a class you can stay awake in."
2390,1812074,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Fonseca is a really caring and driven teacher. She cares to teach her students and reminds students that she wants them to be inspired to learn and knows Spanish can be tough to learn at times. She wants her students to succeed, and sometimes will go out of her way to do so!"
2391,1812074,1.0,4.0,Super unorganized. I took her Spring 2017 class and she didn't give us our grades until the class was over! Never gives homework back nor does she input the grades on canvas. Showed up 30 mins late for every class and on our final exam! Lectures are unclear and confusing. Nice lady but bad teacher.
2392,1812074,1.0,5.0,Horrible teacher! doesn't know how to speak english. Many students are failing her class and she tried to do a lot of extra credit so she doesn't fail as a teacher. Don't take her! not worth it!
2393,1812074,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!!! VERY CONFUSING AND BORING. LEFT CLASS EARLY EVERYDAY BECAUSE SHE GAVE US NO MOTIVATION TO LEARN. PASSED WITH A C AND RAN SOO FAST FROM THIS CLASS... TRY TO AVOID IF POSSIBLE. TESTS ARE FROM A TEST BANK, CONFUSING, AND SENSELESS. NOOOO THANKS!"
2394,1812074,3.0,3.0,"if you have never taken Spanish and aren't a native Spanish speaker this class will be difficult but Fonseca is a nice professor! Be sure to go to class on time, do all the work even if you are not sure if the work is correct (she gives will give credit), and go to her office hours. do all these things and you are guaranteed NO LOWER THAN A C+"
2395,1812074,4.5,3.0,"Profesora Fonseca is one of the most supportive instructors at the Mount. She motivates and encourages her students to do their best. I took her for both Spanish 3 and 4. Both classes consisted of working on grammar, doing hw packets, a folder, a midterm and final. Attend class/ participate and you will be fine. Do your part and she will do hers!"
2396,1812074,4.0,3.0,Professor Fonseca is an amazing professor. Yes it helps if you're a native speaker because it makes the class easier but she is very helpful and answers questions that you may have thoroughly. She really cares and wants to make sure you understand the material but also stresses that she expects the effort to really learn as well. 
2397,1812074,2.5,2.0,"She does not know a thing about working technology. Luckily, although she assigns online homework, she does not grade it; it is merely there for practice. The first semester I had her, she gave quizzes after every chapter. The second semester I had her, she stopped giving quizzes, which meant your grade relied solely on the midterm and final."
2398,1812074,1.5,4.0,WORST PROFESSOR EVER! She's nice enough as a person but its absolutely hopeless with technology which is a big problem since all your homework is online. She will usually answer your question with another question or with a nonsensical rant. The only way to do well in this class is if you speak the language fluently. Take Japanese instead trust me.
2399,1812074,4.0,3.0,Professor Fonseca is a great professor. She is very helpful and will make sure you understand if you have any questions. The textbook is used a lot though and she counts attendance and participation.
2400,1812074,1.5,1.0,The professor is very easy and leniant with work which is why if you aren't a native spanish speaker you will not learn anything. The only help she is able to offer is translations. She expects online assignments to be completed but she is hopeless with technology.
2401,2600561,5.0,1.0,"Took this as an intro to nursing. This class was helpful because it made people realize what kind of nursing they wanted to get into. In this class, you'll speak to a lot of your peers and take multiple quizzes on your interest to see if nursing is a fit for you. Super easy would take it again!"
2402,2055794,1.0,5.0,"Does not explain well at all. Raises her voice when you ask questions. Is late all the time and expects you to wait 30 mins for her for a hour long class. Her grading is very tough, wants specific answers. You teach yourself reading the textbook. DONT DO IT! "
2403,2055794,1.0,5.0,"Not helpful at all, worst bio teacher this school could have hired! Hated her lectures, and not labs even worse!"
2404,2055794,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely hated this professor, rude and gives no help."
2405,2008708,4.0,2.0,Our class was a hybrid so we just read 3 novels and discussed them in class. Every Friday there was a really easy assignment due by noon. Usually 1 page. The major assignments are 4 essays and a short presentation at the end. The prompts are pretty easy and you just have to give a good analysis and details and you could get an A on each paper.
2406,2008708,5.0,3.0,"Just make sure to take advantage of the conferences he holds, the feed back he gives on the paper will ensure you receive an A on it."
2407,2008708,5.0,2.0,"Super easy, just read the books, take notes as he lectures because the points he focuses on during lectures you should focus on your essays. "
2408,2008708,5.0,2.0,Professor Bredie gave good feedback when it came to essays. He definitely knew what he was talking about and let's you re-do two essays for full credit if you did not receive the grade you wanted on them.
2409,794275,5.0,4.0,"Professor Tan is an awesome professor! He is always open to have personal zoom calls to discuss work or papers whenever you need to. He is overall a really understanding and humorous person! He gives weekly assignments, but he is lenient and helpful. The class really makes you think so it may seem difficult, but don't hesitate to ask for help!10/10"
2410,794275,5.0,4.0,"Tough while you're in it, but because of the topics he chooses, you'll be thinking about ethics long after the class ends"
2411,794275,2.5,4.0,"Prof. Tan knows what he is talking about. The only problem is, if you don't understand the text then it is hard to understand what he is talking about. He reads the passages with us in class and explains them but a lot of the time I just feel lost. Nevertheless, write everything he writes down because he writes everything he says out loud. Goodluck"
2412,794275,4.5,2.0,"Professor Tan is an amazing teacher! he's clear, and is always there for you when  you need to understand the material. He won't move along with the material until he knows that every single student understands what is going on. Participating during class helps a lot, because he will walk you through the steps if you need help."
2413,794275,4.5,3.0,He's amazing(: Just ask if you have any questions and he'll help you out. He's really laid back and very kind.
2414,794275,5.0,2.0,"Honestly, I was not looking forward to this class. Professor Tan is smart, clear, and helpful. He makes himself available to students and is easily approachable. I understand that many students to not like philosophy but since it is required, I recommend you take Tan; he's great. Make sure to attend class, participate, and take notes. I have an A."
2415,794275,4.5,3.0,"Professor Tan is a great professor. He was extremely helpful and never had a problem clarifying what he just said/wrote. The trick in his class is to pay attention and take good notes (i suggest color coding) while also participating in class, it's easier than it sounds. He has a very jovial personality and is easy to get along with."
2416,794275,5.0,3.0,Dr. Tan is an amazing professor! I would never prefer another Philosophy professor!!! Take him!
2417,794275,5.0,3.0,although the subject was a very hard one he made it very easy for me to grasp. Tan can often use vocabulary that's kind of hard to understand or explain stuff in a confusing way but if you let him know that you did not understand he has no problem re explaining and he offers so much help this one of those professors where your grade depends on you.
2418,794275,2.0,5.0,"He definitely knows his stuff, but subject is very hard. Tests are just as hard, you need to make every class as to not fall behind. Class seems irrelevant to major (nursing), don't know why we had to take it, seems like it would be more for law students. Teacher is available for tutoring, but watch grading, seems to error alot in counting points."
2419,794275,5.0,2.0,Dr. Tan is demanding but if you study and take the time to do a good job on his papers you can do very well. He is very helpful and gave many extra credit opportunities. I also loved his sense of humor. We were always hanging out.
2420,794275,5.0,3.0,He is a great teacher and very helpful. Even though at times the subject he is teaching is very difficult he is willing to stay with you after class to clarify your needs. Awesome lectures intersting keeps you awake. Test are kinda of hard just focus on his lectures and make sure you understand the subject.
2421,659111,3.0,5.0,"Difficult grader, lots of written work--really too much written work. I like Spanish, and wanted more focus on speaking the language. But really the only option if you want to continue for a second year. Expect way more than average amount of work for a 3 credit class."
2422,659111,5.0,2.0,"Lovely lady, so well defined and classy, warm and loving.  Her class was so much fun, for our final we each had to create our own childrens book.  My book was showcased in the Library for 2 full semesters."
2423,2010804,5.0,3.0,Dr. Poon actually cares about his students and he makes things interesting to learn. He also provides a fun environment for his students. You can tell he is passionate about teaching.  
2424,2010804,5.0,4.0,One of my fav professors at the mount because he truly wants to help his students. His lectures are long but are also very helpful. If he says something is going to be on the quiz its because it is.
2425,2010804,5.0,3.0,Professor Poon is by far my favorite teacher I’ve had so far. He is very clear about what we need to know for his exams and explains everything very well. He is also very funny and approachable. 
2426,2010804,4.0,4.0,"Was a good professor, lets you know what might be on the exam sometimes he expected you to know something that he didnt talk about but if you just read the textbook and study the things he does mention youll be fine."
2427,2010804,4.0,4.0,Great professor. Make sure to do readings and take notes during lectures. Participation matters in his class!
2428,2010804,5.0,3.0,"He is really helpful and makes the material very clear. Also, he doesn't make you buy the expensive mastering A&amp;P for the course. Make sure to take good notes in lecture and you will do well. Overall, a really great professor."
2429,2010804,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Poon is a cool professor. He is quiz and test heavy for anatomy lab, but if you watch his recorded lectures and look at his slides, you're pretty much good. He likes to make jokes, but he can also get serious. His class was very straight forward, and he tells you what to expect in his exams. Very reachable via email, and gives extra credit."
2430,2010804,5.0,3.0,"Very funny &amp; nice man! He wants to see his students succeed. As long as he is able to see that you are invested in the class, he will do what he can to help you out. Physio Lab was online because of the virus but he kept it interesting and engaging. He also did Kaplan review sessions during his free time which I really appreciate."
2431,2010804,5.0,3.0,Professor Poon clearly conveys course info. I wouldnt describe his class as easy peasy BUT it is foolproof as long you stay on task (do assignments and study). I purposely register for his science courses; as I know Ill understand the material with a passing grade. Perks: Hes a humble individual with a great sense of humor! He wants you to pass!
2432,2010804,5.0,3.0,Great guy and professor! Easily one of the best teachers I've had at the mount. It's hard to make a subject like microbio easy to understand but he's great at relating topics to everyday life which makes it interesting and easy to remember.
2433,2010804,5.0,3.0,Great Professor !
2434,2010804,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, great person. I had a great summer in anatomy. God Bless you"
2435,2010804,5.0,3.0,"Poon was an amazing professor. If you do your part and study what he tells you to study, you will definitely pass. He really cares about his students and their grade. Class was a little bit of a drag because of the long hours, but he honestly make it worth while. Take him if you can!"
2436,2010804,5.0,3.0,"Poon is great!!! Taking Anatomy can be daunting, but he makes this class so doable. He's straight forward and tells you everything you need to know to succeed in this class. Study straight off the study guide and lab review materials and you'll pass! Be committed to studying at least 6 hrs collectively/wk minimum if you want an A."
2437,2010804,5.0,2.0,"Professor Poon was a great lecturer and even if the tests were easy, I still learned a lot of information that I will be using in pharmacy school. I enjoyed how we would go around the different tables with his diagrams/models and ask us questions. This really gave us the opportunity to ask questions/mess up in a smaller setting."
2438,2010804,5.0,3.0,"Professor Poon is great at what he does! He uploads his lectures on dropbox, and all his exams and quizzes are based on what he teaches-- no surprises! He is even nice enough to tell you what to study for, and will post review sheets for you to do on your own. He also allows you to drop your lowest quiz grade by doing a presentation."
2439,2010804,5.0,3.0,"Anatomy is already a difficult class &amp; if you haven't failed one yet(like me), I would suggest to take this professor. He is very good at going over what will be on the next quiz/exam. He gives you handouts to help you pass. He is more than fair on grading/extra credit. Hardly any trick questions &amp; engages with class. Perfect professor!"
2440,2010804,5.0,3.0,"Took him at El Camino Compton for Anatomy 32, He is awesome. Each 4 weeks is a cycle. 1st week is just lecturing. 2nd week is a Lab quiz, 3rd week Lecture quiz, then 4th week is a Lecture EXAM, and a Lab EXAM. All of these points add up to 1k. He also gives extra credit, and gives you a heads up on what will be on the quiz/test, TAKE HIM!!!"
2441,2010804,5.0,4.0,"In comparison to other Anatomy/Physio professors, I recommend. His lectures are easy to understand. He is willing to assist his students until they can comprehend the subject. It is mandatory attendance, but his lectures do help for exams."
2442,2010804,5.0,4.0,"He made anatomy seem easy! He is very thorough when it comes to lecture and he uses great examples to help you retain information better. I took lab with him as well. Your grade is based off of the 3 major exams, so make sure you attend every lecture!!! He's great about going over what to expect for the exam. See ya in Microbio, Professor!"
2443,2010804,5.0,4.0,"I love that he was accessible and straight forward when it came to what would be on exams. They were predictable, you were never left in the dark."
2444,2010804,5.0,4.0,"If you are afraid of taking a mandatory science class, take Poon!! His lectures and course material are actually relevant & exciting. Also his study guides are incredibly helpful and detailed, so you WILL NOT feel scared going into the exams. If you are ever confused he is very approachable (and funny) and explains things thoroughly and clearly."
2445,2010804,5.0,3.0,"Professor Poon is a very great teacher. I had him for anatomy lab and you just have to study in order to pass the class. He  tells you what to study, and he plays no tricks on study guides, SO DO NOT WORRY! You will pass if you pay attention in lecture and take notes. Study the study guide very well  and you will be good! Goodluck :))"
2446,2010804,5.0,5.0,Great person. He truly cares about his students. He wants you to pass if you work hard for it
2447,2010804,5.0,3.0,"I took Bio10 with Professor Poon as a freshman and he was one of the best professors at the Mount! Just study the key points that will be on quizzes/exams! If you're not going to buy the book, just make sure to print out all the slides for his lectures and take really good notes for exams/quizzes. Save all handouts because they will be on tests. Such an amazing professor!"
2448,2010804,2.5,3.0,"I have never wished I got homework for a class ever but if he had given some it really would of helped. Lectures are long and boring, the course consists of him reading off the slides and that's it. He gives lots of tests and quizzes, the book is not mandatory but I would purchase it  because you will need to teach yourself."
2449,2010804,4.5,2.0,Isnt specific when it comes to study guides. Lectures are online and in class he just reads off them.  Gives great opportunity for extra credit.
2450,2010804,5.0,4.0,"If you want to learn an pass the class at the same time take this professor. He gives 4 lab quiz, lecture quiz and 4 exam quiz. You also will do 1 presentation. Quiz and exam can be hard if you don't read. Lots of extra credit. Good luck!"
2451,2010804,5.0,2.0,Professor Poon was an amazing teacher! He took his time to make sure everyone in class understood the lecture. He gives you lecture and lab quizzes which prepare you for the exam and there are many opportunities for extra credit throughout the exam. He drops your lowest quiz and the presentation is quite easy.
2452,2010804,4.5,3.0,Professor Peter is the Best! Class is tough. Requires lots of reading and of course you are expected to memorize lots! Quizzes and exams comes from PowerPoint and lab book. Gives extra credit if you ask! He is fair! I enjoyed the class and I did study 6hrs every day for this class that's how I got my A!
2453,2010804,4.0,4.0,"One of the best professor! This class requires lots of memorizations but if you listen to the lecture and read the power points you will do fine. He also gives  extra credits, TAKE Advantage of the EC! I took his class at Elcamino Compton fall 2015! If you want to get an A then you need to put in the work!"
2454,2010804,5.0,4.0,"Mr poon is a great teacher! hes funny works with you and helps you if you are lost! He does make you work for your grade but, only for your benefit! this class was one of the best class i have ever taken during summer session. Even tough it was a fast semester and we covered alot of material i learned alot! TAKE HIM!!!! Hes a GREAT TEACHER!!!"
2455,2010804,5.0,4.0,"Professor Poon has by far been the BEST professor at Mount Saint Marys! He does make you work for your grade, but if you attend class you wont have a problem. Poon exceeds any professor, and makes sure his students understand the material! He is very down to earth, and hilarious! He should teach more courses, I'd would deff take him again!"
2456,1861300,4.5,3.0,"Professor is quirky and awesome, is really interested in his students. Doesn't make you feel like an idiot. Class is very visual and the hour and a half goes by very quickly through engaging class discussion, and lots of visual aids and fun deep thinking. Great professor overall."
2457,1861300,5.0,2.0,"Honestly, the best I have ever taken! He's so cool and his lectures and class activities are fun and help me understand the material! I highly recommend taking his class! He makes philosophy and interesting! He gives feedback on papers and he gives studyguides for his exams!"
2458,560822,5.0,3.0,Dr. Kidd is extremely intelligent I am a better English student because of her teaching. She knows so much so ask as many questions as you would like. She makes learning fun and exciting.
2459,560822,5.0,1.0,Very flexible and reasonable.
2460,560822,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Kidd is a great instructor, funny, and understanding when it comes to papers and in class work."
2461,560822,4.5,3.0,Dr. Kidd is very interested in what she teaches. She is such a sweet lady and overall i think she taught a good class.
2462,560822,5.0,3.0,There are some professors that you will always remember because they inspired you to become a better student.  This is what Dr. Kidd did for me.  Loved her classes.  She also helped me discover the fascinating world of literature.  I will always be grateful for her support and encouragement.
2463,1494710,4.0,4.0,"Completely different from anatomy lab. There are a lot of labs and tests are based on the labs you do in class. Reviewing the labs was the best way for me to prepare for tests. Read everything. She goes over some things, but not all so if you're confused make sure to ask. There is a big final group project."
2464,1494710,5.0,4.0,"Livas is straightforward with how she teaches and grades the course. Write everthing down. I constantly reviewed homework and class notes. If you don't show up to class or put in the time to review you will not pass this course. The class was challenging, but it was straightforward and helped me a lot in lecture. Textbook is only used for images."
2465,1494710,2.0,4.0,"Livas is a great professor, and does know her stuff, but she simply reads off the slides which makes lecture pretty boring. along with that, the exams are very long, and it doesn't help that we can't review our quizzes to understand what we get wrong or right. just beware to self-teach yourself. "
2466,1494710,4.0,4.0,"I took this course over the summer online, and it was hard. I hardly did good on the weekly quizzes, but I always aced the homework and labs. A textbook is mandatory for her class. Be ready to write notes and study all day. It is very stressful, but once you get the hang of it, you will be fine. All I can say is STUDY."
2467,1494710,4.0,4.0,"Currently taking Livas for Anat. Lec. and Lab. She's super nice, straightforward, and gives the necessary information. She explains topics so well and is open to answering questions. Take notes on what she says in class, MAKE THE TIME TO STUDY, and try hard on HW (helps a lot for tests and quizzes)."
2468,1494710,5.0,5.0,"I took Human Anatomy Lab online for the Summer and honestly, this class was easy as long as you study what she tells you too. She lets you know exactly what will be on the quiz and the homework definitely helps. If you have any questions make sure you ask BEFORE the quiz."
2469,1494710,5.0,5.0,"I took Professor Livas Human Anatomy Lecture online during the Summer, and honestly, majority of the exams and quizzes are based on the homework so if you do not do your homework, you will not pass."
2470,1494710,5.0,4.0,"Her class IS difficult, but A&amp;P usually is. She is such a good lecturer. She literally goes off the book, but also expands from it. I suggest pay attention to whatever she says in class, because 100% everything she says ends up on the exam! Overall, she is very understanding and patient. I 10/10 recommend her, best of luck."
2471,1494710,5.0,2.0,"Learning muscles was painful, but that was the only real tough hurdle. Livas is apparently the more difficult lab prof, but if you take her w/ Chang as your lecture prof, you're going to be prepared. If you know how to study, the weekly quizzes+midterms should be really doable. The midterm is just a compilation of her quizzes. Highly recommend."
2472,1494710,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Livas certainly made this year very entertaining, especially for an 8 AM lab class that lasts three hours! I took her for Anatomy Lab and Physio Lab, and I would take any class she teaches in the future. She gives tough exams, but they really helped me prepare for my lecture classes."
2473,1494710,4.0,3.0,"Her lab for both physio and anatomy are one of the tough labs on campus. Her anatomy lab is like another lecture class, and her weekly quizzes are no piece of pie, either. She makes you work for your grade, but she's a fair professor. If you re struggling in her class, my best advice is to reach out to her, and she will make time to talk to you."
2474,1494710,4.0,4.0,"Personally, I like Dr. Livas. Her anatomy lecture exams are super tough, but if you study Mastering A&amp;P you should be fine. Her short answers are hard if you do not have her as your lab instructor, as well. When you know you are struggling in her class, reach out to her and ask for help. She will give you tips and advice how to do better."
2475,1494710,4.0,3.0,"I love Dr. Livas! She really does a great job in helping students remember all the ID terms. There are weekly quizzes so make sure you prepare. Her quizzes actually help us stay on top of our material so by the time an exam comes around, we're not cramming a bunch of new info into our brains."
2476,1494710,5.0,4.0,"Anatomy is a hard class overall. It will be hard with whichever instructor you take. I would recommend Dr. Livas because she tells you exactly what material needs to be reviewed before an exam. SHE WON'T TRICK YOU like other insctructors do. Whatever she says will be on the exam, that's what it'll be."
2477,1494710,5.0,3.0,"I love her because she tells you what to study and that is what is going to be on your exam. If you stufy you will pass. She gives weekly quizes which are good practice but in the end they dont really affect you. The exams are what matter, they are multiple choice, true false, and fill in. I would definetly recommend her! Write down everything!"
2478,1494710,5.0,4.0,"Beware, Dr. Livas does not do multiple choice on her quizzes/exams.  That being said, it would be a good idea to take her because you will definitely know your stuff and learn the material.  Staying on top of the material is vital to pass this class.  It may have been tough, but if you work for it, it's all worth it."
2479,1494710,5.0,4.0,"Professor Livas is my favorite. She helped me pass my anatomy lecture because of her weekly quizzes. She was very clear on what would be on the quizzes and tests. Memorization is key for this course. The first test was easy, second test a little bit difficult and the final was easy. As long as you do well on the quizzes you will be fine for tests."
2480,1494710,3.5,5.0,"She is very clear and possibly the best professor at explaining on campus, but her exams are extremely difficult no matter how much you study and know your material. she likes specific details so be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this class. Over all great professor."
2481,1494710,4.5,5.0,"Anatomy lab is a very difficult class due to all of the memorizing, but it's worth it because she teaches you so much. Everything that she gives you is really helpful for lecture. Physio lab is much much easier than anatomy lab. I received an A both semesters."
2482,1494710,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Livas is the best lab professor on campus! She is a physical therapist so she really knows her stuff.She may be more challenging than the other lab professors, but you will come out knowing the most. She is always willing to help you and is very chill. Definitely take this teacher! You will not regret it! I got a B+ both semesters. :)"
2483,1494710,5.0,5.0,"She truly is a great teacher who wants you to succeed. She gives you study tips and time to ask questions. She never lectured for the full time in my class (although she did in another section due to more questions being asked). She is the hardest of the anatomy lab professors, but in the end you will know your material."
2484,1736383,5.0,3.0,I loved Levy's class! Her classes consists mostly of presentations and class discussions. If you actually pay attention you will learn some interesting things from Levy. I really liked the class discussion. She also makes so many side jokes which I think are hilarious. Great professor with great humor that you can actually learn from!
2485,1736383,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor, very knowledgeable. Gives life exsamples along with lectures. Quizzes and tests are easy most answers from lectures."
2486,1736383,5.0,3.0,Professor Levy is the best! I learned so much in this class and it was a lot of fun. She has a lot of experience in the field which was a great touch on all of her lessons.  I would take any class that she teaches.
2487,1736383,2.5,5.0,"Caring  and knowledgeable teacher  However, lectures are not helpful  More talking, laughter & sharing personal stories  Did not learn that much Would have been helpful to have homework rather than just saying read the book  Failed class and took the class over the following semester with another instructor Got an A Will never take a class w/Levy"
2488,1736383,4.5,2.0,"Helpful, caring, & knowledgeable. Really works hard to make sure you understand the material, happy to offer guidance & support, motivated to teach. Makes content very interesting to learn about. Very organized & prepared to teach the class. Exams are fair, make sure to read/take notes based on lecture. Overall, Levy is a great teacher!"
2489,1736383,5.0,4.0,"I've taken professor Levy twice now for 2 graduate classes. I absolutely recommend her she not only knows the material extremely well but she has all the life experiences that professors who've only taught can't give you. She's not my advisor but she's acted like a mentor for myself and many other classmates. Read and pay attention, you'll be fine."
2490,1736383,5.0,1.0,"She is an excellent teacher. Very helpful, understanding, funny, and clear. She never gives any ridiculous assignments and if you do your readings for the quizzes, you will do fine. I would advise anyone to take her. In fact, I am taking her again next semester for a different class!"
2491,2727624,5.0,3.0,"She is very kind and understanding, she likes it when you ask questions and is patient."
2492,2727624,5.0,2.0,"I loved having Prof. Turjman as my professor! She was very kind and explained things thoroughly if there were any questions. Pretty straightforward, just make sure to study on your own time as well. "
2493,2727624,5.0,3.0,"She is AMAZING, I LOVE her. She is very understanding of individual situations if you communicate with her. She WANTS her students to pass and makes herself available to do so."
2494,2727624,5.0,3.0,"Professor Turjman is the best, when she would lecture she made it very interactive. During the lab portion, she was always willing to help if something was confusing. Overall the nicest and would let us know if there were any extra credit assignments. However, be ready to do pre-lab quizzes which are due before class. As well as post-lab ones."
2495,1121993,3.0,3.0,"She's well spoken but you can't always understand what she is saying because the terms & concepts she speaks about don't seem ""intro"" to christian ethics at all which is what this class is supposed to be. She takes attendance the second class starts and if you're late even a minute, points off. She lectures the entire time and many pop quiz, READ!!"
2496,1121993,5.0,2.0,"Her class is very interesting. If you are going into the medical field, this class is a must becuase it really shows you the ethics of healthcare. Her lectures are really fascinating and all of the assignments due are papers. If you don't understand something, she is very helpful. Great class!"
2497,1937098,1.0,3.0,"Having taken thiscourse before as an AP in high school(same textbook+class content)I have a clear comparison between ways this class could be taught v the way it is being taught by professor jones.She communicates her material clearly and in a very timely manner.However,her personality makes it easy to feel judged.would b better kindergardn teacher"
2498,1937098,5.0,3.0,"super kind! get to know her, and ask questions if you need help, she is very receptive. lecture heavy, enviro with her is also really cool. would recommend going to office hours and talking to her. she's great."
2499,1937098,4.0,3.0,"Everyone struggles with their first bio course. Dr. Jones is very laid back and caring but can sometimes come off as judgy. Her quizzes and exams are based on her power points and the book/additional readings. Overall, if you actually do the work and pay attention in class you should be fine."
2500,1937098,5.0,2.0,"This class is easy, Jones just expects us to discuss more often. She allows talks about how her advance environment science class is her favorite class to teach. Overall she is more easier to take in enviro than in bio 1."
2501,1937098,2.0,4.0,"Jones wants specifics within her test/exams she wants you be able to understand &amp; explain everything clearly when taking her I had trouble understanding her lecture bc she grades on techniques &amp; concepts rather than what is on her lecture she is passionate about her students, but she get mad when everyone does not do good &amp; blame it on us."
2502,1937098,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Jones, if a very caring professor. However, she just goes over powerpoints and it honestly doesn't make a difference to go to class. Her test is based on concepts, you have to memorize everything she gives you and i mean everything she gives you from powerpoint to worksheets, to the discussion. Especially the phylogenetic trees."
2503,1937098,2.0,5.0,"One thing that I love about her is the passion that she has for the class. That the material is interesting. But this was a very challenging class for me. When I first started her class I assumed that her quizzes would be on the slides, some questions would others wouldnt. Personally it was a very overwhelming class. I wouldnt recommend taking."
2504,1937098,5.0,3.0,"I really liked her because she really made me love bio, and everything from her powerpoint and what she talks about is basically the quizzes, the exams take a little bit more understanding, which u can take the harder practice quizzes that the Cambell online thing offers and as long as u understand those u can get a B/A on her exams"
2505,1937098,2.0,5.0,"PowerPoints have nothing to do with what ur being quizzed on. U are better off reading the entire chapter and taking ur own notes. Talks way 2fast class and expects u to know whats going on. Be prepared 2study a lot! Memorizing things wont help, she wants you 2apply concepts and use ciritical thinking on exams. Im almost + half the class failed"
2506,1937098,3.0,5.0,"She is nice &amp; passionate but she goes way too fast in lecture, can be very unclear, &amp; has quizzes every week for lecture &amp; lab. Her tests are very detailed, difficult, and lots of essay questions. She packs too much in lecture and expects you to have memorized 3 chapters worth of information in a week. Most of the class is failing."
2507,1937098,3.0,4.0,her slides barely touch the surface of what comes in the quiz
2508,1937098,2.0,4.0,"She's such a nice person, love plants, but the overall class isn't that enjoyable at all plus her quizzes, and exams don't match the powerpoints. the questions are always very difficult to the the answers because they are crItical thinking problems, memorizing will not help you succeed.  There is no homework, and no extra credit to help you."
2509,1937098,1.0,4.0,"Yeah she's very passionate about Bio but honestly her class ehh. She moved way to quickly. She's very impatient during lecture which is actually very distracting. If someone asks another person for a pencil or a simple question during lecture she gets annoyed and asks ""oh do you have a question?"" You have to really LOVE bio to enjoy this class."
2510,1937098,4.0,3.0,"I love this class, at first I was like, ""why am I taking this class,"" but I'm happy I did it was fun, it was hands on and it was very informative. Take good notes and her quizzes and exams questions come straight from the lectures. She is smart , funny and really nice, any questions she answers she loves, love,s loves, loves working with students ."
2511,1937098,4.0,4.0,"Excellent teacher, but her exams are very difficult and require more critical thinking and application of what you've learned in class. It is not easy to receive an A in her class. "
2512,1937098,2.0,5.0,She is a HORRIBLE professor. Her quizzes and exams are very tricky in the way she words her questions. More than half the class is barley passing.
2513,1937098,1.0,5.0,Her test and exam questions are very tricky.
2514,1937098,4.5,3.0,She LOVES what she does.
2515,1937098,5.0,3.0,Really helpful and very kind. She will personally ask you what is going on and if you need help in class. If you pay attention during lecture everything she puts on her power points are on her quizzes and test. She may go into detail on her tests but if you need help with concept she is always there to lend a helping hand.
2516,872143,1.0,5.0,"I really wish I could rate him.  He bailed on the class just before the semester began (rumor has it, to write a book).  The replacement instructor is WAY better from what other students have told me, and we have learned more than if Cummings had shown up as expected."
2517,872143,5.0,1.0,Awesome Professor. He really knows his material and you will never fall asleep in his class.
2518,872143,4.5,1.0,"Death & Afterlife - very interesting. Cummings knows his material. Lets everyone speak. Shortened class hrs. Just do the assignments and show up. Books not well-edited, which was a disappointment."
2519,872143,5.0,3.0,Prof C rocks!!! This is my second class with him at the weekend college. Love his lectures. He has you do a lot of reading but it's all very interesting.
2520,872143,5.0,1.0,"He is a great professor, just be prepared to write a 10 pg paper. Make sure you do all of your posting on angel. He is awesome"
2521,872143,4.5,1.0,"He's a pretty cool teacher, he will lose track of time once he gets into talking. All he wants you to do is read, post your thoughts and a research paper."
2522,872143,4.5,2.0,His teaching method is unorthodox in that he goes off on tangents - but they're interesting tangents. I've always enjoyed his classes.
2523,872143,3.0,1.0,"Am a Weekend College Student, and I gotta say his class definately lightens the load.  But I find that I'm really not learning anything.  Wish the class was more structured.  I'm not even sure what is required of me!  Not sure I'd take him again... unless I knew I had a super hard, demanding class and need a break."
2524,872143,2.5,1.0,"I recommend any class w/ Dr. ****mings is you are taking a full load.  It's easy enough where you can balance it out and get a good grade, just as long as you finish up the assignments.  He's very generous w/ due dates, but don't push it or else you'll end up in a rush at the end."
2525,872143,1.0,1.0,"What can I say about Randal&#63;  Although he comes off as funny and cool up in front of class, he can actually be a jerk.  His class was easy but I wouldn't take him again."
2526,872143,2.0,1.0,He is VERY laid back so assignments are never due on the date he originally states. His lectures always get off topic and his exams are just your thought on the readings.
2527,2682582,1.0,5.0,"Moving to online and keeping her as an instructor was a mistake. Her Tests are absolutely ridiculous. Full-on Scenarios and math and paragraphs of information for 1 question, which is fill in the blank btw. now make it all 30 questions and you only have 50 minutes to do it. Her poor mic also does no favors to her thick European accent, no recording"
2528,1846999,1.0,5.0,"AVOID!! Online class, with no class meetings - only zoom lectures. The textbook is your holy grail and you need to memorize EVERY WORD for the exams. Literally. Exam questions and exams are super hard, even if you study. Some questions/concepts are not in the book. Labster assignments given as well. WOULD NEVER TAKE AGAIN. Super rude as well."
2529,1846999,1.0,5.0,"One of the most terrible professors I have ever taken. He goes off topic a lot, he always brags about how he is such a good professor, and will definitely make you feel bad about yourself. Has the most unimportant info on his tests. You will hate your life if you take this professor."
2530,1846999,1.0,4.0,"STAY AWAY. PLEASE. He repeatedly gloats about the amount of students that have dropped his classes in the past. He has no sympathy for you, your grade, your current situation, etc. No extra credit, no test retakes, no wiggle room. His grading system is so broken no one knew their ACTUAL GRADE and I'm pretty sure he didn't either. He's not worth it."
2531,1846999,1.0,5.0,He is very self centered most of the class dropped this course. Labs and quizzes won't do much to your grade it is the test that make up your grade. His lectures are 2 hours long he gets off topic and the lectures are noting to what the test are about. I only recommend this course if you know how to study WELL by yourself off the book.
2532,1846999,4.0,4.0,"Lectures are fun and interesting. Liu talks about very helpful real life situations for those in nursing. Although, they don't help much on exams. Exams are all from the textbook (100% self study, but he is happy to help if you reach out.) He is a tough professor, but genuinely looks out for his students and helps them succeed in the long run."
2533,1846999,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE LIU EVER. He is the worst teacher at the Mount by far. Too many of my friends are five year nursing because of him. His lectures do not pertain to the material. He wastes two hours of your life every class b/c he always makes you stay past the designated time. You will spend 40 hours trying to study for his tests to get a C. Trust me.
2534,1846999,1.0,5.0,"Taking this course with Jerry Lu has been such a nightmare. I honestly should have dropped the course when I had the chance to, he is such a tough grader. Worse of all he tries to make everyone be intimidated by him. I Honestly don't know why he is even a teacher?"
2535,1846999,1.0,5.0,"I would not recommend that you take this Lecture , ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PRE NURSING, I would only recommend this course t those who are great at self study if you are not , his class is not the time to try and learn how to."
2536,1846999,1.0,5.0,"I don't know how he got the job to be a professor. He's a smart person but teaching isn't it. He makes his class difficult to have the people who are taking him to become a nurse drop out. He is the first person ever in my life, besides my parents, to yell at me for something i didnt even know. dont take him he is literally awful &amp; should be fired."
2537,1846999,1.0,5.0,I highly reccomend that you do not take this teacher. His lectures are confusing and the examples that he uses to help us understand the material DO NOT make sense. His tests are hard and the homework is unnecessary. He doesn't provide extra credit and his quizzes do not help boost your grade at all. Everything is up to your test grade.
2538,1846999,1.0,5.0,Hes kinda funny and all but his lectures really dont help when it comes to the exam. Not to mention he gives you tons of homework that are unnecessarily hard. I would not take him ever again thats for sure. I just dont think hes that good of a teacher. He basically expects us to memorize the entire book which is insane.
2539,1846999,3.0,5.0,"His stories are interesting, but don't help &amp; get off topic very quickly. Doesn't actually teach the material. Does prepare/show you how hard future nursing classes will be. Exams mainly based off of Mastering Microbiology hw, not the text. Exams still very hard. Textbook hardly used at all. No hints given for any exams. Try to avoid taking him!!!"
2540,1846999,3.0,4.0,"interesting lectures, but they don't help much on the exams. the best way to pass the class to to read the textbook, take notes on the reading and re-write those notes. exams are all based on details from the textbook, so try not to be behind on readings. he really pushes you to try your best"
2541,1846999,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Liu is the best! He's very funny haha. He applies the concepts we're learning in class to real life situations and teaches us to always know the logic or basics of the concepts. Make you sure to READ THE BOOK because his tests are more based on the concrete details of the book,so make sure you've read and taken notes and rewritten those notes."
2542,1846999,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Liu is a very intense professor -- he really pushes you to your limits. Although his exams and quizzes can be rather difficult, he's a great professor and prepares you well. Overall, Dr. Liu is a tough professor, but he makes you work to your fullest potential. Definitely recommend him!"
2543,1846999,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Liu is a good professor. His exams and quizzes are quite difficult, but everything you need to know are in the textbook."
2544,1846999,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Liu is a tough professor who gives difficult exams, but at the same time he is a great professor. You really need to be on top of the reading.  Although his test are difficult, he does curve it. Their have been so many times where I should have gotten a B but I got an A because of the curve.  Overall, he's tough but great."
2545,1846999,3.0,4.0,"Professor Liu will help you realize how hard college will be. I didn't get the hang of it until after the midterm but it's doable if you TRY! THE TEXTBOOK WILL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND! Read the chapter, look over PowerPoints, and take notes before the next class so you can ask questions for the next lecture. Do these steps and you'll be fine."
2546,1846999,1.5,4.0,"This class wrecked my  science GPA!  Dr. Liu is a  professor who's purpose   at the Mount is  to get people to drop out of Pre-Nursing. He lectures about ""real life stories"" instead of going over  material in the textbook . Then he  quizzes and tests  you on very minute details .  He is a fascinating person , but he makes it very hard to pass."
2547,1846999,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Liu wants you to fear him on the first day.  Be warned: His class is designed to make you drop out of pre nursing.  It's not for the weak-hearted. Also, the lectures aren't what you'll test on. You have to discipline yourself.  His stories actually do make sense if you read the material.  It's a tough class, but he's a nice guy on the inside.  "
2548,1846999,2.5,5.0,He isn't like other professors who only go over the material in the book. He tries to relate what you're learning with real-life personal experiences. This may result in him going off topic a lot. 
2549,1846999,1.5,4.0,"He is a great guy as a person, but he is a terrible professor. When you ask questions he gives extremely ambiguous answers.  He tries to relate by going off on tangents and stories that have nothing to do with the subject. For quizzes he expects you to know the little details in the book that will never be looked over in class."
2550,1846999,1.0,4.0,"If you take his class to learn, don't count on it. He DOESN'T EXPLAIN anything he puts on the slides. He claims that he tries to relate the material to real life by telling stories, but those stories are actually irrelevant and useless. LOTS of self-studying. He says the test will be on 6 chapters, but only one chapter ends up being on it."
2551,560867,5.0,1.0,"Very inspiring, easy going, respects your ideas, very knowledgeable, always on time"
2552,560867,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Culverhouse is the most helpful professor I've ever had. If you ever email him, he replies quickly. The material is straightforward, and his exams are pretty much the homework questions. I recommend you take a class with him, atleast to fulfill a general studies"
2553,560867,4.5,4.0,"It took me a bit of time to get used to him (it was not his looks) because I really hate the subject.  But I noticed that if you turn in your papers, do the study guide questions, you'll be in good shape for the tests.  Just make sure to email him your answers so he can correct them before you use that as a basis for the test."
2554,560867,4.5,3.0,"He is a very helpful instructor. Feel free to e-mail him any questions and he will do his best to make sure you understand. Overall, he is a great professor. But when referring to the class I had with him (Business Ethics), I think it is safe to say that I wished that MSMC had picked a better professor for the subject."
2555,560867,4.0,3.0,He is by far the HOTTEST tutor I have ever had! I found it hard to really concentrate the first couple of times he tutored me but after the initial &quot;high school girl attraction&quot; and I got down to business he really helped me a lot! He likes to talk a lot but remembers to stop and ask if I understood. Really good one on one tutor! I'd recommend him!
2556,560867,3.5,4.0,"Prof Culverhouse tries his best to teach us ancient philosophy.  It was very confusing at times and I wanted to rip my hair out.  But, if you email him and ask him for help, he is more than willing to explain further."
2557,560867,5.0,3.0,"Oh Zenon!!!!! He is the best looking professor I have ever had, so even though he didn't give breaks during class...I didn't mind.  He is very knowledgable about philosophy and went out of his way to make sure the class understood the material.  In addition he was very fair in his method of grading.  I highly recommend taking his class."
2558,560867,3.5,2.0,Cute to look at but bored me to death when lecturing!!!!
2559,560867,5.0,2.0,I would recommend his class to anyone.
2560,560867,5.0,1.0,"If you need help, he's the one to go to.  just sit there and don't talk, it's like your text book is talking to you...and you can ask it questions!  Easy on the eyes."
2561,560867,4.5,2.0,He is super nice and super hot!!! his class is not hard..i recommend everyone takes him!!
2562,560867,5.0,2.0,This class is beyond easy!!
2563,560867,4.5,1.0,he's such a nerd! i love it.
2564,560867,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2565,560867,5.0,3.0,"super nice, helpful!!! and easy to talk to."
2566,560867,4.0,3.0,He is a little shy at the beginning but once you understand his personality he is the most helpful teacher ever! He is very passionate about this subject so he will do anything to make sure you know what he is talking about. He is the most helpful teacher I ever had!
2567,560867,5.0,1.0,I REALLY LOVE THIS TEACHER........ YEAH THATS IT
2568,900843,3.5,5.0,"I believe she is a good person,and knows her stuff but I did not like her class at all.Power points are useless, not related to book or tests,  best advice : ignore them and study from the book.Lectures are shallow , test are very hard, questions asked over stuff there is not in the book , not mentioned in lecture. Not fair, very stressful."
2569,900843,5.0,2.0,"Sandy is a fair,knowledgable, and interesting teacher. Having her for clinicals was a pleasure, she is always available and doesn't DRILL you about everything, but explains in a composed manner and actually TEACHES you. Lucky if you get her. Wish she taught more subjects."
2570,900843,4.5,1.0,"Excellent professor-very knowledgeable, understanding and approachable-all that is needed to teach the class effectively. Gave a lot of extra credit opportunities and threw out questions in tests if majority of students argued rationally. With a good memory of questions from tests, an A can be definitely achieved."
2571,900843,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2572,900843,4.5,2.0,"Sandy is a great teacher! She's very understanding and is helpful in every way.  Her tests are pretty standard and an extremely fair grader.  If you read and understand the book, you'll do well in the class."
2573,2352881,2.0,5.0,"As a person she is very caring, nice, and understanding. I did not enjoy the course as it was composed by 5 papers and they were all thesis driven essay about animals. The text material was very difficult to understand and although she would review with you in class, it was always difficult to know what she actually wanted from you in a paper."
2574,1259254,5.0,4.0,"Had her on both lecture and clinical. She is awesome. I love her. She is a very understanding professor. Her tests might be a little hard because of fill in the blanks, but they are not that difficult if you actually pay attention in class and read the chapters. In clinical, she is awesome. She talks a lot, but you will always learn something."
2575,1259254,2.0,4.0,"You basically have to teach yourself OB. Read the Ch.!!! Her tests are kind of hard in that sometimes the exam questions are irrelevant. She also has fill in the blanks and expects you to know the words that fit in according to what her brain is thinking. (um no one knows, everyone would get stumped which affected our grades)."
2576,1259254,5.0,4.0,"She is a wonderful theory and clinical professor.  Her motto ""Be Mindful."""
2577,1259254,2.0,1.0,This should be an ONLINE CLASS!  I taught myself OB.  I never paid attention in class instead did my HUGE packets of HW and BS assignments.  She is super smart in OB but uninterested in the classroom.  Never reviews tests.  Waste of gas to attend class.  
2578,1259254,5.0,4.0,"Professor Hesse is a great OB instructor! I went into the rotation very scared bc I had no idea what to expect with the whole pregnancy thing but she totally was awesome in theory and clinical. I learned a lot ! I still do not want to do ob, due to personal preference, but I can def. say I had a happy time during her rotation! Very knowledgable. "
2579,1259254,1.5,4.0,Boring
2580,1259254,5.0,5.0,Wonderful clinical instructor! Her lecture was slightly off from what was tested on a few occasions but I think that had to do with a change in our textbooks that semester and she always adjusted our test grade. We all cried at the end of clinical and truly had a great experience with her. Amazingly knowledgeable and sweet. EVERYONE knows Fehrn!
2581,1259254,4.5,3.0,"Professor Hesse is a sweetheart. She has been in OB for 31 years, she is full of knowledge and willing to share it in clinicals and in the classroom. Tests are kind of difficult, as her reading assignments don't necessarily correlate with what is on the test. You tend to find the answers in the next reading assignment, so it may pay to look ahead."
2582,1994495,1.5,3.0,"Her class seemed pretty easy for the first couple of weeks. But, as the material became more complex she just did not know how to teach at all. She is not organized and confuses a lot of the students. If you ask her a question she will answer you very rudely and will make you feel dumb in front of the class. I basically taught myself in this class."
2583,2598670,3.0,1.0,"Dr. Fassnacht is unorganized. This often caused frustration in the chorus. For example, we did not practice our music in concert order before the concert. This is super odd because wouldn't we want to prepare in the order of the concert? She also does take a while to respond to emails. I do believe she cares, but some organization would help."
2584,2598670,1.0,2.0,"Fassnacht has virtually no communication skills. She is easily the most disorganized professor I have had at the mount. She is terrible at returning emails. Twice she has canceled class 20 minutes before it started. This is unacceptable as I drive 50 or more minutes to class each way, by the time she canceled class I was already almost at"
2585,2598670,5.0,1.0,"Professor Fassnacht is extremely caring and understanding of her students. She wants everyone to enjoy the process and production of making music in any environment from in person to online. She sees value in every individual singer and musician. Overall, she is a really great professor."
2586,1644306,5.0,1.0,BESIDES HIM BEEN THE SWEETEST PERSON EVER KNOWN.. HE IS VERY SMART AND OUT GOING WICH THIS IS WHY HE IS SUCH A GOOD PROFESSOR.. SWEET WM
2587,1644306,5.0,1.0,Prof Len taught me everything I know on the court. I worship the ground he works on. I pray to God that I can someday be half the baller he is. He has schooled me so many times. - Ben Thammaruja
2588,1644306,5.0,1.0,I'm sure professor len is a great teacher but he definitely needs to work on is basketball game lol. We'll be at the courts -May 2012 ballas
2589,1644306,5.0,2.0,"nice, funny, good taste in music and is pretty easy on the eyes."
2590,1644306,5.0,4.0,Prof Len really knows his stuff! The person that said he has a belly is clearly smoking something and doesnt wear her glasses. She probably has a big head.
2591,1644306,4.5,3.0,"Professor Len is a great teacher! He is great at making it easier for students to understand concepts and always gives us useful analogies. He is very approachable and is always helpful to us when we have questions. He makes lab fun, yet productive and efficient."
2592,1644306,3.0,2.0,He's pretty hot I guess...just has a little and belly and all. Cutestuff
2593,1644306,5.0,3.0,AWESOME TEACHER
2594,1644306,5.0,3.0,"Len is a great lab professor. He has a very great background of biology.I would not say his Biology Lab class is easy, he can be difficult at times and not at the same time. He is also very understanding and punctual."
2595,1644306,5.0,1.0,The acronyms he comes up with are really helpful for a visual learner like me.
2596,1644306,5.0,4.0,Fair teacher. Very concise and to the point.
2597,1644306,3.0,2.0,Really easy teacher in terms of getting a decent grade. Usually messes around in class and doesn't take things too seriously.
2598,1644306,5.0,2.0,Very fun and helpful discussion class.
2599,1644306,5.0,2.0,Very helpful and fun discussion class. Gets things done.
2600,1832723,5.0,1.0,Professor Ira is such a great professor! He's very helpful to his students and he takes his time on each chapter. He doesn't care too much about falling behind schedule; he'd rather his students comprehend the material. He puts up a slide show every class meeting so we can follow along; everything from his slides are in the book.
2601,2414354,5.0,3.0,"He cares for his students and helps you understand the bio2 topics well! , just do all your work on time, because it may be a lot. He has quizzes before lab so study and be prepared for those."
2602,2414354,1.0,1.0,He was confused more than half the time and spent time questioning the main instructor.
2603,2414354,5.0,3.0,"He makes all the labs fun and is very easy to talk too. If you don't understand something, he will take his time to explain it to you. He did give out a few pop quizzes so make sure you are reading the chapters. The pop quizzes are easy points so if I recommend you do the reading."
2604,1992469,5.0,3.0,"She is absolutely amazing. I love taking her as a professor, she lectures and still engages the class. She takes her time to help you understand the course. She is so humble, and so experienced in her field. If you could ever take her, you will be in the class of one of the best professors on campus. Hands down. You will legit learn in her class."
2605,1992469,5.0,2.0,"I loved her classes (I took two) with her! She is a very nice person and is easily approachable. I enjoyed both classes and was always interested in the lectures. Although she does not use PowerPoint to lecture, you do not loose focus while she is speaking. I definitely wish she shares her teaching methods with other professors."
2606,1992469,5.0,2.0,I would take her again in a heart beat! Class is super easy. The quizes are online. Papers are not difficult. Dont miss class or your grade will drop. Her lectures are fun. She is open for suggestions to make the class better for you. I definetly recommend her.
2607,1992469,5.0,2.0,"This professor is quite easily the best professor I have ever had.  She is respectful; therefore, respectable.  She is genuinely there for her students. Her online quizzes are great and short, and her lectures have activities that stick the concepts in your head! If you have the chance to take her class, do it! You will not regret a thing."
2608,1992469,5.0,2.0,"I loved Prof. Avetyan's class! She is a thoroughly engaging professor who is willing to challenge your views on Psych.  She relates all lessons to make them applicable to every day life, which really helps you understand it on a deeper level. She assigns weekly  online quizzes which are easy if you just use the textbook. She also has no final exam!"
2609,1992469,4.5,1.0,"Fun class! She is really funny and the class isn't that hard. The quizzes are online, so you are able to use your notes and book. Reading the book is essential to pass the tests."
2610,1992469,5.0,1.0,"She's so caring and very intelligent and has a vast understanding of psychology concepts and knows how to correlate the course material to our own lives and current and past events in life in general! She even gives us useful tips and examples from her own experience and life. Very inspirational teacher, I wish I could take more courses with her:)!"
2611,1992469,5.0,1.0,She's the type of professor that sets you up for success there's no way that someone can fail her class she gives us all the resources and help to make us succeed! 
2612,1992469,5.0,1.0,"Professor Avetyan is such a wonderful professor! She's down to earth and makes the class fun and interactive, and very easy to understand. She's very helpful and encourages us to participate. She's also very stylish! Make sure to study and read the textbook so that you can participate in class activities and pass the quizzes and you'll be good!!!:)"
2613,1992469,4.5,2.0,"Professor Avetyan is very calm in demeanor and incredibly empathetic.  She absolutely loves psychology, so you're in good hands with her.  She is also very sweet.  She gives quizzes; expect one every week.  Don't worry because if you read the book, you will be fine.  If you don't have the book, chances are she ordered it on reserve for the library."
2614,1992469,4.5,1.0,"Initially, she was very reserved and did not engage much with us, but I think it had to do with her being a first time professor. As the semester progressed, she because more and more engaged with us. She does use lecture slides that are rather helpful when studying for tests, but they aren't that thorough. Take time to read a bit of the text."
2615,1992469,5.0,2.0,"I absolutely LOVE Prof Avetyan! I wish she could teach all my classes; she is bright, funny, kind and very caring. She lectures so that we can relate the material to everyday life and get a real understanding. I can't say enough great things about her! She wants you to pass, is there to help in any way, and really cares about her students! MustTakE"
2616,214805,5.0,2.0,"For my part, if you do the work and READ the syllabus then it should be a fairly easy A. Some students ramble that shes a hard grader, she really isnt. For most of my last minute papers I always received a high grade for them even though they werent that good"
2617,214805,3.5,4.0,This is the online portion of your internship. Dr. Haldeman requires a textbook that helps guide you through her assignments. Be concise and write what she asks for. She is a bit of a tough greater but it makes you learn to get better. I could have done better than a B- but I struggled to pull through at the end due to a lot of work. Try your best!
2618,214805,1.0,5.0,"If you need something you need to go look for her at her office because she does not  respond back to emails. She takes her sweet time and it makes it very difficult. Once you turn in the work, that is it. You cannot fix it or redo it because she will not take it. Also, she is very picky and she forgets everything. "
2619,214805,2.0,3.0,"Class was fairly easy. Haldeman tends to ramble on during lectures and never stays on track. She gives study guides for her midterm and final but they end up being 3+ pages long which is ridiculous. She doesn't cover everything that is testable on the exam so make sure to read the book. Overall, I didn't enjoy her teaching style."
2620,214805,1.0,2.0,"She is so rude!!! It's hard to communicate with. She is unfair, if she makes a mistake she doesn't consider that it was her fault and sticks to it. I would not take her again. BTW I have an A in her class, so it isn't always the student's fault."
2621,214805,5.0,3.0,"THE BEST Professor at the Mount! I Love this woman she knows what she's talking about and really helps those students that want to succeed, only lazy students can make negative comments, But if you can Please take her and visit her office time to time she's a unforgettable prof."
2622,214805,4.5,5.0,"She's a great professor. You'll be hard-pressed to find someone who loves what she's teaching as much as Haldeman. She's funny, smart, very helpful, really cares about her student's success. Take her, you won't regret it!"
2623,214805,5.0,2.0,An Awesome Sociology Professor
2624,214805,5.0,3.0,"Excellent professor. Only poor performing students make negative comments about her. You must study, but the material is interesting! Her introductory sociology class converted me to becoming a major. Forget mean comments from others. Probably jaded because they didn't do well in her classes. She cares! And she doesn'teaches SOC 166 or SOC 150."
2625,214805,1.5,1.0,Very difficult to communicate with. Is very strict on the due dates even if one day late. Classes are not interesting and online courses are terrible
2626,214805,3.0,3.0,Pretty corny. Soc 117 wasn't a hard class. I didn't even buy the book. Grades the presentation on her own personal style. She's whatever
2627,214805,5.0,5.0,"she's got a great sense of humor.... one of the best teachers at msmc... she is great, very professional, very good techniques to teach.. just the best.... she gets a 10 from me...."
2628,214805,5.0,4.0,No Comments
2629,214805,5.0,2.0,She is a great professor.  She is bright and teaches with clarity.  You always have to study hard for her test and make sure to A's all her online test and you'll do fine in her classes.  Overall I enjoyed all her classes.
2630,214805,5.0,1.0,Get the book for those online quizzes or else you'll continuously fail them and screw up your grade.  Everything else is easy.
2631,214805,4.5,4.0,online quizzes. debates. her tests were nothing like the quizzes.
2632,214805,4.0,3.0,Good Professor. Very easy going. Is definately a lot harder on her Gerontology class than her Soc1 class. I recommend her if you are looking for a good class to take. The assignments she provides are fair and the online quizzes help you to maintain on top of things.
2633,214805,1.0,5.0,No Comments
2634,214805,5.0,5.0,Prof. Haldeman..She is a great professor who is very educated in the material that she teaches.  Very approachable and is interested in making the students succeed not only academically but personally.
2635,214805,5.0,3.0,Awesome Awesome Awesome! Had a great time in her online courses...
2636,214805,5.0,3.0,"She is the best, great instructor and a wonderful support for students. She truly wants students to succeed, and makes time for students.  I found her enthusiastic, motivating and very intelligent. A great credit to the teaching profession."
2637,268059,1.0,3.0,Needs to understand boundaries.
2638,268059,1.0,1.0,He is one of the worst professors I have ever come across. Rudest person i have ever met. Did not care to help when I needed advice in taking a minor but rather said I was idiotic for thinking I could add more. How he is the chair of the department is beyond me and I will talk to the dean about it
2639,268059,5.0,5.0,a good guy
2640,268059,2.0,3.0,"He accused me of having someone else take, develop, and print my own pictures just because I didn't ask him for any help and didn't ask for any feedback during development. Didn't believe I was just good at taking pictures. He made me print pictures in front of him to prove it. Ridiculous."
2641,268059,1.0,4.0,I struggled due to my mental disability that makes it hard to understand anything. He teased about it and used that against me regardless of how hard I worked on an assignment. Arrogant and rude professor who lacks on creativity. It's sad to see that he is the Art Department chair of the College. He even questioned if I plagiarized on the final.
2642,268059,4.0,2.0,Jody is a really interesting teacher who honestly wants to help you as much as he can. His sense of humor is a bit wacky but that's just part of his &quot;Artsy/Hippy&quot; personality. You gotta just not take him seriously sometimes! The class was frustrating for me because I have no artistic bone in my body. BE PREPARED TO SPEND TIME WORKING ON THE HW!!
2643,268059,4.0,2.0,"Learned a lot in Design. Fun & Laid back class. Towards the end of the semester you have to put a bit more effort into the projects, but overall I enjoyed ART2. Jody is very laid back & friendly. Be open-minded & be creative, but not lazy (you might end up w/ a C). Put in some effort. Almost everyone in the class got an A or B. =)"
2644,268059,5.0,4.0,I took several classes with him and he is the greatest!  He is inredibly inspirational!  I learned so much.
2645,268059,5.0,3.0,"He's honest, thoughtful, and willing to put in countless hours towards your achievement if you show him sincere dedication. He goes above and beyond for his students. Take his classes with an open mind and a willingness to work hard, he respects any ability. His sense of humor is a riot, those that are offended might take life too seriously."
2646,268059,3.0,3.0,No Comments
2647,268059,5.0,3.0,"Not a typical prof-has an honest, blunt sense of humor that not everyone gets. Encourages, provokes, supports independent thought/artwork.  Puts in tremendous amount of extra work to maintain/develop art program in somewhat optimistic hope that students will take initiative & pursue art w/passion."
2648,268059,1.0,3.0,I can't begin to explain the rudeness of this guy.  I was totally uncomfortable around him.
2649,268059,5.0,3.0,Very supportive ang helpful! The best faculty member at MSMC!
2650,268059,1.0,3.0,"Really, what can I say&#63;  Not only is this guy rude as all hell, he's arrogant and strange in the extreme."
2651,268059,5.0,4.0,"For non-art majors & art majors alike, expect a lot of work! If you love art & are willing to put in the effort, you'll probably enjoy the class. Don't expect an easy 'A' but expect an understanding professor who will work with whatever ability you have."
2652,268061,1.0,3.0,"We are living in a more culturally aware society but this White Professor chooses to use the N-word with the hard R in our Harlem Renaissance class. I understand it is in our books, I still feel it is not right for her to use those terms as it is widely inappropriate. You will never know how you are doing in class as she never submits grades."
2653,268061,5.0,2.0,Dr. Ash is so lovely and an incredible woman. She really gives her students freedom in assignments which can be wonderful if you have creative ideas of how you want to write your papers. She is not a slave driver and her work is reasonable. Lots of great intellectual discourse in her classes.
2654,268061,3.0,3.0,Boring class. You can participate but it does not help you learn. You can skip them and it wouldn't matter except that she takes attendance sometimes.
2655,268061,4.5,3.0,I haven't finished her class yet but I really like her and would take her again. 
2656,268061,3.0,3.0,"This will probably be one of your most boring classes if you take one with her. The class isn't lively whatsoever. It's an hour and a half straight of her giving a summary of each chapter you read from the textbook. She seems to really love history, but don't expect fun from this class. "
2657,268061,5.0,3.0,"I just LOVE Dr. Ash. She is so smart, compassionate, intelligent and genuine. It's amazing being in class with her because she is so knowledgeable and passionate about history! She really cares about her students and is so nurturing. Amazing experience, truly!"
2658,268061,5.0,2.0,"She is an amazing educator. For our class, we used 3 books and we sure used them. There are no exams in her class, but we do have four major essays that we need to submit. They were required to be 5-7pages with quotes. Make sure participate, she gets upset when the class is silent. This class has opened my eyes in regards of the Civil Mov."
2659,268061,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ash is a wonderful professor, she's so smart and really helps her students.  She is very understanding and real, definitely not strict or condescending.  It's a reading/writing class, no scantrons here.  She's great!!"
2660,268061,2.0,3.0,"I haven't had Dr. Ash as a professor yet, but she's my advisor. She would not respond to any of my emails and getting a hold of her was impossible. I ended up having to have someone from the school get rid of the hold so I could register and I didn't get a very good schedule. There are so few history majors, you'd she'd care."
2661,268061,5.0,2.0,"Professor Ash knows her discipline and is good at challenging her history majors but also makes her class understandable to non-majors. She is the type of professor that makes you fall in love with history even if it?s not your major (many people in my class added history as a minor because of her). Take her, you won't regret it!!!"
2662,268061,4.5,1.0,"intelligent professor. Has passion for what she teaches although it can get a little boring at times. She does take attendance everyday. Homework is just reading but if you listen to lecture you will do fine. you write papers. Cool class, laid back teahcer. if you need to miss her class tell her and she will understand....i recommend her"
2663,268061,4.0,1.0,"her lecture can get a little boring at times, but she does cover a lot. Her class is easy and informative."
2664,268061,4.5,1.0,its true that she talks a lot but her class is very easy...not only that but it's interesting...she give's gives you a good study guide and she even lets the class make up the exam..its a good class if you just want to chill and not do anything but listen and take notes
2665,268061,5.0,2.0,"Although she tends to talk alot , what she does about is very interesting. She is super intelligent shows great passion for her field and is very considerate of her students. She is very outspoken and candid, no need to read between the lines with her, she is just plain great"
2666,268061,1.0,4.0,"well.. she sure does talk a whole lot!!! i fall asleep most of the time, thank god it is ONLY twice a week!!!"
2667,268061,3.5,4.0,"Two of the three books chosen were deadly boring! She talks quite a lot and is interesting at times. Take good notes. Read the book or look for essays online that may help you with your papers.  She is not easy but not too hard. She is very approachable and friendly. Overall, I had a good experience with her."
2668,268061,1.0,5.0,no comment she wasn't all that too me!
2669,268061,4.5,3.0,"Ash is a GREAT Professor. As a science major, history and law classes were not a topic of choice for me. With Professor Ash's help, I got an A and loved the class. If you have the chance to take a class with her, I would suggest you do it! :)"
2670,268061,4.5,2.0,i love her! She's a great teacher and has an open mind while still staying true to what she believes in.

2681,268061,5.0,2.0,Great teacher
2682,268061,2.5,2.0,"Ash's class is pretty easy. She lectures a lot. Assigns papers. BUT!!!  MAKE SURE SHE GETS YOU DOWN FOR ATTENDANCE! She lowered my grade from an A to a B- because she said I was absent for too many classes, which was not true at all. There was another girl in the class whose name was very similar to mine of whom she could have mixed us up."
2683,268061,5.0,3.0,"Great instructor, very passioate about her work...and understanding."
2684,268061,5.0,1.0,She is great and really interested in what she teaches!
2685,268061,5.0,4.0,Ash is the nicest lady ever!  she understands that &quot;stuff happens&quot; and teaches well.
2686,268061,2.0,5.0,"Dr.P. Ash is cool professor, but her grading grading criteria is unfair. Some students never attended her class and failed her tests and they still passed with C's that is nit fair to the people that studied hard for her exams and got good grades."
2687,268061,5.0,3.0,"Major Issues in US Women's History was a great class. I wouldn't have wanted anyone else teaching it. She's well-spoken, highly inteligent & gives students respect at all times. I would highly recommend taking the course!!"
2688,1644317,1.0,1.0,too easy class. confusing at times. thinks he is awesomely awesome. he thinks he has moves like jagger
2689,845601,5.0,2.0,Professor Walla is a great teacher! He really cares about you learning how to write properly and gives good feedback on your essays that you turn in. Essays are really simple just make sure to edit them before turning them in.
2690,845601,5.0,1.0,"He's really nice and sweet. He gives you extra time on test and lets you  make it up. Never has gotten mad , hes really nice. So be nice ! :)"
2691,845601,4.0,2.0,"Honestly, this class is an easy A. Just do what he tells you to do and you'll pass. He's an awesome professor but sometimes his lectures are boring which makes me sleepy. Other than that, he is a fairly, easy professor!"
2692,845601,4.0,2.0,"This class is fairly easy to pass. but he is somewhat strict with grammar errors in his essays. He is very helpful, and the quizzes are fairly easy. As long one listens in class you can get a good grade in the class."
2693,845601,5.0,2.0,"he is very friendly, and makes class easy to understand, his homework is basically just to read and some essays, he gives quizzes on the books he gives but pretty easy questions. TAKE HIM! you wont regret it"
2694,845601,5.0,3.0,Amazing teacher!! one of my all time favorites.  great class
2695,845601,5.0,2.0,"Very nice professor, He is easy if you read, always quizzed but easy to pass if material is read. He is not difficult is easy and you actually learn as well."
2696,845601,4.5,3.0,"He is a very nice professor and his coursework is pretty straight foreword. The whole semester consists of reading 5 classic novels and writing a paper for each. You take some quiz's in between the books and that's what will ultimately make or break your grade. Overall, the class is like book club it's fairly interesting and easy :)"
2697,845601,5.0,3.0,Great and Interesting professor. The class wasnt super easy or super hard. He checks attendance so make sure to go to class. Overall he is a really good professor.
2698,845601,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Walla is a great teacher. He has a good sense of humor and is very understanding. He assigns interesting stories, novels, and poems. He does not grade too hard. I got As in both A and B without a problem. Just pay attention, come to class, and do the work on time!"
2699,845601,5.0,1.0,very cool guy...books were interesting...course load was not that hard...overall easy class and make sure you read the books...you get quizzed!
2700,845601,5.0,1.0,this guy is REALLY easy!!...little boring...but easy work and easy essays.
2701,524070,5.0,1.0,I took Mr. Aucutt's class for Weekend College and he was very enthusiastic and a fascinating speaker. I learned a lot about writing and how to improve my style. He was very interesting and helpful.
2702,524070,5.0,4.0,"Daniel, you were wonderful! I feel so much more prepared and ready to handle what lies ahead. The course was very effective and intellectually stimulating...and that's rare for a class like this. Great job!"
2703,524070,5.0,5.0,"Daniel's teaching style is non-threatening and he makes complex subjects enjoyable.  That's not an east task. What was that you said about flattery&#63; But really, I learned a lot about more than I could imagine about Shakespeare and writing effectively.  Hats off to you!"
2704,524070,5.0,5.0,"I had a wonderful experience in Mr. Aucutt's Shakespeare class with the Weekend College. Daniel is so passionate, caring, interesting, animated, enthusiastic, and simply delightful! He is one of the few outstanding Professors I will remember for a long time to come, and a definite asset to MSMC. Bravo to you for hiring him!"
2705,524070,1.5,5.0,This guy is a joke.  Why is he teaching here&#63;
2706,524070,2.5,5.0,Very brain smarts but does not know how to teach.  Too funny to be a teacher.
2707,524070,1.5,4.0,"smart guy, horrible teacher"

2712,524070,4.5,2.0,Good teacher. He is not talking down to you... that's just the way he talks. He is a really smart guy and wants his students to learn.
2713,524070,2.5,2.0,"This guy is crazy, he's helpful and tries to do his best but he has no idea how to teach.  He makes u write a lot of papers and summary's but he's an extremely easy grader.  Some of his assignments are just busy work and they have nothing to do with real english classes."
2714,597803,5.0,3.0,Doctor Vandyke is clearly the best professor I have taken in college so far. He is knowledgeable and engaging and fun but what made his class so good for me was his passion for the subject matter. His lectures are so interesting that you feel disappointed when class is over and they have to end.
2715,597803,5.0,4.0,Professor Van Dyke is quite insightful and has knack for always leaving seeking you for more information.

2717,597803,5.0,2.0,This is a New Testament Class - Now I know I would've never taken it with anyone else. He is the best professor I ever had. He is soooo knowledgeable! It's incredible how someone can know so much about anything that complex. He is very direct and he says he doesn't care but it's obvious that he does
2718,1771308,2.0,5.0,"She gives toooo much work. Avoid at all cost. Wait and take the course when she is NOT teaching it. New Professor, totally gung-ho about teaching college and is piling all this work on the students. Hello, we work and have other classes, and families at home. She doesn't get that. Sad --- TO MUCH WORK WARNING"
2719,452399,2.0,3.0,"He is not THAT bad. His class consists of lectures He assigns a 20 pg paper at the beginning of the semester so if you do the work ahead of time you should be fine. same for the mid and final, he gives us questions AHEAD of time, so it is just copy and write on the actual test. Its a lot of work but manageable if you manage your time. Thumbs up."
2720,452399,1.0,3.0,he digresses a lot in the class. its not worth going to class bc we just sit there and do our own thing. he is smart and knows his things but he just needs to retire bc no one pays attention to him. have to do a presentation for 10 mins if not you fail
2721,452399,2.0,3.0,"This professor is a very smart man with many life experiences which he openly shares in lecture. Be prepared to hear only his voice UNLESS you interject. He wants something very specific & apparently I don't know what. I received an A on a paper, but bombed the tests. Find another professor unless you're up for a challenge."
2722,452399,1.5,5.0,"Browder is so boring.  All he does is lecture and go off on tangents, his exams are so useless and long.  He's such a kind person, but should not be teaching anymore. Avoid him if you can, or else your semester will drag on and ON!"
2723,452399,2.0,4.0,Boring! Lectures had nothing to do with the midterm or final and were very confusing. He is biased as well. Do the readings and write your essays according to his viewpoints to do well. Expects good writing skills and will grade down if you haven't got them. Participate to get on his good side. do the essay prompts ahead of the final/midterm.
2724,452399,1.5,5.0,j
2725,452399,1.0,5.0,The WORST professor i have EVER had. He is useless. Dont bother going to his lectures. Try to think like him because if you dont then you are screwed. He is so BIASED. If you don't agree with what he says too bad because he is God and knows everything. HATE HATE HATe. was the class from hell to me.
2726,452399,2.5,5.0,"Professor Browder great person, but EXTREMELY BORING. Lectures entire class (lectures are VERY CONFUSING), not much class participation. 2 papers, 1 fifty to sixty min group presentation (10 min PER PERSON), and 2 tests (mid-term and final, essay style and GIVES QUESTIONS 1 WEEK BEFORE TEST). EASY GRADER, BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO WORK HARD Got an A-"
2727,452399,3.5,3.0,Tests ( essay form). Don't worry you can prewrite it at home and then rewrite it during class. He gives you 10 questions and he only chooses 3 or 4 from it on test day. there are presentations but it is not difficult at all. Very kind professor. Very polite and courteous. Do the readings!
2728,452399,1.5,5.0,He is a hard professor who only lectures. He does not interact with class or writes on the board. all he does is sit and talks. He is boring and expects a lot from your. Do not take him
2729,452399,4.5,5.0,"Great teacher. Helpfull, but you have to ask for help."
2730,452399,4.0,5.0,"Dr.Browder is an amazing teacher. Give a lot of input in class, work very hard on clarifying your writing, and give him ONLY what he wants! I got an A in his class and it was an honors course! He definitely likes to talk a lot but best advice is to be an outstanding writer and get your points across in your papers! Very funny guy!"
2731,452399,1.5,5.0,This character is no Joke... He is a very extreme grader and wants everything his way. Whem listening to his lectures comparing them to the reading makes no sense. Doesnt make himself approachabe. Doesnt encourage class participation. I would never take him again.
2732,452399,3.5,5.0,Hard teacher. Has HIGH expectations. He lectures and you can't miss any of them. HE connects his life to what he is teaching which often makes interesting conversations in class. Overall good teacher. Don't take him if you just want to show up once in a while and be lazy. He assings papers (2-3) and your tests are your mis term and final.good luck
2733,452399,2.0,4.0,"You have to give him what he wants... which is basically what he lectures.  He loves to hear himself talk and doesn't encourage class participation, which is a bummer. But he's funny and as long as you stay focused, he's pretty interesting. Leave your religious beliefs at the door... philosophy isn't about that.  If you're PC, hit the door too."
2734,452399,3.5,4.0,"Professor Browder has high expectations for all of his students and will try to help you if he sees you are a hard worker.He is a great guy with good intentions but a seriously tough grader.He is supportive and approchable. He does talk a lot, goes on some tangents.I would recommend him but you have to be prepared for class and work your but off."
2735,452399,1.0,5.0,"Phil of Lit. Should have been fun, maybe touch on the aesthetic beauty of literature. Instead class was philosophy bootcamp lead by a pompous ex-know-it-all passing the time by wasting students time. Teacher says he NEVER gives &quot;A's&quot;, and he doesn't. Real jerk!"
2736,452399,1.0,5.0,"Phil of Lit. Should have been fun, maybe touch on the aesthetic beauty of literature. Instead class was philosophy bootcamp lead by a pompous ex-know-it-all passing the time by wasting students time. Teacher says he NEVER gives &quot;A's&quot;, and he doesn't. Real jerk!"
2737,452399,3.5,4.0,The readings are illustrated by the professor's real life examples. He is a great thinker but definitely a hard grader.
2738,452399,1.0,4.0,"Not a very effective professor.  Do not expect lectures to clarify reading assignments.  Does not encourage class participation.  Hard grader. He has redeeming qualities as a person, just not as a teacher."
2739,452399,1.0,5.0,"Not very helpful.  When he has answered a question, your left with more unanswered questions after listening for 20 minutes.  Makes it a sport out of confusing the student."
2740,1457971,1.0,2.0,"Terrible Professor, laughs at own jokes and thinks shes interesting when she is not. Doesn't accurately represent the material that she supposed to instruct on. Says she doesn't tell students her opinion on things but its all she does. Tried to sell her essential oils to students during a business ethics class."
2741,1457971,5.0,2.0,"I'm gonna say it like this: best professor I've had in a LONG time. She cares wholeheartedly about philosophy and wants you to get an A. Funny, nice, and interactive, this class is everything a philosophy class should be. An A is definitely achievable if you do the work and put in the time. Great teacher!"
2742,1457971,5.0,4.0,"Professor Daily is a complete gem! I took her class at SMC and she genuinely has so much passion for teaching philosophy. For her class we had 4 essay exam, 2 quizzes, and a final presentation. Super easy chill class if you do all the readings and participate in her class. Highly would recommend taking her class!"
2743,1457971,5.0,3.0,I take Professor Daily's PHILOS 1 class at SMC and she is truly a joy to have as a professor and it is a pleasure to have met such an incredible and enthusiastic human. There is some reading and essays but it is honestly so worth it. Class feels like an open-minded discussion group and leaves you feeling invigorated and introspective.
2744,1457971,5.0,1.0,"AMAZING TEACHER!!!!!! Would take her over and over again if I could. Very clear lectures, reasonable homework and grading. makes it super interesting, did not like philosophy before taking this course, however, afterwards seriously considered choosing it as my major! best professor ever"
2745,1457971,5.0,1.0,she's an amazing teacher. i've always had an interest for philosophy so i did enjoy this class. she doesn't really assign hw but she wants full participation. probably the hardest part of the class are the 2 5-page papers and the end of the class presentation.
2746,1457971,4.5,1.0,"Great! She truly loves Philosophy and the concepts within them. She uses the textbook a good amount, loves participation, and shows her passion. Pay attention, read the book and notes, use her study guide for exams and I got an A in her class. Take care, I love her!"
2747,1457971,5.0,1.0,"Before I took her class I did not know a thing about philosophy, but now I've actually grown an interest in it. She is an awesome instructor in class and outside of it. I would definately recommend her class to anyone."
2748,1457971,5.0,1.0,"Miss Daily is a great teacher. She is different then other teachers, I like her teaching style  a lot. You need a book, I didn't have one though, I just took pics of assign pages with my camera, and studied them on the computer and got an &quot;A&quot; :0) Very helpful"
2749,2342718,5.0,3.0,Professor Garcia is great! Along with her lecture we had class discussions and it was not stressful at all. We also were able to have lots of input and share our own ideas relating to the lecture. I enjoyed the class and her approach to teaching helped me understand and created and non judgmental learning environment. 
2750,1824577,4.0,2.0,"Small Business Management with Hopkins was a slight challenge, but definitely learned a lot. Heard he was better than the last professor who taught this course. His exams are mult. choice and 5-6 essay questions but he gives you about 20 questions to study. It's tough, but helps you learn the info. Group project due at end of sem (get a good group)"
2751,1597252,4.0,2.0,I took professor Jacobo for a qualitative research methods class- She has high expectations but grades fairly.  She came to class very motivated and willing to help- Difficult class but liked the professor. If you put forth the effort you will recieve a very fair grade.
2752,2410319,5.0,3.0,"Her online quizzes were hard to do because some of the questions were not from the book so you had to look it up online or take an L. Other than that, I like how gives good feedback."
2753,2410319,5.0,1.0,"I took Professor Panzanelli for an online course in Fall 2018. The class I took was Fashion, Body, and Identity. Since her class was an accelerated online class, make sure you do all of your weekly discussion and for every module, there is a quiz. The quizzes are base on your readings."
2754,1877847,4.5,3.0,Lupe is AMAZING.  By far the best clinical instructor I've had thus far at Mount St. Mary's.  Her care plans and assignments are tough but she is very clear in her expectations which makes it a little easier to complete the assignments to her liking.  Her compassion and empathy go a long way. You will absolutely love her!
2755,1976156,2.0,1.0,"Although Dr. T is a nice person, she can be irritable. Moreover, she does not grade anything until grades are due and can make students feel inferior when they ask questions. I don't recommend taking Dr. T if you like being stress-free."
2756,1976156,2.0,4.0,"No one knew grade entire semester. I had to ask her to put in grades, they were still not accurate. Next time she put in grades was before the final. Spends more time on lectures than application. Doesn't start w/easy problems, starts w/complicated ones. Doesn't explain well. Tests had things briefly or never talked about. Textbook only used for hw"
2757,1976156,5.0,3.0,She was such a great instructor!!! RECOMMEND!
2758,1976156,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Thulsiraj is an amazing woman! She was so helpful in every class period and made the time fly by. The labs are usually pretty interesting and she's very helpful if you're not getting it. She's very invested in the success of her students. If lab finishes early, you leave early. You NEED the lab book. Pop quizzes are common, but with a heads up!"
2759,1976156,4.0,3.0,Great teacher! Helpful! Would recommend her to anyone
2760,1976156,5.0,2.0,"She's a great teacher for MicroLab. If there's anything you don't understand, she'll be more than happy to help. She gets along great with her students. Her pop quizzes were fairly easy and her tests aren't that bad, considering she gives out study guides."
2761,1976156,5.0,3.0,i loved her i took her micro bio lab and she was amazing! she was very helpful and caring. she will help you if you are in need but when it comes to quizzes and test make sure you ready the labs and study! you use the lab book every time so make sure you have it!
2762,2049896,5.0,3.0,"Her class is interesting and you learn ALOT, but she's a tough grader at times.. You could always take an easier teacher if Phil is not your thing."
2763,2049896,5.0,2.0,"Reading before class is very important. As long as you pay attention and do the readings and homework, you're good. Ask questions if you don't understand the material! She tries several ways to get you to understand if you are confused."
2764,2049896,5.0,2.0,She makes the class very interesting. I would definitely take her again. Not too many tests. Papers are fairly easy as well as quizzes. She is easy to get along with and not very intimidating. You need the book to pass the class she doesn't do powerpoints mostly reviewing the readings from the book and other articles that she assigns.
2765,2049896,5.0,1.0,"Professor Meda was very nice and understanding. I would definitely take her again. There were not so many tests and they were easy to understand. She would assign homework on her syllabus but it was not a requirement to do but if you totally want extra credit, turning in the homework is the extra credit. "
2766,2664300,4.0,5.0,Make sure to study outside of class and always take notes during lecture portion for Lab. Ask questions! He is very easy to approach!
2767,2293614,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Cook is a really chill professor. I took him during the pandemic, and showing up to class is mandatory. He also gives a list of books you need to get for the class. Throughout the semester, all you do is read the assigned chapters he gives, and by the end, you do a paper. The class is easy and makes it fair for everyone at one point."
2768,2293614,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor! He truly cares about his students and is passionate about his job. I enjoyed reading the poems he would choose.
2769,2293614,5.0,2.0,Taking his class was a breath of fresh air. The only &quot;textbook&quot; required was the small reading book for freshmen. Enjoyed analyzing poetry in his class. Super kind and understanding. Definitely recommend!
2770,2293614,5.0,1.0,REALLY SWEET PROFESSOR AT MSMU!! You can really tell he is passionate about his job and he joins interacting with students. Easy A as well. Enjoyed this class and recommend if you want to take FYS or english with him.
2771,2293614,4.0,2.0,It's English so you have to buy your own books. This class was VERY easy. All you do is read the book and do a 5 question quiz every week. We also have a partner presentation which is super easy. His class is just overall easy only for ENG1A. I heard ENG1B with him is the total opposite. TAKE HIM FOR THIS CLASS!
2772,2293614,5.0,2.0,"Love Thomas!! He really is a great professor and makes everything clear and easy to understand. He works a lot with poetry, so be prepared for that. His assignments are fairly easy and if you ever need help he WILL make time and go over anything until you get it! I really recommend taking his class."
2773,2293614,5.0,2.0,Cook is the best
2774,2293614,4.0,4.0,Dr. Thomas Cook is more focused in poetry so if you like poetry you will enjoy his class due to always reading and writing. He is a fair grader and will make you work for the grade.
2775,2293614,5.0,3.0,"Very good teacher. Soft spoken, explains things clearly and slowly. Easy class to pass if you pay attention. Everything about the homework and finals are posted online as well. No text book required but you will need separate books to go over in class. No need to buy them though they are available in the library. Overall great class great teacher!"
2776,1875873,4.5,3.0,I learned a lot with her. She likes students that take initiative rather than being ask to do something. Know your basics and she will help you even more.
2777,925627,3.0,4.0,"Waters is a great philosophy professor. I just think that the content was a little confusing for me. The examples he gives are pretty helpful, though! I recommend taking notes on the things he illustrates in class. Participation is important because this is the type of material that you need to do yourself in order to understand. Notes def helped!"
2778,925627,4.0,3.0,"His lectures are pretty boring but he does make a few jokes here and there. His tests are worth a lot of points so if your taking this class online make sure to take it in a group, as well as homework."
2779,925627,1.0,5.0,Apparently the book we use is written by one of the MSMU philosophy professor and it's aweful. We only use it because she/he was the head of the department. His midterms are like 10-20 qs but is worth 100 points. He does not give feedbacks and just marks points off because we got them wrong. Listening to lecture does not help with the hw at all.
2780,925627,5.0,2.0,Overall he's a solid philosophy professor. Make's a boring subject interesting with his lecture style and use of jokes. Highly recommend taking him.
2781,925627,5.0,3.0,he is great. take him.
2782,925627,4.0,3.0,"If you have the chance to take him, do it."
2783,925627,4.0,1.0,"Professor Waters taught a very fun and educational class. He's a really easy teacher and the class is an easy A. The book is really needed for the class because he goes over material from it all the time. But if you have any questions about the assignments or lecture, he's there to help."
2784,925627,3.5,3.0,"Professor Waters is seriously great. . I would absolutely take him again.  He is really funny, really smart, and a  is really good conversationalist.  You definitely will not be bored if you take him.  The bad reviews must be the people that didn't try in his class.  It is not your typical class and that is what makes it that much better."
2785,925627,3.0,3.0,"Professor Waters is an excellent teacher. He relates philosophy with current events that really interest you. He is very funny and very carefree. It is only confusing if you do not read the book; however, he does go over it very well in class. He is a hard grader when is comes to papers. They are not very long, but I suggest you not procrastinate."
2786,925627,5.0,1.0,"Honestly I don't know what everyone is talking about. He's amazing! His work is not difficult if you actually try a little. The group project at the end requires thinking but you have 3-4 brains. Use them! & he uses a variety of techniques to teach, it becomes interesting. I had no interest when entering this class & walked out loving it! Take him!"
2787,925627,1.5,3.0,"Oh.my.lord. I signed up for class that explored alice and wonderland with another professorbut she couldn't teach the class and we got stuck with THIS GUY!!!! He can be funny, if you appreciate dry, somewhat **** humor. Essays = killer. Highest grade was a c- and I get As in english. Homeboi is a little cray cray. This should be your last resort"
2788,925627,1.5,5.0,"He's a funny guy, but he can't really teach to save his life. His essays are harshly graded, and his lectures are more like tangents that you don't know if you're supposed to be paying attention to. If you're worried about maintaining a good GPA, I'd advise against taking Prof. Waters..."
2789,925627,1.0,3.0,"Horrible teacher, he constantly questions you, several of his students including others from other sections have had to go to the head of philosophy about his poor conduct and impolite ways of talking to students.  His tests are easy, but he grades like it's an upper division class on papers and projects. I'm surprised he still has a job."
2790,925627,1.0,5.0,Not a good teacher. His lectures are rants and he does not clarify the subject. No one is doing well in his class and everyone I've spoken to agrees that he is a poor instructor. I actually used to enjoy philsophy prior to this class.
2791,925627,1.0,4.0,"Read the book. His lecture helped for about 1% of the test, 60% from the book. and 39% I swear I never read it! Even though I looked over EVERYTHING we needed to read in the book."
2792,925627,1.5,5.0,"He keeps changing his mind when it comes to papers,he'll tell you one thing and do another .No freedom to write,because he wants you to do the exact pattern as the book.The book and subject it's easy , he makes it difficult .Do no take this class, it's a waste of money"
2793,925627,4.5,1.0,Very easy going guy and a great teacher. The subject is not difficult at all. Highly recommended professor.
2794,925627,3.0,4.0,"Waters, Waters, Waters!  This man is crazy!  He is really smart, but his class is insane!  He questions everything you say. It will drive you crazy because he will never tell you if you are right or wrong.  Be sure to read or else he will make the whole class take quizzes instead of discussion.  Be sure to participate and you will get an A."
2795,1726406,1.0,1.0,"She's a direct reflection on the MSMC ADN program: UNFAIR, DISORGANIZED, one minute she's great the next you're being screamed at! She's ALWAYS late yet managed to drop the grades of half a dozen students because of attendance in the world's most useless class. We spent 2 days watching a Michael More film! Although she is great with Kaplan Review."
2796,2699208,5.0,3.0,Professor Glicker lectures are extremely helpful and she is super down to earth and friendly. She has an amazing way of connecting the chemistry /physics we learned in the class to real life situations which is super cool! It puts the material into perspective. Glicker also makes chemistry and physics easy to understand. 10/10 recommend lots of EC
2797,2185171,5.0,1.0,"She is a great Professor. Very soft spoken, funny, kind, and very approachable with any questions you have."
2798,2602967,5.0,1.0,"Aldous is one of the only lab professor that I actually liked, her class was every easy and I always felt engages. Sometimes after class I would stay in lab just to talk to her bc she's a really fun person to be around with and is always willing to help when needed."
2799,2199521,5.0,3.0,"Dr. D has a rep for being intimidating, when in fact, she's the most sweetest person on earth. She's extremely helpful and cares about her profession and students. The only way you will fail is if you failed to contact her and let her know you were struggling. She gives you her attention and time to explain the material until you get it. Love her."
2800,2199521,5.0,2.0,"I've taken her for 4 classes. She's brilliant, caring, practical, and there to help you. Her lectures and  readings are online to complete whenever you want in the week, and then in class there is an in-depth discussion and activity. She makes the subject interesting, welcomes questions, and knows SO MUCH about psych. Awesome professor - take her!"
2801,1941478,4.5,1.0,She's very generous with her grading and is willing to give lots of extra credit. She really empathizes with your position as a student and doesn't make the class very difficult. 
2802,1941478,5.0,3.0,She really knows her stuff and explains the material until it is made clear. The week before the exam she does a review and it is very helpful. She is pretty understanding and is available when you need her. Great professor. 
2803,1941478,3.5,2.0,"Great Professors who really knows the material and tries to make it easier for the students to learn. She explains math concepts in multiple ways until the student understands. Plus, she prints out all the lecture notes and provides study guides that are basically the answers to the tests. Very understanding and lenient with homework. "
2804,1941478,4.0,2.0,She  is a very nice person and pretty easy as long as you pay attention and do the work. The toughest thing you will have to do is the homework but the test are a breeze!
2805,1902574,5.0,3.0,She seems really nice. I would recommend her.
2806,2310129,5.0,4.0,"Prof Federico is AMAZING! He is the best Pharm Teaher ever, and actually one of the best professors I have ever had. As long as you take notes and LISTEN, and STUDY you will do great, he is always there for you and will help you as much as he possibly can"
2807,2310129,1.0,5.0,terrible teacher. not recommended.
2808,2310129,1.0,5.0,Alex is the worst instructor i ever had. his teaching is not clear and his exams are unreasonably hard from areas he barely teach. he is very rude and disrespectful. avoid him at any cost. not in par with other great professors at MSMU.
2809,143354,4.5,4.0,Does not like interrupted with questions during lecture. Hard grader
2810,143354,5.0,3.0,"Professor Whitman's Economic History class is very interesting. She has the class precisely constructed and laid out in the syllabus, which she gives students on the first day of class. She is very understanding and lenient when it comes to due dates. Grading is a little on the hard side, but totally fair. Overall I would recommend taking her class"
2811,143354,5.0,4.0,Whitman is a great teacher. You can tell she has a passion for Economics. If you are not interested in econonmics it can be a dry subject and she realizes that so her approach was to relate the material to our everyday lives.
2812,143354,5.0,1.0,"Good teacher and lecturer, take notes and read the book. The only problem with that class is the way she words the questions on the test, I swear sometimes the available answers don't answer the question!! But other than that she is straight forward and to the point. Her tests are multiple choice, defintions and short answers.. know the subject and you'll do fine, econ is just common sense anyway"
2813,143354,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. Very clear... not so concise. Her tests are challenging and a good way to learn.
2814,143354,5.0,2.0,"She funny, and so sweet.  She knows what she's talking about and explains it well.  Her tests are based on what you learned, but using your brain to figure it out.  She'll give you a &quot;problem&quot; and ask you to work it out with what you've learned in class.  I like her."
2815,143354,5.0,3.0,"Good teacher, but I had a little trouble in her class. I am still taking another Econ course with her though."
2816,143354,5.0,3.0,Take Prof. Whitman's classes.  Her lectures are not to be missed!   She makes what could be uninteresting and dry content come to life!   I took several of her classes and all were meaningful learning experiences.
2817,143354,5.0,1.0,Very easy and nice professor. Works with you when you need help. Gives interesting advisements
2818,143354,1.5,3.0,"Don't know what to expect in her tests. I do all the homework and reading... study as much as I can, and I still find surprises in every test."
2819,143354,5.0,3.0,"Greatest teacher!..... vey helpful, lover her!!!"
2820,143354,5.0,2.0,"Really excellent teacher - explains the subject matter very clearly.  Real-world applications and discussions. Just read the text, listen to lecture, take notes, you'll breeze through the mid-terms and finals."
2821,143354,4.5,3.0,"Great Teacher, explained concepts well, really enjoyed her class"
2822,2486269,2.0,4.0,"I learned a few things throughout this course but there is no need for so many papers. To put it in perspective, this was my longest paper final and it's an elective. If I were you I would choose a different elective. He seems like a great guy, he just assigns too much work. And also you will spend most of class lecturing."
2823,2486269,1.0,4.0,"If you don't like writing papers, skip this class you will have to write a total of 7 paper with the final one being 8-10 pages. He is a really tough grader. Overall, disliked the course he treats students as if we were in high school. You get 2 free absences, after that he will doc 2% off your overall grade for each class missed."
2824,2486269,1.0,4.0,"I recommend taking a different elective, the amount of work assigned is unnecessary. Focus on your core classes. He can be a disrespectful but it's up for debate if he does it intentionally. Attendance is graded harshly. Material learned is interesting, but the professor will make you dislike it with a passion."
