0,1804289,5.0,4.0,"Grisel is the most passionate prof I've had. Really knows what she's talking about. The class is hard & material is daunting, but you learn a lot if you put in effort. Exams are *hard* but she generously offers EC for students that decide to do it. Incredibly well-respected and overall a nice person. I would rec this class but be ready to work hard"
1,1804289,2.0,5.0,"I cannot stress enough to not take a class with Grisel. Though she is really nice and fun to talk to as a person, her classes are the sole cause of my GPA tanking over the course of four years, especially NEUR 217. I can't pursue my dreams of medical school anymore because of this. Beware"
2,1804289,3.0,2.0,"I liked Professor Grisel and class in general. There is a lot of work and it takes a lot of time out of your day. I would not recommend this class if you don't do the homework because that is what the entire grade is based on. However, she is a very good teacher and you will learn a lot from this class."
3,1804289,1.0,4.0,Grisel is by far the worst professor I've ever had. Her lectures are very disorganized and she goes on tangents a lot. Test questions are so specific; she asks analogy questions and expects you to memorize exact percentages. I worked so hard and spent countless hours studying for her exams and still averaged a 60 and ended with a C. AVOID!!!
4,1804289,4.0,2.0,"I really liked this class. I thought the material was interesting and worth the work. However, there is so much homework so make lots of time to complete the assignments. Most of the homework is reading so if that isn't your thing then I wouldn't recommend this class. The lectures were interesting since most of the work is done outside of class."
5,1804289,1.0,5.0,"Very disorganized lectures that don't cover all of the info she tests on. Does not explain the bio to the level she expects you to know it (even though there are no bio prereqs). Wording on exams are confusing, and exams are entirely memorization based. Want to do well? Go to office hours, do all the extra credit, and double check exam scores."
6,1804289,1.0,5.0,"Prof. Grisel assumes that you know biology. If you don't, you are more or less screwed, as she gives extra points to people who can explain more. Lectures are disorganized, tests are nothing but memorizing her lecture and the book, and she dumps pressure on the &quot;good grade&quot; students to help the &quot;poor grade&quot; students. Avoid if you can."
7,1804289,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Grisel is an incredible professor. I took her Neuroscience 101 course over the summer, and although it was fast-paced, it was extremely rewarding. She cares about her students and is passionate and knowledgeable about her field. I highly recommend taking her class."
8,1804289,5.0,5.0,"There was nothing easy about Dr. Grisel's summer course, but I felt like the challenge wasn't impossible. As long as you complete the reading assignments, take notes, and seek her out during her office hours, then you're sure to pass Dr. Grisel's class. She also allowed me to record her lectures and she posts the lectures online. Great professor!"
9,1804289,5.0,4.0,"In full disclosure, the material can be dense and intimidating, but Prof. Grisel is very knowledgable and passionate about her work. You will learn a ton of great information if you take time to learn the material."
10,1804289,3.0,4.0,"She was a really passionate teacher, however a lot of recorded lectures and textbook reading. The class is a lot of work, but serves as a great foundation for students interested in psych."
11,1804289,4.0,3.0,"You can tell that this professor really knows what she is talking about. Sometimes she goes off-topic, but it is always psychology related. She has a lot of experience! She is very easy to talk to and is accessible outside of class. You have to study hard to do well, but she makes you want to do well. I hope I get to have her again."
12,1804289,1.0,4.0,"The worst professor I've had at Bucknell (which says a lot). She was so mean that she made someone cry on the first day of class. Her tests were impossible; they were typically 110 questions, including &quot;Grisel choice&quot; - basically a set up to fail. Her lectures were all -over-the-place and I dreaded going to her class. Definitely do not recommend!"
13,1804289,4.0,3.0,Judy Grisel is an interesting professor as she's really brilliant so she sometimes assumes that you know certain things. Her class is engaging and interesting despite it be disorganized. Her tests are challenging but manageable as it's a lot of memorization.
14,1804289,1.0,5.0,"Worst Prof ever. First exam average: 50.5. Goes on tangents during class, forgets what she was supposed to cover, but puts what she forgot to say on exam anyway. 33% of the exam is what she says, so needless to say, this hurts you. Also incredibly condescending to students and refuses to take accountability for how bad of a professor she is."
15,1804289,5.0,2.0,"Extremely intelligent/ Extremely passionate/ Lots of life experience/Yes her class structure is disorganized, but it never mattered because she's a master of her subject. Ask her a question and she'll respond with utmost clarity. There are several extra credit options. Tests actually make you think, so people whine that they're hard... they aren't."
16,1804289,2.0,3.0,Grisel is an interesting lady but not the best lecturer-she clearly loves neuroscience and is really intelligent but so disorganized in her lectures that it made the material confusing when it should have been really simple. She goes on random tangents in her lectures that don't help with learning the material and the MC on her exams are confusing.
17,1804289,3.5,4.0,Very tough but learned a ton
18,1804289,2.0,1.0,"Prof. Grisel's class was interesting, easy, and boring. We had 5 writing assignments and you simply had to show up to class to get points for the day. Other than that and a final project, that was really it. The material, however, was really fascinating so I wish we did more activities with it. She never seemed prepared for class though."
19,1804289,5.0,4.0,"This course was excellent.  She is incredibly intelligent and will turn you into a better scholar, student, researcher, and critical thinker through her stories and the content she assigns to be discussed.  Only take her if you are a serious student and wish to grow."
20,1804289,1.5,3.0,Not very interested in her students. Went to ask a couple questions and she came off as though she did not have time to stay for a few minutes to help. Often goes on tangents and the class would get confused.
21,1804289,4.0,3.0,"Professor Grisel is very intelligent and knows how to teach, Her lectures were really interesting and informative. However, her tests are very tough and if you study the notes, slides and the book, you should be fine. Having previous knowledge of Neuroscience helps a lot. Overall a great, approachable professor but the material is just tough."
22,1804289,2.5,4.0,"She was aweful, so hard to understand and no clear at all. She was very helpful if you could get her to talk to you outside of class but always acted like you were bothering her when you showed up to her office. Her tests were near impossible, especially her ""Grisel Choice"" questions. she also doesn't believe in A's."
23,1804289,1.5,4.0,"She is the single worst teacher I have had at Bucknell. Studying hard didn't help me on her tests because they were unfair and we didn't know what was on them (except for the practical). She is unclear and doesn't cover entire chapters, but still expects you to understand them. AVOID!"
24,696321,1.0,5.0,"If you wish to maintain your GPA, do not take his classes"
25,696321,5.0,4.0,"Knisely was the best professor I had at Bucknell.  He is tough but also fair, and he is tough mostly because the material is tough.  He is a little bit intimidating but if you give his class respect (show up, learn something) he will be helpful when you need it."
26,696321,4.5,4.0,Good luck.
27,696321,4.5,3.0,"if you're taking him for thermo I, get ready to have your ass handed to you. he makes it his job to weed out anyone who's not ready for mechanical engineering. everyone i know that dropped out was cuz of that class. if you have him later he eases up, great teacher."
28,696321,3.0,4.0,"Pretty tough, but you learn a lot. I remember walking out of that class every day having no idea what was going on, but by the end of the semester you know your stuff. Exams and quizzes are tough, but if you read and study, they're pretty straightforward and follow the book closely."
29,696321,3.0,4.0,"Knisely gets a rap for being pretty tough, but I think that's more due to the fact that he teaches the toughest classes.  He's one of the best professors I've had here and one of the smartest people I've met.  The exams aren't too hard, but they're long which makes them tougher.  The class will be tough and lots of work...but you'll learn a lot."
30,729095,5.0,4.0,"Professor Heintzelman is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is very smart and passionate about what he teaches. I definitely recommend taking this class! It is tough, but definitely worth it."
31,729095,5.0,3.0,"I LOVED ornithology with Heintzelman. He is so fun to learn from, especially because he's an avid birder! The class literally felt like those movie classes that is challenging, but you learn so much in, and just feels good to be a part of. This is a caring, knowledgable professor who wants you to succeed."
32,729095,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Heintzelman was knowledgable, funny, and made sure students ultimately did not just memorize material, but became better scientists. The exams/quizzes' difficulty level was appropriate for a 300 level bio class. The lab was difficult at times (cell culture), but it covers super useful skills. Lab reports were graded tough."
33,729095,5.0,3.0,"The best professor I have ever had in the bio department.  So fun but still makes you work hard, explains everything very clearly and is EXTREMELY knowledgable.  10/10 would recommend"
34,729095,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, super helpful and he makes the course interesting and educational. Never condescending and very approachable, I highly recommend taking any class with him because he's just an upstanding guy."
35,729095,3.5,4.0,"Prof H is a real great and goofy guy. He has a good sense of humor in lab and in the classroom which makes lecture totally bearable. His tests were hard, and you really need to understand and intergrate everything inorder to get a good grade. Overall he is a great guy and I am glad I had the chance to take a class with him."
36,729095,4.0,4.0,I just had Dr. H for Cell Biology.  The class is not a cake-walk by any means.  You have to study the material and be able to integrate everything that you are learning.  The load of work is not overbearing; its what a 300 level BIOL class should be.  I am very glad I took this class and feel like Dr. H made me a better student and scientist.
37,729095,5.0,4.0,Great teacher. He teaches the material with great clarity and his power points are very helpful when taking notes.
38,729095,2.5,5.0,"um, no. his tests require you to know every last detail. he's a smart and nice guy and all, but um if you want to do well then don't bother."
39,729095,2.0,5.0,"Hard as hell, stay away"
40,729095,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher- Great guy. Really helpful, especially in office hours. The tests, however, are killer! And he's a tough grader! Read the book!"
41,729095,3.0,5.0,"His tests are unbearable! No multiple choice, all short answer, fill-ins or essays on obscure topics. He's funny at times, but not worth it; it's still very hard to stay awake in his class."
42,729095,1.5,5.0,"I did not find him helpful at all.  He talks really fast in lecture, so it is hard to take good notes."
43,729095,4.0,4.0,&quot;protein molecules were the sexy molecules of the time&quot;  &quot;party at that tata box!&quot;  dr. h is the man!  he has got to be the most socially awkward professor but he knows his stuff.  two words: moose obsession
44,729095,5.0,3.0,He's awesome.I definitely recommend him!powerpoint presentations can be found online prior to class so you can take notes right on the presentation.he's always very helpful and makes himself available after class if you're confused.tests are straight-forward...as long as you pay attention in class and take good notes you'll do great in his class!
45,729095,4.0,4.0,"Very tough but sooo helpful and encouraging. He's always willing to help. The lectures are boring but he speaks pretty fast so PAY ATTENTION! He's very nice, extremely intelligent, and has a great sense of humor!"
46,2064391,3.5,4.0,"She is a nice lady, but her class is incredibly boring. There's a ton of reading that no one wants to do. She takes points off of the test essays if you only incorporate stuff from class discussions. There are 2 tests, 1 final, and 1 final paper. I would only take this class if you are very interested in Roman readings like the Aeneid etc. "
47,1351692,2.0,5.0,Terrible. Period. If you are in his class make sure you drop out during the 2 week period and find a new professor.
48,1351692,2.0,2.0,"He was my least favorite professor. He was not clear and the TA was a much better teacher than he was. He was disorganized and completely uninspiring. If at all possible, do not take his class."
49,1351692,1.0,4.0,He is a terrible professor. All he does is read off powerpoints and is not good at answering questions
50,1351692,2.0,2.0,"The class overall was easy, as long as you do the textbook reading and strudy for tests it isn't hard. He is just such a boring teacher, spending the entire class period lecturing. The hour and a half long class definitely drags"
51,1351692,1.5,4.0,No Comments
52,106513,5.0,1.0,"Professor Ponnuswami is a real gem. Not only was her class interesting and fun, she cares deeply about the well-being of her students. I was having a pretty hard time at school, and she helped me so much with the transition into college. She encouraged me to do what I love and I am so thankful I know her!"
53,106513,4.0,5.0,"Not for the timid, I took one of Meenakshi's seminar classes on Contemporary British Lit. She really makes you work for it, and her understanding of the literature is on another level. You will feel in over your head at first but come out with a greater understanding of everything. Super fun and hilarious professor, she will change your life."
54,106513,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ponnuswami was one of the best professors I had at Bucknell. I think some of the more critical reviews are coming from students  who took her survey class, which is kind of an unpleasant class regardless of who you take it with. Her class on American Theatre was amazing though. Kind, extremely knowledgeable, interesting lectures/readings"
55,106513,4.0,4.0,"I don't know why everyone is saying that her work load is easy. If you want an A shell help you achieve it, but don't be fooled, shell make you work for it.  Theres a lot of reading and writing involved in this class, but overall she's a great professor."
56,106513,5.0,1.0,Loved this class! She is an excellent advisor. Ponnuswami really cares about your essays and input in class--she treats you like an adult. Take this class!
57,106513,5.0,2.0,"fun class, i hate reading and i'm bad at it, but i enjoyed the plays we did. she's funny and easy, she gave back my final paper and said &quot;This is a B paper...give it back to me when it's an A&quot; apart from that she makes you really think about the material, i recomend her to everyone"
58,106513,3.5,3.0,"Dont take her for 101, there are much easier professor's. Engineer's looking to fill their English credit and get an easy A should take another class.There are three papers and she grades very hard."
59,106513,3.0,1.0,"She's usually a nice person and her grading is a piece of cake. But, the work is so pointless. We had two research papers total and each of them were to write lesson plans and support them.  Basically, we did her planning for next semester's course(s). A waste of my time, I think."
60,106513,4.5,1.0,She's wonderfully easy to understand
61,106513,5.0,1.0,"interesting, funny, liberal grader"
62,106513,4.0,1.0,"Very considerate, nice, and funny prof"
63,106513,5.0,1.0,"meenakshi rocks! she's funny and interesting, just show up at class and you are basically assured an A or B. not a taxing professor"
64,106513,4.0,2.0,"Hilarious sense of humor, giving with grades, very friendly and willing to help you."
65,694291,5.0,1.0,Very nice. Not too much homework and very understanding. 
66,694291,5.0,2.0,"This class is amazing if you're interested in learning about Spanish literature. The lecture is in Spanish and expect to be exposed to famous pieces along with analyzing them. Make sure you participate often to engage with the class and do your homework so you don't fall behind. Super nice and helpful, I would 100% take one of her classes again."
67,694291,1.0,5.0,I do not recommend her class to anyone who at one point had any interest in pursuing Spanish. She was not helpful or invested in her students. The course was completely self taught.
68,694291,4.0,3.0,"Good professor. Helpful and funny. Classes weren't bad at all. Attendance was completely mandatory. Not too much work day to day. Tests are a little trickier than I would have expected. Overall, good class and I enjoyed her teaching."
69,694291,4.5,5.0,Great class!
70,694291,4.5,5.0,Great professor!
71,694291,4.5,1.0,A very easy but good teacher.
72,694291,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, I learned a lot in her class"
73,694291,5.0,4.0,Awesome professor for 361... we learned a lot and had fun at the same time.  Everyone in the class was engaged by Cunado's teaching in this course.  I would recommend it to all Spanish majors.  Cunado is passionate about this subject and it shows!
74,694291,4.5,4.0,The class is a bit hard but he´s a great teacher and she is very understanding. Always available during office hours.
75,694291,4.0,3.0,"Class isn't too difficult, and she grades fairly easy on essays and presentations.  Just participate a lot and she'll like you.  She is kinda boring though and doesn't have much of a personality.  However, she's a native spanish speaker so you learn a lot."
76,694291,2.0,4.0,"the worst.  she is not helpful at all, the tests are unnecessarily hard, and she is just not a very good teacher"
77,694291,1.0,3.0,"this lady is just plain mean, and tries to teach stuff to the class that she doesn't even know about"
78,694291,3.0,3.0,"She makes you feel kinda bad about yourself, but it's not you, it's her.  Just talk alot and do your work and you will do fine."
79,694291,3.5,3.0,good teacher. never smiles and nothing is funny. class is very predictable. kinda boring. fair grader although we barely have any grades. no midterm or final. grade is based mostly on participation (can be good or bad thing depending on if you like speaking or not)
80,694291,5.0,3.0,"Good Teacher Semi easy grader if you do the work. Native spanish speaker (can be good or bad) I learned a lot in her class, the only problem i have with her is that the woman has absolutely no personality in class."
81,2181145,1.0,3.0,Do not take a class with her if you can. She does not do much more for her students than lecture every class. Her office hours are not welcoming as she does not seem as if she wants to be there to help. Overall terrible experience.
82,2181145,5.0,3.0,"I had her for Linguistics. There's barely any homework, yet you learn a lot! There are basically 4 tests you have to do well on but there are no surprises and she makes sure to teach EVERYTHING that is on them. Very accessible in office hours, she retaught me an entire lesson I had to miss due to athletics!"
83,1804316,1.0,2.0,"Seemed to be more concerned with us giving her a good rating than teaching what we needed. Essays assigned were not helpful, nor was feedback given. Attendance grading also misleading--said we didn't have to attend--but grade clearly impacted by attendance. Not a good experience--take someone else."
84,1804316,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Willoughby is very passionate and really knows what she is talking about! If she sees that you are struggling with something in your writing, she will give you really good feedback and help you out if needed. I would definitely take another class with her again if I got the chance!"
85,1804316,4.5,2.0,"If you're looking for an interesting, fun and easy foundation seminar look no further! No tests- just occasional papers and group projects. Professor Willoughby is extremely passionate about films and encourages her students to feel this excitement along with her! "
86,1804316,4.5,1.0,Professor Willoughby is so much fun! Her classes are never boring and she always makes you think about something in a way you hadn't even considered before. Highly encourage taking a class with her!
87,1804316,5.0,3.0,Professor Willoughby is one of my most interesting professors I've had. She is engaging and her classes are very interesting. You can tell she loves what she does and is definitely a pro. She is very helpful and understanding. 5/5
88,1804316,5.0,3.0,Professor Willoughby is one of my favorite professors. She's really funny and obviously an expert in her field. Fair grader and always willing to help.
89,1263649,4.0,4.0,"Tincoff is extremely helpful outside class and is very understanding. Her tests were tough and she's definitely a nit-picky grader. Her lectures can be dry at times, but overall the workload wasn't bad and the small essays for hw were easy and helped boost your grade. Definitely take notes! Her 3rd exam she let us choose the type of test we wanted!"
90,1263649,4.0,4.0,I was actually shocked when I saw how low her rating on here was. I understand Halpbern & Grisel being low but Tincoff is actually a great professor. She does interesting research and is very helpful and receptive of questions. Her lectures are interesting and she challenges students to engage with the material. Her tests ARE hard though.
91,1263649,1.0,4.0,"Would not take a class with her again, does not explain things well, will not discuss anything but the specific material in class. You will not know what to study."
92,1263649,1.0,3.0,Does not explain clearly and is very confusing. Does not teach the material properly and is very disorganized. Do not recommend
93,1263649,3.5,3.0,"Lectures are straightforward and not so interesting, she is always nice and willing to help, easy grader on papers but tests can be deceivingly hard: not so clear what exactly you need to know.  Overall pretty average"
94,1263649,5.0,2.0,"Professor Tincoff is definitely one of favorite professors at Bucknell. She loves what she does, and is much more concerned with conveying the material to the students than giving out harsh grades. She is a fair grader and if you go to class and show that your putting in some kind of effort you can't do worse than a B+."
95,1263649,4.0,4.0,Class was easy if you attend class and pay attention. Lectures are on power point so reviewing for the tests are easy. The tests are easy if you study. 4 tests and a final. There's a group research project but its not that hard. She's a very helpful professor during office hours.
96,1263649,2.5,3.0,Weed out class for psychology majors.  Class is easy and do not even need to attend.  powerpoints on blackboard and take home quizes.  nevertheless only 2 test so be careful.  hard paper grader and you never know what you are going to get.  stumbles a lot on what she wants to say and unclear with what she wants. not recommended
97,1263649,3.0,2.0,"She is a consistent professor, but often stumbles over what she is trying to convey to the class which is confusing. Overall, explains the material well. If you do the readings and put in a solid effort you can't do worse than a B."
98,1095725,4.0,4.0,"I struggled a bit with the class my freshman year and he was a tough grades but I really liked him as a peson. Truly cared about his students and wanted them to succeed, Would only not take again bc I am not good at science in general."
99,1095725,4.0,4.0,"Kirby is pretty goofy, but in a way that makes learning fun. Lectures are pretty fast pace, but he loves when students ask questions, and he works very hard to make sure you understand things. The fieldtrips are fun. He is very knowledgable and wants to help you succeed, but you will need to work for it."
100,1095725,5.0,3.0,"Kirby is one of the best professors I've had. He is extremely helpful, understanding, and flexible. He really wants to help students and hear what they have to say. He has a lot of cool stuff to say that's really insightful. He's not a tough grader and doesn't overload you with work whatsoever. Everyone should take a class with him."
101,1095725,5.0,2.0,"Second class I've taken taught by Kirby. Both were easy - never used the textbook and taking notes didn't feel too necessary. Pretty intuitive subject matter especially if you had any earth science at all in high school. Funny, laid-back guy who will chat you up outside of class if you want. Both classes of his were ones I looked forward to."
102,1095725,3.0,4.0,He's actually so bad at explaining things. Made it a lot harder than it had to be. Really nice guy and cares about the subject and his students but not a great instructor. Don't take his class unless you're good at geology.
103,1095725,3.5,4.0,"A very entertaining professor, he knows his stuff but sometimes has trouble explaining it, but then again geochemistry is no walk in the park to begin with.  "
104,1095725,4.5,2.0,"Great guy. really cares about the subject, and the class trips are actually pretty interesting.Definitly a good lab to take, and just study the powerpoints for the test, and you'll be fine. Show him you care."
105,1095725,4.5,2.0,"Kirby  is really helpful and the subject matter was interesting as well. He uses powerpoints exclusively so notetaking is easy. Additionally, Kirby is really knowledable about the material and teaches the big picture. Overall, he's great."
106,913456,5.0,3.0,Emily is an amazing professor as she tries her best to make you understand the concept clearly. She is very nice and accessible outside class as she encourages students to meet her to explain everything. She also guarantees that test is fair. She also curve so I think she is a great choice
107,913456,2.0,5.0,"Her homeworks are about twice as long as for calc 2, which I heard was the harder of the two classes. It's not possible to do the homeworks just from going to the lectures, so you have to read the textbook AND get help from another source to do each homework, which are assigned every day. She does care about her students and is very nice."
108,913456,3.5,4.0,"Dryden did a decent job of teaching the material and helping when you needed it. If you are willing to study and put in the time, chances are you will get a decent grade. Be ready for WebWork and homework everyday, and you're going to have to study for the tests. Even if she's a hard grader, I would suggest Dryden and would def take her again."
109,913456,1.5,5.0,"If you enjoy homework and webwork everyday of the week this is the class for you. It would be better to just learn from the textbook on your own then going to her class, and the tests forget about it, your more likely to get a perfect  score on the SAT's then to pass one."
110,913456,3.5,4.0,"Proff. Dryden genuinely cares about her student. She will make time for you, if you put in the effort to get her help. Her tests are tough, but her homework assignments, which are quite plentiful, prepare you well for the test. You just need to ask questions, do all of your work, and you will be fine."
111,913456,2.5,5.0,"Lots of homework... She flies through the lectures leaving you in the dust. Not many tests though, and they aren't terrible."
112,913456,5.0,4.0,"Although intimidating at first, she was very good at explaining everything. She was extremely accommodating with help through office hours and moodle forums. Her class is tough but never unfair, and if you do all the homework, you shouldn't have any trouble."
113,913456,2.0,5.0,Dryden will make sure that you learn the material and if you do not she will make you an example in front of the class. If you do not answer the first question of that day correct then she will call on you for every single other one even when she knows you don't understand it. I do not recommend taking her at any point in your career
114,913456,5.0,3.0,"I had her for Topics in Calculus. Math is not my best subject so I thought the class was hard. However, Prof. Dryden explained the material very well and was always available for help. The tests were made by all the Topics in Calc. professors and curved (if necessary) for all the sections. The tests were hard, but overall they were mostly fair."
115,913456,5.0,4.0,"Makes students work hard, very clear and concise about assignments.  Will easily make time to help outside of class.  Helps understand material so that you don't have to memorize a lot of formulas, but understand what you are doing."
116,913456,3.0,4.0,"Professor Dryden makes you work.  She is very clear and concise about what she expects in and out of class.  She also teaches the material in way in which, you don't need to memorize formulas.  You will actually understand what you are doing when you do it.  She is a great professor and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
117,913456,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Dryden is very helpful, surprisingly also during the actual lectures.  She is a hard teacher, but she teaches math the way it was supposed to be.  It felt like a lot of work, but it's math.  Get real.  She wants you to really understand it."
118,913456,3.0,4.0,"Hard grader, kind of a distant personality.  If you don't go to her for help, she won't approach you so I definetly recommend office hours, and try not to fall behind, because it's really hard to catch up. I did bad in the class, but she tries to have everyone do decent."
119,913456,5.0,5.0,"Emily was amazing.  As long as you attend class and keep up with the problem sets, you will do well.  She encourages you to come to office hours, and is always willing to work with you.  She sets up a forum on Blackboard to get homework help which was a great bonus.  She also provides a fair amount of extra credit opportunities."
120,913456,4.5,4.0,"She is great at explaining the material! She really wants you to understand the topic at hand, and she is very accessible if you want help. Homework is graded pretty strictly though, and exams definitely aren't easy. But if you study hard and get help when you need it, you will do fine."
121,913456,5.0,4.0,"hard class, but she knows what she's talking about.  i didn't necessarily like the book used, but her lectures helped me understand the material."
122,913456,4.5,5.0,"hard grader, reserved/detached during class but a really nice, seemingly well-rounded woman if you can get to know her"
123,913456,4.0,5.0,"she's a really hard grader but a really nice lady - take advantage of office hours, she's very helpful if you're willing to use your time to go in a see her."
124,913456,1.5,5.0,No Comments
125,2576435,4.0,3.0,"Professor Johnson assigns a lot of homework--there are 2 assignments due each class so it's extremely important to go to class so that you receive credit. Aside from this, I thought this was a great class and wasn't very difficult, especially if you took any form of calc in hs. She explains concepts extremely clearly and is always open to questions"
126,2576435,4.0,4.0,Professor Johnson explains the math concepts very well and uses examples in class close to the homework. It's not too bad for a calc class but definitely can be challenging. She's an easy grader as long as you show work. Sometimes can be rude but usually fine.
127,2248755,5.0,3.0,"She's the best accounting professor I have ever had. She is very patient. Unlike some accounting professors at Bucknell who roast their students for not knowing something, Professor Schenck is very caring and really tries to bond with students! TAKE HER CLASS!"
128,2248755,5.0,4.0,"I have Prof. Schenck for my Accounting I course. She is a really nice professor. She holds a lot of office hour, which is really helpful. She makes thing clear in the lecture and in the homework. She also leaves a plenty of class time for in-class exercise. You just have to do all the homework and go over extra exercise and you should be fine."
129,2248755,5.0,1.0,By far the best professor at Bucknell. Absolutely loved her. Always so helpful. Cares about her students. Get ready to put in the time because the Exams are difficult. My favorite professor so far. She is very personable and I would love to take her again. You MUST take her!
130,1112115,5.0,2.0,Really wants everyone to do well in her class and wants people to care about what they are learning. Sometimes gets frustrated when people do not understand but relatively easy class and such a sweet professor.
131,1112115,3.0,5.0,Tricky class. Alia is very sweet but is also willing to snap. Goes through excel problem every class which is helpful but doesn't to a great job transferring knowledge. Quizzes are tough. Homework is ok and graded. You must give full attention and full effort every class to do well. She moves pretty fast. Has an accent. Loves masks. 
132,1112115,4.0,4.0,Alia cares greatly about all her students and wants nothing but the best for them. She does move very quickly and it can be hard to follow along the entire class. She expects a lot out of her students but respects any effort given by the student. She is always willing to help out of class.
133,1112115,4.0,4.0,Professor Stanciu is a great teacher and mentor. She always emphasizes that she is there to help us and is always willing to answer questions. You can ask a question in the middle of a lecture and she will help you out right away. She is also very accessible outside of class. She is great and super knowledgeable about what she teaches.
134,1112115,5.0,2.0,Alia is a really great professor. She is extremely enthusiastic about what she is teaching and wants her students to understand the material. She is available outside of class and really wants to help you in anyway she can. She can sometimes she can be a bit confusing in class so it is important to ask questions if you don't understand.
135,1112115,5.0,3.0,"Stanciu is the nicest professor I have had yet. She genuinely cares about her students and wants them to do well. She brings a unique energy to class and tries to keep it interesting, and exams aren't too hard."
136,1112115,5.0,2.0,"Alia is an amazing professor. Work hard, ask question if needed and you will be more than good"
137,1112115,5.0,3.0,"Alia is a very fair professor who truly cares about her students success. She begs us to ask questions every day, and while sometimes her explanations can be difficult to understand, she tries very hard to help students. Her accent can be tough, but overall not too difficult a class. Not too much work. Need to show up and participate to succeed."
138,1112115,1.0,5.0,she doesn't know how to teach the material in the class and is much harder than the other mgmt102 teachers. NEVER TAKE HER IF U WANT A GOOD GPA. I only passed because of AP stats from high school. The textbook doesn't even help. she wrote it herself to make more money probably
139,1112115,1.0,5.0,"She is one of the worst professors that I have ever had. She moves way too quickly and teachers material that is much more difficult than it should be for a 100 level class. She makes you feel stupid for asking questions and doesn't believe in curving, even when it is necessary."
140,1112115,3.5,4.0,Confusing at times because there is a lot of material to get through in a limited amount of time that can sometimes be tough to follow. Most of class work is on excel. Can be frustrating at times. Very nice professor but structure of class can sometimes be confusing. If you miss assignments there is no way to make them up
141,1112115,5.0,2.0,"Class moves fast but she gives great examples and really helps you understand the material.  She is very helpful during office hours and via email.  Need to attend class to understand the concepts and how to use the programs.  She is great at giving partial credit on exams, quizzes, and homework."
142,1112115,4.5,4.0,A good teacher who is always willing to go over something if you don't understand it- in the classroom or her office. She moves kind of quick so if you don't understand something you should ask. Tests and quizzes are tough; homework is manageable. a solid professor for 102 but I'm not sure if she was the best. SO nice however. 
143,1112115,3.5,5.0,Great teacher. Material is hard and she moves fast. Sometimes hard to keep up and understand what she is doing. Tests are difficult.
144,1112115,3.5,3.0,ALia is a great teacher. She is very passionate and really knowledgeable. However she moves very quickly in class and expects that everyone knows the material in the detail she does. She is really helpful and available outside of class. Tests are difficult.
145,1112115,4.5,4.0,"Alia is a great teacher who is passionate about her subject matter.  She knows how to have fun in class, but yet she has high expectations of her students. If you participate and ask questions, you'll do fine and learn a lot."
146,1112115,3.5,4.0,Learned a lot from her class. Challenges students and has very high expectations. Tests are hard.
147,1112115,4.5,4.0,"Alia is amazing.  She's extremely helpful and really wants students to succeed.  She's always available outside of class and tries to make class as interesting as possible.  She's a GREAT professor, I'd definitely take her class if you can."
148,1112115,4.5,4.0,I had Alia for Operations and Decision Sciences. She is an excellent professor- sometimes her Romanian accent is a little hard to understand but that is not really a problem. Overall she wants to get feedback from students and is very approachable. She makes a quantitative based class very interesting and engaging.
149,1112115,4.5,3.0,Encyclopedia of knowledge regarding mgmt.  Some tests are harder than the average work you do in class but everything is fair.  Plenty of partial credit.  Very approachable.
150,1112115,4.5,2.0,No Comments
151,1112115,4.5,2.0,"Extremely nice, there is homework every couple of weeks but you can work in groups."
152,2211895,5.0,2.0,"This is the best art class to take. He is really caring and a little shy. If you show up to class, try your best to draw and turn in your work on time you will get a good grade. This class did more than just regular drawing and was really fun. There was hardly homework and he asked for a lot of recommendations so we could control what we did!"
153,1431612,4.5,4.0,Dean is a great teacher whos very enthusiastic about what he does.  He cares about his students and is an easy grader but still shows he cares about the students work.  Overall he is awesome and highly recommendable
154,1431612,4.5,3.0,"Awesome teacher. A decent amount of reading, but as long as you keep up with it, which isn't very much if you space it out correctly, it's a great class. Likes to talk about his other classes, but sarcastic and funny. Likes the kids who actually talk and participate in class. I highly recommend this class!"
155,1431612,3.0,1.0,"Hysterical guy.  A lot of enthusiasm and will open your mind to uncomfortable topics.  However be ready for a lot of jumps in topics and changes in syllabus because it is sometimes hard to tell where he is going.  He really cares about his students though, so don't hestitate to ask for help or clarification when needed."
156,1431612,5.0,4.0,Easily the best teacher at Bucknell. Makes up for the other miserable &quot;professors&quot; in the Psych department.Great man
157,1431612,4.5,2.0,"great professor, really smart and a great guy...just a little scattered at times."
158,2435139,1.0,4.0,I doubt his intellectual understanding of the subject and topics he teaches. A waste of time and would never recommend
159,2435139,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Azhar is very passionate about econ. Truly cares about the students, really willing to help, always a line at the office hour because students love to talk to him! I took political economy with him and it was a mind-blowing experience. Lots of reading, lots of writing, but lots of learning for sure."
160,2435139,4.0,3.0,Prof. Sharam was a really good professor but his lectures were really boring. He also gives 2 one-page wiring assignments a week which we a tad tedious but I learned a lot from them. He was nice enough to not give us a midterm and the final exam is pretty clear cut. Overall good class he is very passionate about econ!
161,2435139,5.0,2.0,"I had a class with Professor Azhar that was 3 hours long. You would expect the lectures to get boring after a while. Wrong. I have been so intrigued by a lecture before. No textbooks. Listen to what he says in his lectures, the assignments are exactly related. There are no tricks in his classes. Best econ prof in the whole department, hands down."
162,2435139,5.0,4.0,"Great professor who you can tell genuinely loves the course material. Participation and reading are very important but he makes it seem effortless. Overall one of the best professors I have ever taken, highly recommend."
163,2435139,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor!!! Incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. Replies to emails in time and door is always open even outside office hours. Really passionate about the course topic and brings a lot of life to the class. You feel like participating as he creates an environment where you want to learn. Overall he is the best professor I have had.
164,1204314,4.0,3.0,"Professor Stokes-Brown is really well-educated and very knowledgeable about public policy and whatnot. Thus, she lectures a lot and can go on for a long time, which I find very boring. As to grading, she's very clear as to what she wants and I found her to be an easy/fair grader, but many other students said she was tough."
165,1204314,1.0,3.0,"Stay away. Class isn't that much work and isn't too hard, but expect to be frustrated all semester if you have political views different than hers. Just copy what she says and you'll be fine, but don't expect to actually think."
166,1204314,1.0,5.0,"Bucknell should fire this woman. It's not even that the material is hard. She just fails you simply because she feels like it. For example, on tests you will do fine on the multiple choice but when it gets to your essay she just underlines random things and takes points off that make zero sense AND she does this for summaries/reflections."
167,1204314,4.0,2.0,"Professor Stokes-Brown is very well-educated on the topic and is always open to discussion as long as it's intelligent. Her class is an easy A as long as you show up and pay attention. Summary/Reflection papers are an easy grade, and her tests are not difficult; she even gives a sort of study guide. Material can be boring to read though."
168,1204314,1.0,3.0,"Can't even explain how horrible this class is. Long, boring lectures followed by discussion where she tries to shut down any viewpoint different than her own. There are lots of other intro politics professors out there-- find one of them."
169,1204314,3.5,1.0,"Really liked her!! Very passionate about her subject and well informed. She is very approachable outside of class and always open to discuss things with you. Decent amount of reading, but tests were really easy. Only one longer paper, and no final exam. Pretty liberal, and not afraid to share her opinions."
170,1204314,3.0,4.0,She is an ok teacher. Her understanding of politics and history is great but she teaches from a bias. Although I agree with most her own personal views it is still annoying have to learn from biased opinion. Her grading is really subjective to her own personal opinions. You can do well in her class as long as you suck up.
171,1204314,1.0,4.0,"Not a nice person. Defensive and arrogant towards questions & different viewpoints. Constantly dominating class discussion to the point where no one else can contribute. Overall, cannot see past her own ego to teach the class."
172,1204314,5.0,4.0,"I really don't understand all these bad ratings for her. She was clear, interesting and very helpful. She challenged us to think outside the box and defend our views. She does not take sides and only facilitates the arguments. The class requires a lot of readings but other than that its a FUN class and you should take her."
173,1204314,1.5,3.0,"Domineering and arrogant. Diminishes discussion in class by refusing to acknowledge opposing viewpoints, even on non-partisan issues. Angers easily when asked challenging questions. Overall, embodies what an educator should NOT be."
174,1204314,2.5,4.0,"Awful.  Just awful.  Extra Credit assignments help you recover points lost, but you're best bet is to articulate a liberal viewpoint even if you're not liberal.  Her grading system is a little disingenuous and she seems unconcerned less with important concepts and more with whether your perspective coagulates with hers."
175,1204314,2.0,5.0,She was extremely overbearing and obviously thinks that the way of the Democrats is the only way. If you don't agree with her you are screwed. If you do agree with her...guess what you are still screwed because she only gives good grades to those she likes. Do not take this class with her!
176,1204314,1.5,5.0,"Easily the worst teacher/professor I have ever had as a student. Her lectures are horribly boring, especially when the subject matter is just as bad. Not only is she a horribly difficult grade but even if you get everything completely correct and explain it thoroughly, she still down grades you. Avoid this professor at all costs!"
177,1204314,2.0,2.0,Easily the worst lecturer I have ever experienced. It was painful to listen to her voice. Incredibly pretentious also which just made it worse. This was a truly awful class that almost turned me away from the major.
178,1204314,2.5,4.0,"One of the most boring classes I have ever gone through.  Lectures are tedious.  She is a walking textbook.  Although she is a very nice lady, her grading can be tough at times.  Sometimes she will spontaneously think of new homework to give you that day as class ends that has no connection to what is on your syllabus.  Avoid this class at all cost"
179,1204314,2.0,3.0,Her lectures are painful. Grading is not bad but assignments are somewhat ambiguous as to what is expected
180,1204314,4.5,2.0,"Class is interesting but she is a very hard grader. If you are a democrat you will like her, she does not agree with republicans and will grade you differently if you do not share her view points."
181,1204314,1.5,3.0,"Horrible teacher! Does not have enough knowledge of subject area to be teaching college courses. Very boring and an unfair grader, unless you agree with her politics."
182,1204314,2.0,4.0,"Ratings from when she was at Florida State. (doesn't look good) No. of Ratings: 34, Average Easiness: 1.8, Average Helpfulness: 1.6, Average Clarity: 1.8, Hotness Total: 0, Overall Quality: 1.7"
183,1079388,3.0,2.0,"a goofy guy that can't explain chemistry very well..grades test fairly, but really would NOT recommend for gen chem"
184,2060383,5.0,4.0,"Awesome professor. Really cares about his students, and loves the topics he teaches. Tests and other work are difficult, but if you put in the effort you should be fin, and hes always willing to help. Taken classes with him three times, and enjoyed each one. Sad to see him leave Bucknell, his enthusiasm is what made me become a psych major."
185,2060383,3.0,4.0,"Makes this class extremely hard. Doesn't explain clearly, and requires you to figure out a lot on your own. Every time I was in his class, I ended up leaving more confused that day. Great guy easy to talk to and will work with you outside of class, but I learned nothing and my grade in the class showed I did not understand the material."
186,2060383,5.0,4.0,"Prof Freestone is an awesome guy! His interests are wide ranging, and he's what is referred to as a ""polymath."" I have never met anyone so interested in seeing his students succeed, but this is not to say that his classes are easy! They are not! You have to work for it, but he will help you in 1 on 1 office hrs, and you will learn a ton! Take him!!"
187,2060383,5.0,3.0,tests are taking basically all from class lectures/power points. always willing to help outside of class and is so understanding and caring.
188,2060383,5.0,1.0,"Great guy, and the tests are really easy if you show up to lecture and pay attention.  One of my favorite professors I've had at Bucknell, and you can tell he truly cares about the students performing well and understanding the material.  His tests are long, but overall he is pretty understanding when it comes to finishing them on time."
189,2060383,3.5,2.0,"He loves what he does and is VERY enthusiastic, which keeps class interesting. Sometimes he is slightly unclear/goes off on tangents, but it's pretty easy to decipher what is/isn't important. He most likely will not know your name unless you go to office hours, which he loves you to come to (they're helpful too)."
190,2060383,4.0,4.0,His tests are very thought provoking and very minimal information to bs through so know the material when he teaches it. His powerpoints are not informative if you do not sit in the lecture. He's quirky and sweet. Literally willing to set time aside to just talk. Great guy!
191,2060383,1.0,4.0,"Nice person, but doesn't explain anything well. Expects you to figure it out yourself. Too fast in lectures. Will meet with you, but no change happens after meeting with him. Tells you things are super important (never on exam) and dismisses other things (90% of the time, it will be on the exam). "
192,1843298,1.0,1.0,Class was below average. Subpar. Not impressed. I worked hard and was not respected. 
193,1843298,5.0,4.0,"I loved his class. Participate and pay attention, and it will pay off. He is so passionate about what he teaches and is by far the best Spanish professor I have ever had. He is a tough grader and assigns a lot of work, but he wants you to succeed so the class is very rewarding. I learned so much with Blanco and would take his class again any day. "
194,1843298,5.0,2.0,Professor Blanco always made class as interesting as possible- there is a lot of busy work but if you go to class and participate the rest of it is easy
195,1843298,5.0,3.0,Best professor I have had at Bucknell. Truly cares about students and is so funny. Class was always fun.
196,1843298,5.0,2.0,Professor Blanco was probably one of the best professors I have had a Bucknell so far. He is not only caring but also hilarious in class. He keeps class light but you will learn a lot in this class. I would recommend him to anyone.
197,1843298,5.0,3.0,My favorite professor at Bucknell! He cares so much about all his students and is extremely engaging. Class is always exciting.
198,1843298,4.0,1.0,"He is such a nice man and cares about each student if he sees you putting in effort. You will need to participate at least once every class and he will pick on you, but it's ok if your answer isn't entirely correct. You'll definitely end up improving your spanish by the end of the semester. Definitely an easy grader. Best to be on his good side."
199,1843298,3.5,4.0,"Entertaining, but he assigns a lot of homework.  "
200,1843298,5.0,3.0,"Blanco is the best professor I've ever had. He is so funny, engaging, enthusiastic, and understanding. He really gets to know every student. I don't do the homework because it's mandatory (it's not- he never checks it), but rather because I'm genuinely interested in the material. He is a super fair grader and wants to see everyone succeed and learn"
201,1843298,5.0,3.0,"Complete homie, take his class."
202,1843298,4.5,3.0,Blanco is easily one of the best professors at Bucknell. Encourages office hours if you need help. Class is always fast-paced and interesting. 
203,1843298,3.5,4.0,"Blanco is awesome!!! Best professor I've had at Bucknell so far. Incredibly sweet, always smiling and he usually brings cookies to class. Class consists of watching movies and writing papers, occasionally presenting. Very reasonable workload"
204,1843298,4.0,1.0,Overall great professor and great guy. He's hilarious and the class is not hard at all. Hw is never mandatory.
205,1843298,4.5,2.0,Best teacher at Bucknell. Blanco is so engaging with his students and only wants the best for them. Be ready to speak spanish though because he will call on you in class. Pretty easy class if you understand spanish well. Overall I insist you take a class with him once!
206,2041959,5.0,4.0,Coolest professor ever
207,2041959,5.0,4.0,hella intellectual and feedback is limited. super interesting guy that can be appreciated from all sides of the political spectrum.
208,2041959,5.0,4.0,"Mehmet teaches it like no one else. The readings are tough, but you talk about the material in class and get a real sense of what theories are going on. Well worth the difficulty."
209,2041959,4.5,4.0,"Such an awesome professor. Definitely makes you work for an A-- a lot of reading, writing and discussion--but you'll get so much out of the class. He's really open to different opinions and interpretations, so long as he sees you're actually thinking about things. "
210,1843304,5.0,3.0,"I really loved his class, he is extremely passionate about the environment and did a great job making us view things from different perspectives. As long as you read and complete the coursework, you'll do very well. People in my class who complained about him didn't complete the readings and/or didn't care about the class. Amazing professor."
211,1843304,5.0,4.0,"My favorite professor at Bucknell. He is so interesting and I genuinely enjoy going to class. There are many readings and tests are challenging, but he is worth it."
212,1843304,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher who really loves what he does.  Definitely a great professor to get to know outside of class.  He highly values respect and participation, but is willing to do a lot to help you out."
213,1843304,2.0,3.0," Acts like hes a nice dude, but is picky and unfair. Takes points off for athletes who can't make it to class. Also takes points off if you're late, but expects you to stay five minutes after class ended everyday. "
214,1843304,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor! I loved taking this class and was impressed by the professor's genuine concern for the students to do well in the class. Clear and helpful.
215,1843304,5.0,2.0,Very interested in your learning and very clear of what he wants from you.  Nicest professor I've ever met by far and makes class very interesting.
216,1843304,5.0,2.0,"Amazing Professor! Outlines exactly what he wants from you in terms of readings, papers, and tests. One of the nicest people I have ever met - if you put any effort into his class, he will reciprocate it by putting effort into making sure that you do well!"
217,1843304,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor! Nicest man ever.  If you put effort into this class he can tell and really wants you to do well!
218,1378407,5.0,2.0,"He does a great job explaining this visually so they make sense.  It's difficult material to explain, but he gets it across well."
219,1378407,1.0,5.0,Learned a lot more in my High School Calc class.
220,1378407,1.5,5.0,I feel I recieved a better calc 1 education in high school and I was highly unsatisfied by the quality of his ability to instruct. he clearly knows math but not how to effectively teach it to others. I felt he was more focused on his own skills and doing math than teaching it.
221,1378407,4.0,3.0,"I thought Wang gave me a good experience in linear algebra.  He likes to prove stuff which is nice for math majors, and he always recapped where we were last lecture, which allowed you to keep up better.  Office hours are very helpful too.  He has an awkward constant smile and is, like all math profs, considerably quirky."
222,1378407,2.5,4.0,"He generally makes sense during class, but I found that the homeworks usually weren't on anything he actually discussed.  This made the class much harder than necessary."
223,1378407,4.0,3.0,He's a new professor and I had already taken calc1 before in high school but I have to say I did learn some new things. He explains a lot of things based on proofs. He didn't give much hw(about 5-6 problems a day) and we had quizzes about once a week and the tests got gradually harder. I liked him as a prof and he was helpful after class
224,1378407,3.0,5.0,"Hes very smart and passionate about what he teaches, yet he is way too difficult. We did complicated proofs for homework on a dailey basis and the tests were impossible. Prepare to spend 12 hours a week on homework and be totally stumped on tests if you take him."
225,2207856,4.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher, too bad she's leaving. She knows a lot about her field and is young so is very relatable."
226,534642,3.0,4.0,"Always tried to engage the class and almost instantly knew everyones name. Very tough grader with high expectations for all students, but if you engage with the material and him it can be enjoyable"
227,534642,5.0,4.0,"Literally my favorite Bucknell prof. Political theory was tough but the structure of the class was great and he brought the material to life in class, even when it was hard to understand in the readings. Made me change my major to poli sci. Highly highly recommend."
228,534642,2.5,3.0,"Definitely the worst political science professor at Bucknell.   His classes are futile and  not of lasting significance.  Although I did well in his Political Theory class, I hated every minute of it even though I tried to make the best of it.  He just simply doesn't have the compassion or the intimacy of other department professors."
229,534642,3.0,4.0,"Definitely a teacher that expects you to read. Passionate about the subject, and engages during lectures. Not afraid to call on someone that's not ready. Is always open to help, but not a class where you can get away with never reading or participating. Expects a lot from you, but I enjoyed him as a teacher. Also head of Polisci Department. "
230,534642,4.5,3.0,"Political Theory is an amazing class and I actually had a lot of fun during class. There are daily journals which don't even take long, pop quizzes which keep you honest, and tests that are pretty challenging. The readings are actually pretty interesting and you can always read spark-notes for a quick run down of what you read. Great lecturer. "
231,534642,3.5,4.0,"Learn a lot, knows what hes talking about, but tough. Daily Journals, pop quizzes, test not easy. Nice and insightful professor however"
232,534642,5.0,4.0,"Best Professor at Bucknell.  I have become close with many professors at Bucknell and Professor James is by far the most interested in you as a student and as a person.  I have taken all of the classes that he offers, I simply cannot say enough nice things about him.  You truly are an idiot if you dont take a class with him before you graduate!"
233,534642,5.0,4.0,Great Professor with sea of knowledge. He is very organized and structured with his arguments in class and loves to teach.The class itself is tough but if you do all the readings and ask questions during class you can definitely get an A. He gives pop quizzes on readings but they are usually super easy.Overall one of the best professors at Bucknell
234,534642,4.0,4.0,"A great professor. Knows what he is talking about and loves it. His class is not easy. You have to put a lot of effort into it. This includes reading, taking notes, and participating. If you want an easy A don't take this class. If you want to learn a lot about political theory from an expert, this is man for you. (P.S. he's funny...sometimes)"
235,534642,4.0,4.0,"Great professor with a good sense of humor. Knows what he is talking about and expects you to contribute to the discussion. Heavy amount of reading but it's not terrible. Class fairly simple and you can easily pass if you put the effort into it. He gives you everything you need to know, you just have to work to comprehend it. I would recommend him."
236,534642,4.5,4.0,"By far one of the best professors at Bucknell.  He isn't easy by any means, but if you do the work and show up to class you should do fine.  He is absolutely brilliant and has structured the course in a way that is impossible for anyone to not understand.  Take a class with him if you can!"
237,534642,4.0,5.0,"One of the best professors at Bucknell. Exceptionally engaging and intelligent. The readings are hard and dense, but if you do your work he'll definitely help you understand everything. Very fair grader, but definitely not a class for lazy people."
238,534642,4.5,5.0,"Great guy, knows his stuff. Reading load is extremely heavy, but material is interesting. Class involved four 8-10 page papers. ."
239,534642,4.0,5.0,"Hard class. Gives extremely long and boring readings. No break in the readings from day one until the end of the class. Course involves 4 8-10 page papers, which are frequently due the same day as the very long readings. Fair grader, but the class is a lot  of work, but interesting."
240,534642,4.5,4.0,"Political theory is not going to be an easy class, but if you like theory it's a TON of fun. The readings are pretty tough (and it definitely is noticable if you don't keep up on them) but he explains them really well and will answer any questions you have."
241,534642,4.0,3.0,"tall dark and handsome......(plus he knows quite a big of useful information and stimulates some good discussions, ya know- even with unwilling freshmen)"
242,534642,5.0,3.0,"By far one of the best professors here on Bucknell's Campus. Very articulate and well spoken in class. Challanging at times, and lots of reading, but he is able to take dry material and make it interesting. Very much recommended."
243,534642,5.0,2.0,Teaches some of the most interesting poli sci classes at Bucknell.  Makes lessons that could very well be boring really interesting.  He is one of the best professors who has taught some of my favorite classes at Bucknell.
244,534642,5.0,4.0,"Good class, but tough."
245,534642,5.0,5.0,"great class - it was such a relief to be studying theory, and studying with someone who made it fun and engaging.  take this class if you like to think."
246,534642,5.0,1.0,Very thoughtful and articulate. Assigns a great deal of readings that are only necessary to skim to a certain level in order to get a good grasp of the subject. If you are a good polysci student this should be an easy a.
247,534642,5.0,3.0,Very good teacher; picked intresting books to read and always provoked intresting discussions; a fair grader
248,534642,5.0,5.0,Prof. James is a tour de force!!
249,827508,4.5,4.0,"Kim is good professor, and certainly loves mechanisms and things that move. However, he is toughest grader I've had in my 3 years at Bucknell. In his own words, ""If you do all of the work, you'll receive an 85%. I don't like to give out A's"", and it's true. Class and labs are always interesting and hands-on. Avoid if you're not a serious student."
250,827508,5.0,3.0,Awesome prof! he teaches very well and has a lot of fun
251,827508,5.0,5.0,"Professor Kim is a Jedi Master of Mechanical Engineering and Design. At first I was disappointed because this class had nothing to do with operating a locomotive, but I grew to love it as I grew to love Professor Kim. Though not as good-looking as his brother, he is still a beautiful man. If you ever take this class ask him about the &quot;green pants.&quot;"
252,827508,5.0,2.0,"Good guy good prof, gets you interested in the material even if you werent.  As long as you are interested and not sleeping you will do fine lots of partial credit."
253,827508,3.0,3.0,"Not a bad prof. Tries to keep your attention. Cares about how he is doing, and will change things if you don't like the way he's teaching the class. Poor organization at first, but has gotten much better. Tests can be pretty tough, but if you actually do the reading, they become fairly easy."
254,827508,3.0,3.0,"Class is really boring and pretty tough.  Kim is a good guy, but not the greatest prof.  Sometimes he's fun and interesting but other times he's really tough and vague. At first there was no organization to the class...Had him this semester for Mech 392 and he was much better.  Exams are challenging...high C's to low B's are the average."
255,583799,4.0,4.0,"If you are interested in the topic/motivated she is an amazing professor. Her lectures can be easy to snooze through (which is great when youre tired), but participating/engaging makes all the difference in her class. Participate and do the reading in the first months and youll get an A. A+ professor I recommend to anyone willing to read"
256,583799,3.0,4.0,She is a caring teacher but her class is very boring. There is reading for homework for every class. Short papers are graded fairly easy but larger papers are graded much harder.
257,583799,3.0,4.0,Although Prof. McCready was a difficult teacher she was clear in her expectations and presentation of material. You must do all of the readings. I was a freshman in the class and it was very difficult but manageable. I felt like I learned a lot. She is not very helpful when you meet with her. I liked how she wrote notes on the white board.
258,583799,3.0,4.0,"Difficult class, very boring lectures. So much reading. Not the most difficult class ever but you must devote a lot of time to it."
259,583799,2.0,4.0,Nice lady. Terrible in class discussions... procrastinates to the actual point of the lesson. Her notes on the board are confusing and do not help at all. Do not take course.
260,583799,5.0,1.0,"Although it might have been the class I took her in, with mixed reviews going into class, I ended up really enjoying having her as a professor. Made sure to be clear and answer students' questions entirely.  Work load was very manageable, and a lot of opinionated writing.  Class were pretty boring but how many classes are exciting to go to."
261,583799,3.5,4.0,"readings, discussions, and papers (in that order, and repeat). the readings were interesting to me, but class discussions seemed to flat line (though i sort of sat by and watched rome burn, so to speak). she obviously has done great work selecting the books, but maybe the discussion format could run better. nice person and will help you."
262,583799,3.5,4.0,Not the best teacher but not nearly as bad as everyone makes her out to be. She can be tough but shes also very approachable and she'll help you with whatever you need.
263,583799,2.0,3.0,HORRID and HEINOUS... her class was terrible and pointless and too much work for a 200 level and if your interested in political science dont take it because it has nothing to do with political theory
264,583799,1.0,3.0,She sucks. Her class was boring and she never made anyone do any work. But then complained when no one did anything. Tried to screw me at the end of the semester
265,583799,4.5,3.0,"very nice and understanding! a lot of reading and a few papers, but she will gladly help you write the papers! very easy to talk to, and is always willing to extend deadlines. also, majority of class days were spent as discussions, not lectures."
266,2566266,5.0,2.0,Take her. She's such a great person. She treats you like an equal. This is my second class with her. I love her so much. She makes you laugh and enjoys unique questions. Will probably never say &quot;You are wrong&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; My favorite professor of all time. She likes to assign short readings and to have open discussions in class. Very minimal work.
267,2566266,5.0,4.0,"Take her. She's an awesome professor. Readings were admittedly a little dense for an intro class, but she was very patient with us and helped us individually as much as she could. Would take any of her courses again in a heartbeat."
268,2566266,5.0,3.0,"The class was really interesting. Professor Drake is great, very kind and understanding. The lectures are interesting and she tries to get the whole class involved which makes the lecture worth while."
269,983164,5.0,4.0,"Best professor around. His sweater vests and lisp are very endearing, plus he knows his stuff. His lectures are crystal, and as long as you do the problem sets thoroughly, the tests are easy. He's very helpful outside of class too. Take his class!!"
270,983164,4.5,3.0,"Absolutely amazing, highly recommended"
271,983164,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Clapp was great.  He takes the material slow enough so that you can follow along in class and really makes an effort to make sure that everyone is on the same page.  He gives you all the resources you need, you just have to use them.  I wish he had taught Biochem 2. I would be getting more out of that class if he taught it."
272,983164,4.5,3.0,No Comments
273,1931390,4.0,4.0,"Professor Bickel is a very kind professor who is always willing to help. This class is difficult though and can be picky with wording. However, the overall experience was very positive and full of understanding and learning moments."
274,1931390,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bickel spends a lot of time on students. Her lectures are clear and organized, and she spends a lot of time reviewing students' homework after the grader's grading. Homework is heavy, but the questions are helpful."
275,1931390,5.0,3.0,"Great prof, sums up almost each lecture with group work at the end of class on a worksheet. Had her for calc 3 and plan on taking linear algebra with her next semester."
276,1931390,5.0,3.0,"She is a great professor, and I was honored to be her student in calculus II. She is one of the most organized individuals I have seen in my life; therefore, her teaching is solid and consistent. She cares a lot about conveying the ideas, and she is smart (in other words, she knows how to convey ideas). I wish I can take her for calculus III."
277,1931390,4.0,1.0,"She is really helpful. Although she is new to the school, she is trying her best to teach everybody and make you understand, which she did a great job. Really encourage you to take her class"
278,1931390,5.0,1.0,Kelly is a very helpful person plus her friendly attitude toward any of the office hours.
279,1931390,5.0,1.0,"Professor Bickel is literally the best math professor I have ever had. Although she is new to Bucknell, she seems to be a very experienced professor. She is a reasonable grader that if you work, you will get a good grade."
280,1931390,2.5,4.0,"Bickel is a nice person, but not a great teacher. She reviewed Calc 1 material at the beginning and left many of us more confused than the first time we had learned it. Expect to do proofs for just about everything, and be tested on your ability to recite them in full. Not worthwhile to take her unless you plan on teaching yourself. "
281,2621570,1.0,4.0,"Professor Bove's lectures are extremely long and boring. Her assignments are very manageable, but it is common to get failing grades on them. Participation grade is an absolute joke, severely hurts your overall grade. Lots of lab group work. It is manageable but she is an unreasonably tough grader if the class is virtual. Not very considerate."
282,2621570,5.0,4.0,"Bove is an amazing teacher &amp; person. Her lectures can be very long &amp; the material is very complex, but she is always available for help &amp; cares a lot about her students &amp; their well-being. She is very flexible, considerate, &amp; compassionate &amp; only wants to see you succeed. Don't be fooled, the class is veryy hard but she makes it 1000 times better."
283,2621570,4.0,5.0,"Bove is super relatable, nice, and caring. She truly cares about her students mental health, and she does her best to lift your spirits when classes have got you down! Her lectures can be very fast-paced, which can be difficult, and she won't give you any answers to questions in office hours, but she's very accessible and an interesting professor!"
284,2621570,5.0,4.0,"Bove cares so much about her students and wants you succeed. It's not an easy A because you have to actually show up to class and be engaged since the material isn't simple. She's doing her best with teaching on zoom and is always willing to help/take feedback. She makes her expectations very clear, so as long as you put in effort you'll do well."
285,2621570,5.0,3.0,"One of the most relatable, intelligent, and coolest profs Ive ever had. Yes, she is a tough grader and expects a lot, but she always made it clear the point was to learn the material and not to get an A. If you put in the effort, you will do well. A great mentor who wants her students to succeed, and a strong advocate for DEI. The future of STEM."
286,2621570,1.0,3.0,"Never gonna take her class again. Honestly, this course is not that hard, but it is so common to get 50% or 0 in each assignment. All professors in neuro department are so much better than her. The way she grades participation is ridiculous. Her lecture never make sense. And you get nothing from this course."
287,1695878,1.0,4.0,"Avoid him at all costs. He is pompous and uncaring. Rather than trying to educate or help students his goal is to trip you up, make you fail or put roadblocks in your way."
288,1695878,1.0,5.0,God help him.
289,1695878,1.0,5.0,"one-way ""communicator""; relies on cut and pasted redundancies; invents criteria haphazardly; content irrelevant to assigned tasks; imperious; vain"
290,1695878,4.0,4.0,"Lots of reading, but this is a graduate course. Gives lots of feedback on papers which helped me improve my writing skills in just one semester. At first thought it was egocentric to require students to read his own publications, but eventually realized that he is an expert in his field and he has the the best and most cited works in the field."
291,1695878,1.0,5.0,"he is very hard, and he grades VERY hard! When a professor such has himself writes the material he is teaching and then grades it he is very critical and judgemental. I do not recommend him."
292,747664,4.0,4.0,"I was frightened of econ until I had him.  He's enthusiastic and he loves it when kids show the same level of enthusiasm.  Tells you how to do well on the first day: classes were mostly current events based and tests were challenging, but not impossible.  The man let us watch the South Park Financial Crisis episode for 15 minutes of class one day!"
293,747664,1.0,5.0,"lectures are so boring, i want to fall asleep & they don't have anything to do w/ the reading. tests are hard. tough grader, takes random points off. very opinionated. TEXTBOOK IS YOUR BEST FRIEND. don't take this class, you could prob learn everything yourself by just reading the txtbk. i took AP econ, so i thought this class would be easy, WRONG!"
294,747664,1.0,4.0,"Steve Stamos....how can i describe my econ 103 experience with him....i started excited to learn! i read all these reviews below and thought, hey hes good. NO. he does not explain anything or care about anyone. He doesnt care about you or your opinions. he just tells you &quot;YOUR LIFE WILL SUCK BC ECONOMY SUCKS&quot; and you move on. Tests=hard. DONT DO IT"
295,747664,5.0,3.0,"I love this professor. Jolly professor, talks a bit much but it so involved and passionate about what he teaches and does that it keeps you very interested and involved as well. Learned so much, and I cant wait to take another one of his classes!"
296,747664,4.0,3.0,Possibly the best professor one could have.  He knows a lot and makes sure you know the material.  Doesn't take a lot of crap but makes the learning experience so worthwhile.  A professor everyone must have.
297,747664,5.0,2.0,"Amazing teacher. Very very interesting guy. You'll learn tons of interesting things about how the world works. He has travelled and done it all...and his experience shows. There is a lot of reading, but no essays (unlike other econ103 teachers) and his tests are pretty easy if you are competent."
298,747664,4.0,3.0,i was mildly interested in econ..now i think im going to major it. you should take this class if your into the world perspective on things.
299,747664,1.0,4.0,I want to fall asleep every class. His tests are difficult and he doesn't come across very friendly. His lectures can be interesting but only for about 10 minutes.
300,747664,5.0,2.0,One of those geniuses who has done it all and knows at least a little about everything.  Still a normal guy who isn't &quot;too smart for his own good.&quot;  Challenges you how to learn and gives you a new perspective on everything.  MUST TAKE!
301,2091154,5.0,3.0,He is always there for the students. Great teacher. I'm not a Physics major but enjoyed the class.
302,2091154,5.0,3.0,Great course.
303,2091154,4.0,3.0,"Deepak was super accessible and nice, would definitely take again but I'm not gonna take any physics classes. You should put in the work so you're able to participate and get those points, but not required."
304,2091154,5.0,3.0,Great course.  Dedicated professor that retains his individuality and captures attention. Enjoyed the course. Highly recommend.
305,2091154,2.0,5.0,"Avoid this course at all costs.  300 characters cannot describe the hardship experienced in one semester.   If you do not have a physics background; you will fail.  Absurd homework assignments; with even more convoluted grading system!  Tests are impossible to study for because there is no textbook for the course.  Great idea, huh?"
306,2091154,4.5,2.0,"I would definitely recommend the class. It was overwhelming for some of us and he is a tough grader but the quality of the lectures were good. Though the course is open to students from all backgrounds, I would recommend it to those with a genuine liking for the field."
307,2091154,5.0,2.0,Cool Dude - a sincere and passionate teacher with genuine interest in imparting knowledge without any personal agenda. Aren't all physics dudes super cool!
308,2091154,5.0,3.0,Love Prof. Deepak. He knows what he talks and most importantly explains in a way that makes it easy for students from diverse backgrounds to follow the subject. Great prof!
309,2091154,5.0,1.0,Very helpful professor with genuine care for students. He did not fake an interest like many other professors did. Genuinely nice and knows his stuff well enough to understand students' lack of understanding and explain it to them!
310,2091154,5.0,1.0,"I think he is a great professor. I had a great experience being part of the class. He takes time to explain matters and is a very easy going, down to earth kind of professor. Not a partying kind of professor but one that I would look forward to have as a mentor. Doing the essays were fun from my perspective.  A very grad school type of professor!"
311,2091154,5.0,1.0,Awesome guy. Easy to approach. Has a strong understanding of the subject and puts in across in an easy to understand fashion. Very inspiring for science and non science students equally. Those who take the course only for the grades might find it difficult but for those who love the subject can't ask for better.
312,2091154,1.0,5.0,"If you have the opportunity to take Baby Bio or Geology take that instead for your lab credit! This class is awful, so much work that he grades on the last day of the semester, so everyone found out they failed a week before the final. Labs take 4 hours, you write stupid 1500-2000 word essays, and HW everyday. Beware! Take something else, trust me!"
313,2474139,5.0,2.0,Professor Lira is one of the best professors I've ever had. I looked forward to going to his class and would definitely recommend taking one of his if you need to take a language. 
314,2474139,5.0,2.0,Amazing Professor and is so caring and the most genuine and understanding Professor Ive had. If you need extra time submitting something or need to skip class he is understanding if you talk to him. Be ready for take home essays that are your test grades! But if you get below a 95 he lets you redo it!!!!
315,2474139,5.0,2.0,"I just love Professor Lira. I've had him for two classes and he is simply the best. So relatable, so genial, he feels like a friend more than a professor. He's very passionate about what he teaches and that makes it super engaging. Best person!"
316,2474139,5.0,2.0,Very caring professor. Understanding about outside life circumstances. Wants you to understand the material and do well in the class.
317,2367649,5.0,2.0,Congdon is one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell. She's one of the very few professors who know how to teach you rigorously without stressing you out. I wish that many other professors employed the methods she uses while teaching in their classes. I would definitely take her again.
318,2367649,4.0,3.0,The best! Really wants to help her students understand &amp; do well. She does amazing in-class examples and demos to connect the material to real world things. Really knows how to convey material clearly to students. She's great at what she's doing &amp; very clear! Also a caring &amp; understanding person. She even brought us snacks sometimes!
319,1493159,5.0,3.0,the kindest woman ever. basic class where if you try in your writings and if you act like you care you won't have a problem with her at all. classes very interactive and group leadings and movies and articles
320,1493159,5.0,3.0,"Prof Fruja is wonderful person and professor. I really enjoyed this discussion-based writing course. She cares about her students so much, and I found the classes to be very enjoyable. I didn't know much on the subject, but I felt as though she created a safe, warm environment that allowed you to comfortably share your opinion. Highly recommend!"
321,1493159,2.0,4.0,"Compared to the other Educ 101 professors, she is one who doesn't give every student an A. Had to work my ass off to get an A- while other professors give out 100% on essays for turning it in on time. Take another Professor if you have the chance."
322,1493159,3.5,2.0,"Very kind professor! She may not always be clear with what she wants, but is an easy grader and very understanding."
323,1493159,4.5,3.0,"Professor Fruja is one of my favorite professors on campus.  While I was lucky to have taken the class with a group of students who were academically engaged and diverse but open in their thoughts and opinions, Fruja did an excellent job of creating a very open and welcoming atmosphere.  I truly learned a wealth of information."
324,1493159,4.0,1.0,"While I found the subject and her material to be incredibly interesting, the way she taught really didn't elicit much participation out of the students, which made it boring. Her grading was so easy to the point where it made me uninterested and unwilling to try."
325,1493159,4.0,3.0,Very nice teacher but tough grader.
326,1493159,2.5,4.0,Stay away from this class. Grading is wildly inconsistent and requirements for assignments are unclear. Grading on major assignments is out of 10 points so one negative mark can cost you a whole letter grade.
327,1493159,5.0,2.0,"One of the BEST professors at Bucknell! Such a nice, caring woman! Always willing to motivate and help you succeed even if you aren't an education major. Her classes are must takes!"
328,370857,1.0,4.0,"Very verbose. Will talk for 49 min of a 50 min class, without coming up for air. If you have something to share with the class, it will be a moot point by the time he calls on you. His directions are unclear and asking for clarification makes him angry. Assigns exorbitant amounts of reading and doesn't say which to do for each class."
329,370857,3.5,2.0,He loves to talk...You dont really have to listen if you dont want to. Just do what he tells you to do on your papers and youll be fine. He's British so the accent is funny at first but it gets old quickly. Be prepared for him to go off on random tangents.
330,370857,4.5,2.0,"he is very helpful in improving your papers, and then grades them fairly easily. he's tough, you have to pay attention (its hard, he rambles - BADLY), but it pays off in the end."
331,370857,3.5,2.0,"He just rambles and rambles, and you will have no idea what the heck he is talking about.  Then you will write your draft, he will tell you that you're wrong, but tell you how to fix it, and then you'll revise it an get an A."
332,370857,5.0,3.0,"he's quirky, but he's friendly and helpful. he expects you to take initiative with your work. his knowledge of his field is amazing. be prepared to work."
333,503977,2.5,4.0,"Jordi is a great guy but don't take his class.  He's not organized and assigns a lot of frivolous work.  Plus it is a writing intensive class, with 3 major papers plus weekly blog posts and written homework.  Overall I found the class to be frustrating."
334,503977,1.0,5.0,"Awful professor, unless you are a fan of having your time wasted do not take this guys class"
335,503977,4.5,3.0,Business Govt Society is one of the most enlightening and interesting classes Bucknell has to offer. Professor Comas does a fantastic job.
336,503977,3.0,2.0,Changing Organizations (Fall 2009).  The small class size and interactive format was appealing in that it created an intimate community where we got to know one another.  A great field trip to Cowan to learn teambuilding exercises was really cool.
337,503977,1.5,5.0,nice professor who will try to help you but really is very tough to understand and is an extremely hard teacher and hard grader. He loves the subject but it goes way over eveyone else's head. Do not take unless you are very smart and can analyze graphs
338,503977,1.0,4.0,"WORST professor at bucknell.  he's not prepared for class, he's a very hard grader, and he's completely disheveled all the time.  i would NEVER recommend him or his classes to anyone."
339,503977,5.0,1.0,Such a great professor!
340,503977,2.5,3.0,"Not the most organized teacher, but a good guy. He really cares about what you have to say. Isn't anal about sticking to course material all the time, so if you bring up an interesting subject he'll talk about it! GOod professor"
341,503977,1.5,3.0,One of the worst professors at Bucknell. Is useless when it comes to teaching. I would not recommend him for any course here.
342,503977,1.0,2.0,Horrible
343,503977,4.5,3.0,"JORDI IS THE MAN.  HIS GRADING IS CLEAR AND CONCISE AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS.  Class was 3 hours straight, but he made it interesting and values students opinions."
344,2420907,1.0,5.0,Hard
345,2420907,1.0,5.0,"This is genuinely the hardest class I've taken at Bucknell. The class sizes are small, the entire grade is made of tests and homework. The homework is near impossible along with the tests. He's too smart for his own good and the only way to pass is if you are equally as smart as him. Expects you to do homework early and go to office hours every day"
346,1226924,5.0,2.0,"The semester long group project was a lot of work, but you really do learn a ton. Tests aren't to hard if you study, since she reviews the material beforehand. She was very helpful and knowledgeable. She likes talking and engaging with her class and telling funny personal stories."
347,1226924,1.5,2.0,This class should not have been taught by her. She had no idea what she was teaching and easily picked favorites in class. The material was easy but she did not have any idea how to teach it. The project was pointless and needlessly time consuming. Do not take this class if you have trouble staying awake.
348,1226924,4.0,2.0,"Nice lady but can come across as condescending if you don't say exactly what she is thinking.  Material is extremely dull, but tests are easy, especially if you attend the review sessions.  Semester-long group project is a pain.  Take this class if you don't mind suffering through boring material in exchange for an A."
349,1226924,4.5,1.0,Class was a bit boring and unnecessary since the tests come almost directly from the text. Very nice lady and if you show an interest in the material she'll love you.  Attendance is mandatory which is hard because the class is somewhat pointless.  Group project was easy and almost everyone gets an A on it. I actually learned a lot of useful stuff.
350,1226924,5.0,1.0,"Classes may be a little boring, but easy class. She is extremely helpful with the tests and group paper. I am willing to take another class with her"
351,1226924,4.0,2.0,"Great lady.  She's an expert in information systems, and her experience makes her a great teacher.  She's really quirky, and a really big nerd.  Her only fault is that she's a pushover, and is WAY too lenient with grades.  Not a difficult class, and she doesn't grade strictly at all."
352,1226924,4.0,2.0,"i loved this class. the material was interesting because it is about stuff you use everyday, but never knew it was an information system. the tests were a little hard but if you keep up with the material you should do fine."
353,1226924,2.5,4.0,"The group project for this class was painful. The material itself was dull at best, and the tests were absurdly subjective. Do yourself a favor, and take an easier tech elective."
354,1226924,1.5,3.0,terrible terrible terrible experience. easily the worst professor/class ive had to date. horrible grading system and basically incoherent. huge waste of time.
355,2683055,3.0,5.0,"Orgo 2 is a brutal, beast of a course. Arslan is a good professor and conveys info clearly, but is minimally helpful outside of class. Still the hardest class I have taken at Bucknell, but with Arslan difficulties with the professor will not be an added hurdle."
356,2683055,4.0,4.0,"For a difficult course, he makes his expectations very clear. His exams are fair, but class is test heavy. He also gives a good amount of extra credit. However he doesn't always answer your questions, and he can sometimes assume we know a lot more than we actually do. Overall though, I would recommend because you do end up learning a lot from him."
357,2683055,5.0,3.0,Solid
358,2683055,4.0,4.0,"He's a nice guy who does his best with this challenging material. He provides you with a lot of resources for success and is usually really quick about answering questions you have while studying outside of class. I recommend taking him, as he does seem to genuinely care about your success and is also interested in the material."
359,2683055,4.0,4.0,overall a great guy; most people who have taken his class stick with him for the next couple of chem levels too. definitely do the worksheets he gives out and don't just look at the key for answersthey help a lot with tests
360,753839,5.0,3.0,great teacher.
361,753839,5.0,3.0,"Laid back, easygoing guy who really enjoys history, great class."
362,753839,4.0,3.0,"Incredibly intelligent! Really knows his stuff. Grading can be a little confusing but fair. Very appraochable and willing to help if something isn't clear. Boy can he talk! He talks pretty much the entire hour which can sometimes make it hard to stay awake:D In general, 132 is a good course and Bourg is a great guy!"
363,753839,4.0,4.0,No Comments
364,753839,4.5,3.0,"BIG BIG TALKER.  Lectures most of class, but is a very clear in his explanations.  Can get talking little to fast.  It can be difficult to remember and take notes from what is said.  Grades fair.  Very nice funny guy.  Great in office hours."
365,2314417,3.0,3.0,"Professor Dupont definitely cares about her students' success and wants to help you. She gives a lot of reading and writing work but it's not without reason, it's to make you a better French student. She is also helpful in office hours and very encouraging. I think she is a solid choice if you want to become a better speaker and writer."
366,2314417,1.0,4.0,I was an intended French major. Emphasis on was until I took her class. She boringly taught off the slides copied from a wikipedia page and complained to a bunch of student athletes how busy she was while teaching 1 class. She's a nice lady but is not helpful when you go see her and grades much harsher than anyone else in the higher lvl Frenches.
367,49330,4.0,3.0,"Pros: Good selection of readings that are straightforward, lectures are mostly interesting to sit through, she answers questions well Cons: In class exercises can be downright monotonous (sometimes has students read out loud a reading going paragraph by paragraph for the entire class time without any discussion)"
368,49330,4.5,3.0,"One of the best teachers Ive had at Bucknell. Your going to have to read a lot and put effort into the class, but she's such a great teacher that if you listen to her lectures and do the homework you'll get a good grade. She is one of the best, most interesting professors you'll meet at this school. "
369,49330,5.0,2.0,Janet is awesome.  She's extremely well-versed in her subject material and is a great lecturer.  Pushes her students to delve deeper into the works of study.  Quizzes and tests aren't difficult if you do the readings and study ahead of time.  It is important to keep up with the readings.  An awesome professor!
370,49330,5.0,3.0,"Archaeology of Rome is a great class.  Be prepared to do the readings, at least before the test. Write down everything she says and you'll be golden. She loves what she does and it shows--although slideshows can be a little dry, she has funny stories and is awesome. I would take her for any class she offers!"
371,49330,5.0,2.0,"Super helpful and nice.  Tests were easy, as were quizzes, and she was very helpful on the final essay.  She told you after the rough draft what grade you would get if that were the final draft, and told you what to improve.  Very caring and nice, and will help you if you have any problems."
372,49330,5.0,3.0,"Sooo nice. Mostly lecture with powerpoints. Isn't a hard grader but had weekly quizzes and two essay responses a week. She was a VERY fair grader though and wanted everyone to do well. Her tests were fair and had helpful feedback for our final essays. I would take her again. Visit her after class, she is incredibly kind and has interesting stories."
373,49330,4.5,2.0,"LOVE Janet- she is very interesting, intelligent, and easy to talk to. The class required a good deal of reading, but was manageable. I consider Janet to be a fair grader, and was always flexible with deadlines and allowed revisions on essays. Best foundation seminar ever!"
374,49330,5.0,3.0,"Prof Jones is just a super nice professor.  She doesn't begrudge those who don't work, and if you do work and enjoy the material, she'll be a good friend of yours and a helpful professor.  Reading is essential, but she's a classics professor, so that's obvious.  Tests are straightforward and she told us what to correct to get As on the final paper."
375,49330,4.0,2.0,"Loves what she teaches, will ramble on, and then always feel bad about not engaging the class in more discussion. Great professor."
376,49330,2.0,4.0,for a foundation seminar it was kind of tough...lots of reading to be done. very subjective.
377,49330,3.0,1.0,"Very nice professor, but often confusing during class. Powerpoints were all over the place some days. But if you learned the material, you were fine on tests."
378,49330,4.0,3.0,she loves what she does. often goes on tangents but definitely entertaining even if the slideshows are a bit too much to handle.
379,49330,1.5,3.0,have to read everything unless you will be screwed for her tests
380,49330,5.0,3.0,Great Prof!  Love her!
381,49330,4.0,3.0,just a very nice professor
382,49330,5.0,3.0,No Comments
383,49330,4.0,3.0,"The slide show projections were boring, especially after lunch, but overall she was helpful and knew her material"
384,753845,3.5,3.0,"Professor Swan is super chill. You don't really participate in class but his powerpoints are helpful and somewhat interesting. He will throw in ""funny"" YouTube videos at least twice a class. He gives you worksheets in class to prepare you for tests. Tests straightforward/he will always tell you exactly what is going to be on it. Easiest labs ever."
385,753845,3.5,4.0,"Has an odd sense of humor, but is very funny. Class is a bit boring, but he is a really nice guy. Somewhat of a hard grader. Can be manipulated."
386,753845,5.0,3.0,"Nice Guy, he's very helpful"
387,753845,3.0,3.0,solid class if you need a lab.  I found the exams very easy but I am a science person.  Those who hated Chem in high school will not like this class but will benefit from the fact he tries to tone down the math
388,753845,4.0,1.0,"He's a really nice guy with very very dry humor.  He will help you if you ask, I actually learned most of Ochem during my lab sessions with him.  He doesn't make lab more complicated than it needs to be, but you get all the necessary skills."
389,753845,3.5,2.0,"Barely did any work in his class,so easy sometimes a little dry and boring. goes off topic alot on little things that arent going to be on the test, just to make it &quot;interesting&quot;. no lab reports and they last like 1 hour each. not helpful if you go to him. expects you to explain it to him and that will help you. dont worry you wont need help neway"
390,753845,2.5,4.0,"Nice guy, hard to understand sometimes and can get confusing in explanations.  Tests dont always reflect what is emphasized in class.  Need to know everything from text."
391,2425014,4.0,2.0,Love Professor Williams! She is so sweet and really knows her stuff. Some of the concepts and material can be tricky but she makes iy so much easier to understand. If you show up and try you're guaranteed to get an A.
392,508088,5.0,3.0,Legend
393,508088,4.5,2.0,One of the best professors here at Bucknell.  Expects a lot from students but why shouldn't he if you made the decision to take the class.  Getting an A- or higher is very possible
394,508088,5.0,4.0,a gold mine of knowledge
395,508088,2.0,5.0,"Very interesting guy. The class was tough, a lot of readings and work to do. Two 3-hr group presentations and a final and midterm. He's pretty unclear about his expectations for anything, so you have to feel it out. He wants deep insight, not just lots of participation  so you have to know your stuff. This class gives you a new perspective, though."
396,508088,3.0,2.0,"Gruver is a good guy. At times he is very fastidious. His grading is odd and messed up. However, he presents some interesting information and ideas."
397,508088,5.0,4.0,"After taking three classes with Gruver, it is easily said that he is he most intelligent and best professor at Bucknell, bar none!  His classes provoke intelligent thought and discourse.  His knowledge of the subject matter in addition to his overall brilliance is unmatched by anyone else in his department or the school."
398,508088,5.0,3.0,"Smartest professor at Bucknell...he's tough, but very worth it.  I highly reccommend any class with him"
399,1845432,5.0,2.0,"Frankly, the man kills it. He makes is fun to go to class everyday and does an excellent job of explaining difficult material. I don't think I've ever laughed in a class as much as I have in his. He also tries to find real world applications of everything you learn so expect a short youtube video at the end of every class."
400,753853,4.0,4.0,"High energy, keeps class moving.  His ego is out of control but otherwise a pretty good class."
401,753853,4.5,2.0,Good guy and is willing to help.
402,753853,4.0,3.0,"He's a really fun professor and teaches with a lot of enthusiasm. But if you ask him a question, be patient, it takes him a while to get to the point sometimes. Tests are pretty straight forward if you have done the assignments, but home work assignments are challenging. An overall great prof."
403,2119881,5.0,4.0,I don't think there is a better human being on Earth! Too bad he is leaving Bucknell. He is the best in the chemistry department at Bucknell. I want to learn more and more orgo from him. Cares about his students and wants them to do well! Very clear lecturer. Understands college students very well!
404,2119881,5.0,3.0,"Had him for orgo 1 and 2 and I am so sad he is leaving bucknell. He is literally amazing and I would not have gotten through orgo in another professors class. He makes corny jokes and is a very caring person! If you have the chance to take him at his new job, take him!"
405,2119881,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Baggett has honestly made my first-year experience so much better. Not only does he have a deep passion for the material, he also has a passion for teaching. He tries to connect with all of his students, throw in jokes, and make organic chemistry as clear as possible. He is beyond fair. Only wish I could have him again!"
406,2119881,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, really understands and knows how to teach the material."
407,2119881,5.0,5.0,"I can't imagine taking organic with any other professor!  Baggett has to be one of my favorite professors of all time.  It's so hard to make such a difficult topic fun, but he does!  He really wants everyone to succeed, so his tests and quizzes aren't too bad and he grades fairly.  His chem jokes are also spot on!"
408,2119881,5.0,4.0,Professor Baggett is a great teacher who cares a lot about his students. He wants everyone to succeed and  will work hard to help you understand the material. It's super refreshing to have a young and funny teacher like him!
409,2119881,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Class was enjoyable and fun. Not to mention, Baggett is an amazing human and is a bit awkward which makes him the ideal professor. He makes all students feel accepted and is more than willing to help. Go to his office hours, you can earn back points! Amazing... would take again!"
410,2119881,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I've had at Bucknell. Willing to meet with you outside of class and helps you understand the material thoroughly. Great lecturer!
411,2119881,5.0,3.0,"Professor Baggett got me passionate about Organic Chemistry through his excitement about the material! He makes the best jokes in class! He is super helpful in recitation and office hours, while also being extremely effective and clear in lecture. If you do the worksheets, you should be fine for the exams. Favorite professor at Bucknell!"
412,2119881,5.0,2.0,"Professor Baggett is the sweetest! He likes to make corny jokes during lecture. He wants the students to do well, and has given points back on tests in office hours. He does not make homework mandatory, and he provides practice quizzes and lots of worksheets to prep for exams, and quizzes. He is a very nice person, and makes orgo easy to learn."
413,2119881,5.0,3.0,"Organic Chemistry is a hard course, but Professor Baggett is extremely knowledgable in Chemistry and knows exactly what he is talking about. He lectures in appropriate terminology, but will later break it down into simpler terms. He is extremely helpful during recitation and office hours. He is the best professor at Bucknell for OChem hands down."
414,2119881,4.5,2.0,"I had Baggett his first semester teaching at Bucknell.  Took accelerated gen chem with him.  He lectures well, is super helpful during recitation and outside of class.  He has a good sense of humor and is personable.  Tests are not super hard.  Pay attention during class and you will be fine."
415,2119881,4.0,1.0,"Easy Grader, Exams arent bad, he tells you what to study for, Labs are easy."
416,1992907,4.5,2.0,Prof Johnson is cake. Few homework assignments over the semester and the tests are 10-15 short answers which he goes over the days leading up to the exam. Really nice guy and interesting class with an A at the end.
417,1992907,5.0,2.0,"Johnson is one of my favorite teachers I've had at Bucknell.  He truly cares about the students and how well they dounderstand the material, and gives more than reasonable exams (although there are 6 of them).  I would love taking him again---he's the man"
418,1992909,5.0,1.0,"Really helpful, caring teacher who wants the best for her students.  Likes her job, and makes exams very fair.  Easy to get an A if you put in the work."
419,628952,5.0,4.0,I'm am not sure if this is the correct section but I took Mr. Hunter's Humanities 100 class and absolutely loved it. I have come across few teachers who are as into their material as he is and it really shows. He brings energy to his classes and he doesn't ask for a whole lot as long as you show up to class ready to share your ideas.
420,628952,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hunter's passion for the subjects he teaches is intoxicating. This class was super interesting and he kept us engaged the entire semester. Although there was lots of reading, he was realistic about his expectations."
421,628952,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hunter's passion for his subject is contagious! One of my all time favorite professors. Cares so much about his students, but most importantly cares about challenging them. Truly wants his students to get as much out of the course as possible."
422,628952,4.0,3.0,"Awesome prof and person. Cares about his students and will sit and talk with you in his office about whatever, related to class or if you just have questions about his work. Highly recommend taking a class with him, he challenges you the exact right amount. "
423,628952,4.5,4.0,"Very fun, very intelligent, extremely helpful. I had computer problems midway through a semester with him, he set me a completely new deadline for a paper because of it. He wants the best for his students and will do anything he can to help."
424,628952,5.0,4.0,"Professor Hunter is perhaps one of the best professors I have ever had. He is equal parts kooky and intelligent, and he almost perfectly fits the stereotype of the eccentric professor.  Not only has being in his class improved my academic ability, my life is that much richer because he is in it. Do everything within your power to get in his class."
425,628952,3.0,4.0,Lots of reading. Usually about 125 pages a week. Class is interesting and he expects everyone to be able to discuss the reading.
426,628952,5.0,4.0,"One of favorite teachers thus far! Hunter is definitely brilliant, and always leads an interesting conversation in class, without relying too much on his own dogma. He expects a lot on his papers, but really taught me how to analyze. Keep up with the readings, attend common hour, ask questions and go to office hours! The work will pay off."
427,628952,4.5,4.0,Great professor who has fascinating ideas and truly cares about his students.  He is a tough grader but he will help you anytime you ask.  You can't BS on papers though but he will improve your analysis.  The way he runs seminar is amazing and everyone contributes because the info is current and makes you really think.
428,628952,4.0,5.0,He is a perfectionists and shall never give one an A on a paper.  He expects the students to have a Ph.D themselves for the level of writing he requires.  Don't take a writing class with him.  On the bright side he has some interesting ideas.
429,628952,5.0,3.0,"John is a wonderful professor and, if it's possible, an even better person. He's challenging, engaging, judicious, and one of the most genuine, kind professors I've had at Bucknell. He takes a real interest in his students and goes out of his way to enhance their educational experience. He's an absolute joy to be around, and his accent is awesome."
430,628952,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hunter is awesome.  His lectures are interesting, and he is a very charismatic guy.  I would often times stop by his office (outside of office hours), and he would be willing to discuss anything with me.  Not only is he one of the best professors at Bucknell, but HUMN 150 was a great course as well."
431,628952,4.5,3.0,"Professor Hunter is amazing. His courses are very reading intensive, but class discussions are interesting, and he is always available to help."
432,628952,5.0,3.0,"Really good guy, good teacher too. He's funny and inspiring. I like his earring"
433,628952,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hunter is a great prof. Very intune with his students and their level of interest. If he sees a lack of interest he will recommend another topic for discussion. But, come to class prepared with the readings because his teachings are primarily discussion based. Never gives tests, just writing assignments."
434,1558747,5.0,2.0,"Working with Writers was my favorite class the semester I took it. Probably the one I learned the most from. UNIV 239 is a lot of fun and the labor-based grading means you know exactly where you stand. Not having to be afraid for a grade makes turning in the three big papes (one paper, two revisions) a lot less stressful. Lots of good discussions."
435,1558747,4.5,1.0,"Had her for Working With Writers. Extremely nice, and helpful. Subject material is interesting enough and she leads a good discussion. Quirky. Keep in mind, however, although this is an A she will assign an exorbitant amount of busy work, and will send you a handful of emails a day. Enjoyed her class, with the occasional frustrations"
436,2834652,1.0,2.0,"Alan Cheville is the most out of touch professor I've ever met. He has no real world experience, but teaches very confidently about the design process, and nothing that he designed actually worked. He will do no grading until the end of the semester, but that doesn't matter since he can adjust your score for professionalism by up to 50%."
437,1501406,3.0,4.0,professor orbison's lectures are mostly him doing problems on the board and you're expected to follow along and understand from that. rarely do we do problems individually or in small groups. if you like a lecture heavy class he's a good professor for that however if you are more of a learning by doing student this class will be a struggle
438,1501406,5.0,3.0,"Professor Orbison is the best professor Bucknell has to offer. He genuinely cares about every student and wants nothing more than to see them succeed. His lectures are truly mesmerizing; his knowledge of the material is unmatched and he can answer any question asked. Not only is he an amazing teacher, but he is incredibly interesting. Ask questions"
439,1501406,5.0,3.0,"Awesome lectures, keeps it interesting, makes sure everyone understands before moving on, always asks the class if they have any questions. "
440,1501406,5.0,3.0,"coolest teacher/advisor on campus, if you ever get the opportunity to have him for anything, do it"
441,2719969,4.0,3.0,Lots of room for extra credit and very helpful outside of class. A solid choice all around.
442,2719969,1.0,5.0,"She speeds through the lecture which makes it a very hard class with very vague questions on exams and quizzes. Also, doesn't really answer questions in class even though more than half the class is lost. Moreover, class is weighted heavily on exams and quizzes which we aren't able to view afterward."
443,2719969,1.0,5.0,"lecture heavy and doesnt spend time explaining the material she just blasts through problems so we dont know what we are actually doing. Only has 4 homeworks that are heavily weighted and always due right after an exam. Wont let you see old quizzes or tests, only allows 15 minute scheduled meetings for office hours or to go over quizzes/ exams."
444,2719969,1.0,4.0,"Very unclear on what she expects from her students. Doesn't answer any questions about material, almost always just tells you to look in the textbook. Hardest thing about her exams was the wording of the questions which she never clarified. Strong accent and very boring class. Assignments are on material we never once learned in class or in book."
445,1939683,4.5,3.0,Really intelligent professor. Funny and passionate about the material he presents during lectures. Tests are designed to be straight-forward.
446,1939683,4.5,2.0,"Was in his first american politics class... He did a great job making lectures entertaining, engaging, clear, and informative. Workload was fair and tests were pretty easy if you put in a moderate amount of effort. "
447,1939683,5.0,2.0,"He's new at this but he clearly cares.  He set expectations early on and followed through.  Overall, a good experience."
448,1939683,3.5,3.0,"Prof. Visalvanich is really intelligent and a very straightforward professor. If you go to him for help he will definitely give you clues to what will be on the tests (plus he gives out study sheets before exams). The amount of work is fair and manageable. Overall a great guy, I'd take the class again."
449,1712356,3.5,2.0,"His seminar was a bit boring, but easy if you put a bit of effort into the work. Boosts your grade."
450,1712356,4.5,4.0,Prof Cipoletti is a good prof. Class time's valuable.  You learn a lot in his labs too. If you're ready to work and put the time in he is too. He's very helpful. 
451,1712356,4.5,2.0,My favorite professor at Bucknell. He really cares about each student and is incredibly helpful one on one. Very enthusiastic about teaching. Course material is hard but he does a good job conveying it.
452,1712356,5.0,2.0,Super nice guy! always willing to help and very ver enthusiastic about teaching. Would absolutely recommend him.
453,1712356,1.0,5.0,Horrible and Condescending.
454,1712356,1.0,5.0,Definitely the worst teacher I've every had at Bucknell... doesn't even know what he's doing half the time. Condescending if you ask questions and are trying to learn more about a certain topic.
455,1712356,3.0,2.0,"Pretty bro. Willing to help you outside of class, conveys information pretty well. Tests are not overly difficult if you prepare. Would take a class with him again."
456,1712356,2.0,5.0,"He is a nice guy, and will help you if you have questions, but his teaching is fast, and he misses materials which he assigns in homework assignments. Also there is no specific textbook so all missed information is left for you to Google or try and find across the internet which can be challenging at times. (revised)"
457,1712356,2.5,5.0,"He is a nice guy, and will help you if you have questions, but his teaching is fast, and he misses materials which he assigns in homework assignments. Also there is no specific textbook so all missed information is left for you to Google or try and find across the internet which can be challenging at times."
458,1505508,5.0,4.0,"Good guy, really smart, has tons of real industry experience, and genuinely cares about students succeeding after graduation. 205 came up as the most important course that landed me my internship this summer. Down side? He tells dad jokes so consider yourself warned. Go in ready to work and you will learn a ton."
459,1505508,3.0,4.0,"This class is an unbelievable amount of work, with a flipped classroom style. Everyone is perpetually behind but he accepts work regardless of how late it is. He will answer any questions you have which is very nice. The exams are not too difficult."
460,1505508,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors I have ever had. Super smart. Knows how to structure a course to maximize the students' learning and preparedness for industry and for graduate school.
461,1505508,5.0,4.0,"He and Perrone are the two greatest assets to Bucknell's CS department. If you get a chance, make sure you take a class with both of them before you graduate. 205 is a lot of work but you learn more than almost any other CS class."
462,1505508,4.5,2.0,"He does a flipped class room. You listen to lectures at home and work in class. The tests are hard if you don't watch the lectures. He assigns A TON of work, but it's manageable if you get it done and work hard."
463,1505508,3.5,5.0,"Tests are impossible, and the workload is terrible. It's required for CS majors, just be prepared."
464,1505508,5.0,4.0,"Really chill and relaxing. A lot of work for the class, but he's very willing to help. I do feel that I learnt a lot after classes."
465,1505508,5.0,4.0,"I came into the course with no experience in Java and left feeling like I knew enough to either code anything, or at least know where to go for help coding anything. Very helpful"
466,1505508,5.0,4.0,"Holy balls, this is a new class, and it is a lot of work! But I must say, it was the best class I've had so far. Great class. Final project was fun! Excellent professor, with genuine interest in the material he is teaching. I left the class feeling like I learned a LOT."
467,1505508,5.0,2.0,He is really a nice guy. He know about his stuff and makes things very clear. His class is kind of boring but you could really learn a lot. He is very willing to help outside class too. I've decided a computer science major after taking his class.
468,1505508,5.0,3.0,"Just finished CSCI 203. I'm told the course is completely different than it used to be. It is a lot of work, but you learn a lot with this guy. He makes the material enjoyable. Funny guy too! Take it with him if you can."
469,1505508,2.0,5.0,"Impossible course. Not the same easy thing like Java. DO NOT TAKE! Especially if you have no background in computer science or working with the programming language python. Prof King is super nice and understanding, but class is ridiculous."
470,1505508,5.0,3.0,"Probably the best professor I've ever had here. King really know his stuff and is excellent at teaching it: he makes difficult concepts seem simple. I thought I knew Java going in and I learned at ton, it's now my best language thanks to him. All assignments are actually useful and I legit enjoyed them. Not too hard or easy. Take if possible."
471,1505508,4.5,5.0,"This was his first semester here. This guy is EXCELLENT. The class moves along pretty fast though. His midterm was fair, but long. I learned a lot, and I thought I knew Java very well before the class. Go to him for help. Easy to talk to."
472,927974,5.0,4.0,"He's the most knowledgeable professor I've had, but he is tough. He assigns really tough homeworks that force you to think a lot. Labs are close to impossible if you don't know what's going on and even then are tough. Tests require real prep with mistakes often being 5% no matter the error. Helpful in office hours if you know whats going on"
473,927974,5.0,3.0,"The best thing about Dr. Dave Kelley is his flow. He is also always available by HAM radio. He is the most professional man I have ever met. His lab reports are impossible but the rest of the class is fine. Dr. Kelley has an obscene reservoir of knowledge. I have yet to see him stumped by any questions, regardless of the topic of discussion."
474,927974,4.0,4.0,"Definitely one of the smartest and highly respected professors within the EE department. Wont find anyone smarter or more enthusiastic about engineering, particularly antennas. You will have to work for your grades but not terribly impossible. Expect thoughtful HW and will require some thinking"
475,927974,4.0,3.0,"Extremely interesested in electromagnetics, his favorite topic. His homeworks are hard, but if you do them and use the study material, his tests are easy. IF you dont try on hw or use study materials, this class is impossible. Overall, one of my favorite teachers at bucknell."
476,927974,3.0,4.0,"Lectures consist of one giant example problem that has nothing to do with the homework problems which were tediously long and difficult. Not helpful in lab. I dont know if he grades the lab reports or not, but you WILL lose a ridiculous amount of points for stupid things like formatting. Tests focus on tiny details in the material covered"
477,927974,3.0,4.0,"I'm not usually one to disagree with everyone else but maybe Kelley changed. He only taught ELEC 225 when I took it bust still put NO time into the class. He lectures without caring if anyone gets it, gives a ridic amount of work for a half-credit. very helpful during office hours though. I never used the textbook besides homework"
478,927974,5.0,3.0,Great Professor.  His teaching style is very affective and he is very clear.  His tests and quizes are challenging but definitely fair.  Study and do the Homework and you'll get an A.
479,927974,5.0,1.0,"awesome teacher. explains the material very well, and makes sure that everyone understands everything. also a very nice guy and easy to talk to. definitely take  this class and give him a big hug asap."
480,927974,4.0,3.0,"Overall, a nice guy and a pretty good professor. He's really straightforward with the lectures. He writes everything on the baord, so it's easy to take notes. And, his tests and labs aren't bad at all."
481,2363626,1.0,5.0,Not good a experience at all. 
482,2363626,1.0,5.0,"Difficult labs without any collaborations or communications with others, and they are time limiting. He would not give any useful instructions. You don't finish by the end of class, that is probably because you are dumb and your scores are gone. yeah"
483,2363626,4.0,4.0,"This class is difficult but as long as you demonstrate effort he will be kind. Homework is not to difficult and very manageable. Quizzes felt like too much for too little time, but that was because it was online."
484,2363626,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hass is a very nice guy and he is always willing to help. There were times where the material got a little more difficult, but if you ask him for help, you will get by just fine."
485,2363626,5.0,3.0,"He's a gem. Try, and you will succeed. 10/10 would take him again. Real good teacher."
486,2363626,5.0,3.0,"Granted, I had him for less than one semester, but that doesn't change the fact that his class can be easy if you put the time in. I went to office hours when I didn't know what to do, and bam I di well. I sorta had to carry my team project but that's college for you. He's a good guy, very down to earth and willing to help if you have questions."
487,2363626,1.0,2.0,"Horrible at engaging with the material he teaches or making his students excited to learn. He reads directly off the notes/ powerpoints he creates, which are then posted online anyway. Hass will not answer any student's question directly and instead will be condescending toward them. You will learn nothing in his class!!!! Avoid at all costs."
488,2363626,1.0,3.0,"Professor Hass is in no way bad at teaching the material, however, he has extremely high expectations and for a half-credit course required significantly more than any of my other four classes. He also takes off absurd amounts of points for the smallest things."
489,2363626,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Hass is definitely one of the most organized professors I have worked with. He goes through the lessons and the new ideas with a good pace in a very methodical and structured way. If you pay attention and take notes in class, homework and tests will be easy. He understands the ability of students very well and does not overload them."
490,2363626,5.0,3.0,Do the homework and you will pass the course. Prof clearly cares alot and is doing an excellent job
491,1886452,5.0,3.0,"Professor Cyr is a great choice and awesome person. Having taken calculus in high school, I did not have much difficulty with the material. He shoes you why concepts are true and shows how mathematicians derived them. He is super enthusiastic and loves what he teaches. Would 100% take him again!"
492,1886452,5.0,4.0,Had for Calc 2 and 3. Very good teacher but class is hard as all other calculus classes are. Very good choice as a teacher. Highly recommended.
493,1886452,5.0,3.0,"He is the man. One of the best math professor I've ever met. He gives super clear derivations, and his lectures cover everything you need to succeed the course. Fair amount of homework collected once a week. His exams are reasonable in difficulty."
494,1886452,4.0,4.0,"Anything you need is covered in lecture: he focuses very strongly on the derivation of things so that a) you understand why this works and b) anything derived in class is expected to be memory. Very smart, and is often willing to correct students to keep the class moving. Keeping up with notes and practice problems is the key to understanding here"
495,1886452,2.0,5.0,Very kind professor but not a great teacher. He leaves the class in the dust as he is too smart to realize how difficult things are for his students. He grades hard and does not curve.
496,1886452,5.0,4.0,"Lectures provide all the information needed to succeed in this class. Tests are meant to make you apply knowledge so you really have to know the material. Make sure to know how to do funky integrations as you will still be required to do them. However, if you cant he is good with partial credit."
497,1886452,3.0,5.0,"He is super nice and overall a great guy, but he often leaves the class completely confused. He fails to engage the class, and so it is easy to lose focus and not pay attention. No matter how much you study for the exams, you still won't receive the grade you hoped for."
498,1886452,1.0,5.0,He is patronizing and humiliating to those that ask questions in class.  His Exams are impossible.  He asked a question on one of the exams that not one person in the class got correct.   Someone should teach this guy how to teach.  Just because you have taken a lot of classes does not mean that you have any idea how to teach or create a valid test
499,1886452,5.0,3.0,"Professor Cyr is an awesome teacher. He's literally the man. Whenever I did anything wrong, he would help me rework the problem from the beginning so I could see where I went wrong. Definitely take him if you have the chance"
500,1886452,4.0,3.0,I really enjoy his teaching style. It is clear and he goes out of his way to ensure that everyone fully understands.
501,895225,5.0,2.0,BEST PROFESSOR AT BUCKNELL...so nice and knowledgeable.
502,895225,5.0,1.0,Fantastic teacher.  Really knows her stuff and cares about the success of her students.
503,895225,4.5,1.0,Honestly without question the most awesome professor/class that could possibly ever be dreamed up. I'm pretty sure she doesn't have it in her to give below an A- and actually while a smidge boring the subject matter is pretty interesting.  Highly recommended
504,895225,5.0,1.0,"this woman is the pinnacle of college professors. her class is really cool.  its so easy even a caveman could do it. seriously.  i suggest it, in a not ghey way."
505,2588931,4.0,3.0,"I took Italian 101, and she's a great professor. You need to be in class to keep pace with the course, and participation helps with learning the language. The assignments can pile up if you don't get on them, so keep up with them. Otherwise, she's caring and, if you genuinely want to learn the language, will be a great choice."
506,2588931,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite professors by far. She cares a lot about her students and wants them to succeed. Class is interesting and she allows for a good amount of peer discussion. She is a very reasonable grader, if you put in effort she acknowledges it. Wish I could take her again."
507,2588931,5.0,2.0,Love Prof. Dolasinski! Shes so sweet and always there for you for problems regarding class and problems not related to class. She makes lectures fun and interactive which really helps you learn the language. Theres not a lot of work and shes a really fair grader.
508,110852,5.0,2.0,"I have no clue what these recent poor reviews are talking about. Professor Evans is great. His lectures are interesting and he makes his grading criteria super clear. People on here are saying his exams are difficult but they are really not I promise, if you understand his slides you will do well on the exams. Just study and you will do well. "
509,110852,3.0,5.0,"Prof Evans is an amazing lecturer who clearly loves psychology and knows what he is talking about. However, this course is impossible. The exams are 75% of your grade and they are pretty difficult. You definitely have to put in a lot of work and time studying in order to do somewhat ok in this class. "
510,110852,1.0,5.0,"he is the worst professor I've ever had here. I was struggling in psych because the tests are impossible and so much more specific than his lectures, so I reached out to him, and he showed no interest at all or that he cared one bit. I will never be taking a class with him again it was the absolute worst. "
511,110852,5.0,3.0,"The class is test heavy (not many hw assignments), but Professor Evans makes everything easy to understand and the tests are fair. Interesting content, and his lectures are great! You have to get to class exactly on time or you can't come in, so the only reason I would say don't take this class is if it's at 8am and you sleep though your alarm."
512,110852,4.0,3.0,"Professor Evans is so captivating because of how much he loves the course material. Intro was lecture heavy, so attendance isn't mandatory, and if you miss you get notes from a classmate. He posts pwrpoints before exams which is really helpful. There is a textbook, but I haven't read since chapter 1 and Ive been fine."
513,110852,5.0,3.0,"I look forward to Prof. Evans lectures more than anything. He is an enthusiastic, knowledgeable speaker. The class is lecture heavy, but the time passes quickly since he is so entertaining. The tests are all multiple choice which is good and bad I guess. Also, he is Russel Crowes doppelg&auml;nger."
514,110852,4.0,2.0,"You will do good of you show up to class and take notes and study those notes. Very straight forward, doesn't try to trick you or anything on tests. Good to have intriguing conversations with. He doesn't tolerate lateness however so be on time!"
515,110852,5.0,4.0,"Class had by far the most engaging, interesting lectures. If you go to class, you can definitely do well on the exams. He is challenging but so engaging and would take his class again no matter my grade."
516,110852,5.0,2.0,"He always made the subject matter interesting to learn about even though it was more of a lecture class than a discussion class. He also really prepares you well for the exams so if you don't do well, it's kind of your own fault. Super enthusiastic about what he teaches!"
517,110852,4.0,3.0,psych 100 is boring but he did his best to make in interesting. He showed a lot of cool videos and had cool examples to get concepts across. His exams were literally straight from his Powerpoint slides so take good notes and study the power points. I got a B+ in the class
518,110852,4.5,3.0,"Best lecturer I've had at Bucknell in my two years so far.  Incredibly informed in field of study, an interesting lecturer and funny guy.  Made 8am class worth attending.  Exams were unusually difficult for intro psych, so studying is a must.  He is particular on essay questions.  Earning a B is not too difficult, but certainly not a GPA booster."
519,110852,5.0,4.0,"My favorite class! But no way that this is only memorizing. Lots of emphasis on critical thinking, and test rely heavy reliance on notes. Better go to class and study the notes."
520,110852,4.5,2.0,"Awesome class! The material was very interesting, including the guest lecturers and in-class movies. Evans has a great sense of humor, is pretty straight forward in lecture, and tests are super easy and based on straight up memorization."
521,110852,5.0,4.0,"I've taken him for intro, abnormal, and will be taking his biopsych course, as well as my applied lab with him. Excellent professor. He is passionate, interesting, engaging, funny, and he knows how to teach. One of the best teachers I've ever had. If you only have a couple psych classes to take, take them with him."
522,110852,4.0,3.0,"A very interesting and funny lecturer, sometimes changes pace with videos. I appreciated his emphasis on the clinical aspect of psychology. As far as grading goes, studying for tests is a MUST especially from the notes, and he is quite picky on the essay questions. Earning a B is not too terribly difficult."
523,110852,5.0,5.0,"An amazing professor!  he completely prepared me for grad school. everyone else in my program seems like lost sheep so far, but I feel ready and excited. Strong emphasis on critical analysis (obviously--it's bucknell!) and integrating ideas. class is absolutely taught on a grad school level. i can't thank evans and bucknell enough"
524,110852,2.5,5.0,really into what he teaches but impossible to do well on tests unless you can practically recite the text... it's really hard to enjoy the class and get into the material when the grading is so hard... nice guy but hardest grader ever!
525,110852,3.0,3.0,"He is very passionate about the subject and makes the material pretty clear.  That said, he treats this class like it is more advanced than it really is.  His exams and papers are graded unfairly, it seems like he (or maybe the TA) just doesn't like to give good grades.  He throws so many notes at you every class that missing one will set you back."
526,110852,4.0,4.0,"Awesome professor, he really cares about teaching students. He's enthusiastic and engages the student's well. He isn't afraid to get off topic a little bit for the purpose of learning. About 80% of the test material comes from notes, the rest from readings. Study for the tests!!"
527,110852,4.0,3.0,"He is really awesome. He is passionate and clearly very interested in his subject. Plus, his lectures are always interesting and really keep my attention- kind of hard to do for a 90 minute class. His tests are fair, but they can be impossible if you don't study!"
528,110852,5.0,3.0,He's very passionate about what he teaches...I never watch the clock in his class!  Plus he's super helpful and friendly...but you better know your stuff for his tests!!!
529,110852,5.0,4.0,"The most articulate, well-versed professor I have encountered in 6 years of being a student.  Learned a ton.  Highly recommended."
530,110852,4.5,2.0,"goes on tangents a lot, can be disorganized but the class overall is pretty straightforward"
531,110854,3.0,4.0,"This is the most work I've ever had to do for an intro class. We have to complete two written assignments a week, that typically span 2-3 pages. It takes me about 40 minutes to complete one, and that's not counting the 1-1.5 hours of readings/videos we have to watch and take notes on in order to complete the assignments. Way too much work for 101."
532,110854,5.0,3.0,"He is an amazing professor, and a lot of the material covered on exams is in lectures only. He makes material very easy to remember during lecture if you pay attention. Overall, an amazing professor in my opinion!!"
533,110854,4.0,3.0,"Myers was a chill dude. You have to pay attention in class to do well because things he says will appear on exams, but overall I didn't think they were unfair. You get tested on a lot, so lots of point chance. Funny guy as he'll go off an rants about his past addictions and existentialism that are not related to class."
534,110854,4.0,4.0,He is a great professor. Lectures are always very interesting and he explains well. Exams are avery specific so you need to go to lectures because he often asks exam questions relating to things he talks about in class. Exams are tricky but gives you other opportunities to excel.
535,110854,4.0,4.0,"I would recommend doing the readings, there are small Moodle quizzes based off them. His class does have a few tests and one or two assignments, but if you talk to him and ask for his opinion, he will help you get an A. His first exam may be hard, but you quickly learn what he expects and you will succeed on the next two if you prepare."
536,110854,2.0,5.0,"Never knew what he wanted. Test questions were often too specific to study for. Class was ok, he can go off on tangents regarding some topics. Teaching philosophy revolved around student effort; if you weren't doing well it was your fault. Didn't supply any slides for review use, and generally moved too quickly for you to take consistent notes."
537,110854,1.0,4.0,"unempathetic and rude. hard grader and does not seem to care about whats happening to students outside of class. kind of a bummer, interesting subject but rude guy."
538,110854,5.0,2.0,"Myers is the best. Very approachable guy and loves what he does. Lectures are never boring and he makes sure everyone understands the concepts. Does not take attendance but a lot of information from lectures is on the exams so I would definitely recommend attending, especially since it's enjoyable anyway. Fair grader and really enjoyed his class."
539,110854,5.0,4.0,"Best professor I've had at Bucknell so far. Loves what he does and his passion is contagious. Classes were never dull. He is a really smart guy. Tests are hard, but he is always more than happy to meet for help. He expects a lot from his students but in return he gives 100% to his courses and students. Take him if you get the chance!"
540,110854,3.5,2.0,"Prof Myers is a great prof! He makes class interesting and is genuinely interested in the course material.  His exams aren't easy but if you study for them, you'll be fine. Make sure that you do exactly what he asks of you for your assignments so you don't lose easy points"
541,110854,5.0,3.0,"Professor Myers is one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell. No matter how tired I am on a given day, Myers knows how to keep the room alive. His energy and knowledge of the material he teaches are truly fun to be around. I highly recommend Myers to anyone interested in psychology or just looking for an interesting class!"
542,110854,5.0,4.0,The most fantastic professor I've had at Bucknell. Really loves what he does and is always trying to figure out better ways to help his students get whatever he is teaching. The work isn't too light or too heavy but it does actually get you thinking. I have now taken 3 classes with him and have gotten a lot out of all of them.
543,110854,5.0,2.0,"Professor Myers is funny and passionate. He loves Psychology, and teaches it empirically; he's clearly a dedicated scientist, and it shows in his lectures. Attendance isn't mandatory, but strongly encouraged, as many of his exam questions come from lectures (which he goes out of his way to make engaging)."
544,110854,4.0,4.0,"Myers is a funny guy and a good teacher. he problem is that in order to do well you HAVE to do the readings every night.(Atleast an hour of horrible, boring text),he does not cover all of the information from the readings in class but still tests you on it, so if you cant teach yourself then dont take this class."
545,110854,4.5,2.0,"Had him for learning, and he is one of the best teachers i've had at bucknell. really engaging and interested in what he teaches. make sure you go to all classes as tests are mostly from notes. watch out for final- completely different structure from class tests"
546,110854,5.0,5.0,"Myers is one of the best professors at Bucknell.  Really helpful, classes are interesting, and he's a really funny guy.  The only bad thing about Myers is that his tests are sometimes unnecessarily hard.  Still, Psych 100 was one of the best classes I've had."
547,110854,5.0,1.0,Myers was a really good teacher. He was friendly and interactive. The tests were pretty easy if you did your homework but impossible if not.
548,110854,5.0,2.0,Great professor.  Really funny and knowledgeable.
549,110854,5.0,1.0,Myers is the man! all there is to it. goofily funny as hell. definitely take him for 100. you will not regret it. gives a thousand examples of everything so it's real easy to understand. awesome prof. tests are actually easy if you study for them
550,110854,3.0,4.0,"Great, enthusiastic teacher. Attendance is not mandatory, but  in the long run it is, in the sense that if you go to class the material is MUCH easier to understand. He is very helpful in that he supplies sample questions before each exam."
551,110854,3.0,4.0,"Good teacher for Intro and for Learning, nice guy, smart.  But beware, Advanced Learning Adaptive Behavior is HARD AS HELL.  I did well in Learning but I am struggling to keep up in the seminar.  Interesting topics but at a complicated level and he doesn't explain.  He expects everyone to get it and keep up and its alot to handle."
552,110854,5.0,2.0,"This guy is so helpful, both in and outside of class. The class has very little material to learn, and he moves slowly and repeats important (usually simple) concepts over and over. Tests are harder than you'd expect, but still not bad. He records lectures and posts powerpoint slides, both very helpful. If you put in effort, you'll do well."
553,110854,5.0,3.0,"So good - really cares about the students and if they get it. Very bright and on his toes, can point to examples of the top of his head to help clerify."
554,110854,4.5,4.0,"His class was one of the best I ever took at Bucknell. Pay attention and study hard because the information he gives comes up in every class, especially if you are a psych major. Also, study the examples he gives, they come in use during tests."
555,110854,3.0,5.0,"clarity is awesome in class, but when it comes to quizzes and exams, they become ridiculously hard.    p.s.  looks like Bill Gates's little brother"
556,110854,5.0,3.0,i just had him for learning this semester and it was a very good class i hope to have him for learning lab later
557,110854,5.0,3.0,Pretty cool guy.  Fair with class and clear with material.  Looks like Doogie Howser.

559,110854,3.0,3.0,Professor is more suited teaching at a elementary level as he treats his students like children
560,110854,4.0,2.0,No Comments
561,49416,2.0,4.0,"NO TEXTBOOK which makes it very hard to learn foundations of accounting from scratch. Thinks he's hilarious, kinda is, but focusses more on entertainment than teaching. Learned EVERYTHING through my Dad who is a CPA. 4 hour phone calls with your parents trying to balance a balance sheet over the phone gets old and frustrating real quick!"
562,49416,5.0,2.0,He teaches the basics of the materials in the lectures and then has you work through the more in depth material through homework. Always answers your questions clearly and is very helpful.
563,49416,5.0,2.0,"One of the greatest professors ever. Glad I took him my freshman year because he made me fall in love with the whole SOM. If you follow him in class, you barely have to do any additional reading. He gives homework, that is relevant and will help you keep up. I could go on and on about Needham, because he is truly one of the best there is."
564,49416,3.5,3.0,Nicest professor in the accounting department at Bucknell!
565,49416,4.0,2.0,"Great professor.  Entertaining, smart, and there if you need him.  Weekly quizzes keep you on track, and most of them are easy/ take home."
566,49416,4.0,2.0,"Funny awesome guy, you might not do well in the beginning but it gets easier. Make sure you pay attention in class, study and your set its not too hard"
567,49416,4.0,3.0,"Overall, I found him to be a great professor. He gives a lot of work and quizzes weekly but that forces you to learn the material. He gives all of his notes via Powerpoint which can be downloaded online in addition to homework solutions. Exams follow the homework, slides, and practice exams. I highly recommend getting him for accounting courses."
568,49416,1.0,4.0,"Terrible professor.  Unapproachable, absolutely unclear.  Take someone else.  Actually, take anyone else."
569,49416,3.0,2.0,"Tests and Quizes were easy if you understood the material, god help you if you don't or if you don't do the work, he isn't helpful but the information isn't really hard to grasp"
570,49416,5.0,2.0,"Loved taking his course, always enjoyed going to class, always makes jokes and has conversations go off on tangents so enjoyable atmosphere, also did a good job of explaining material and allowing you to boost up your grade, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
571,49416,5.0,2.0,Loved the way course was set up. Quizzes once a week make you learn topics and not wait for exams. Does tons of examples in class so you are prepared and also gives minimal but relevant homework. Exams (especially the final) were challenging. Take him over the other professors because you will learn more. Will make taking 160 much easier.
572,49416,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, highly recommend him.  Ready to help and explain anything that needs clarification, leaves you well prepared for all tests.  Tough but do-able."
573,49416,3.0,5.0,I find him to be a bit unclear. A background in accounting is a definite plus in this course. I would say that if you don't have an accounting background your taking a chance. [I don't like the class that much this semester :( ]
574,49416,5.0,3.0,"i really resent the posts that say needham is an awful professor.  as long as you listen in class and do the work (even though he doesnt collect it) this class can be very interesting.  he will bend over backward for anyone who needs help. As for the comments about the final, that is crap, he basically tells you everything you need to know."
575,49416,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely the worst class I ever took. I agree with whoever posted earlier. I took the final today, and it was terrible.Needham doesnt teach well, and then gives us an exam that a real accountant would have a tough time with.Terrible class, lectures suck, I didnt learn a thing. Class not recomended"
576,49416,1.0,5.0,"Way to screw everyone over on the final. Class lectures unclear, TAs do a better job teaching than Needham.If there wasnt an attendance portion of your grade I would say dont bother to go to class, teach yourself.Class is not friendly towards beginners in accounting. All in all a horrible experience"
577,49416,1.0,4.0,"Just took the final (spring 05) and he didnt let us use our TI89's. Instead he made us use crappy $1 calculators... test was impossible, and calculations hard to do with crappy calculators because they did not display what your calculations were like a TI89. Class very hard for beginners. BEWARE!!!"
578,49416,5.0,4.0,Tough but fair
579,49416,3.5,2.0,"Definitely take Mgmt 160 with Needham.  Hardly any out of class work.  Wednesday night quizzes kind of suck, but they aren't every week.  He tries to make accounting as exciting as possible.  (and to the eye candy remark...definitely not, but he's a really nice professor)"
580,49416,4.0,2.0,i love going to class...what a piece of eye candy!
581,49416,5.0,2.0,"He is a really good teacher. Very clear and helpful. Gives sample tests before the tests.  Not much outside work, just studying."
582,49416,4.0,2.0,very good professor that is helpful when you need help and he even brings some humor into class sometimes....

585,49416,4.5,2.0,Great Guy
586,110856,5.0,4.0,Professor Noguchi and his classes changed my life.  thank you thank you thank you
587,110856,1.5,3.0,"Lectures the entire class with no chance for participation. Nice guy, but really bad professor. There is little to no segue between topics. Nothing of much value is discussed. He gets sidetracked all the time and rambles. You probably won't learn a lot in this class."
588,110856,5.0,1.0,Awesome
589,110856,4.0,3.0,"Professor Noguchi is a fair teacher.  I suggest you get to know him, by going to his office hours, talking in class, and showing a general interest in what he is teaching.  Interesting and intelligent man.  He enjoys what he teaches and is a fair grader.  Writing is important, essays on every test and a research paper that you must do."
590,110856,1.5,3.0,"If you're interested in the lost and found of subway stations, this is the class for you. Or, if you're planning on becoming a trivia expert, one of his classes might get you a couple points.  Other than that, this class is a complete waste of time.  Luckily, if you sign the attendance and then leave he won't actually notice."
591,110856,3.0,4.0,"from the other comments you can tell that he may not be the best choice for intro. japan focused classes are more interesting and he knows about japan from his research trips. the books are great, but not all the information is very current. grading is tough, but not nearly the worst at bucknell."
592,110856,3.5,2.0,"took two classes with him cultural and urban. attend class, do the readings, study a little and its easy. hes a nice guy, his lectures are interesting if you pay attention. his sign in sheet sucks, interesting material. the tests are easy to BS"
593,110856,2.0,4.0,"Although he is a nice guy, he is a very hard and anal grader. I don't think I really learned anything from him or this class."
594,110856,1.0,2.0,"He likes to put random, irrelevant things together and present them during class. The class is boring, and the materials he presents are usually old, inaccurate or a little off the point. He is a nice guy, but definitely not a good professor. It would not help you learn anything at all about Japan...I recommend you to avoid him."
595,110856,2.0,4.0,"Attendance is mandatory, or you lose points. Exams and quizzes are hard because he asks random questions or picks out specific details, as opposed to the broader points of the readings. Class is extremely boring with random, useless sidetracking - it will evolve into his photo slideshow of Japan. Avoid him."
596,110856,2.0,2.0,"the class could have been interesting. He's a boring professor, doesnt explain material in an organized way, and adds too many sidenotes about his japanesse heritage."
597,110856,4.0,1.0,"Kinda throws together a lot of random material, and then throws it at you. Interesting stuff though. Notice how he always glances from one corner of the room then the other."
598,110856,1.0,4.0,very boring instructor. could have been a very interesting class. not very approachable or helpful.
599,110856,1.5,2.0,"Not understanding at all.  I was stuck in health services all weekend and he wouldn't give me a study guide I missed.  And he was mean about it.  Also he is rude.  And his class was boring when the material could have been interesting.  And its true, he doesn't make eye contact.  It is strange."
600,110856,5.0,3.0,"Fascinating class!  If you want to learn about other parts of the world and cultures take this class.  You will enjoy the class sessions and the assignments.  Though you will need to work fairly hard to earn a good grade, it is definitely worth it!"
601,110856,4.0,2.0,"class is a little boring, but he is a really nice guy"

603,110858,5.0,4.0,Very helpful professor whos always available outside of class and loves to provide as much advice as he can while still letting the student think for themselves. Content was a bit boring in this class - but professor Orr did his best to keep most engaged !
604,110858,5.0,4.0,I really liked professor Orr. The content was very interesting and he was very passionate about the subject matter. He also really values students who take interest (which you should have if youre taking a niche class like this). Hes very accessible outside of class and willing to help students who put in the work.
605,110858,1.0,4.0,Professor Orr was very vague in a lot of subject matters and often times in class veered away from the subject at hand. His notes were extremely hard to follow and messy and often times did not help with exams. His exams were hard to study and prep for due to the extremely vague ID list he creates for students with terms that cant be looked up.
606,110858,1.0,3.0,Avoid Prof Orr at all costs. The man is extremely boring and his lectures have no structure whatsoever. He often assigned Japanese movies to watch as homework and they were super boring and some featured rape scenes. He did not warn students of triggering content before watching. Claims he is willing to discuss grades but really isn't. Don't take
607,110858,4.0,4.0,"Great class. I was interested in the material, and I learned a lot. There is a lot of reading, and most classes are based around discussion. He is very passionate and knowledgable about the material. He is very kind and willing to give students extra help."
608,110858,1.0,3.0,"Lectures not based on reading goes off on tangents and has supplemental readings every week, which are impossibly long and uninteresting."
609,110858,1.0,4.0,"Nice man, but I would not recommend taking any of his classes. He rarely follows the readings during class discussions and often throws in unnecessary details that often make the class hard to follow. On tests, he gives out incredibly long ID lists to study and sometimes waits for the last minute to send them out."
610,110858,3.0,3.0,"Orr is a very nice man, but his lectures are mainly class discussion which means that they are often very unclear and confusing to follow. The class is discussion based which means that if you did not do the reading it becomes very obvious. THIS WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT LIKE TO SPEAK IN CLASS."
611,110858,4.5,2.0,"Very soft spoken and very kind man. Since he teaches 200 level courses, it's expected you have at least some very general background knowledge on the subject. Tests are tough but if you study and read you'll do fine. Lectures can get derailed sometimes but are usually key for building on readings and HW. Overall great but don't expect an easy class"
612,110858,1.5,2.0,He is a very nice person but his class is very confusing and not well taught.
613,110858,3.0,5.0,"Clearly very knowledgeable about the material; however, his lectures are unorganized and extremely difficult to follow. He expects too much out of his students considering the high amount of reading. In order to have a decent quiz/test average expect to read the chapters at least 3 times each. Absolutely horrible professor."
614,110858,2.0,4.0,"His class about modern japanese history is completely misleading. It is not modern but 1800's till 1940's. Also, he is very soft spoken and his class is extremely boring. Everyone in the class seems near falling asleep everytime we meet. Constant bombardment of extremely boring readings that alot of the time have nothing to do with the tests."
615,110858,1.5,1.0,Prof. Orr has no passion for teaching and puts a minimal amount of effort into his classes.  Relies entirely on students questions which does make the class tedious and boring.  Assignments were nothing but busywork that he clearly did not grade or even look at.
616,110858,1.0,3.0,"No passion towards teaching. Considering EAST111 is not a W1/W2, there?s a lot of reading. He fails to teach &quot;why&quot; incidents happened throughout the history or its significance. Memorization of years and names can be helpful, sure, but what's the point if you don?t know the significance behind it&#63; Not recommended as an intro teacher."
617,110858,3.5,2.0,"Definitely one of the nicest professors at Bucknell! He's very informal. Class is discussion oriented. His lectures are typically based off student's questions. Can get a bit boring...Orr is very soft spoken and doesn't lecture fast, which can make it hard to stay awake at times."
618,110858,4.5,2.0,One of the nicest teachers I have ever had....take notes on exactly what he says and you should recieve an A.....3 readings a week....2 papers.....and he gave the possible questions used on the final
619,110858,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor! Enjoys class interaction and really cares about his students! Any prof. that lets me in on his class wearing just pajamas and socks ROCKS!I would take class with him again!
620,2588940,2.0,4.0,Lecture every single class. Very boring. Kylie is very nice and sweet. Very difficult to get above a B. Assignments due every friday. Two major tests that were graded tough. In class you should read the night before if you want to participate.
621,110861,2.0,5.0,I would advise to stay away. He goes through the lectures very fast and rarely sees people's hands when they go to ask questions. He has a lot of office hours on the syllabus but rarely makes himself available during them. Tests are absurdly hard for no reason. 
622,110861,3.0,4.0,"This class was way too much work for one class! While the information you learn is interesting, this professor doesn't take into account that you have other classes. It was very overwhelming and I would avoid unless you plan to give almost all of your time to this class only. Good luck"
623,110861,5.0,4.0,"Hes in general a good professor. As long as you work hard, take notes, and go through his  PowerPoint and summary before the tests, its not hard to get the grade you want"
624,110861,1.0,5.0,worst professor ever. he does not know how to explain concepts clearly and grades completely unfairly from student to student. he doesn't make it clear what he wants during tests and. nd tests are 1000x harder than anything done in class or for hw. he doesnt care about the success of students and makes it impossible to get a good grade in the cour
625,110861,1.0,4.0,"For someone who has one of the most amazing jobs in the word, he seems awfully bored and disinterested. Was mean to certain students and displayed their errors to the entire class. Handed back assignments from August in December so there was really no opportunity to improve. Missed office hours and seemed bothered when questions were asked."
626,110861,4.0,3.0,"Yes, he is a little socially awkward. Yes, can be a harsh grader. That being said... he is a caring person who will reward you with interesting facts and hilarious quips if you take the time to get to know him. Once you accept the fact that he is brutally honest, he is a good professor for anyone who wants to study animal behavior."
627,110861,4.0,3.0,"He's super awkward, but he cares a lot and will help you if you can get past the fact that he chuckles uncomfortably and won't really look you in the eyes. But he's a very caring person, and wants you to succeed."
628,110861,3.0,3.0,"Judge is not helpful within our outside of the classroom, he is prone to biases, and he assigns ridiculous projects.  At one point, we were graded on how easily he could recognize our subjects by our sketchings.  Unless you have some training in art, I suggest you steer clear."
629,110861,2.5,3.0,"He knows a lot about what he is teaching and he really loves it, however his class is just boring, and I don't feel like I have to do any work, he basically gives out hand outs so you don't have to take any notes. If you like monkeys though, working with them makes the class worth it."
630,110861,3.5,2.0,"tests are easy as long as you study, lectures can be boring but class is fair"
631,110861,5.0,3.0,"he's not bad for animal behavior. You can definitely tell that he is really into what he's teaching you and knows a lot about everything.  In my experience he was very helpful and I was able to reach him no problem. He can be a bit boring but overall he's not bad....plus, he shows a ton of MOVIES! I would recommend his course"
632,110861,1.5,5.0,"For Animal Behavior, he is absolutely terrible.  He is boring, gives terrible powerpoints that follow the textbook word for word, is not easy to reach for assistance, and makes very difficult tests. If you are planning on taking Animal Behavior, make sure he is not teaching it that semester."
633,110861,2.0,3.0,"first few weeks you figure this is going to be another one of those boring classes you can just blow off and get an A. well, ehhhhh. he does give lots of handouts so no need to read the book or anything, especially since all tests are open book and notebook. he does indeed take off points for anything like it is his job. sooo annoying and unfair."
634,110861,4.5,4.0,Very borring but very clear.  Good man and is a pretty good teacher.  His tests are a bit hard.
635,110861,5.0,2.0,Great class. Great teacher. You get to work with the monkeys and he's really good at teaching you to do research.
636,110861,2.5,3.0,very very boring. he takes points off for stupid things like its his job. if you must take psyc stats take it with someone else.
637,110861,4.5,3.0,"Great class, challenged me intellectually"
638,110861,1.5,2.0,"His class was good for catching up on sleep, but that's about all. He has an annoying lisp, and to make things worse, practically whispers when lecturing. Follows the book almost perfectly. His tests are open book and pretty easy, but he's very picky. You'll come out of the class with a good grade, yet you probably haven't learned anything."
639,110861,4.5,1.0,"He is easy - at least, if you can figure out how to bring your notes to class (all his tests are open notes) and actually use them.  A little boring if you know anything about Statistics, but that means you can doze in class.  Just show up and get your sheets of notes and then you are good for the exams."
640,110861,4.5,3.0,Demanding but fair. The class was boring at times but that's what I expected from a stats class. He knew the material and explained it well. I learned a lot.
641,110861,1.0,4.0,"He is by FAR the WORST teacher I have ever encountered in my entire life! He is completely unhelpful, always directs you to the TA, and is soooo apathetic to everybody, it's scary... In retrospect, I would have NEVER taken him."
642,110861,2.5,2.0,Also had him as an independent research advisor. Emphasis on INDEPENDENT. He gave little advice and rarely attended scheduled meetings.  In class I will agree that he was a very boring lecturer. It's unfortunate that the animal behavior dept no longer has some of the greats that started it like Candland and Peirara --- they are all extremely knowledgeable aboutt he field of primatology. Judge does not seem to engage with his students as the other professors did.

645,110861,3.0,3.0,"very boring lectures, just reads deffinitions off power point.. his exams are tough but if you study you'll do fine... he's an overall nice guy, but doesnt exactly know how to adjust his teaching style to help students who are having trouble"
646,110861,3.0,2.0,"really, really boring lectures but tests are fair and he's a nice guy."
647,110861,4.0,2.0,"Good professor, but if you pick up the material really quickly he's a little boring.  Very nice and really wants his students to learn the material.  All in all, take him if u want open note tests, slow movement through the material, and lots of help."
648,110861,4.5,4.0,Great guy. Very smart. He's a great guy and tests are fair. Not too bad to look at either.
649,110861,5.0,4.0,"inspiring and hot, too"
650,110861,5.0,3.0,"Interesting, knows alot about monkeys....awesome..don't miss out   ..awesome"
651,110862,5.0,4.0,"Homework is tough, but she is very helpful and if you put in the time you will get a good grade and come out with a good understanding of the concepts. I highly recommend taking courses taught by this professor."
652,110862,5.0,2.0,"Thornley is an excellent professor, very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about astronomy. The class involved some basic physics and some of the concepts were challenging but overall it was very fair and very easy to get a good grade. If you are looking to take a lab science, I recommend Astronomy 101 with Prof. Thornley"
653,110862,4.5,3.0,"great professor. really wants her students to do well.  a lot of physics involved (was not ready for that), but not too bad of a class. night labs go by quickly. will work with you until you get the material right."
654,110862,3.5,4.0,"Overall, a good teacher, although a bit goofy at times. The class is very hard, or at least for me it was, because I didn't really want to take an Astronomy class. She is very helpful ini office hours, more so than in class time."
655,110862,4.5,2.0,"She obviously knows a ton about what she's teaching, and is passionate about it. Show up to class and try to pay attention, even though you'll probably get bored (unless you REALLY like the subject). She's really helpful and approachable outside of class. I would recommend her!"
656,110862,2.5,4.0,"She likes to use formulas that differ from what the text tells you to do, so that makes it harder.  Classes very boring, labs are pointles, and there are assignments for every class.  Tests are hard."
657,110862,4.0,2.0,she explains things very well but the problem is that she is very meticulous and demands you do everything correctly before she lets you go. labs usually take up to their required time because of this problem
658,110862,4.5,2.0,Very clear and interesting teacher. She obviously knows a TON about the universe and is very approachable. Highly recommended. Loved her and the class! Learned a TON.
659,110862,5.0,2.0,"Very good teacher.  If you pay attention and do the reading the class is a breeze, and is very interesting.  Highly reccomended."
660,110862,3.0,1.0,"Nice, boring, and the material was so easy that notes and studying are unnecessary. It's really all basic physics and trig, I was hoping for more about what's out there in the universe, instead I got boring math problems that were just high school review, and only a few labs are at the observatory."
661,1093903,5.0,2.0,"Professor Daly is one of the most knowledgeable and caring professors I have had at Bucknell. He knows the struggles you're going through with Greek and gives you chances to do well on quizzes and exams. If you didn't study for one quiz, you'll have opportunities to make it up by doing better on the next."
662,1093903,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic Professor. Knowledgable and gives easy to follow lectures. As long as you get to class you do not really need to do too much extra, but if you want an A you will need to do a little research. He is also a relatively generous marker. Only complaint is that he is usually unresponsive on emails, which can be annoying. See him in office hours"
663,1093903,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Sad to see him go.
664,1093903,5.0,2.0,Not a hard class. Very interesting. Never had to open a textbook. Pay attention in class/take good notes and you will do well.
665,1093903,5.0,1.0,He's such a nice guy and pretty funny. Lecture can be dry. You might nod off if it's your first class of the day. The class itself was a minimal time commitment outside of lecture. I never opened the book(s) and did well. I did get a lot out of it though. Very thorough lectures.
666,1093903,5.0,4.0,Wonderful! Really cares about his subject and his students
667,1093903,5.0,3.0,He was an incredible teacher..and he really made sure you knew what you were doing.
668,1093903,5.0,3.0,"In all my years of education, I have encountered few professors as knowledgeable and helpful as Professor Daly. Although you'll have to work hard in his class, you'll emerge with a greater understanding of Latin and increased knowledge of classical civilizations. One of the best professors I've ever had."
669,1093903,5.0,5.0,Adonis has nothing on Daly!
670,932112,4.0,2.0,I only skimmed the reading and still have been getting good grades. She's great because she cares about mental health and test anxiety and doesn't make you memorize anything. All tests and quizzes are open notes and untimed and the quizzes you get two chances to take and she takes the higher score.
671,932112,3.0,3.0,"Professor Lintott is very approachable and very caring, but a very hard grader. I would recommend going to office hours regularly, but you still probably will not get the grade that you want. Regardless, Philosophy of Laughter is a very interesting class."
672,932112,5.0,3.0,Professor Lintott is the best and is super understanding. She is so interesting to listen to and is very passionate about philosophy. She made the information accessible although she is a little bit of a tough grader she is amazing and loves creative projects. She taught with Daubman! Awesome class!
673,932112,4.5,2.0,"Philosophy of laughter was one of the most interesting classes I have taken. She is so nice, understanding, and intelligent. Amazing professor. Wish I had time to take another one of her classes."
674,932112,4.0,2.0,"She's a great professor. Class is discussion - not lecture - based, which is great. Her grading can seem a little harsh sometimes and it is generally quite inconsistent. Overall, I would definitely recommend her."
675,932112,4.0,3.0,"She was awesome - totally quirky and fun. Her quizzes were sometimes annoying, and although they are open book you still have to read and do your work. Some of the readings were very confusing but she did a good job at clarifying things during class. She made the class really enjoyable and was very approachable."
676,932112,4.5,2.0,"Professor Lintott is Awesome.  If you pay attention in class, go to office hours with your rough drafts or any confusion with the reading material (which, at times, can be quite confusing), you pretty much have a guaranteed A.  Overall one of the nicest, most genuine people I have ever met."
677,932112,3.5,2.0,"She's fun, and very approachable.  My one complaint would be that she lets her views become too much of a her teaching.  From day 1, you can tell that she's pretty biased on certain subjects.  On the whole, I enjoyed the class.  What's better than getting to watch South Park for a college class&#63;!"
678,932112,1.5,1.0,She tries hard but does not make the class what it could be
679,932112,5.0,3.0,"Fun teacher, easy to talk to and really caring"
680,932112,4.5,3.0,She's a great professor. She is really approachable and class was always fun.
681,932112,3.5,3.0,Really nice and sweet women. Really wants you to be interested but such a dull teacher and class. Not many interesting discussions and dumb homework assignments.
682,932112,4.0,3.0,"Professor Lintott is approachable, fun & very well educated.  Lots o' reading--take this if you like philo, art & discussion."
683,932115,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Hecock is the man... he really makes you think deeply. His 3rd world politics class is based on reading different sides of arguments, and then discussing the pros and cons of each argument. You'll gain a lot of knowledge, but more importantly you'll learn to think for yourself and evaluate different perspectives."
684,932115,5.0,3.0,"Strongly recommend taking his 3rd World Politics or Latin American Politics classes. Really engaging lectures, and great personal anecdotes make the material very interesting. Relates his own experiences well to the material to make class fun. Office hours and advice outside of class are also fantastic, a champion of liberal arts"
685,932115,4.0,3.0,Absolutely love Professor Hecock. Hes one of the few professors at Bucknell who is passionate about what he teaches AND cares about teaching itself. The tests were pretty straightforward as long as you were in class. Papers could be a little tough but he gives good feedback to help you improve. Overall a really great guy who knows his stuff.
686,932115,5.0,3.0,I found he was a very fair grader and taught a course that was made interesting by his perspectives. Certainly a prof I would recommend
687,932115,5.0,3.0,Extremely passionate about what he teaches.  Really interesting and clear lectures. Would highly highly recommend taking a class with him.  Definitely go to office hours to talk to him about your essays.  Test are pretty easy (if you do the reading) but the essays are a bit tough.  He is definitely willing to help you if you ask
688,932115,4.5,3.0,"Super funny guy, especially with his personal stories, and definitely very intelligent and interesting. Not too difficult but you do have to do SOME work. If you like comparative politics definitely make sure you take his class!"
689,932115,5.0,3.0,"Great professor who loves to teach. Very organized and clear in his lectures. Tests are easy if you do the readings especially the articles that he assigns. Overall a great class to take with him, he is definitely one of the best professors at Bucknell."
690,932115,5.0,3.0,"He is a great professor who emphsizes concepts over little details. The readings aren't that bad and the three, 3 page essays are easy. He's really interesting and loves to tell personal stories. Must take professor at Bucknell."
691,932115,1.0,5.0,"Terrible professor. Lectures were boring and unclear, he would get caught up in his thoughts and make no sense. Exams were 8 essay questions and you had to answer 5 which is ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.The readings are long and too many of them. Most boring class ever absolutely no structure besides him listening to himself talk."
692,932115,3.0,4.0,he lectures for basically the entire class which can get kind of boring but it's worth taking notes as his lectures are basically the key points of his tests. he assigns a fair amount of writing assignments too and can be pretty harsh grading them but if you go to his office hours he definitely can help you out.
693,932115,4.0,4.0,Good professor.  A hard grader for no reason. But smart and interesting.  Would recommend.
694,932115,3.5,2.0,Class is extremely boring but the work isn't hard. He assigns alot of usesless readings
695,932115,4.0,2.0,"His speaking style is off-putting at first, but you get used to it. Go to class! Most of the tests are straight from class notes, so if you pay attention you'll be golden. A fair amount of writing but it's divided up and he's pretty helpful."
696,932115,2.0,5.0,"The class is very hard, but part of that was that it was at 8 at I was tired. He for sure knows his stuff, but isn't exactly the most helpful."
697,932115,2.0,2.0,Definitely has favorites. Lectures for an hour and a half straight and grades arbitrarily. A little bit awkward and has very organized teaching style.
698,932115,1.0,3.0,"Nice guy but kind of awkward and just LECTURES ALL CLASS PERIOD. realllly boring and not clear in terms of essay questions, what he wants, his comments on your exams, essay, etc. kind of easy but super boring and you learn nothing from his class. he has weird grading as well (probs based on how much he likes you)"
699,932115,4.0,2.0,"Nice, easy going guy. He is very into the subject and does a good job of teaching it. Class was long, but in general fairly interesting. He is helpful, and does admit to being a tough grader. Your overall grade can turn out better then what it generally should add up to as long as you let him know you care."
700,932115,4.5,1.0,"Really enthusiastic, easy hw grader, will help you on papers as much as you want"
701,932115,5.0,1.0,Professor Hecock is God's gift to the social sciences and ladies in general.  He's charm and wit will astound you and his love for Latin America is infectious.
702,932115,4.0,1.0,"Nice guy, easy and I thought he was very organized and clear"
703,932115,1.0,3.0,"great subject matter, but prof. is unclear, repetitive, disorganized, unhelpful.  Take this if you want to teach yourself about 3rd World Politics."
704,1020182,5.0,4.0,"Took this class with UMUC.  Ridiculous amount of reading even for an English course.  She provided feedback on papers but not on weekly assignments (even when I asked), so impossible to know what you are doing rightwrong each week.  She did grade fair on papers and was available to help throughout the course."
705,1020182,4.5,4.0,She loves what she teaches and she is very interesting!
706,1020182,1.5,4.0,"Horrible, absolutely awful.  Boring classes of her trying to force discussion of bland books because she has nothing planned.  Grades papers harshly, making nonsensical comments and point deductions.  Totally unaccepting of other writing styles."
707,2367766,5.0,3.0,"Amazing class &amp; professor. Readings can be tough cause you read original texts but he walks you through it all and leaves nothing unanswered. If you take good notes and put effort into homeworks and study guides, you do well in exams. He is also always available for help via email or office. By end of course I ended up looking up to him immensely."
708,2367766,5.0,4.0,"Frankly I was skeptical about a young prof teaching a research-based senior seminar but Sudeep changed my mind with the first two weeks. His breadth of knowledge, passion and intellect is inspirational and it shows in his lectures and is truly a work of art. Unbelievbly humble and kind man too. Definitely take if you can, he will open your eyes."
709,2367766,5.0,4.0,"Professor Regmi is nothing short of incredible. Took 2 classes with him and fell in love! Such a clear thinker, connects every theory with relatable examples and topics and themes from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Always helpful and kind in class and during office hours, and funny as hell. Highly recommend, both his 103 and 258."
710,100633,5.0,3.0,"loved this class, very interesting, don't really need textbook but do for key terms"
711,100633,5.0,3.0,Great class! Informative lectures & Doc P was always accessible if help was needed. Tests are hard but can be mastered & he gives hints. Uses examples to make lectures digestible. He also cares about his students. I had severe health issues in & out of class & he helped me & checked in on me multiple times after class. Fav prof & a truly great guy!
712,100633,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely love Doc P & this class! Interesting lectures & there wasn't much hw besides a few writing pieces (1-2 pgs max, no length req. until final portfolio). His tests are hard, but he gives hints & can always meet outside of class if needed. As a bad test-taker, I managed to get As on tests. PSYC234 isn't always offered, so take it if you can!"
713,100633,4.0,4.0,"Ptacek is genuinely one of the funniest professors at Bucknell. I've had him for multiple courses now and would NOT reccommend him for stat, but any other class he teaches will be great. You need to pay attention in class bc a lot of what he talks about there is on exams, but he makes coming to a 9 am so fun with his stories and jokes. Awesome guy."
714,100633,4.0,3.0,"I found this class very interesting. There were not too many assignments, and I do not think he graded the tests too harshly. His humor made lectures fun!"
715,100633,5.0,3.0,"loved this class and prof! super funny and caring, he always had sunday reviews on top of office hours. never read textbook but u need it. his mc is tough but you get used to it. a lot of what he emphasizes in class is important for tests/quizzes. do the problem sets/practice math before exams. use office hours/reviews!!!"
716,100633,4.0,4.0,"Very good lecturer. The material is hard and if you don't attend the reading usually isn't enough to understand. The tests are pretty hard but fair, there's nothing we didn't cover on them. Occasional Homework is optional for extra credit. Takes a fair bit of studying to get an A"
717,100633,2.0,5.0,"If you are taking stats with him be prepared to teach yourself everything. He is a nice guy and I heard he's good for other classes, but he CAN'T teach stats so idk why Bucknell hasn't realized this yet."
718,100633,2.0,4.0,"He is very caring, funny and he cares a lot about his students and is willing to work with you in any way he can. However, if you plan on taking this class be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class. He is very disorganized half of the lectures consist of him telling stories and it's very easy to get behind. Don't take him if need credit"
719,100633,4.0,3.0,"GREAT Guy! He really cares about his students. Extremely personable and loves to tell stories! His test questions can be unclear but I never found this class too stressful by any means. Plus, not much homework AT ALL! I WILL be taking another one of his classes in the future."
720,100633,5.0,3.0,"This class is hard. You need to be able to read the textbook and use office hours to pass. He is an amazing guy though, super funny and always a great conversationalist. His class just requires work."
721,100633,3.0,4.0,"I WORKED FOR THIS A. Although I like Ptacek as a person, his lectures can be unclear and he fails to emphasize the importance of what turn out to be major topics. Exams require A LOT of preparation but if you do the work, the exams are straightforward and memorization-based. He is always willing to meet and answer questions and is very friendly."
722,100633,3.0,4.0,"Doc P is very personable and approachable if you need help outside of class. He is always willing to help those that want to be successful. However, his exams are very unfair. He asks essay questions on things that were talked about for 1 second in class and won't test on big ideas which makes no sense. So hard to study for this course."
723,100633,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ptacek is one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell. He (somehow) made statistics fun and easy to understand, and included lots of real-world examples in his lectures. Extremely caring and wants the best for every one of his students. Is very approachable and if you demonstrate effort he will have your back 100%. Very cool guy."
724,100633,5.0,3.0,"He is an extremely engaging, funny lecturer and it is no secret how much he cares about both his passion for psychology along with his students. I loved being in this class and was always excited to go."
725,100633,3.0,4.0,"There were only 4 grades in this class: a midterm, a final, a small percentage for homework, and a big paper. You definitely to meet with him often. The midterm was difficult because the questions he asked are really random and there's so much content to cover. Even though he's a cool guy, I wouldn't take it if you don't have to."
726,100633,5.0,4.0,"Definitely has mellowed out over his years here. Genuine guy, but doesn't tolerate slackers. Do your work. Don't understand something? He's more than welcome to help you out. Wants everyone to do well, as long as they're putting forth effort."
727,100633,2.0,5.0,"He seemed like a nice guy in class, but several office visits revealed that this was just an act. In private conversations, I thought I was opening up to a fair minded, mature and level headed psych professor, but in fact he was a bully. His attitude was mean, rude &amp; insulting. Do yourself a favor and skip this clown-take anyone else but him!!!!"
728,100633,1.0,5.0,"Yeah, the worst statistic professor ever. He tests on stuff he does not even teach. Worked my ass off and went to office hours but only got a C. Take anyone but him for stats."
729,100633,2.0,5.0,"I had Prof Ptacek for Psych 100 and he was good. As a stats Prof though, he was not good. He tested on stuff he did not teach and the stuff he did teach was fuzzy. Only him take if you had stats before and are comfortable. Office visits result in more confusion because he is NOT a math teacher. Avoid."
730,100633,4.0,3.0,Discussion heavy class so do the reading.
731,100633,1.0,4.0,"He's the worst professor I've had at Bucknell! Your grade is derived from papers the and the tests are essays, but no reason/feedback is ever given  as to why you get the grade he assigns. You just have to accept it. He gives out few A's and lots of B's and C's. I took this clown one time but I will never take hi again. Avoid this professor!!!"
732,100633,5.0,4.0,"My favorite Professor at Bucknell. His courses aren't the easiest and require a good amount of work, but he is the most caring professor I have ever had. I go out of my way to choose classes taught by him (unfortunately there aren't many!). If you have the chance to take his class, do it! He is so funny and always keeps things interesting"
733,100633,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors in the psychology department. He is there for and willing to help any student. Cannot speak highly enough of this professor. Outstanding lecturer, wants his students to do well, funny, and clear. "
734,100633,3.5,4.0,"Great professor, but psych stats is a tough class. He does not go easy on the students, but offers help if you need. His tests are difficult."
735,100633,3.5,3.0,"Definitely go in for help, and if you miss class get notes from other students because he basically discussed what we went over, but didn't teach it to me. His tests are fair. Half open book (math section) half closed book (multiple choice). Some multiple choice can be quite tricky."
736,100633,4.0,2.0,Absolutely loved this class. He made things really interesting and is very friendly. Tests are not hard at all. Highly recommend him.
737,100633,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ptacek is amazing. He is so funny and strives to make sure everyone understands what is going on during every class. Tests are difficult if you do not study but just review the textbook and lecture notes and you should do fine. Amazing person and professor, very personable, highly recommend!"
738,100633,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor. Brings a ton of personality to the classroom and manages to make statistics (which many consider dry) fun and interesting. He is extremely approachable and always willing to help. Without a doubt one of, if not the, best professor(s) I have had at Bucknell. I strongly recommend taking this course."
739,100633,3.5,5.0,Tests and quizzes are hard and the final is impossible but he's a great proffessor and is always engaging during class and very willing to help
740,100633,4.0,5.0,"One of the nicest professors I have had, but by the far the hardest course I have taken. I still love psychology, but the format of the class with only 4 multiple choice tests usually drew most of the questions from somewhere other than the class notes."
741,100633,4.0,3.0,Ptacek is great overall. He is funny and engaging in class. His exams can be quite long and difficult though.
742,100633,3.0,4.0,"His class is pretty entertaining. You have to ask for details though, he's too general with the info in class and then puts very specific questions on tests. Also plan on at least skimming the book if you want an A."
743,100633,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, one of my favorites at Bucknell.  Easy grader, makes everything clear and goes over everything clearly. Still trying to get into another class with him."
744,100633,4.5,4.0,"Funny, interesting, engaging. Really enjoy his class. Tests are hard and require lots of studying. Not a huge text book guy, and very conceptual not detail oriented (which I love). I would definitely recommend him."
745,100633,4.0,4.0,"He was a great guy, and an awesome teacher. However, his exams were quite difficult and almost completely based from the textbook. So don't listen when he says they exams are lecture based. I would say 75% of the information for the multiple choice questions was not covered in class."
746,100633,5.0,3.0,"J.T is a GREAT professor! Always helpful and intergrating his own stories and experiences to the class, making them nothing less than hilarious! Optional final exam, a couple of writing assignments, and 2 (or three, can't remember) exams during the semester. Gives students oppertunities to earn extra points. Exams are not that difficult."
747,100633,4.5,4.0,"Hardest exams and grading out of all the PSYCH 100 sections. However, amazing lectures and great guy. His lectures are always fun and engaging and he gets to know his students well. Unfortunately, the exams cover more than is covered in the lectures. Small writing assignments graded extremely hard."
748,100633,2.5,5.0,very difficult tests and he is a hard grader. much more work in his psych 100 class than the other sections who have other teachers!
749,100633,4.0,4.0,"Tricky tests but that's only because he has so much material to put on them. He keeps the class entertaining and gives personal stories as examples that are always funny. Always available for help, but you have to approach him. highly recommended..."
750,100633,3.5,4.0,His exams were tricky and he definitely was not as easy as he apparently used to be.  The class was a lot of fun though and extremely interesting.
751,100633,5.0,2.0,Highly recommend this professor. You should def take him at least once while at Bucknell. He makes the class so enjoyable and I never complained once about going to his class. He is easy to talk to and super funny. This is a must have!
752,100633,4.0,5.0,Always helpful!
753,100633,5.0,3.0,"he is the greatest. very interactive, keeps you engaged (the only class i haven't started to fall asleep in), draws on his own experiences, i really recommend him."
754,100633,5.0,3.0,really intop the material which makes it so much more interesting! definitely recommend him!
755,100633,5.0,3.0,"extremely intelligent and interactive. and while he may seem to have favorites- he really just likes the students who work hard and engage in the class. relatively difficult tests- but not impossible to pass- you learn a lot from him. plus, he's a stud- even if he is balding."
756,100633,5.0,2.0,"He's a great teacher- funny, interesting, and always very clear about the subject material.  He's always willing to help and answer questions and makes the class very interactive."
757,100633,3.5,2.0,"cares about the material, but seems to have favorites and that is so distracting. Kids care more about if they are liked then if they can saytheir own opinion"
758,100633,5.0,3.0,No Comments
759,100633,4.0,4.0,Not easy but very willing to help
760,100633,4.0,3.0,"Funny guy, willing to help, tests are a little difficult."
761,100633,3.5,5.0,"Don't take if not a psych major, but he's mad hot"
762,100633,5.0,2.0,"really nice guy, ALWAYS willing to help, :-D"
763,100633,3.0,1.0,Def not hot
764,203034,4.0,4.0,"Prof Daubman is always available if you need help or are confused on any assignments. It is clear that she really cares about her students doing well, but you also need to make a good effort to get a good grade. This class had a good amount of reading and writing, some was graded easily but essays were graded tough."
765,203034,4.0,3.0,"I took both social psych and positive psychology (taught at Muncy State Prison) with Prof Daubman and she is an amazing professor that truly cares about her students and wants to help them succeed. Although her courses are challenging and she can be a tough grader, I learned a lot and really enjoyed taking her classes and getting to know her."
766,203034,4.0,2.0,"I recommend doing the readings, for they are useful for the exams. Daubman is very nice and there is a group project due at the end of the semester that she gives you PLENTY of class time to work on it. Take some notes in class during her lectures and you'll be fine! Great class, would recommend to a friend!"
767,203034,3.0,4.0,"The lectures make sense, but I did poorly on the two tests we had in her class. There's short answer, so pretty much know every single vocabulary word for that unit. We have two essays and she graded very harshly on the first one (haven't gotten second back). Doesn't make an effort to meet outside of class. Made me less excited about social psych."
768,203034,4.0,3.0,"This is the best IP course. It was interesting and we learned a lot. Professor Lintott was the other professor and they made a nice balance. There were 3 formal essays, 1 creative project and participation which included a daily journal/essay. If you showed up and listened it was very easy to get a good grade! I would highly recommend."
769,203034,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, very nice always helpful, makes the material interesting"
770,203034,2.0,4.0,"Material was very interesting, but class was always the same boring thing: read articles/book and then discuss.  Very weird on grading, biased but sucking up does not necessarily work.  The good thing was that there was a very manageable amount of work and assignments.  Only 3 essays for the semester to critique each of the 3 books we read."
771,203034,4.0,2.0,"She's nice, and I enjoyed her class."
772,203034,3.5,2.0,"I was really interested in the material before I took her class. She is a nice woman, but her lecturing get pretty tiresome after a while. Not very hard at all, but others in my class disagreed. Some subject matter that I thought would be obvious to talk about was missing from the syllabus. SoJo is worth avoiding in general, honestly."
773,203034,5.0,3.0,"one of the best classes I've taken so far.  prof is knoeledgable, subject matter is interesting.  opened up new areas for me."
774,203034,1.5,4.0,"Makes classes sound very interesting but in fact were not.Very biased when grading, definately had favorites.Regardless of hard work sucking up pays off.If you don't like to suck up rather just do the work, you'll still get a B. There could be 3 mistakes on a rough draft, fix it & get C+.Stay away!!"
775,203034,1.0,1.0,"Way too easy, discussion was very empty and the material very poor. She's nice, but unhelpful for course scheduling. I'm sure she's better in her psychology courses."
776,203034,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher! Not too hard, tests are easy except for the t/f, be sure to do the readings."
777,203034,4.0,4.0,No Comments
778,203034,5.0,4.0,Knows her stuff and how to provoke students to think outside the box. Bends over backwardes to help students.  Glad Ihad her as a freshman. She opens your eyes.
779,2412826,4.0,2.0,Prof. Wood is witty and shares a lot in his lectures. Shares lots of cool statistics and data that is relevant. small group student discussions and convening as a class every class to break up all the lectures. Graded by two midterms and a couple easy paper assignments.
780,2412826,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Wood is nice, intelligent, and knows his field. He doesnt like lazy students. I recommend his course if you are motivated. Wood is one of the better profs to take comparative and quant with. Hes also reasonable about the workload."
781,2412826,3.0,3.0,We only had synchronous discussion sessions once a week. His lectures were boring and were not engaging. His grading never made sense and he didnt make expectation for assignments very clear. I did not learn much.
782,2412826,1.0,3.0,The most boring professor I've ever had. He is not engaging or interesting at all and makes no effort to be personable. Only one assignment due at the end of every week and I doubt that he even reads them so it is not a hard class. He reads off of his slides every lecture and takes homework questions straight from the back of the book. Really lame
783,2412826,1.0,3.0,"Professor Wood is both non-specific and unhelpful. His assignments are lazy and his lectures are boring so his class was soul sucking. The assignments weren't hard, they just sucked (no will to do them), basically all &quot;regurgitate a massive reading&quot;, but he also never makes it clear what he wants. The balance of his grading makes no sense either"
784,2412826,5.0,3.0,An excellent teacher who cares about his students. He gives out study guides before tests and really wants to see you succeed.
785,907554,4.0,1.0,I really enjoyed going to Professor Lee's class. He knew a lot about the subject matter and if you apply yourself in class you will do fine. Grades are all over the place but he is fair in the end and I ended with a good grade.
786,907554,4.5,2.0,"He is not nearly as bad as some reviewers are making him out to be.  His class is interesting and not a ton of work, plus he is not a mean guy.  If you show legitimate interest in the work for the class, you should get a pretty good grade in the end.  His grading is random at times, but balances out in the end."
787,907554,3.0,3.0,"To be honest, I didn't hate the class. It was pretty easy and I found Lee fairly interesting. You could tell he didn't put a ton of work into his lessons but he was really easygoing. He knew a lot about PA and is the sort of guy I'd love to get a beer with, but his grading RUINED me. He had no rhyme or reason and played favorites."
788,907554,1.0,5.0,Worst professor at Bucknell. Whoever said they like him is clearly one of his favorites. He grades completely based on his own opinions and has no solid system of grading. I felt like there was nothing I could do to improve my grade because everything was so randomly graded. He does not respond to emails. He should not teach.
789,907554,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I have ever had. Going to class is more confusing than not going. The class is an hour and half, but for the relevant information we receive the class could be 20 minutes. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Lee is inappropriate with content. You would expect it to be easy, because you learn NOTHING, but it is actually very hard."
790,907554,4.5,4.0,I love hiM!!!!!!! Such a good teacher!!
791,1900837,5.0,3.0,I have taken several courses with prof. Flynt and she's one of the best professors I've ever met at Bucknell. I'm currently studying at Columbia University for my master's degree and I'm still using notes from Prof. Flynt's class for review. Her class notes are super organized and her office hours are very helpful.
792,1900837,5.0,2.0,"I had Professor Flynt for her foundation seminar class (Sports, Statistics, and Society). If you're a fan of sports in any capacity, I would recommend this class. Flynt is one of the most caring people I've ever met, and the writing for this class is relatively easy to complete. You also get to analyze statistics for Bucknell's varsity teams."
793,1900837,5.0,4.0,"Excellent lecturer and very caring, great at answering questions. Gives lots of work. Homework is very time consuming, as is final project. Condensed skeleton notes make reading textbook uneeded (not too much reading). Make sure you understand what you're doing on the homework, waiting until the quiz/exam is too late. Can't get away with low effort"
794,1900837,5.0,3.0,"Amazing human being, incredibly sweet, funny and smart. Gives relatively difficult exams but if you REALLY know the material you'll get an A. If you want to take this data science class you have to be interested and intrigued in the subject otherwise it will be hard. about 1/4 of the class dropped it after the first 2 weeks."
795,1900837,5.0,4.0,"She is an awesome person. Cares about her students but makes you freaking work for it. But she is fair, if you work hard you will get the grade you want, and you know exactly what is expected."
796,1900837,4.5,4.0,"Stats was not an easy class. You really had to put the work in, but Prof Flynt was extremely clear with what she was looking for and what you had to do to get the grades you wanted. She begged us to come to office hours, all she wanted to do was help! I loved her. If you have to take stats, take it with Flynt."
797,1900837,4.0,4.0,"I loved professor Flynt's stats class!  You have to work for it and she can be a tough grader sometimes, but if you are precise on quizzes and tests and know the material, you'll be fine.  "
798,1900837,2.5,4.0,Please do not take Stats with this professor. She's a very unreasonable grader and expects you to remember complicated definitions rather that understand the concept. Takes 3 points off a 20 point lab for not stapling. Very condescending. Homework and worksheets prepare you barely at all for exams. Take this class with anyone else.
799,1900837,3.5,4.0,"Flynt is clear when she is teaching and I feel that I understand the material well, however she is a ridiculous grader.  She takes off two points for the tiniest issues like forgetting a word that's not even crucial in a definition.  She also comes across as rather cold during office hours.  You learn a lot but it doesn't show in your grade.  "
800,1900837,5.0,3.0,Prof Flynt is sooooo sweet! And she also makes it super easy to understand the material. Def a good class =)
801,1900837,2.5,5.0,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS TEACHER! She is totally unreasonable in terms of her expectations, grading, tests and absurd amounts of work. She grades everything including homework extremely hard and her tests are impossible. Her class is structured but she treated her students like middle school rebels because of her strictness and inflexibility."
802,370985,1.0,5.0,"I agree with the other person, but just know that if she feels that you aligned with the other end of the hallway, your life will not be pleasant."
803,370985,4.5,4.0,"She is a great voice teacher.  Staying on her good side is important.  If you work hard she will respect you and teach you alot. If you are willing to work hard at voice, she is great.  If you don't really plan to work hard then don't bother."
804,370985,5.0,4.0,I absolutely love Kay Payn!!!
805,370985,2.5,3.0,"I agree with some of these other reviews. Stay on this woman's good side. I used to be and she treated me ROYALLY then I came to be on her bad side and she made my life hell. If you're on her good side, you will flourish and she can be a truly excellent professor and kind friend. I am not the only one upon whose ass she has turned vicious and evil."
806,370985,2.0,4.0,Stay on her good side!
807,370985,1.0,5.0,"Very unclear and intimidating.....horrible pedagogue, and in general very bitter."
808,370985,5.0,4.0,Great teacher...but very tough and demanding.
809,180522,4.5,4.0,"Tough subject, but Tillman makes it as clear as possible.  If you do each worksheet he posts after each class, you will do well in his class.  Very helpful during office hours and cool to talk to on a personal level as well."
810,180522,5.0,3.0,"This class required a lot of time studying and doing worksheets. Between lecture, sample problems, and review sessions, Tillman explains everything that you will see on an exam. Second semester requires you to stay on top of things, but Tillman is helpful during office hours.  Sample exams are similar to actual exams.  Great teacher overall!"
811,180522,4.5,3.0,"Best professor I've had while at Bucknell.  Gives extremely helpful lectures, and you learn everything you need to know for the quizzesexams in class.  If you do all the worksheets and go to class, Tillman makes orgo more than doable. Highly recommend."
812,180522,4.0,4.0,"Tillman is one of my favorite professors so far. He's very good at teaching Organic Chemistry, and I love the class because of his influence. He's got a good sense of humor on top of it, and lab with him is generally pretty relaxed. Very good teacher and I'm excited to be taking Organic 212 with him next semester! "
813,180522,4.5,4.0,"Tillman is hard, but he is arguably the best organic teacher.  I have heard from prior students he prepares you the best for the MCAT.  It takes work to do well, but you will definitely learn the most from him.  It's obvious how much he knows about organic chemistry and how smart he is. I definitely recommend him."
814,180522,5.0,3.0,He makes orgo easier than it should be.  I didn't put in the effort I should have to do better though.  He's really nice and wants you to do well.  I recommend using Klein's Organic Chemistry as a second language book to learn the material you don't understand
815,180522,1.5,4.0,Tillman is a very unfair professor and chooses favorites immediately. You have to sit in the front rows in his class or else he thinks you are automatically a slacker. Very elitist mindset and talks down to people who ask him questions. He grades unfairly and if you are one of the unlucky ones he singles out then you must go fight for points back
816,180522,3.5,4.0,"Really, really good lecturer, but the class is very hard, and its not all his fault. After all, its organic chemistry; it's supposed to be challenging."
817,180522,3.5,5.0,"Tillman is definitely the best organic chem professor here. When I say best I mean that he teaches the material well and you learn, however, he is hard. His exam questions often through you for a loop. You really have to understand the material to do well. I should have gone to him for help more often but he is intimidating (to me, others disagree)"
818,180522,4.5,5.0,"Probably the most skilled lecturer I've had at Bucknell after 2 years. Everything is usually clear after he teaches it the first time. If he is condescending, it was probably a stupid question. He is difficult; tests will have trick questions. Do all the worksheets and sample quizzes as he posts them. Kerber's orgo class is easier if it exists."
819,180522,4.0,5.0,"I'm glad I had Tillman for orgo, he has a great sense of humor and explained the material very clearly. The info was not too hard to keep up with 1st semester, but be sure to stay on top of things 2nd semester! He offers a lot of practice material and review sessions, which really helped me get used to the problems."
820,180522,1.0,5.0,He was a horrible and arrogant professor. He moved very fast and always made students feel stupid for asking questions by responding with a condescending tone.
821,180522,5.0,3.0,"Organic Chemistry is a difficult class, but Tillman makes things easy to understand. He is extremely helpful and smart. Plus, he is hott which can't hurt ;)"
822,180522,5.0,4.0,Tillman is a fantastic professor. He really knows his stuff and is passionate about it. He is always available for help or just to talk. He's a really cool guy and the best professor I've had.
823,180522,5.0,5.0,"LOVE HIM! He's an amazing teacher and always available to help. It almost makes me wish I didn't hate chemistry and could take him again. One of Bucknell's best, if not the best."
824,180522,5.0,3.0,He is the best teacher I've ever had!
825,180522,4.5,5.0,"Probably the best teacher i've had at bucknell in terms of &quot;teaching ability&quot;. he's a really nice, smart, cool guy and explains the material very well, but it's still orgo. chemistry, and he's known as one of the hardest profs. in the department, DO NOT TAKE SHAWE FOR 211 THEN SWITCH INTO TILLMAN'S CLASS FOR 212, you will get owned."
826,180522,4.0,2.0,"He's an awesome professor. If you stay on top of the material, his exams aren't really too hard. He explains everything really well in class :)"
827,180522,3.5,5.0,"He knows his subject and teaches it well.  However, he has a tendency to go fast and his tests are really hard."
828,180522,5.0,4.0,"Tillman is awesome...Very helpful, made worksheets & answer keys and practice exams and quizzes. He always explained things well and made sure you got it...Which is good because he's definitely not easy. He's my favorite professor at Bucknell."
829,180522,4.5,5.0,"I switched to a different section for 212 so my grades could reflect the effort and work I put into the class. He's really hard, but helpful and a nice guy."
830,180522,4.0,3.0,"not an easy class, but it's doable.  lecture is all note taking which is fine.  tests are difficult, especially if you don't study. but even still, he asks those lame questions that he didn't really go over in class so you have to be a genius to get them. lecture can get very fast paced sometimes which is annoying. prob the best orgo prof. though."
831,180522,5.0,5.0,"Tillman is a great teacher, although his tests are extremely hard and much different from the practice exams"
832,180522,5.0,4.0,"Great professor..lectures are very helpful and clear. Anyone that says tillman is a bad professor has not put enough time in the class, its not high school anymore and you cant expect tillman to just give you an A. It's a challenging subject but  tillman does a great job of clarifying it and is always there for help."
833,180522,5.0,3.0,he is awesome. end of story. chem is a hard subject but he wants you to do well and does his best to help you
834,180522,4.5,4.0,I dreaded organic chemistry but Prof. Tillman made it so much easier. It's a hard class but he gives lots of practice tests and quizzes and worksheets. He wants you to do well.
835,180522,4.5,3.0,"Tilly (yes we have a nickname for him) is an amazing professor.  He seems kind of boring at first, but try sitting in the front row... he will come to love you and you will LOVE him back... I thought Orgo would be a nightmare, but I actually liked it because of him!!!"
836,180522,4.5,3.0,"Definately the best of the organic teachers, extremely organized and does practice quizzes/exams and goes over them in recitation. Don't miss recitation, it will definately help."
837,180522,2.5,4.0,"He definitely has favorites and if you are a favorite, he will love you, and if you aren't, well good luck figuring out Ochem on your own.  Either way though, it's likely he will pass you in the end.  As for tests, if you can do exams that are almost all spatial skills and little to no factual information then you'll be find."
838,180522,5.0,1.0,"Tillman is an amazing professor, one of the best at Bucknell. He is very clear, and you know what to expect on tests, which are fair (easy if you're prepared). Worksheets and practice exams are very helpful, and lectures are structured and at a good pace. Definitely take Tillman for orgo!"
839,180522,5.0,2.0,tillman is awesome. do your work and study. thats how you get an A. college doesnt work like high school when you could just show up and earn over a 4.0 ****es.
840,180522,4.0,3.0,"Extremly helpful, gives worksheets and practice tests. Explains everyting very clearly"
841,180522,2.0,5.0,"Ok, this professor is the reason I changed my major.  He refuses to help - prefers instead to insinuate that you are not smart enough.  His tests, while they contain what he discussed in class, are hugely long and no one finishes before he calls time at least twice.  I'd stay away."
842,180522,4.5,3.0,No Comments
843,180522,5.0,2.0,"extremely helpful, gives great worksheets to review from, no surprises on tests just what youre expecting, lectures are very clear"
844,180522,4.5,3.0,"Very helpful with questions.  Lectures move fast, but they make sense.  He explains things well and is very organized.  Good for lab too.  He's also nice to look at."
845,180522,5.0,3.0,"Great guy, very available for help.  Gives lots of optional worksheets to help with problems.  Try and take him for organic chem."
846,180522,4.5,3.0,HES HOTTT
847,168236,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor, incredibly knowledgeable not only the subject matter but many other topics as well. He has been doing this for so long and he know exactly what students need to grow. Really the only limitation is students who are unable to do the work required. Highly recommend."
848,168236,3.5,4.0,"Spends too much time telling stories, not teaching"
849,168236,3.0,5.0,"Abe is way too hardcore in all ways possible.  Nice at first but  can turn on you.  Hard grader, offers little help, expects students to actually get what he's saying no matter what."
850,168236,5.0,2.0,"engaging and funny, gets his point across and has fun hands-on projects. abe is a very friendly guy who will tell stories for hours if you catch him at the right time."
851,168236,2.5,4.0,No Comments
852,168236,5.0,3.0,"He is a truly great prof, who really cares that we understand his material. He is also incredibly intelligent, which is apparent in his lectures and labs."
853,168236,4.5,4.0,"Dr. A. is a great professor! He's a bit too excited about his gall research but what world-reknowned prof wouldn't be&#63;  Any problems or questions, just walk right into his office and ask - he's very approachable and he must check his email every minute of every day!"
854,168236,4.0,3.0,Shouldn't turn the lights off when giving powerpoint presentations.
855,1116461,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Bailey can come off quite daunting, but at the end of the day he cares about his students, and he will work with you both inside and outside of class to make sure you're understanding the course material. He has a tendency to go fast and blow through topics quickly, but if you take the time to ask questions, he will slow down. Great guy!"
856,1116461,4.0,4.0,"He is an excellent professor - engaging, uses real world examples, makes an effort to review material, you name it! Operations is very information heavy but he does an amazing job teaching it in an accessible way. He is hard to find outside of office hours but the BEST at responding to emails. You definitely have to work hard and pay attention."
857,1116461,5.0,4.0,"I had Professor Bailey for both MGMT 102 and 202. He's a very tough but difficult grader. I have no regrets taking his classes, he really makes you LEARN the material. I feel extremely comfortable with excel now compared to never touching it going into his class. Just make sure you go to his office hours and try not to miss a class, it'll hurt."
858,1116461,5.0,1.0,Great professor. Loves what he does and is very good at getting his point across.
859,1116461,5.0,4.0,"Anyone who says Bailey is not a good prof is either did not work hard in his class I've never been challenged/learned as much in my life than with Bailey; however, I became a master in Excel, which is super important in the business world Once you understand the hours required to Ace the exams, you will succeed Hard A, Hard not to get at least a B"
860,1116461,4.0,4.0,"I really liked Bailey as a professor. He was very upfront- if you didn't pay attention in class or didn't do the homework, you were going to struggle. He was willing to help me when I needed it. His lectures were very helpful and demonstrated how to do everything and how we can use it in future jobs."
861,1116461,2.5,5.0,"Professor Bailey is a great professor if you are going to be an excel professional. Otherwise, he absolutely the hardest professor I have ever had and I'm a Physics Major. Definitely expects too much from his students."
862,1116461,3.5,3.0,Tough grader initially but explains it as it goes on. Course gets easier over time if you can learn from his feedback. Very smart and respected person. Only got a B+ because I didn't do the best on my mid-term but it was very possible to do. 
863,1116461,3.5,3.0,You will learn a lot in baileys class and he is a funny and interesting guy. Do the problem sets and take notes and you will be fine 
864,1116461,3.5,3.0,Overall classy guy
865,1116461,1.5,5.0,"He is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He goes way too fast and expects student to figure everything out on their own. He'll respond clearly if you go to him, but I should be able to know how to do all of this from his class, not because I had to search the depths on the Earth to guess how he wants something formatted. "
866,1116461,4.5,4.0,"This class is hard in general but Bailey is absolutely brilliant and is really helpful when you ask questions. He is a great professor but will make you work. I really enjoyed taking the class with him and I learned a lot of very real world relevant material. If you're willing to put in some effort, taking this class with him is rewarding."
867,1116461,1.5,5.0,Such a hard class and he makes it that way. The material isn't that bad he just finds the most confusing and unclear way to explain it. He means well but he doesn't tend to understand why we don't get things sometimes.
868,1116461,2.5,4.0,"He's used to teaching grad students who have some sort of background in this material. He assumes that college kids with no background in the material can comprehend everything on the grad student level. therefore he goes very fast, and is unclear a lot of the time."
869,1116461,1.5,5.0,Real hard teacher. He is not very helpful and has a big ego. He seems to think that by making work hard and unclear that he is doing his students a favor in the long run when he can actually make things a lot easier for his students. I would stay away
870,1116461,1.5,5.0,Strict and extremely unclear. He writes all of his hw questions very subtly so that you cant determine what the question is asking easily. He talks way too fast and is way to smart. He is not a people person and doesn't remember his own advisees names. He works another job and is never on campus. Never thought 242 would be that hard.
871,1116461,3.5,4.0,"Really passionate about his subject and students. He really wants to see you learn and succeed, but does teach at a fast pace. If you pay attention and really want to do well in his class you will be fine, but if you're looking for an easy A this is not it. You come away from his class learning a lot. DO NOT SKIP CLASS."
872,1116461,3.5,4.0,"He is a nice and helpful professor, but he does go too fast with the course material sometimes. He is more than willing to help you out during his office hours and he can get very annoyed with absenteeism and getting late to class. Overall, this class does require you to make an effort if you want an A."
873,1116461,2.0,4.0,AWFUL Professor. AVOID. Take Banchiu instead (for decision sciences and ops!)
874,1116461,3.0,4.0,"This guy is really nice. But as a professor, he's horrible. Doesn't really know how to grade or teach effectively. His methods need MAJOR tweaking. Avoid his classes. You'll struggle w/a lot of work to learn completely uninteresting material..."
875,1116461,4.0,4.0,"He's a great professor and really wants to see you learn the stuff. There's a lot of work but it's interesting stuff that's not too hard if you follow along in class and don't procrastinate. If you're looking for an easy A this isn't it, but if you're looking to actually learn stuff and be stimulated then he's your man."
876,1116461,4.0,4.0,"Great guy.  His class was challenging, but he was also available and willing to help both during and outside of office hours.  A lot of people weren't happy with him, but if you just take the time to meet with him outside of class, the work really isn't that bad.  You walk away knowing a lot more because of this."
877,1116461,2.0,5.0,"This is a HARD class. Bailey isn't very helpful w/ questions and you'll have to spend alot of time with the $200 book you must buy for this class. The last homework: I know of TWO people who did their own work... and about 15 who completely copied not because they were lazy, but because didn't know how to do it! That's not helping anyone learn."
878,1116461,4.5,5.0,"He is awesome, his class is very challenging and he expects a lot but when you are through with the class you'll feel very accomplished.  Overall great guy with good intentions."

880,1425712,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT take Professor Tlustys foundation course. Ok so about the course, (compared to other foundation seminars) one is given an immense amount of work that is found not only challenging but lacking in purpose. Take this course if you would like to read books (the entire semester) about themes like demon sex and the role of sexism in witchcraft!"
881,1425712,2.0,5.0,"Beware of Witchcraft and Magic foundation seminar. This class is difficult and uninspiring at best. It's a topic that at face value sounds quite cool, but this is primarily a history class on the early modern period and is neither fun, nor educational. There is a large amount of writing and reading for the &quot;reading responses&quot; but your paper is 40%"
882,1425712,2.0,4.0,"Throughout the semester, it was very unclear what we were supposed to learn and the topic of the class was. The quizzes were very unclear and she did not give a realistic idea of how she would be grading anything."
883,1425712,5.0,3.0,"She was my adviser as well, a fantastic teacher, counselor and very understanding.  She is well read and helpful when thinking through papers as well"
884,1425712,4.5,2.0,"She's the best. Extremely helpful, allows 3 absences per semester, really knows what shes talking about, and puts everything up online. There isnt really that much work to turn in - just a lot of reading. And theres no tests which is nice"
885,446770,5.0,3.0,"Para gives really good, blunt feedback-- it's helpful, and not sugarcoated, but it never feels like a personal attack on your musicianship. Because of COVID-19, this class was set up as a chamber group instead of a full orchestra ensemble, but I honestly liked it better that way, and I had a great semester!"
886,446770,5.0,5.0,"Maestro Para is without a doubt the clearest and most precise conductor that I have ever had.  He does diligent research and is always prepared to the utmost degree. He works just as hard, if not harder, than he expects us to,  bringing out the best of both the music and the players. He is a true inspiration. Also, he has a great sense of humor."
887,446770,1.5,5.0,"Worst professor I have had in anything music related.  He is frustrating and doesn't work well with students. He claims he teaches like a conservatory; however, lessons consist of playing through an entire piece with limited, useless comments from him at the end. I have regressed immensely with him as my professor.  Don't take any classes with him."
888,446770,3.0,4.0,"Really has a passion and knows his stuff. Very serious though, absolutely no fooling around. VERY hard if you're not a music major-- he doesn't think anything is more important than orchestra rehearsal. Ridiculously inflexible about anything else going on in your life other than music. Everything else has to be pushed aside or you're kicked out"
889,446770,3.0,2.0,.
890,446770,4.5,4.0,"Attendance is MANDATORY. He goes on about how he wants us to be like a professional, not student, orchestra. You need an excellent excuse to skip it. He's a very fun and fantastic conductor though."
891,446770,3.5,4.0,"Great professor, amazing at all things musical. However, unless you're a music major or have nothing to do except music, don't take orchestra. The time commitment is HUGE and for non-music majors, lengthy practices simply don't fit in your schedule."
892,446770,3.0,4.0,"He's really into his orchestra being a 'professional' one not a 'student' one. He wants most things perfect, but he won't single you out if you're doing badly, usually. He makes the orchestra fun and very good, which is what's most important I guess. Just don't fool around."
893,446770,4.5,2.0,No Comments
894,446770,4.0,4.0,"He's a real stickler about detail and dynamics, but its a good thing. He's also a really sweet guy...and he's pretty wacky too."
895,446770,5.0,2.0,Truly an amazing man. I have never enjoyed playing in an ensemble as  much as I have with him.
896,2492722,1.0,5.0,"He literally wore the same thing two days in a row. And he was called out on it. I mean, why even bother coming to class?"
897,2492722,1.0,1.0,This professor rolls natural ones. And has a -2 modifier.
898,2492722,1.0,5.0,He saw a baby once and screamed at the top of his lungs
899,2492722,1.0,1.0,"Despite what people say, and despite calculating his age based on facts like the year he is born or what his colleagues and students at conferences say ... he is definitely not ""old."" Yes, he may remember the 90s, and his memes are recycled advice animals, and he hates zoomer memes as they make no sense. He's just like 26 or something. Maybe 30."
900,2492722,4.0,3.0,"Hes a great professor, as long as you pay attention in class you will learn most of what you need to know. I loved his class, the final project was a lot of fun, great choice of professor would high recommend"
901,2492722,2.0,3.0,this class was a disorganized mess. there was never clear instructions and rarely instruction. prof said it was hands-on learning but most of the class was heavily reliant on Google. didn't teach coding and a lot of students struggled with project. wouldn't answer questions clearly. once sent Khan academy videos instead of lecturing. don't take.
902,2492722,5.0,2.0,"The lectures are amazing. Homework is a bit hard, but he doesn't grade them hard. He also gives us lots of extra credits."
903,2492722,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Thomas is a smart computer engineer that explains things in a bit fast pace. If you lose attention his class for a minute you may get lost. The homework in ECEG240 was hard and sometimes a bit vague, so a good advice would be to start homework early and go to the professor's office hours. The tests were well structured and not hard."
904,502070,4.0,3.0,"I am not sure why Professor DiStefano gets such bad reviews. He is a knowledgeable, caring, and wants his students to succeed; that can't be said for all professors at Bucknell. His lectures can be dry but he will joke around with you if you get him going. Good teacher, better man, my lover."
905,502070,1.5,3.0,He loves anaerobic treatment and believes you should love it too. He will try to teach a subject he doesn't have a good grasp over.
906,502070,1.5,2.0,Awful professor. One of the worst I have had at Bucknell. He steered me away from going to Environmental because I'd have to take another class with him. Very unclear and boring lectures. And he is the biased grader I have ever encountered.
907,502070,1.5,1.0,Take his class only no other prof is offering. You will learn very little and he will put you to sleep.
908,502070,1.5,2.0,"You could get good grades, but don't expect to learn anything from this class."
909,502070,1.0,2.0,Boring. The only thing he will teach is how important his recommendation could be. Very arrogant. Unclear. Ask him if he is in contact with any of his former student. No one likes to be in contact him.
910,502070,4.5,4.0,Hard but you learn a ton (only had him for lab). People who say he's to hard typically are lazy and are wasting their parents money trying to get by without learning
911,502070,2.0,1.0,Provides handouts that are not edited. Quiz will have questions not discussed in class. An engineering professor with very low understanding of mathematics. Nervous in clas and laughs inadvertently in between teaching. Does not feel comfortable in front of students. Don't ask him for recommendation for grad school/employment.
912,502070,2.0,3.0,"boring, unclear and can be a little arrogant. Dont take his class in the morning but if youre a CivE youre probably not gonna have a choice"
913,502070,3.0,2.0,"i only had him for a ENGR100 seminar, but he is not a great prof. he's goofy, and he didn't teach the material very effectively. he's not hard though, and he is approachable, so you could do worse"
914,2492727,5.0,5.0,"Taking a music class is not easy for people who do not have musical ears which was my problem. This class was interesting but hard in terms of listening exercises. Prof. Caravan is so dynamic and you can never fall asleep in her class, and she is so nice as well. Also, you have to not be late for class."
915,880958,5.0,3.0,A very great professor. The class sometimes gets pretty derailed but it normally leads to a greater understanding of culture even if we end up missing certain language practice. Homework is a manageable amount. Work load feels fair and good. Professor Lavine is incredibly accessible outside of class and nice to talk to.
916,880958,5.0,3.0,"RUSS250 Crimes and Punishments Russian Classics in Translations, a literature course of 3 classics of Pushkin, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy. Prof. Lavine journeys students through these amazing reads with her incredible level of scholarly expertise that one wouldnt get by reading these novels alone."
917,880958,4.0,4.0,"Great professor, however beware of the reading. I was reading about 120 pages a week for the class. Overall, she keeps the class engaged and she is very caring and accommodating outside of the classroom."
918,880958,4.0,1.0,"Luda is very passionate about what she teaches and she is an easy grader, all homework is for completion and quizzes are pretty easy and non-cumulative. She made me want to minor in Russian."
919,880958,5.0,3.0,By far the best teacher I have ever had. I loved Professor Lavine. She convinced me to be a Russian major when I came to Bucknell ready to drop Russian. Definitely very interested in her field of study. Take her!!!!
920,880958,4.0,2.0,No Comments
921,909637,5.0,3.0,Nicest lady you will ever meet and she genuinely cares about her students.  The quizzes are open book and you have a partner but she does this because she will be a very picky grader so that you are prepared for the tests.  She is maybe one of the best people and best professors I have had at Bucknell
922,1487174,2.0,5.0,"Just a horrible professor. It seems difficult for her to present any information to an audience in a comfortable and sensible fashion. Do not take. She knows her stuff, but can not teach it."
923,1487174,2.0,4.0,"Nice, but very inexperienced at teaching. Class is extremely boring because of subject matter and because she only teaches off of powerpoints. It takes her over a month to grade most labs and tests, which are both graded pretty hard for how little she goes into the subject matter. Don't take anything with her."
924,2492747,5.0,2.0,"Math genius and MatLab pro. Go to his office hours to get help, it will definitely make a difference. Overall both ECEG270 and 370 were easy with him. Gives practice exams that help you prepare for the upcoming exams. Labs are just MatLab but definitely possible to finish during lab time. Fair grader and does not assign lots of homework."
925,2492747,5.0,2.0,"This class is so well designed. It is hard, but if you go to office hours at least once a week, you'll be fine as he goes over any homework question you have then. He is clear about what will be on exams so you can prepare accordingly. Lab feels disconnected from lecture and is mostly MATLAB, but can completed within the lab period."
926,2492747,5.0,3.0,"Professor Nickel is excellent in Mathematics, and his lectures help students with limited math ability to learn well. Homework is very, very, very hard, with most students go to his office hours every week. Exams are not hard, and the professor will help you review sample exam questions before the exam. Labs are not hard, but his grades them hard."
927,2492747,5.0,3.0,Prof. Nickel is an electrical engineer that is brilliant especially at mathematics. His lectures are very interesting. He is very good at showing the use of mathematics as a tool in electrical engineering. His tests are absolutely fair because he shows the system of the test and what to expect beforehand. He is so funny as well. Such a MATLAB Pro.
928,1349967,3.0,4.0,this class is difficult. she often wouldn't finish lectures in time which was stressful and often rushed through the end leaving us lost. her examples and explanations made sense in class but didn't always cover how to do the hw. in PS she was much better and clearer; often because she wasn't rushed. if you want to pass do ALL the hw.
929,1349967,1.0,3.0,She seems organized but it doesn't seem like she's ever taken the time to try to learn how to teach or how to deal with technology. I feel like a lot of the things should have been much simpler than she made them.
930,1349967,4.0,4.0,"Allers can be a really nice teacher, but she is also very hard on students. In my experience, she seemed willing to help students, but not willing to compromise or admit that some of her lessons left people confused. She is also very antiquated and not &quot;up with the times&quot;. I think sometimes she doesn't understand where students are coming from."
931,1349967,5.0,4.0,She's the best!!!!
932,1349967,1.0,5.0,I found Professor Allers to be very condescending and almost unwilling to answer questions. She is undoubtedly my least favorite professor at Bucknell. She makes straightforward concepts deceivingly convoluted. I would absolutely not recommend taking her for PHYS212
933,1349967,4.0,4.0,"Very passionate and intelligent about her work, lectures are very informative and engaging. She is very understanding and caring, but you will still need to put in some serious effort to do well in her class."
934,1349967,5.0,3.0,"Incredibly kind and friendly professor. Truly cares about her students and makes an effort to get to know you, even though this is tough to do in lab. Willing to help and answer your questions. Take 211212 with Allers!!!"
935,1349967,5.0,4.0,"I love Prof Allers, I think she's a great teacher. I loved having her for problem session - she gets right to the point, she's clear and concise, doesn't beat around the bush, and she's tough (in a good way). I don't have her for problem session in 212 and it's making me realize you don't know what you've got til it's gone.. love ya allers"
936,1349967,3.0,2.0,"She is really sweet and nice, but some of her explanations for problems were unclear and hard to follow."
937,1349967,3.0,4.0,Our Solar System class- its such a big class that is it understandable that she cannot help everyone all at once.  She does not really get into detail about what is going on and does not slow down.  Labs are decent but overall the class is boring.
938,1349967,3.0,4.0,"The beguiling title of the course &quot;Our Solar System&quot; gives you the impression that you will leave the class knowing how to make a styrofoam model of the solar system. However, although Prof. Allers has incredible passion for astronomy, she doesn't realize the rest of us don't. Too specific on exams and a little bad at explaining most concepts."
939,1349967,3.5,2.0,Very passionate about astronomy but is a poor teacher. Does not go over the material clearly or with much depth. Taking AP physics before astronomy 101 is the only reason I got a good grade.
940,1349967,4.0,2.0,She is a phenomenal teacher with a well organized method of teaching which helps to understand difficult topics. Her in-class demonstrations and attitude keep things fun and interesting. She is a great professor to have if you are a non science major. Always willing to help if you ask.
941,1349967,4.0,4.0,Extremely passionate about astronomy which makes the class interesting. Plus if you catch her on a warm day you can see her tat of the solar system that stretches from her left shoulder to mid back.
942,1349967,3.5,4.0,"The large lecture format can be boring sometimes.  She is really passionate about astronomy, and will go to great lengths to help you outside of class.  Sometimes she overestimates students' understanding an ability, and sometimes does not explain things clearly."
943,1349967,5.0,2.0,"Definately a good choice for non-science people who need to get that lab requirement.  Way more interesting than other courses and really not difficult.  Exams were directly from powerpoints and required little analysis or understanding, just spit back the answers to the questions we'd go over in class.  Really nice lady who wants you to do well."
944,1349967,5.0,2.0,There is no reason you shouldn't do well in her class.  Homework assignments are short but difficult.  If you go to her office hours (which she loves) she tells you exactly how to to do all the problems.  Tests came directly from in-class activities and powerpoints.  Some questions were even the same. Super nice and always willing to help.
945,1349967,5.0,3.0,I think that the negative comments for Professor Allers are just from people who are unwilling to put any time or effort into the course. If you spend a decent amount of time studying for exams and do all the homework assignments (you can get 100% on them since theyre online) you'll do fine. I would recommend this class for everyone-i learned a ton
946,1349967,1.5,5.0,"Terrible class. The tests were incredibly hard for a 101 class and especially for non-science majors. She's relatively nice outside of class but the tests given were insane. No matter how hard you study or try to learn the material, unless you're naturally amazing at astronomy, you won't do well. Would NOT recommend."
947,1349967,4.5,4.0,"Really tough course - but I learned a lot. Had to work hard for this one, but it is doable."
948,1349967,2.5,4.0,She's very organized. She'll help you but you have to make it happen outside of class. You need to put forth significant effort to understand material. Her tests are a lot harder than first-level course tests should be. This isn't an easy class. The averages of two tests were 68%. Lots of work. Worst class of my semester. My classmates agree.
949,1349967,5.0,4.0,"Taking the final for this class soon and I was a bit nervous, I feel like the offered study sessions have helped a lot. Not a subject I was interested in at first, but I now find it really interesting. Great class."
950,1349967,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Allers is very accessible and willing to help her students. Your performance in the class depends on the amount of time you spend studying the material. If you attend lectures and study for exams, you will do great in this class"
951,1349967,3.0,4.0,No Comments
952,1581392,3.0,5.0,"Very hard course.  Quizzes are very hard (quiz every week).  Harsh grader.  Lots of reading and writing assignments.  Group Case write ups due every so often.  individual Papers in addition.  No exams, except final exam which was impossible.  Grading is very subjective and not a single student did well."
953,1581392,5.0,3.0,"She had to cover a lot of material so we moved fast and the class often felt rushed. There were weekly quizzes that weren't too bad and helped you keep pace. The tests were fair but hard. The personal budget project was very informative, eye-opening, and pertinent. She is available for help. She is professional and serious, but still caring."
954,778581,5.0,3.0,"Sweetest professor ever! Clearly cares a great deal about her students and is so passionate about dance history. The only thing I would say is that most of lectures are spoken so if you're a visual learner it might be a bit more difficult for you, but definitely still manageable."
955,778581,5.0,1.0,"WONDERFUL HUMAN! She is an incredible dancer, teacher, and person. She is incredibly understanding and caring - especially since this was an introductory level dance course. She is so inspiring and you will learn so much from her regardless of your dance background or interest."
956,778581,5.0,3.0,"Kelly is actually the most amazing professor I've ever had the pleasure of working with. She is so passionate about what she does and it makes it easy for students to relate to that passion and explore creativity in a safe and welcoming environment. Also, she is such a gorgeous dancer it's beyond insane. Take her class if you love yourself, please."
957,778581,5.0,2.0,Kelly is a true gift from the heavens. I've never met a professor that is so passionate about what they do. Her love for dance and its history made the class 10x more interesting. Not to mention she is truly hilarious and such a joy to be around. Take class with Kelly Knox if you ever get the chance! You wont regret it!!
958,778581,5.0,2.0,Kelly is amazing! She's the wind beneath my fleas! Great professor and loves helping her students!
959,778581,5.0,3.0,OMG! She's a great professor! She's super duper hot and funny! And her teeth are whiter than lambs! She's an amazing professor! Lover her!
960,778581,3.0,4.0,"Good teacher in dance classes but for theory courses (i.e. composition) she's a ****...and if you're not a modern dancer to the core, forget about it. Very unforgiving and unwilling to respect you."
961,778581,5.0,5.0,Kelly is a great dance history teacher! It is however a lot of work for a class in the dance department.  Don't take dance history unless you are truely interested in the subject.
962,778581,5.0,2.0,Kelly is fabulous! Had her for modern and Dance conditioning. They are both fun classes but you will defintely get a good work out every class in Dance conditioning (esp. abs) ;)
963,778581,5.0,3.0,"Kelly!!! She is the best dance instructor in my life (jazz dance technique)! Very nice, friendly, cheerful, witty. And very-very professional! Thanks! Sasha"
964,778581,5.0,3.0,So amazing - everyone should be required to take a class with her.
965,1530209,4.0,2.0,good professor if you like econ
966,1530209,3.5,3.0,He knows the material and is very good at explaining it but he tries to move too fast at times. The homework is easy and worth a lot so the class is not hard and the work helps directly on the tests.
967,1530209,3.0,2.0,He can be confusing at times but he will help you if you need it. There isn't very much homework
968,1530209,3.5,1.0,He was a good teacher. While his lectures can sometimes be confusing his tests are based EXACTLY off the problem sets and text book. Problem sets count for so much and are so easy. If you have any questions office hours are so useful. In a one-on-one setting everything is explained clearly. If you make an average effort you can easily get an A.
969,1530209,1.5,4.0,"I took ECON103 because I had an interest in it, however Prof. Lopez quickly put an end to it. He teaches very little, and he expects most of the learning to be done on his problem sets (which are hard). His incomprehensible lectures are based out of the $200 book, so if you read you'll do ok, but don't count on him for teaching you anything."
970,1530209,1.5,5.0,"extremely difficult to follow in class, speaks very quickly and does not explain anything thoroughly. problem sets are very hard, unrelated to the text book, and not well explained in class. avoid at all costs, you will get a bad grade."
971,1530209,3.0,4.0,"Need to work in this class to do well.  His problem sets require time and effort.  Tests weren't that bad.  If you are having trouble with certain things his office hours are very useful, if you didnt go to class he wont help you."
972,383337,1.0,5.0,"Ziemian is nice and funny and tries to make lecture fun but 90% of class is writing notes. I should warn you that it was coding heavy with little to no help. He gives you a scientific calculator for exams, doesn't allow equation sheets, doesn't release hw answers, and makes students feel dumb when questions are asked. Overall, I do not recommend."
973,383337,2.0,5.0,"if you are taking and upper-level class with man, get ready for it to be your whole life if you want to pass. This man is OBSESSED with structural engineering which is both a gift and a curse. He expects way too much out of his students and grades them very much accordingly. You will learn but he'll always leave you feeling stupid."
974,383337,3.5,5.0,"Very tough teacher, often strays in lecture to non-related material.  Very knowledgable, and interested in his teaching.  If you are not very devoted and focused, do not take his higher level classes"
975,383337,5.0,5.0,The best professor I've ever had at Bucknell. He is very clear about everything he teaches. Very passionate about his area and demanding student's love in the course to take his class.
976,383337,4.5,5.0,"Professor Ziemian is the reason why I chose the structural route within the discipline of civil engineering. His passion and excitement for structures is contagious and his discipline and demanding curriculum prepared me well. As a practicing engineer for 8 years, I look back fondly on my course work with Ziemian. I highly recommend him."
977,383337,2.5,5.0,Lame.  Screwed me over.  Had him for the seminar and final project.  Will lower grades to make the average be a C.  Harsh.  No reward for honesty or integrity.  Does not reward hard work.  Misleading about test content.
978,383337,4.0,4.0,very very fair. difficult prof. got a C. tough grader. but very very fair. i have no complaints. hes pretty funny as well.
979,383337,4.5,4.0,"Demands your best in everything.  He is a stickler for following guidelines and format, but at the same time he is an incredible teacher.  His lectures were some of the most interesting and fun to listen to.  All in all, you learn a ton and have a good time, but you have to be willing to work hard."
980,383337,5.0,4.0,"Ziemian designs buildings, so if one falls, it’s his butt.  Thus, he is very serious about following guidelines.  Still, he is just about the nicest and most enthusiastic teacher one could ask for.  Plus, very clear.  I am opting to take a class of his next semester, and I suggest that you do too."
981,383337,5.0,4.0,nice guy.  tough but makes it interesting
982,383337,5.0,4.0,"Outstanding professor!  Hard, but you'll learn a ton, and he's an incredibly approachable and helpful guy."
983,2435438,1.0,4.0,Professor Williams is outright condescending and rude to students. She expects you to be experts on each lecture topics and her slides posted on moodle rarely contain any of the information that you are supposed to know. She also grades very harshly. Do not take her. All other genetics professors let their students have cheat sheets on exams...
984,2435438,1.0,3.0,"She never seemed like she wanted to be in class. I think if we all dropped dead in the middle of lecture, she wouldn't change the way she was teaching. Consistently bad at explaining the concepts and PowerPoints weren't very helpful. She assumes we all have an advanced understanding of genetics. Significantly more content than other sections."
985,2435438,2.0,4.0,Somehow made 207 harder than 205. Lectures weren't bad in themselves but exam questions and worksheets seemed to have no connection to them. Simply did not respond to my emails. Not good at explaining things when she's asked a question. Seems kinda judgy.
986,2435438,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I've ever had. She is rude, and she thinks she is too good for her job. You can tell she doesn't like college students and is reluctant to answer questions or emails kindly. Don't expect her to explain anything you don't understand. She constantly contradicts the textbook but also teaches straight out of it. Incredibly confusing."
987,2435438,2.0,5.0,"This professor is eh. I changed my rating to 2 to be fairer because she does give some extra credit and reviews, but get ready to teach yourself. Her lectures are a lil boring and she expects everyone to know right off the bat what to do. She has lots of hw which will help you prepare for the tests, but they're difficult too. Good luck with this..."
988,2435438,1.0,5.0,"She really doesn't care about her students, and it shows. Condescending and rude, and her homework is on topics she barely/did not explain in class. Do not take her classes."
989,2435438,1.0,3.0,"I had her for Bio 205 Lab at Bucknell. So unwilling to help her students with lab reports. Doesn't care about the success of her students. Instead she stresses out about grading things, although she never returns any graded work, so you can't learn from your mistakes. This being said, unclear grading guidelines."
990,2085233,1.0,3.0,Do you want a prof so PC it hurts? Then you have found the perfect one. I would never take her classes again. Doesn't lecture just makes you do readings and uses lecture for nothing.
991,467319,5.0,4.0,"Professor Ueli Daepp is a stellar professor, and I think he definitely deserves a high score. His courses are challenging, but very rewarding."
992,467319,2.5,4.0,He doesn't like to give partial credit. He always has a tough true and false section on tests which are slightly impossible.
993,467319,4.5,4.0,Professor Daepp is an amazing professor. Really knows his stuff and likes to crack a joke every now and then. 
994,467319,4.5,3.0,"Very good professor, wrote a book for one of the classes at Bucknell and was head of the Math Department. He has a swiss accent (which I think is cool) but it clear to understand. he gives a LOT of homework but he will train you very well in the secret arts of Math. I'm taking a class with him again this semester. Also, go to Office Hours!!"
995,467319,2.5,4.0,confusing in class.  office hours are helpful.  class is difficult
996,467319,3.5,4.0,"You pick up his accent quite quickly, and although the material is hard, if you go see him in office hours he will go through everything very thoroughly with you."
997,467319,1.5,4.0,Awful professor. He can never explain himself well. And his accent definitely doesn't help. Take from someone like McGuire. He's the man
998,467319,2.0,4.0,"You don't get much out of his lectures, you basically end up teaching yourself through the textbook.  linear algebra was much harder than it needed to be.  only take this class if you really like math. and doing proofs"
999,467319,3.5,3.0,"A nice guy but he could use a little help with lectures.  He does mostly example problems really, not much teaching at all.  So, unless you get things just from examples, or you think you can interpret the book, go for it."
1000,467319,2.5,3.0,"He seemed to know what he was talking about during the class, but most of the students didn't have a clue.  If you are very math oriented he will be a good fit, but if you need to have more than just problems thrown on the board at you, stay away."
1001,467319,5.0,4.0,"Had him a while ago. Yeah, he has an accent, but it doesnt make him difficult to understand, it just makes his speech less smooth. Good at explaining, and can even help you with physics, really great teacher to take."
1002,467319,5.0,4.0,good
1003,467319,2.5,3.0,He is not a very hard prof. but doesnt explain stuff very well. You will be fine in his class if you are a self-study person. His tests are mostly rather easy.
1004,467319,2.0,4.0,"Uli is a bunch of joy before your first test...(cute accent, beard, a nice burret) then you realize that the accent stops you from learning and his explinations dont make sense(unless you are very good at the math language). He explains things better during office hours if you can make them."
1005,467319,2.5,3.0,"ueli isn't really a hard prof, but he isn't a good one...he doesn't speak english very well, and he has a think accent. he's helfup in that he is approachable, but his help isn't very, well, helpful. the class time is basically a waste, he doesn't teach you, he just does problems. avoid if possible"
1006,467319,3.0,3.0,"A good professor overall. I'd recommend him; he's from Switzerland so he can be tough to understand, but he's a reall nice guy."
1007,467319,1.5,5.0,Makes calculus II much harder than it has to be. His explainations are as clear as mud and his office hours are at horrible times. He is a very nice guy but not so hot as a calc prof.
1008,467319,3.5,4.0,Makes calculus 2 waaaaay harder than it has to be and cannot keep u awake at 8 am in the morning.  He tries hard to help answer questions tho and he does the best he can with a Thursday 8 a.m. recitation class at bucknell.

1012,467322,5.0,2.0,Very sweet and a good teacher. Class-discussion heavy and readings were decently interesting. Attendance is very important to her but the class goes by somewhat quickly. A few papers but she asked for feedback on her teaching methods at the end and seems very open to changes and suggestions. I recommend her taking her class. 
1013,467322,5.0,1.0,"Sue Ellen is the sweetest human ever. She is also an amazing teacher because she facilitates great discussions that keeps you engaged and wanting to learn more. EDUC101 is a labor based class, and the grading format is very clear and straight forward, like a check list. If you complete the check list of assignments, you get an A! I LOVE HER!"
1014,467322,5.0,1.0,"Sue Ellen is an incredible professor. The class is labor-based, and she sets specific and clear outlines from day one. She makes the guidelines attainable, and not too much work. However, get ready to read. There are 20-40 pages of reading before each class which the discussions are based on so make sure to actually do the readings. No quiz/test"
1015,467322,5.0,2.0,This course changed my life. Multiculturalism was taught in a respected and great way that allowed our class to be honest and real about tough subjects and gain invaluable perspective. It does involve a lot of reading and writing but you won't mind doing it.
1016,467322,4.0,2.0,"She is a really kind woman who cares a lot about her students and the work they give. She does not give tests but will make sure you do all of the readings, forum posts, and essays. Easy enough if you just put the effort in for at least the first 3/4 of the semester then you can slack a bit because it is contract grading"
1017,467322,5.0,2.0,"The class is really interesting. She is my favorate teacher in Bucknell. Her teaching method is very special, a lot of discussion and reading, not much writing work. Very generous on grading and a lot of extra credit."
1018,467322,5.0,2.0,Great teacher
1019,467322,5.0,2.0,"Such a good class.  It's interesting, especially if you want to go into education, but even if not its great.  It's never dull, the work load is just right, and theres no tests.  She's such a nice person and willing to help you with anything and everything."
1020,467322,3.5,2.0,This class is very interesting and Sue Ellen has an obvious interest in the topic.  She stimulates class discussion well and has many intriguing exercises in class.  She frequently holds class too late (and it is a 3 hour class).  Attendance is mandatory and she has no understanding for anyone missing class.  The service learning aspect of the clas
1021,467322,5.0,2.0,Best teacher I had at Bucknell.  Truly cares about her students and education in general.
1022,467322,5.0,2.0,"Really cares about the students in her class.  Is understanding and grades easily.  She is always in interested in creating class discussion and she really uses the educating methods she makes us read about.  All in all, I'd definitely recommend her for this glass. A great professor."
1023,467322,4.5,3.0,"If I can just have a few professors as nice and caring as Sue Ellen Henry while I am in college will be lucky.  Lot's of work given, but she is extremely approachable and always willing to help.  I reccomend her to anyone."
1024,467322,5.0,3.0,"very friendly! she takes the time to get to know everyone. no tests, only a few quizzes, lots of discussions. you have to go tutor at the elementary school for her class, which was a surprisingly good experience. enjoyable class"
1025,467322,4.0,1.0,shes the sweetest teacher and isnt a hard grader.  there are no tests and only rarely quizzes with plenty of time to get all the work done
1026,467322,4.5,3.0,No Comments
1027,467322,5.0,5.0,"She's a great teacher and she's very friendly, but oh my god, she gives way too much work"
1028,70012,4.5,1.0,Great professor...really loves what she teaches!
1029,70012,5.0,2.0,"An exceptional teacher who is clearly an expert in her field. Stimulates class discussion without any effort whatsoever, and class time flies by as a result. One of the best teachers I have ever had and certainly one of the best that Bucknell has to offer. Take this class!"
1030,70012,5.0,2.0,No Comments
1031,70013,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I have ever had.
1032,70013,3.0,4.0,This guy cannot teach. He designs the course to have a certain amount of work every class. However he hardly ever finishes it. He solves about extremely simple questions in each topic and gives much harder questions in the exams homeworks. Dont take his class in my opinion. A good teacher shows you how to do the hard questions before exams.
1033,70013,1.0,5.0,"I'm not sure if this semester is just worse due to zoom, but man. If you're in his class and not a super math-y person, just drop it while you have the chance."
1034,70013,3.0,5.0,"Professor Adams is not as bad as some other criteria say. His class is not bad but really challenging. You must have clear mind and ability to sort out and analyze points by yourself. I have learned a lot by really hard work, yet I do not want to stress myself again. But he could be a choice for those who are confident and want to have challenges."
1035,70013,1.0,4.0,"He makes large numbers of mistakes in class, and his handwriting is not recognizable. Class contents are not clear. We didn't get feedback for many homework. Exam questions aren't clear, filled with mistakes. Grading is unclear, get an A- despite a nearly full score in final. He promotes students to go to office hours and this increases your grade."
1036,70013,1.0,3.0,"I'm begging you guys, don't take a class from this guy. For your own sake. Don't listen to the rating from April 22nd."
1037,70013,4.0,3.0,"I think Professor Adams gets a bad rep, but if you show up to all his classes, do the work, and go to office hours when needed, his class isn't bad. He's very knowledgeable about what he teaches and can sometimes be hard to follow, but if you put the effort in, his class is like any other math course."
1038,70013,1.0,3.0,"This guy will eventually stop teaching, but for those with the option of Adams or someone else, choose the other guy every time. He is a very smart guy, don't confuse that, but he has no clue how to teach that info to somebody else. Because of this, there's always classes where you felt like you were missing something. Don't take his class period."
1039,70013,1.0,4.0,DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS
1040,70013,3.0,3.0,"Lectures often don't cover the homework. They often have mistakes too and seem somewhat improvised at times. He's a great guy if you get to know him, but he falls short of being a great teacher. He fails to prepare students for exams. No longer on his &quot;A game&quot; mentally anymore. Use office hours to your advantage. He will work to help you."
1041,70013,1.0,4.0,Lectures are confusing and hardly cover what's on the homework or tests; the lectures are also full of mistakes. Homework assignments take multiple hours per night despite only being 17 percent of the grade. You can never read ahead because he doesn't tell you what's coming next. He expects students to have a decent background in physics as well.
1042,70013,1.0,2.0,the only reason Im doing okay in this class is because I took AP Calc in high school. He actually doesnt make sense and gets so much stuff wrong.
1043,70013,1.0,5.0,"Tests were a major part of the grade, only like 17% was homework. Never understood the topics well. Problems are not straight forward so it is difficult to understand what he wants. Homework is alright in difficulty level because it's from the textbook, but test questions are very different. No extra credit."
1044,70013,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Adams is a very nice person, but if you do not study on your own without the need for quizzes, everyday hw, or webwork, you may get lost in the class. There is a big accumulated hw once a week. Also, do read the book before class to be able to understand or make sense of the lecture because calculus III is not that logical."
1045,70013,5.0,3.0,Office hours are prime
1046,70013,4.0,4.0,"He teaches very theoretically. Seems a bit quirky at first but he will grow on you throughout the semester. If you go to office hours frequently, he will reflect that in your final grade. Big curves on exams as they are pretty tough and he's a very particular grader. You have to do it his way. If you go in with an open mind, you'll love his class."
1047,70013,2.0,4.0,I had Adams three semesters in a row and was not pleased. I found him very confusing and my understanding of the material would actually decrease after going to class. Very theoretical. Only good part was the curve-- the test average would usually be under a 50%
1048,70013,5.0,4.0,"Has a deep understanding of the insights of calculus, but is a really hard transition from the way calculus is taught in high schools. Whenever he says &quot;the really cool thing is&quot; or &quot;the beautiful thing about this is&quot; write it down and learn it well. If you can understand those things and show that on a test, he will grade lighter. Get to know him."
1049,70013,1.0,2.0,worst professor I have ever seen so far. His handwriting is awful and the classes are too theoretical
1050,70013,5.0,4.0,"Professor Adams is someone you really have to know to understand. He is not a spiteful professor in the least, and if you go into his class with an open mind you will be fine. Never skip class because he will hound you for it forever. Overall, just try your best and he will grade you accordingly. He does focus on the theoretical methods."
1051,70013,1.0,5.0,Don't even take his class. His class would just cause you pain. You are better of learning math from a 1st grader. His office hours are just as useless.
1052,70013,1.0,5.0,The worst class I have taken at Bucknell by far. Professor does a terrible job of teaching the material. Makes fun of students for not knowing answers. Curved every test because no one understood the material
1053,70013,1.0,4.0,"Greg Adams's exams are VERY DIFFICULT. He would walk into exams and say ""its more difficult than I expected, good luck"""
1054,70013,4.0,2.0,You will like Adams more as the semester goes on and you learn his sense of humor and how he likes things done on tests and homework.  He likes to help students understand the basics and relies a lot on theorems and proofs.  He helps out students who stop by for office hours and is probably one of the easier calc professors at Bucknell.
1055,70013,4.5,3.0,"If you go with his more theoretical method of teaching (which is actually really awesome), you will learn how to approach problems and will remember how to solve them. He really helped me appreciate math. Not easy, but tests were always fair and he is more than willing to help in office hours."
1056,70013,4.5,3.0,"He is a good professor. You might find his class confusing first because he focuses more on theories. However, they turn to be extremely helpful when you solve problems."
1057,70013,4.5,3.0,Sometimes hard to follow but a great teacher and really wants kids to enjoy and learn the material.
1058,70013,2.0,4.0,"Professor Adams is the most confusing professor I've ever had. He is a strange person and tried to make class interesting, but I always had trouble staying awake. If you are confused, meet with him outside of class and he'll help you. Not clear at ALL. VERY hard to follow."
1059,70013,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this class if you enjoy struggling week after week, with no support or help from the instructor. Professor Adams continuously told us he could not teach us because we ""do not have math brains like he does"", therefore he doesn't understand where to go next. Although this is a class for non-math people, I would find another class to try."
1060,70013,2.5,5.0,"Do not take Adams if you do not enjoy teaching yourself Calc. I had him for Calc 3 and Linear Algebra, and he is incomprehensible.  He spends all of class talking about theoretical properties and spends very little time talking about how to actually do problems. I could literally not go to a single class and still have the same amount of knowledge."
1061,70013,3.5,4.0,He likes to joke a lot in class almost to much because he likes to make fun of people to much.  He teaches everything in theory and is vague when teaching.  I thought I would get like a C- in the class but ended up with a B (I didn't deserve it) the tests and quiz's were hard but if you participate a lot he will give your grade a bump.
1062,70013,2.5,3.0,"I really disliked adams... he was really nice guy and made fun of people a lot in class which was the only part of class that was interesting. beyond that, he was vague and impossible to understand. AVOID"
1063,70013,3.5,4.0,"Very bad handwriting, if you arent following his words, you'll have a hard time copying whats on the board. Also, be careful and aware of the traps and bonuses on the tests. read the instructions VERY carefully. or you'll cry."
1064,70013,4.0,3.0,"Fubby, weird sense of humor, but if you get it, it's a fun class."
1065,70013,1.0,5.0,Lectures are boring and incomprehensible. Expect to teach yourself from the book if you have him as a prof. On the plus side he's so eccentric he'll do something that will make you laugh out loud at least once per class. My favorite was when he compared solving a differential equation to trying to kill a gorilla with a grenade.
1066,70013,2.0,3.0,"Kind of crazy, loves to make fun of people, hair resembles a lamp shade"
1067,70013,2.5,4.0,"As was said previously, all he teaches is theory. No one  got the material, and the average grade on each exam was close to failing. He curves the grades up, but it is really frustrating walking out of an exam knowing you got most of the questions wrong. On the plus side, he is rather entertaining in class and makes some good jokes. Nice guy too."
1068,70013,1.0,3.0,"Awful teacher, he explains everything as vague theory and does not show any examples. On the off chance that he does they are usually wrong and he will spend a long time trying to fix his mistake.  He will also make fun of you if you answer one of his questions wrong.  Unless you like math in all theory and being made fun of, AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
1069,70013,3.0,4.0,"He is insane and stunningly smart.  I think that Adams sees things differently from most people, so he isn't such a good teacher.  Still, he knows his stuff.  His class is hard, but for the final grade he is understanding."
1070,70013,3.0,3.0,"He is willing to answere the classes questions, usually goes over hw well. Usually wont show you how to do any aritmatic, which is annoying b/c you have to pick it uo later by going over hw/quizes. Doesnt like to tell you the exact formula or how to use it. Tests only what he showed u and is entertaining. Nice guy."
1071,70013,2.0,4.0,It is hard to follow him sometimes and he skips telling you where he got a lot of stuff.
1072,70013,1.5,3.0,I can't follow him! he is so scattered! half the time i think he is confusing himself too.
1073,70013,4.0,3.0,"Teaching style is kinda scattered, but he is very entertaining."
1074,70013,4.0,3.0,The kind of professor you don't forget.....
1075,70013,1.0,5.0,avoid
1076,70013,3.0,2.0,wierd guy but funny and a scattered teaching style
1077,70013,4.0,3.0,"Adams is extremely helpful during office hours.  I liked him as a teacher, even though his basis for the grades he gives are as wacky as his random discourses about German soccer.  Good teacher for non math majors, but can be hard to follow."
1078,70013,2.5,3.0,Early morning calculus 4 days a week and a not so clear professor = your stuck teaching yourself a lot of the stuff the night before the test

1082,358787,3.0,4.0,"Professor Milofsky is an interesting guy with a very unique background. You can tell he is knowledgeable in the subject and he provides interesting material to the class, and I personally found it to be the most interesting class I took this semester. However, he has high expectations and there is a lot of work. But dont let that discourage you!"
1083,358787,4.0,3.0,"Prof Milofsky is really intelligent, and is an interesting professor! However, there is a lot of reading and extra lectures to watch outside of class, and this class involved more writing than any others I've taken, even though it's not a W2. But as long as you put in the time and effort, it's pretty easy to learn a lot and get good grades."
1084,358787,1.0,5.0,"This professor is the worst I've ever had and probably ever will have. He changes the syllabus so many times throughout the semester not even he knows what's going on. If you don't write exactly in the way he thinks, you will NOT do well in this class. I had to compromise my opinions just so I wouldn't fail."
1085,358787,1.0,5.0,"This professor was horrible. With endless deadlines, unknown quizzes, and a continuously changing syllabus good luck trying to keep up with this class. I took this class as an IP credit and I should have taken something less time restricting and disorganized. Students go ridiculed for bad lighting and lack of participation."
1086,358787,1.0,4.0,The lectures are completely random and have no real trajectory. 75% of the course grade is completely subjective and he grades you like a grad student. If he does not like your argument regardless of how strong it is you wont do well.
1087,358787,3.0,2.0,"I took Medical Sociology with him. The class is based upon 2 online tests, a couple papers, and a final debate. He assigned a lot of reading every night, but then gave confusing lectures the next day about them. He also takes attendance every day. Overall, if you show up and work hard on the tests, you will do great. Great guy."
1088,358787,3.0,4.0,"He's an extremely tough grader. There are a few short papers that I struggled to get better than a B on. The class has potential to be really interesting because some of the debates are cool and make you think about things you didn't think about before, but they're presented pretty boringly in this class. I stayed because the stuff is on the MCAT"
1089,358787,2.0,5.0,He rambles on during lectures about topics that aren't important. His essays seem fine but then he'll grade you as if you are a graduate student. His expectations are way too high and he won't teach you anything.
1090,358787,2.5,4.0,"IF you like to teach yourself then take this class.  He will give you a ton of reading for each class and then he won't talk about it in class.  He just lectures on whatever pops into his head and what he want to talk about not the material.  But then he tests you on the material from the readings.  4 papers, 2 exams online and 1 semester debate"
1091,358787,3.0,2.0,"As long as you don't take the class too seriously or expect too much it's interesting enough. He challenges you enough to make you think, but not so much that it's above a 100 level course."
1092,358787,1.5,4.0,Terrible. Terrible.
1093,358787,3.0,2.0,Milofsky is a little strange but overall a fine guy. His class was a little all over the place but I took Medical Sociology to be my joke class. You can pretty much coast most of the year except for the online midterm and final which are a TON of work. But you never have to write a long paper or read during the year. Def wasn't a bad experience
1094,358787,3.5,2.0,"interesting class. i did notice a little arrogance like other comments. several intellectuals seem to have this quality, and it goes back to the defense of thesis mentality. it's tolerable, but annoying on some occasions. smart and helpful person."
1095,358787,5.0,2.0,His lectures are really interesting.  If you don't miss more then four classes and put effort into the writing assignments and incorporate the lectures into them you'll get an A.  He's a great guy.  Very concerned and passionate about human services.  I would definately recommend taking him.
1096,358787,1.0,3.0,He has a know-it-all attitude and superiority complex.
1097,358787,1.0,1.0,Arrogant blowhard.  Talks like there's no tomorrow.  More boring than junk mail.
1098,358787,3.5,2.0,very interesting prof. midterm and final was 3 response papers for each (3 before fall break and and average is your midterm) (3 before finals and average is your final grade). 4 field experiences and need to write responses. he likes to talk about his friends/acquaintances... he has an ex convict friend
1099,358787,4.0,2.0,fairly easy grader.. if you email him your papers ahead of time he tells you exactly whats wrong & how to correct them.. classes are boring because he rambles like crazy.. but nice guy
1100,358787,3.5,1.0,"easiest class ive ever taken, all tests and quizzes are on blackboard.  he is really entertaining, lectured can be a bit dry but the class is definitly worth taking"
1101,358787,5.0,3.0,Best teacher at Bucknell - dead serious take him as much as you can Perhaps the most interesting and brilliant man i have ever met.
1102,358787,2.5,1.0,Not organized at all.
1103,358787,3.0,3.0,"Arrogant, Self Absorbed, loves to hear himself talk.  Nonetheless very intelligent and a decent teacher as long as you don't get on his bad side."
1104,358787,4.0,2.0,"Great prof for an intro class. Got me interested in sociology. Rambles a bit, but it keeps class interesting. Easy to write papers + Exams online = slacker class. I loved it."
1105,358787,3.0,2.0,"Good guy, he likes to get to know the students.  He rambles a bit during lecture and enjoys watching a lot of movies.  He encourages in class discussions about current polotics and sociological issues."
1106,358787,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor!  He cares about his students and always has time for them.  Class material is interesting and grading is very fair. Highly recommended.
1107,358787,2.0,3.0,Way liberal and needs to keep these ideals seperate from class discussion.  Likes to hear himself talk.
1108,2726280,2.0,3.0,"This class was made tougher by unclear lectures, assignments that didn't cover what we should have actually been practicing, and never going over them. Exam qs were hard to interpret, as English is not his first language and he did not get anyone to read it over before. Overall his instructions/expectations were not clear. He got better at the end."
1109,2726280,2.0,4.0,This class was a mess. Lecture did a horrible job of preparing you for the lab and I was stuck asking my lab professor for a lot of help. Would not answer questions in office hours as &quot;other students aren't getting this same level of help&quot;. Also never learned how to properly spell or pronounce my name even with repeated reminders.
1110,2726282,5.0,1.0,Lots of group work but provides plenty of in class time for the projects. Midterm and exam are short take-home essay questions. She is easily accessible outside of class. The readings are short and easy to understand.
1111,184719,5.0,3.0,This woman is literally an inspiration to us all! She is INCREDIBLE. She is not only an exceptional professor but an exceptional human being who I continuously find myself in awe of. Definitely definitely definitely take a course with her if you have the opportunity!
1112,184719,5.0,1.0,Professor Morris is amazing. Her class was not hard at all and the midterm and final were done outside of class with partners. Basically as long as you read the readings  and follow her direction you will pass. I even used sparknote on some of the assignments if I was too lazy to read and I came out of the class with an A. She is literally the best
1113,184719,4.0,4.0,She is one of the most caring professors I've had here at Bucknell! She is excellent and is really engaged with her students. She can be a confusing grader which also ties back to her disorganization but if you talk it through with her she tends to be accommodating.
1114,184719,5.0,4.0,Such a great professor. Really fair and wants you to succeed. Sometimes its a little disorganized.
1115,184719,5.0,2.0,"Honestly the sweetest professor you will ever meet. Lenient grader and she will give you many opportunities to hone your work and succeed. However, you still have to work for a good grade. She ins incredibly smart and insightful,and the interactive style of teaching creates an interesting and fun learning experience. Really cares about her students"
1116,184719,5.0,3.0,"Truly a goddess among undeserving humans. Morris is an absolute inspiration, riding the line between a life councilor and an exemplary intellectual. Like Emerson, her academic work is her religion, her lectures are her prophecies, and her students are her children. Morris democratizes the classroom to provide a experience vital to humanity."
1117,184719,5.0,3.0,"She is incredible! I've taken her American poetry class this semester and this is definitely a life-changing course! She teaches me to be strong and tough in love and also to appreciate the beauty of ordinary things. Most importantly, she emphasizes the importance of empathy and I feel so much beloved and encouraged. Absolutely recommend her class"
1118,184719,5.0,3.0,"Professor Morris is one of the most brilliant and inspirational people I have ever met. Her seminar especially is a lot of reading and writing, and she is a hard essay grader, but the workload is always fair and worthwhile. Super wise, kind, and helpful. A true teacher. Not easy but fiercely intelligent and empowering. "
1119,184719,5.0,1.0,She is an awesome teacher.
1120,184719,4.5,3.0,Most incredible teacher I have ever had! Sweetest lady who cares about her students. She is also incredibly smart and engaging.
1121,184719,5.0,2.0,I love her! She genuinely cares about her students and her grading is fair. I'd take any class with her as the professor.
1122,184719,5.0,4.0,"the best of the best, folks. take any class with her that you can, and you will see what a real college course is supposed to be like. her enthusiasm is completely contagious and she is truly brilliant."
1123,184719,4.5,3.0,Amazing teacher. She is extremely passionate and so incredibly smart. You can't help but love her classes. She really wants the students to get involved with the literature. Take any class with her that you can.
1124,184719,5.0,4.0,"Off the charts! Captivating, fiercely intelligent, and genuinely caring. She stimulates thought and discussion effortlessly--even a three hour seminar seems to pass quickly! If you leave her class not feeling challenged and inspired, check your pulse. You might be dead."
1125,184719,5.0,1.0,"Morris brings life to the classroom, stimulates a lot of classroom discussion...don't believe the right-wing nut who thinks shes opinionated, do the work, pay attention and you'll do well"
1126,184719,5.0,3.0,"currently in law school, prof morris remains the best professor i ever had.  she is highly intelligent yet lectures in a clear and intersting manner while also encouraging discusiion.  when you work hard you get the A.  she was also my chosen advisor and takes a great interest in her students.  i owe many of my best bucknell class memories to her."
1127,184719,3.5,3.0,"Definately subjective in grading big papers, but pick a good topic and it's easy"
1128,184719,5.0,3.0,Wonderful professor; inspirational person; amazing presence. Bucknell should count itself lucky to have such a dedicated and unique faculty member.
1129,184719,5.0,3.0,the best professor you will ever have. period.
1130,184719,4.5,3.0,One of Bucknell's finest. Inspirational.
1131,184719,3.5,3.0,"Nice person, confusing grader (seems to play a little bit of favoritism), excellent professor"
1132,184719,5.0,3.0,saundra morris is one of the best professors at bucknell and she's a wonderful person who geniunely cares about her students.
1133,184721,1.0,3.0,"The class addresses pretty polarizing topics, but there's only one ""right"" point of view--hers. Much like Bucknell, Prof. Carr exists in a bubble. She doesn't relate subject matter to the outside world beyond her specific experiences. Class was once a week--she cancelled 4 separate time for things like ""allergies;"" tough to view as a professional."
1134,184721,3.0,1.0,The class was sort of interesting but extremely easy. Glynis Carr was very understanding and offered many extended deadlines and extra help.
1135,184721,5.0,2.0,good prof. cares about her students.
1136,184721,1.0,2.0,Intro to English & Am Lit
1137,184721,4.5,2.0,By far one the most helpful and friendly professors I have had so far. She will help you understand the material and grades very well.
1138,184721,4.5,2.0,"She is an awesome professor and person. Very easy to talk to, and very understanding of any problems. Not a hard grader"
1139,184721,5.0,1.0,"Such a sweet lady. She just wants to open your eyes to topics not discussed in other classes. She is open to opinions and accepting of all students. One journal due a week and two papers the entire semester. No final, no midterms, no quizzes.. Minimal work and reading required. Grade based off of participation. Amazing class!"
1140,184721,3.5,1.0,"Easy grader, really nice woman but extremely opinionated. I'm fairly liberal but she made not want to be one. She has trouble processing an opinion that is different from her own."
1141,184721,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Carr is awesome! She is very opinionated, but usually the best teachers are.  Her class is pretty easy and if you go in to see her and get to know her she will love you and then you are pretty much guaranteed an A or something."
1142,184721,4.5,1.0,"i love glynis! such a sweet woman.. yes, it's an easy class, but the class discussions are pretty engaging and the workload is minimal.  i recommend taking her, she's really great!"
1143,184721,4.5,1.0,"she was extremely easy, didn't assign much, interesting reading, approachable to changing syllabus, and as long as you bring something to discussion you'll swing an A no problem"
1144,184721,3.0,1.0,"She was a very easy professor, but not a lot of fun. The class could have been much more fun and we could have had a lot of interesting discussions, but she wasnt very conducive to that. She never wanted to stray from the material in the book, so the discussions became boring and repetitive. But, if you are looking for an easy A, look no further."
1145,184721,1.5,1.0,"I would not reccomend Carr.  She is easy, but boring and opnionated.  Extremely bias."
1146,184721,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor- so sweet and eager to help. If you ever have the chance to take her, I would recommend it!"
1147,184721,1.5,1.0,"I would not take classes from Professor Carr.  She means well but she is not able to process other people's opinions and gets frustrated when people voice opinions that she disagrees with.  If you write and say what she wants, you will get a good grade but the class can be very frustrating.  Sitting through her class can be veeery painful."
1148,184721,2.0,1.0,"Undoubtedly the worst professor I have ever had at Bucknell.  She is so far from intelligent it makes me wonder how she got a job at such a great school.  All these positive comments must be based on how easy her class is, because I learned nothing with her I didn't learn in high school (and even there I learned more).  Don't ever take her classes."
1149,184721,5.0,1.0,"I had her for my foundation seminar (Radical Decade: US Lit. & 1960s). Its what you call a &quot;pass/fail&quot; course. Do the work, you pass. Don't...you don't! She's very eccentric and opinionated, but don't let that intimidate you. Don't be afraid to voice your opinion. She'll respect you for it."
1150,184721,5.0,3.0,AMAZING PROF!!  Her class was so much fun! We read great books and we watched Sex and the City and Queer As Folk!  If you have the chance to take her for anything..DO IT!! :)

1155,184721,5.0,3.0,professor carr is an awesome professor and an awesome person.
1156,2378138,5.0,3.0,His lecture notes are very clear and helpful in reviewing for exams. Homework and exams are not too hard.
1157,2378138,4.0,3.0,Can be pretty boring in class but his notes are super helpful and clear. Passed the class with an A through notes alone. However you must attend class to get these notes and understand them fully. Tests and homeworks arent extremely difficult. Hes also huge on improvement so dont be discouraged if you dont do well in the beginning.
1158,184730,5.0,2.0,"Professor Peterson is a ball of energy and super enthusiastic. Each class is basically a class discussion and easy to participate and follow along. As long as you do the papers and revisions, this is an easy A. She is super caring and considerate. Would definitely take again!"
1159,184730,5.0,1.0,Professor Peterson is a ball of energy. She made public speaking feel like such a valuable class and asks for feedback from the students. Would definitely recommend any class with her and Public Speaking in the 21st Century in general as I have grown a lot from this class.
1160,184730,5.0,2.0,"She is the best teacher ever! She makes english so fun. She's funny and adorable, a professor you must have before you graduate!"
1161,184730,4.5,3.0,She is very enthusiastic about what she is teaching. Her lectures are sometimes boring and sometimes it feels like she doesnt expect much from her students. She is very helpful outside of class and an excellent writing teacher
1162,184730,5.0,1.0,BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!! Take her if you EVER get the chance!!
1163,184730,5.0,2.0,"easily makes my list of top bucknell professors. the course itself was lots of fun, and the energy she brings everyday was very positive. such a nice person and easy to approach with questions. discussions were also great."
1164,184730,4.5,1.0,"Prof. Peterson is very fun and energetic about her subject. She knows a lot, and appreciates class participation. I guarantee that you will laugh at her eccentric behavior at least once. She's really nice and extremely helpful outside of class. I highly recommend her!"

1166,184730,4.5,1.0,This class is a definate must if you need a W1 course for engineering or just as a freshman.  Very little and very managable work load.  She's very energetic and a really great teacher.
1167,184730,4.5,2.0,"i LOVE this lady.  She is the nicest professor I've had at Bucknell.  She assigns papers and edits them twice before you turn them in, basically assuring you of a good grade.  Take this class!  It's amazing!"
1168,184730,5.0,2.0,easy class. A- with minimal effort. she's hilarious... you'll roll your eyes a lot.
1169,184730,5.0,1.0,"She's amazing. She's full of the spirit of the bard. She is extremely hyper and that puts a few people off, but also very nice and understanding and open to various interpretations. I can't imagine how it would be possible to get less than an A on anything you write for her, even if you disagree with her. I can't say enough good about her."
1170,184730,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher, really interested in what she is talking about, helps the students when they need help. She is crazy though, fyi. Very easy class to get an A in, as long as you just do what she says and just listen, you will get an A no question. Good teacher."
1171,184730,4.0,3.0,"she is smarter than the material but still keeps it alive enough to challenge top tier students, the dumber students, well, that's their problem... haha"
1172,184730,5.0,2.0,she's amazing... she has a lust for the material like none other
1173,184730,4.5,1.0,"i didn't learn much, but the class required no effort and was an easy A. Peterson's is nice and energetic, but really wierd"
1174,184730,5.0,1.0,Be prepared to crack up...
1175,184730,5.0,2.0,enthusiastic teacher who is very approachable for discussion of the course

1181,2671006,5.0,2.0,Very caring woman much more than just as a teacher. Class is easy and experiments are fun
1182,2671006,5.0,4.0,"An amazing teacher, always willing to help no matter what the situation. A life long mentor."
1183,2761119,4.0,2.0,"He is a great professor and is very helpful. He works with you if you have an excused absence from class and he is a fair grader. His class is easy to pass, just show up and participate a bit. He has a very clear and easy to follow grading scale. Would definitely recommend taking him."
1184,2761119,5.0,3.0,I took Roman Civilization with professor Lu and thoroughly enjoyed the class. His lectures are engaging and involve lots of discussion with the class. He gives a quiz once a week but as long as you show up to class and do the readings you will have no issues.I highly recommend taking a course with professor Lu.
1185,184735,5.0,3.0,Prof was extremely sweet and caring a lot about her students. Wrote MANY papers this semester and she gave lots of helpful corrections! Super interesting lectures that get you to think about certain topics in a new light!
1186,184735,5.0,3.0,"Had her for an IP class and absolutely loved her, she is super interesting to listen to and gives great feedback on drafts of papers. One of my favorite professors at Bucknell."
1187,184735,4.5,4.0,very bright person with an ability to make the material interesting. discussions were always interesting and relevant to the reading.
1188,184735,4.5,3.0,"managed to keep freshmen interested in reading and writing at 8 in the morning on tuesdays and thursdays. really great at keeping discussion lively and everyone engaged, and didn't mind changing the subject a little if that's the direction that the class wanted to go in."
1189,184735,5.0,4.0,Amazing professor!  So intelligent and actually capable of keeping me awake during a lecture (a nearly impossible feat.)  Has so much to offer and the most interesting prof I've ever had at Bucknell.
1190,184735,4.5,3.0,"she's a great prof who managed to get me and 10 other engineer's interested in reading, writing, and discussing about otherwise uninteresting novels.  she helped me gain great confidence in my own ability to organize and write papers.   because of her class i actually want to take more lit classes."
1191,184735,5.0,3.0,"Funny, flexible, picky grader, easy class"
1192,184735,4.5,3.0,"good class, material was really interesting. she's a funny prof. kind of a tough grader though and Im an english major. really hot!"
1193,184735,2.5,4.0,"I found her to be somewhat of a feminazi, which is something you should never call her, btw.....doesn't much appreciate that. trust me.  Yeah, I don't know why she didn't like me."
1194,184735,4.5,3.0,"can be a tough grader, but gives very interesting lectures, and is always enthusiastic"
1195,184735,5.0,3.0,easy to approach and wants to help
1196,184735,4.5,3.0,She is the best prof i've ever had. She makes 9am thursday classes enjoyable! She made me want to minor in Eng.
1197,184735,5.0,4.0,One of my best professors!  Very smart in Victorian Literature!

1201,49570,5.0,2.0,"Labor based grading and mostly group work. Interesting classes, easy A"
1202,49570,3.0,4.0,Labor based grading so not hard to get an A. Mandatory 4 hours community service plus 30 page readings and 1-2 page writings for every class. If you turn everything in though you get a guaranteed A. Content wise he's mostly just focused on social justice related stuff if that's your thing.
1203,49570,3.0,4.0,"This dude knows everything about Bucknell (aka darker sides) and shares his true opinions. PSYC 230 solely focuses on social justice and basically how people really need help and representation. He is quite boring. labor based with a decent amount of work and 4 hours/week of community service, takes lots of time but interesting"
1204,49570,5.0,2.0,"The most WOKE guy on campus!!! Literally, maybe the most woke old white man in the world. He's a really good guy."
1205,49570,4.0,2.0,"Professor Flack is great. I had him for my social justice foundation seminar. The grades are labor-based, so if you do the work you will get the min grade of a B. There are 1-2 page papers every other week, &amp; a few service learning opportunities you have to take. There are many readings that have helped me broaden my knowledge on the US &amp; the world"
1206,49570,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed having Professor Flack. The contract grading system really allowed me to care about the material rathe than stress about a grade, and I still talk about some of his lectures to this day. He's not afraid to speak his mind and also he's just a really nice guy."
1207,49570,1.0,4.0,"Bill Flack is pompous, arrogant &amp; an ego maniac. Talked about his research EVERY class, &amp; became hostile if you disagreed with him- very unprofessional. He liked to brag that he since he was tenured he could give everyone an A. I worked hard &amp; did the readings but did not get an A. I learned very little from this clown, so choose someone else!!!!"
1208,49570,1.0,4.0,"He believes that science has no place in psychology, and if you dissent or disagree he WILL react poorly. I found him to be unapproachable after class, even when I expressed an interest in his research, which he talks about all the time. He is pompous/condescending. Gave me an A- but I deserved an A in this tough W2 class. Avoid him!!Don't take!!!"
1209,49570,2.5,3.0,"Will be the first to admit that he is not a mainstream psychologist, which is fine in itself, but his approach is close-minded. When people ask him pointed questions that might conflict with his point of view he gets defensive. There isn't a whole lot of room for dissent in his classroom. Weekly hospital trips are overkill (could be done monthly)."
1210,49570,5.0,4.0,"Professor Flack is amazing.  While the class is a challenge, it is completely worthwhile.  He made me a more critical thinker, a better writer, and probably a better person.  He genuinely cares about his students and about the subject, and Bucknell is lucky to have him."
1211,49570,2.5,3.0,"I disagreed 100% with his teaching and views on mental health. I thought he was radical in his thinking, he forced his opinions onto you, he was cynical and frustrating to listen to. That being said, he did force me to think critically and my writing improved greatly. The weekly visits to the psych ward were an awesome experience."
1212,49570,4.5,3.0,"You can tell he is really passionate about the material, even if he does have a monotone voice. Sometimes can be tricky to get a hold of outside of class, but he is very clear during class. His classes are mostly essays, so if you get them proofread before handing them in you'll do pretty well. Really encourages you to think critically."
1213,49570,4.0,3.0,I had him for two classes. He demonstrated a clear interest and expertise in his subject matter which helped to foster pathos on a practi****trip to Danville State Hospital. Good for developing critical thinking on paper-based assignments. Looks like an owl.
1214,49570,4.0,2.0,He is a good professor and his tests are generally easy - but he does have a clinical therapist voice and that can put you to sleep.  Just make sure you get the lecture notes and you are good.

1217,184739,5.0,3.0,"Wish I got a higher grade but she is an amazing professor. She is so knowledgeable and loves to teach and learn from her students as well. I really loved and enjoyed her class, she's an amazing person and professor. She is fair and cares about her students and adjusts anything in the class if people think things need to be changed."
1218,184739,1.0,3.0,"This class was about social justice as a whole. I'm not particularly a fan since Davis continually told students of color that white people need compassion too when defending the racist white students. She depended on exploiting students in the minority groups to teach the class. Thus, I didn't appreciate getting an A- since I taught the class."
1219,184739,4.5,1.0,"Very easy, got an A- and only read the fairy tales and one other book; I wish i read more because the stuff was interesting. Very good class all in all and she's a wonderful person. She really wants you to understand and analyze the material and she'll go out of her way to help you with your work and your grade."
1220,184739,5.0,1.0,"Class discussions are fun and interesting, but can get a little repetitive at times. I would still recommend taking this class"
1221,184739,4.5,4.0,"Excellent Professor. A decent amount of reading, but she does try to use interactive learning, like small group discussions and brainstorming, in class.  Five research papers which are graded strictly but fairly to make up most of your grade.  An &quot;A&quot; is doable if you do the work and are a decent writer."
1222,184739,4.5,4.0,Excellent course. Everyone should take a course with her if they have the opportunity.  She is flexible - gives extensions and lets you revise if you are serious about improving your grade.  she mixes reading with films and discussions.
1223,184739,5.0,3.0,"I found Prof. Davis to be one of the best at Bucknell.  I have taken several of her classes through various departments and found all of them to be intellectually stimulating and thought provoking. If you have a chance to take one of her courses, don't pass it up!"
1224,184739,3.5,2.0,"She is easy, her class is easy, a lot of reading, but when it comes to grading, she is hard.  At least for they type of class it is.  Normally, in 150, you just sit around and discuss."
1225,184739,5.0,3.0,"Very articulate, encourages class discussion, and challenges people to think about their day to day life. Very good courses and engaging individual."
1226,184739,1.5,2.0,"if you like human compassion or intellectual stimulation, don't sign up for any of her classes!"
1227,2419114,2.0,1.0,"Cons:
- Very disorganized: Does not abide by his own deadlines and is often unprepared for lecture
- Focus on report-writing rather than design (Disappointing for a capstone course)
- Course marks are holistic (i.e. non-transparent)

Pros:
- Highly approachable and affable during weekly capstone group meetings
- Marks very generously"
1228,2419114,1.0,5.0,He's so disorganized. He turns a practical course into a writing-intensive one. So you'd receive an A+ if you built a useless prototype but talked about it for pages.
1229,2419114,1.0,3.0,"Aviod him. Prof. Azare shows no empathy to his students yet thinks bascially everything from his own point of view. Ironically, one of our assignment is called ""Empathy Design for Engineers"". But he doesn't know how to incorporate empathy into a design of a course. No idea how he get hired. "
1230,2419114,1.0,3.0,Bad experience
1231,2419114,1.0,4.0,"Very disorganized, let TAs do all the work, don't even speak a lot in lectures"
1232,2419114,1.0,4.0,"Legit the worst prof ever. I've had a lot of bad profs in engineering, but no one has ever been as disorganized as Prof Asare. He is also unwilling to make changes to the course based on student needs. He seems like a chill person outside of class and is generally approachable but the pros don't come close to outweighing the cons."
1233,2419114,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Phillip, or Phillip as he likes to be called, is the chilliest guy I met at Bucknell. He is such a very nice and caring person. He tries to make students learn actively; they sometimes discover things themselves. He cares about reflecting on assignments and other stuff. He would mostly introduce an idea using an activity or a game."
1234,2183603,3.0,2.0,"A caring teacher with good intentions. The class grade consisted of about 6 papers which are easy to write and he is an easy grader. Biggest problem is how he lectures, all he does is speak and is very monotonous which leaves the class bored and unengaged. It's best to do the readings but you'll be fine if you don't just take heavy notes in class."
1235,2183603,3.0,1.0,"Easy class only grades are short papers and participation. lectures were kinda boring but the readings are pretty interesting if you're into philosophy. i never spoke in class, the papers matter more"
1236,2183603,5.0,2.0,Professor Burgos is a very easy going and engaging professor. He made assignments very clear and tends to be an easy grader. The material was typically easy and was always discussed at length in class.
1237,2183603,5.0,3.0,Burgos is the best professor. He really cares about each of his students and will make sure each of them know that. There is a lot of reading material but each reading is thoroughly discussed in class before any papers are assigned on it. He expects participation but it is easy to do if you do the reading and pay attention.
1238,2183603,2.0,3.0,"He is a nice guy but he and his class is super boring. He is willing to help outside of class and doesn't grade too harshly. However, due to a miscommunication, I missed when a paper was due. He gave me a 25% because he doesn't except late work and it tanked my grade and GPA. I would never take a class with him ever again."
1239,2183603,2.0,3.0,Probably the most boring class i have taken thus far in college. He lectures the entire class and is extremely boring. I wouldnt take this class if you dont like to read/dont plan on reading. Not too hard of a grader though
1240,2183603,5.0,3.0,"Such a nice guy. Always around to help with papers. Makes his class very interesting and is very encouraging. Couple of papers throughout the term, but he grades fairly and loves in class participation. I thought this class was so interested and would highly recommend it."
1241,2183603,4.0,2.0,"8 am was definetely a tough time for philosophy so class participation was low which I think took away from the class, but Burgos is a really nice guy and if you do the work with a little bit of effort you should be in the A range for sure.  Missed class a ton and still ended up with an A-"
1242,2183603,5.0,1.0,Burgos is awesome.  He is a super nice guy and wants every student to succeed.  He gives a lot of papers but grades very easily.
1243,2183603,4.0,1.0,Showed up as many times as I missed and still received an A. A lot of papers but very easy. Burgos is a great man and very nice. He wants all students to succeed.
1244,2183603,4.0,3.0,Great guy Cares about his students Young and engaging Lectures get pretty boring
1245,2161080,1.0,3.0,Dont take this class unless youre ready to participate and read 100+ pages a night. We had a midterm in a discussion-based class and 5+ writing assignments in addition to a 15+ page final paper. She will give little to no advice/structure on your paper or paper draft. She didnt mention our paper until the second to last day of class.
1246,2161080,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Kosmin is one of the sweetest professors you will meet, and she has a lot of passion for what she teaches. The subject material isn't too tough, but there is a lot of reading, solid writing of papers, and active participation involved to really knock it out of the park with this class."
1247,2161080,4.0,2.0,Funny and really cares for her students. Interesting class. Discussion and reading base.
1248,2161080,4.0,3.0,Overall it was a very insightful class. Very open and cool final project as well. Nice Professor who cares about her students.
1249,2161080,4.0,3.0,This was an awesome class - the topics were really thought provoking and she was clearly very passionate about them. The class was very discussion based and they were always really interesting. There was a lot of reading but it's interesting stuff so I usually didn't mind.
1250,2161080,4.0,3.0,"Kosmin is painfully boring but is a genuinely kind and caring person.  Class wasn't too hard, but make sure you do the reading because her classes are discussion based and if you don't know the information everyone can tell.  She is willing to work with you on papers if you need it, and is pretty accessible outside of class."
1251,2161080,5.0,4.0,"Prof Kosmin is absolutely amazing! She is extremely knowledgeable about history and truly cares about students. She will know and be disappointed if you don't read, and the class is discussion based so you need to know the material. A few short papers and one final research paper. Hard grader but you will learn a lot and I highly recommend her"
1252,2603452,5.0,3.0,He is really one of the nicest professors in the computer science department. I would definitely take a class with him if you can either OS or Computer Org are good options. He just wants you to learn the material and isn't as worried about arbitrary elements of the grading. Great professor and very knowledge of course!
1253,2509249,5.0,4.0,"Online classes are hard, but I feel like I learned a lot in this class. Everything is well planned out."
1254,2509249,1.0,4.0,"She can barely form a whole sentence based on lecture topics without looking at her cheat sheet, which shows me that she doesn't know what she's talking about... and believe me, she can barely explain stuff. AVOID IF POSSIBLE"
1255,2509249,1.0,1.0,By far the worst professor I've ever had and truthful not exaggerating. Readings and lectures never matched up and lecture slides were screenshots of textbook. Homeworks were either way too easy or impossible given the &quot;taught&quot; material. She had zero confidence teaching and often couldn't answer questions or move class along well.
1256,1700314,4.5,2.0,"Great lecturer, is very clear with the points he is trying to make. Overall, it's a decent class that covers a lot of material and Dr. K will gear the material more towards what he sees the class being interested in, so use that to your advantage. Check in with him a lot along the way and go over project reports with him before you hand them in."
1257,1700314,4.5,1.0,"One of the best teachers in the department.  Extremely interesting.  Project based, not many tests if any at all."
1258,1700314,4.5,2.0,Awesome teacher and just an all around great guy
1259,1700314,5.0,3.0,Great Professor and Advisor
1260,235999,3.0,3.0,Lots of quizzes which are good but also challenging. Jensen is a super nice guy and will help you if you are confused. He struggles with modern technology and communicating with the class. He moves pretty fast. If you study and have prior finance/acct knowledge you will do well if you study. Sometimes boring. Study. 
1261,235999,5.0,2.0,"Easily one of the best professors at Bucknell, has a clear passion for accounting and his students. He makes accounting interesting and fun and hes always there to help his students. Best professor Ive ever had at Bucknell."
1262,235999,3.0,1.0,Has a really hot TA.
1263,235999,4.5,4.0,Best professor I had at Bucknell - took what is typically a dry and boring curriculum and made it my most interesting course of my 4 years.
1264,235999,4.5,2.0,great personality and it helps make the class interesting.
1265,235999,1.0,5.0,Great professor for everything BUT corporate finance.
1266,235999,5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors I've taken at Bucknell. The material itself is very boring, but he somehow manages to make it very interesting. He is hilarious during class, and goes off on wild tangents that ensure you always listen to what he is saying. There is no HW, which is good, but there is a quiz every week to make sure you don't fall behind."
1267,235999,3.5,2.0,"The class itself is pretty easy and the material is straightforward. No hw but quiz every week. Tests slightly challenging, but doable. Jensen def has a major case of ADD, which makes the (dry) class very entertaining. If you want to be amused, just mention iPods/podcasts..."
1268,235999,3.0,3.0,"Very funny and entertaining. Quizzes everyweek can be a big pain but helps in the end. Extremely helpful and friendly, but sometimes assignments were unclear and confusing."
1269,235999,3.0,2.0,Good teacher and real nice.  May or may not be addicted to crack cocaine.
1270,235999,2.0,3.0,"He is the best professor for 160, but that does not make the class easy."
1271,235999,4.5,3.0,"the material can be difficult and dry but he has a great sense of humor and makes the class much more enjoyable.  tests are hard but very fair, he makes sure that you know what to study"
1272,235999,2.5,4.0,well if your into accounting then he's your man. ne one who thinks this class might be nice to try out think again he talks a mile a minute! he is a funny and entertaining professor-but it didn't matter the material is sooo boring! stay away unless u have to!!!
1273,235999,5.0,1.0,great guy and a great teacher.  is interesting to listen to and has a lot of energy.  tells you exactly what is on every quiz and the tests are really fair.
1274,235999,5.0,1.0,"Great guy, class is always entertaining and you learn a lot from him. Work is pretty easy, and he's always willing to help you if you have trouble with material."
1275,235999,5.0,2.0,"Great guy, loves teaching, hilarious, will bend over backwards for anyone who needs help"
1276,594401,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Stowe is very knowledgable in microbiology, but for a course that's supposed to look at a variety of biological topics, she only taught microbiology. She is a very tough grader, and will take points off for the simplest errors, or if she doesn't think you included enough info. Tests are very hard and too long for a 50 min period. Disappointing."
1277,594401,4.0,3.0,"I took Once and Future Plagues. She did use some lectures but they were more for getting a general understanding and we had no tests. It was mostly based on papers, either reflections or on microbiology topics. You will need to do a lot of research/other work, but her feedback was helpful to improve writing style. Overall a nice person."
1278,594401,4.0,4.0,"Overall, I found Dr. Stowe very interesting and helpful. Her teaching style is lecture heavy, which didn't help when class was virtual due to the pandemic, however, if you did the reading and participate, you will find that you will learn a lot from her. The only thing I have to say negatively, is her grading my essays. Her feedback isn't great."
1279,594401,5.0,4.0,"Professor Stowe is great at explaining concepts that are difficult to understand and is more than willing to meet with students in office hours or set up individual appointments! This class is fast paced and a bit harder as it's a 6 week online class instead of the normal 14 weeks on campus, but she is very helpful, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic!"
1280,594401,4.5,4.0,"Good class, the material is a bit dry but lab is sometimes fun, although a lot of work. Again, course material isn't too complex but MEMORIZE THE SLIDES and other book material too for the tests, otherwise you will fare poorly."
1281,594401,5.0,3.0,"I loved having Phage Hunters with Dr. SE! She was very helpful with the lab work we did, and gave us leeway with what we wanted to do with our research. The journal clubs she assigned required a lot of detail, and she also gave online quizzes. Otherwise, this was a fantastic class and I learned a lot!"
1282,594401,5.0,4.0,"Great professor and good class, however, the class is a TON of work but she is very willing to help, thus making it better.  If you like this stuff, take it but if you don't, avoid as its a lot of work.  Overall through, its pretty good."
1283,594401,3.0,4.0,"I would definitely recommend Stowe-Evans for 207. Towards the end of the year she tends to go over the material extremely quickly, and she isn't that helpful in office hours. But for most of the time she is fairly clear. And if you study hard and pay attention you should do well."
1284,594401,4.5,4.0,Greatest prof EVER to research with! I spent an entire summer and fall semester with her and I miss it now! Extremely helpful in teaching lab technique and supportive in hypothetical endeavors. Her daughters are cute when they visit and she gives treats :) Lets you do your own thing as long as you work hard and stay on task
1285,594401,4.5,4.0,"Stowe-Evans is great. She really cares about you doing well in her class and is very willing to help. Lots of extra credit and homework grades, so if you don't test well all the time, you can still get a really good grade. Take this class!"
1286,594401,4.0,4.0,"She really knows how to teach genetics, presents most of the material in a way students can understand. Gives alot of extra credit so its hard to do bad in this class."
1287,594401,4.0,3.0,She is a good professor and really knows her subject matter. At times she can be unclear but going to her office hours really helps.  She is really helpful and nice.  Go to class and take good notes and you will do fine in her class
1288,594401,5.0,2.0,She is a great prof. She is kind and caring and a great teacher. She wants her students to do well and will help them to do so. I also had her for research for a semester and she is amazing to do research with. She is one of the best in the biol dept
1289,594401,3.0,4.0,"At first I loved her, but then she would make a comment about something sucky in her life. Can be unnecessarily mean and takes the most RANDOM points off on exams. Takes out her problems on students, I think she's just a sad woman. Tests are difficult and thinks her class is the only one we've got...many pointless assignments due every class"
1290,594401,2.0,3.0,No Comments
1291,594401,3.5,2.0,"Willing to help, can be confusing in lecture, overall a good prof"
1292,594401,2.5,3.0,"she seems to think her class is more important than it is and is cocky sometimes.  just a little bit nuts/thinks daily crappy unimportant homework assignments are important.  take someone else if you can, but you'll be ok even though you have to fight to stay awake in her class."
1293,498145,5.0,1.0,"Had her for lab. Really fun experiments, the were simple, but still very interesting at the same time. In terms of grading its basically show up and you get an A. She is very funny and down to earth. 10/10 recommend."
1294,498145,5.0,1.0,Toner is the bomb - Easy grading and class structure and hilarious when she tries to convince the class that she is still hip!
1295,498145,5.0,1.0,"Easy and nice. If she likes you, you will do well."
1296,498145,5.0,2.0,"She's a great lab instructor. Mrs. Toner's really funny and endearing with all her anecdotes and family stories. Really really great; take her for lab because she's efficient, smart, and will try to help you finish lab after an hour. REALLY FANTASTIC; TOTALLY RECOMMENDED."
1297,498145,5.0,1.0,"If you take Baby bio, take Toner for lab. She is very nice and laid back. She is also a very easy grader. Labs don't last long either, they never lasted more then 90 mins, and most of the time were much shorter."
1298,498145,5.0,1.0,Simple and short labs. Very nice woman and will help you out when you ask questions.
1299,498145,5.0,2.0,Kate is great - and easy!  She makes learning biology interesting.
1300,498145,5.0,1.0,really really nice woman.  wants you to have fun. short labs. very understanding teacher!
1301,498145,5.0,1.0,Such an awesome teacher. Wants you to learn. Labs are quite simple and do not take up much time.
1302,2245093,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mordaunt is an awesome professor and a great guy. He's really funny and always has some really good stories and advice relating to the subject at hand. He can be a bit hard to follow in lectures, but he's always happy to meet outside of class and explain things more clearly. His tests can be difficult but he grades very generously."
1303,2245095,4.0,2.0,"Shooter is a great guy and a chill professor. He really doesn't like to grade harshly or put students through a lot of trouble. His philosophy is more like ""Look, I can tell you're a smart guy, so I wouldn't worry about grades too much"". He teaches with a lot of energy and can be a great guy to have casual conversation with."
1304,1901032,5.0,3.0,"Good deal of reading, but Professor McDonald is very reasonable and helpful. She wants her students to succeed. It's not an easy course, but I would definitely recommend her. She is very fair, pleasant and easy to talk to."
1305,1630697,1.0,3.0,Do not take this professor. Seemed to demotivated the entire class rather than encourage. Would give negatives if I could
1306,1630697,1.0,3.0,"Horrible. Would strongly advise against taking this Prof. Very bias and grades on very few quantifiable aspects, in part, due to the failed structure of MGMT 101, but mostly due to his clear mental issues. "
1307,1630697,5.0,5.0,"This course is unreal. gain so much life experience but it beats you down bro. He is hands off so you can learn on your own, but when you go to him he is fully there. He is very smart and experienced and it shows. I wish he was more involved, but the purpose of the course is to figure it out with your classmates. this course is a rite of passage."
1308,1630697,2.0,3.0,"Prof Martin is ok. He is nice and helpful if you talk to him one on one, but I'm not really a fan. He didn't know the TA's name (and they were at every in person class) and seemed to push a lot of his own work onto Terry and the other Prof. This class is theory heavy so accept that early on."
1309,1630697,5.0,3.0,Eric Martin is the best professor I've ever had. He is so intelligent and teaches in a meaningful manner. I learned more from our &frac34; semester (Covid-19) than any other class. Eric cares for his students and makes it clear that there's always someone in your corner on campus. I couldn't recommend a professor more.
1310,1630697,4.0,3.0,He likes to talk about himself/thinks highly of himself - his lectures can get a little dull. Grades fairly. Overall a nice guy!
1311,1630697,5.0,2.0,"He was extremely helpful, dedicated, and engaging for Mgmt. 101. He has an energetic personality. He really wanted to see our company succeed and offered helpful advice. He tended to grade papers slightly hard."
1312,1536486,5.0,1.0,"She's amazing, super helpful, wicked smart"
1313,492011,4.0,2.0,Lots of learning journals which are reflection assignments. She hasn't updated our grades once which is annoying. Super nice lady. you read a lot and listen to a lot of podcasts. Somewhat useless material. Super nice lady and runs a good class. 
1314,492011,5.0,5.0,"Hendry is super passionate about mgmt 101. The class is a ton of work, but I highly suggest you get involved in it. You will learn so much. Hendry did a great job as the professor. I would love to take her again."
1315,492011,5.0,5.0,"Hendry is super passionate about mgmt 101. The class is very difficult if you do it right,  but you come out with so much. Hendry did a great job as the professor. I would love to take her again."
1316,492011,5.0,2.0,"Best teacher and advisor ever. She cares about her students and if taken advantage of, will make anyone successful."
1317,492011,5.0,4.0,"Best professor I've had, best class I've taken."
1318,492011,5.0,3.0,"MGMT was the most rewarding classes i've ever taken. She's willing and helpful for whatever questions you have. She cares. She's smart. Clear and concise. She's a great professor who if you get the opportunity you should definitely take. You'll come out with a lot, and grading is fair... The more you put in the better you'll do. best prof i've had"
1319,492011,5.0,5.0,"You have to be ready to work in any mgmt 101 class you take, but having Prof. Hendry there makes it all the better. Best class I have ever taken at Bucknell by far. She is extremely passionate and cares immensely about each individual student. On the last day of class, she cried. That should tell you something. Take her class, you wont regret it!!!"
1320,492011,4.0,4.0,"best professor i've had yet at bucknell.. very passionate about her teaching... i would highly recommend her, she's great!"
1321,492011,3.0,3.0,Best professor I've had at Bucknell. Class is very interesting.
1322,492011,5.0,2.0,"She was so excited about the class, especially her companies. She is sweet, but also a really good teacher. She uses powerpoints a lot in lecture, which she posts online; however, much of the important information is not on the slides, so you have to take notes as well. Take her class."
1323,492011,5.0,2.0,No Comments
1324,1509868,5.0,4.0,"She is very enthusiastic, and passionate about the material and very caring and helpful towards students. We had no tests, but essays which tended to be graded hard for a 100-level course. Still the material was interesting and she was very engaging."
1325,1509868,5.0,3.0,Absolutely one of my favorites. Professor McCoy is truly inspiring. Her love of the material transfers onto her students. She was fair and engaging. I miss her class very much !
1326,1509868,2.5,4.0,"Agree with above comments.  Grades ridiculously hard for a 100-level class.  Answered all the questions she asked for on papers, yet I was still punished for not answering other questions&#63;  She only sees her own views, and if you write against them, you will be punished accordingly.  Regret this class, as it will not hurt my GPA. Don't suggest her"
1327,1509868,2.0,3.0,DO NOT TAKE HER. She has favorites and even they do not get a good grade. REALLY BORING. She is a completely unfair grader and she doesn't see any viewpoint besides her's.
1328,1180145,4.0,2.0,The class was fun to take and the professor was eccentric. She grades her assignments pretty easily and is forgiving with many mistakes you could make. Her class is made up of many smaller grades so doing badly on one assignment won't tank you.
1329,1180145,5.0,1.0,"Guerrero was such a nice prof! 207 was much easier than 105 and Guerrero made the material fun. She incorporated the textbook material into class and made it fun and relevant to learn about. Also, there was not a lot of mandatory work, making the class much less stressful. Worth taking to fulfill a W2 credit."
1330,1180145,5.0,1.0,"If you plan on taking Spanish as a language requirement, definitely take 207 with Guerrero. She is the easiest grader and helps so much with the work. A LOT less work than the lower level Spanish classes and class was always a blast. As long as your good at memorization, you'll get a good grade!"
1331,1180145,5.0,1.0,best ever. take her class 100%. super easy and she's the sweetest
1332,1180145,4.0,1.0,She was such a sweetheart! The class was pretty simple and she made it easy to do well.
1333,1180145,5.0,4.0,She cares about students and has a good sense of humor.
1334,1180145,4.5,3.0,"If you do the work you can get a good grade.  We got slammed on the first exam, especially grammar, but she helped a lot and I wound up doing pretty well by the end of the semester."
1335,1180145,2.0,1.0,Easy as pie....
1336,1180145,5.0,4.0,Amazing teacher! I loved her classes.
1337,1180145,5.0,3.0,"I like it when we read and discuss articles from Latin American and Spanish newspapers.  She's smart, a good teacher, plus she's hot."
1338,1180145,5.0,4.0,"Don't take this class if you need an easy A.  A lot of reading and writing.  Otherwise a good class. I liked the books and films, learned more about immigration, and my Spanish got better. Nice prof."
1339,1180145,5.0,3.0,VERY good teacher. She is really understanding and makes the class fun and not very difficult. Mostly conversation based classes with a little bit of grammar review before tests.
1340,1180145,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor.
1341,1180145,5.0,4.0,"Professor Elisabeth is great.  She makes everyone talk, but when she corrects you she doesn't make you feel stupid.  Uses current events, poetry, art to make class interesting."
1342,1180145,4.5,2.0,"So sweet and understanding. She speaks really clearly and slowly and has cute, funny stories."
1343,1180145,5.0,2.0,I miss taking Spanish with her!!
1344,1180145,3.5,3.0,"Very organized. Fair grader, easy tests and quizzes. Doesn't correct you very much when you speak, though. Really nice personality too!"
1345,1180145,5.0,1.0,great teacher.  presents the information clearly and effectively.
1346,1057266,2.0,4.0,"He loves it when you regurgitate his opinion on assignments. He will challenge you to back up your statements, but do not stray from his opinion. Also this class is very content heavy on Africa, if you like Africa this is for you. If you are interested in Int. Poli., Doces is not for you."
1347,1057266,5.0,2.0,"A lot of students at Bucknell like Professor Doces for the wrong reasons: he gives out a lot of As, attendance isn't mandatory, and he's just overall very chill. The right reasons to like Professor Doces are: he is incredibly knowledgeable in the field of political development, he's willing to meet outside of class, and he sometimes rock a mustache"
1348,1057266,3.0,3.0,"Everyone loves Doces! He is a great teacher and lecturer, however, I have found that he is a bit rude to those participating in class. If you say something against his beliefs he will shut you down and make you feel stupid. Class is fine but can become boring at times."
1349,1057266,5.0,3.0,"Doces is one of the best professors in the poli sci department. he always goes over the readings in The lectures, and gives a study guide before tests. classes are super easy to get an A in if you just show up and try and hes so willing to meet with you outside of class and get to know you. definitely take him if you can and need the class."
1350,1057266,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors Ive ever had. Genuinely wants to get to know his students.
1351,1057266,5.0,3.0,"Doces is great. His lectures are interesting and his grading expectations are clear. Gives exam questions ahead of time so students will succeed if they study. Relatable, funny guy who gets along with and relates to his students well. Also kept us updated on current events which I enjoyed."
1352,1057266,5.0,3.0,Great Professor. Classes are interesting and easy to follow. Decent amount of work but always has a purpose. Tests are straight forward and studying is easy. Doces himself is funny and great to talk to and is usually available outside of class.
1353,1057266,4.0,4.0,Doces is awesome.  He is super funny and will spend the first 20 minutes of class just talking about sports or whatever else is on his mind.  He does give a decent amount of papers and two pretty long exams but overall if you stay on top of your work an A is pretty easy to achieve.
1354,1057266,5.0,3.0,Prof doces is great i didn't mind waking up at 8 AM to take his class! Tests are fine if you do the question sets he gives
1355,1057266,5.0,3.0,"Doces is one of my favorite professors here at Bucknell.  If you share his sense of humor, he's hilarious.  Class is not that hard, but he gets very upset if you come to class unprepared.  Doesn't punish you for not coming to class, but will definitely call you out on it (or have someone in the class call you on your phone) if you skip."
1356,1057266,5.0,2.0,Professor Doces is definitely one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell. His lectures are meaningful and you can definitely tell that he cares about his students. His tests are extremely straight forward as long as you complete the problem sets.
1357,1057266,4.0,2.0,Study the questions he gives you in class for the exams. He grades the paper harshly. Overall great class if you put effort into it. Doces is the man!
1358,1057266,4.0,3.0,"Here's the thing folks, John Doces is a great guy. Not great like Michael Jordan great, but probably as great as that one uncle you have that used to be SO COOL. You know what I'm talking about... the uncle that was always around when you were younger and always made the funniest jokes but now you never really see him anymore which is kinda sad..."
1359,1057266,4.5,2.0,"Definition of a chill professor, very generous with extension and very relaxed about homework and teaches a lot through more pertinent and useful sidetracks than any actual lesson plan. Ton of fun."
1360,1057266,3.5,1.0,"The class is very little time commitment, just a few short readings before class. We had pop quizzes, but if you read you could do fairly well. He gave you all of the exam questions ahead of time. He graded the final paper harshly."
1361,1057266,4.0,3.0,"great lecturer, interesting readings, you won't fall asleep in class. kind of opinionated. if you want discussion not your class. tests are easy if you prepare, very passable class if you go, take notes and pay attention."
1362,1057266,4.5,1.0,"He was a really good professor who knew exactly what he was talking about and was very clear on the information you needed to know for tests. He was very interesting to listen to, however, if you do not like primarily lecture style lessons this may not be for you. Overall I found him to be a very good teacher and would recommend his class."
1363,1057266,3.5,2.0,"Doces is a definitely of the young professor variety. Not a traditional lecturer, but if you're looking for a change of pace he's it. Go to office hours, get on his good side and you'll enjoy the class. Only flaw is he can be narrow sighted and view any opinion other than his own as wrong"
1364,1057266,2.5,2.0,"He is an okay teacher. Sometimes I felt like some of the other students knew more about the topics than he did, but he's a great guy. It doesn't hurt that he's good looking too!"
1365,1057266,5.0,2.0,"Excellent teacher. Very knowledgeable and passionate about politics, economics, and global issues. Doesn't just lecture. Lots of reading, but assignments are straightforward and he's a pretty easy grader. I would recommend some economics background before taking the class though. Awesome guy, get to know him outside class too."
1366,1057266,4.5,2.0,"Took 170 and 290.  Doces is what other professors should strive to be.  He doesn't pile unnecessary work on you, but he won't let you free ride either.  He really knows his stuff and you will learn from him.  Hands down the coolest guy I know."
1367,1057266,5.0,2.0,HOT. Great professor. Always clear and didn't just talk about the facts. Encouraged us to think on our own. Tests are extremely straight forward and he gives you some of the questions beforehand. Highly reccommend
1368,1057266,5.0,1.0,Hot for teacher!
1369,1057266,4.5,4.0,"Amazing guy, learned so much, tests are very straight forward, and he counts class participation, if you want a fair and great teacher take him, perry fumoso loved him"
1370,1057266,5.0,3.0,"Loved having this guy. Incredible teacher, always make it clear what his objectives are. Gave us simulations, kept us active, certainly a role model"
1371,1057266,4.0,2.0,"Keeps the material interesting, even early in the morning. Lots of group activities and current events articles incorporated- not just a lecture class. Fair grader and makes sure you are well prepared for the 2 tests, will meet with you numerous times discussing the only paper you have to write. Made me want to take more IR and polysci courses."
1372,1057266,4.5,1.0,I had him for Intro to International Politics; he's such a cool guy. Grade is based 30% midterm 40% final 15% editorial project 15% attendance. He's the only teacher I've ever had that's told me &quot;you don't need to do as much as work your doing&quot;. Definitely take a class with him if you can.
1373,1886707,5.0,3.0,By far the best Mechanical professor at Bucknell. He is super chill and overall an amazing human being. If I could I would have him teach all my classes. 10000/10
1374,1886707,5.0,3.0,"Sloboda is a great professor, very easy to talk to and explains things really well. He's friendly and seems to love his job and care about his students! Homework assigned weekly, and half of lecture was used for working on problems/examples. On your schedule, the weekly class time on Wednes. night 7-8pm Sloboda only used 3x for exams."
1375,1886707,5.0,3.0,"Very helpful and chill professor. Good sense of humor, down to earth"
1376,936436,4.0,1.0,"Ridiculously easy class, but there was always good discussion among students. Her policies and expectations for the class were crystal clear. Knew her subject matter well and was really open to different opinions."
1377,936436,4.0,1.0,ridiculously easy class. the work is minimal with no tests aside from a couple of group projects and you absolutely must go to class! she assigns work during class that you can not make up and they're worth a decent percentage of your final grade. she's a really nice professor and tries really hard to make the class fun and get everyone involved
1378,936436,1.5,1.0,"easy teacher, but the boringness is unreal. dont take the class. the A isnt worth it. shes so mean its like weird"
1379,936436,5.0,1.0,extremely easy and she is a great professor. Wasn't interested in education before taking the class but she made class very enjoyable
1380,936436,4.0,1.0,no tests- about hour of work a week- classes aren't too bad- teacher is friendly and an easy grader
1381,936436,1.0,1.0,"Easiest, most pointless, and most boring class ever. Carney is not very friendly and a little sour, but the work is sooo easy and she is an easy grader."
1382,498165,5.0,3.0,"Professor Daniel is a great guy. Cares about his students, answers emails very quickly, and has a good sense of humor. Rarely calls anyone out in class for participation and has interesting lectures."
1383,498165,4.0,2.0,"Super chill guy, but if you're not into rocks, the class is SO boring. Easy lab credit though if you need one, just know the labs can be brutal. "
1384,498165,3.0,3.0,Overall he is an average professor.  Try to get on his good side early because it will help you out in how he grades your lab reports and quizzes.  He takes forever to get back any graded assignments so don't expect to see anything you hand in until the end of the semester.  I wouldn't be afraid of taking him though.
1385,498165,1.5,4.0,"He is such a condescending person. If you're not interested in geology and he can tell, he goes out of his way to dock you points on labs and tests. It takes him YEARS to grade everything, and everything is graded unreasonably harshly for a 100 level class. One ""pro"" is that he gives you a list of potential questions for the test beforehand."
1386,498165,5.0,2.0,"Daniel is one of my favorite professors at this school (second only to Bernhard Kuhn).  He is SUCH a reasonable person which is sometimes hard to find in a professor.  He is understanding and completely available outside of class for help.  He always answers emails, I took geol purely for requirement, and i actually learned in this class"
1387,498165,4.0,1.0,"Daniels is maybe the chillest teacher you'll meet at Bucknell. This man doesn't take himself too seriously but he's pretty into geology, but acknowledges that his students probably aren't. Basically, you'll learn a few things, get a good grade if you try(at all), and will probably enjoy it more than you thought."
1388,498165,4.5,1.0,"Really nice guy with a quirky sense of humor.  Gives a few pre-lab quizes that you can use your notes for but theyre still a little tricky.  Over all, not too tough a class if you care at all about geology."
1389,498163,5.0,3.0,He is the sweetest man ever. He really cares about his students and the material and is really forgiving and willing to work with you. I recommend taking Evolution of the Earth is you are not a math/science person as your lab requirement because you will need to put in effort but it is relatively straightforward if you are willing to work. 
1390,498163,5.0,2.0,Jeff Trop is a gem of a professor who makes the class fun and interesting. Pay attention and do your work and you'll do fine
1391,498163,5.0,3.0,"Much of the course consists of chapter summaries and reflections. While it's easier to summarize readings, Professor Trop is more interested in your reflections and the quality of them. Stay on top of the reading and you'll be fine."
1392,498163,5.0,3.0,"Trop was by far the best teacher I've had at this school. Very nice and funny, makes learning geology something fun. He provides study guides for every test and the actual test questions are based on material on the guides."
1393,498163,5.0,2.0,best professor I have ever had. He is very accessible and wants his students to succeed. Keeps the class fun and engaging and really just fosters an enjoyable learning enviornment. I am someone who does not enjoy science and he really made me love a class I didn't anticipate liking.
1394,498163,4.0,2.0,Trop is a cute man full of dad jokes and rock puns.
1395,498163,4.0,3.0,"Professor Trop really takes a boring subject and makes it fun. I do not know how he does it, but he does. His class is the usual you get what you put in."
1396,498163,5.0,2.0,Such an awesome guy that really cares.  Pay attention in class and go to the review sessions and you will be fine.
1397,498163,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, really cares about his students and the subject matter of the class."
1398,498163,5.0,2.0,Excellent teacher. Best I've had so far and I had no interest in geology before I took his class!
1399,498163,5.0,3.0,"Love Trop.  He cares about teaching and it always shows.  He'll push you to work harder if you are slacking and that is exactly what I needed.  His class is very interesting, and he makes sure that that is always the case.  I loved 104 so much I'm taking 221 this year: one of our activities is a kayak trip...for points.  Take a class with Trop!"
1400,498163,4.0,4.0,"LOVE TROP. best teacher i have had! he is SO helpful if you meet with him and is very passionate. tests are kind of hard, but if you study you'll do fine. take this class!"
1401,498163,4.5,3.0,"I took a non-lab geology class with trop.  It's obvious he loves his work, and his excitement was infectious.  His dedication to me as a student made me feel guilty whenever I missed class.  He has a great sense of humor.  107 wasn't a ton of work, but wasn't incredibly easy either.  Thanks to him, I'm now considering a geology minor."
1402,498163,5.0,3.0,"LOVE Troposaurus! (yes, that was his nickname in school) Very clear in lecture, gives comprehensive review sheets for all exams and has review sessions, no tricks or surprises! Always available for help, definitely my favorite prof. Changed my major and minor because of him, taking him next year too. Take class if you can! Makes outdoor labs fun. &lt;"
1403,498163,1.5,4.0,"Personally, I found Trop to be  as cold and hard as a diamond. He was completely unhelpful and  miserable when talking to students one on one, is difficult to understand, and has NO sense of humor whatsoever. DON'T get on his bad side! When I have classes in O'Leary I take the long way around just so I won't have to walk by his office. Avoid him!"
1404,498163,5.0,2.0,"Love this guy. Really cares that you learn the material. Not the easiest guy in the world, but really takes effort into account. Great sense of humor. So much fun on field labs."
1405,498163,5.0,1.0,"Had Trop for Sixth Extinction foundation seminar- definitely one of the coolest teachers I've ever had- can field any question and give you a straight up answer. Helpful, clear, fair and no BS. Trop rocks!"
1406,498163,4.5,1.0,"He's a great professor. I had him for my foundation seminar, so it was easy, but regardless, he's energetic and loves what he does. He's also hillarious. Take him if you can."
1407,498163,5.0,4.0,Probably the best professor at Bucknell. He really has his schist together(i can make puns too).  Awesome guy that is very passionate about his work.  Not a cake walk class so only take if interested.  Will go out of his way to help in any way
1408,498163,4.0,4.0,"Great guy, willing to help outside of class and posts his lectures online before class for your conveniance.  BUT gives 8 quizes no exams.  Keep in mind, quizes are all you get and theyre tough.  Like the other guy said, like rocks take the class, dont like rocks, avoid it."
1409,498163,5.0,4.0,"Tough class. Tons of work. Dr. Trop is brilliant and sincere. I think his mother was a feldspar and his father was a basalt, which produced super-geo-boy-wonder-rock-genius! Another teacher that is taken for granite (I kill myself). Like rocks, take the class. Just want the credit, avoid it."
1410,1624580,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors. No tests and although there is a lot of homework, it is labor based & she explains she set up the course so that it is most likely to be remembered (based off of psych studies). Normally lectures are boring but she keeps them interesting and is very knowledgable about the subject. Participate a little & she'll like u"
1411,1624580,5.0,4.0,Professor Stevenson is a fantastic lecturer and has ample knowledge about the field of neuroscience and behavior. I thoroughly enjoyed her lectures and found myself learning and retaining so much of the information that she provided to the class. She is excellent at answering questions and works until she knows her students understand a topic. 
1412,1624580,3.0,3.0,"Professor Stevenson gives good lectures, but also assigns tons of busy work that is graded pretty harshly. You won't get any points unless you go into detail about everything, even if your answers are correct. Besides that, it's a pretty good class :)"
1413,1624580,5.0,3.0,"Professor Stevenson was incredible in PSYC100. She has great lectures, but she comes from the neuro background, so she was very detailed in the bio aspect of psych, but still knew a lot about all the disciplines. She uses an online textbook for most of the reading, and assigns a lot of busy work. Labor based grading is awesome, but do the work!"
1414,1624580,4.0,4.0,"Professor Stevenson is a very kind and qualified teacher. She truly knows the subject and wants you to love it as much as she does. However, her labor-based class structure means that there is tons of homework that often feels like busy work, and the lessons can feel very redundant."
1415,1624580,1.0,1.0,"While it was this professor's first time teaching this class, the whole course felt carelessly executed. The syllabus had excited me for what to expect in class, but textbook readings became my primary (and only) source of information, lectures felt aimless, and all of our in-class time was spent in breakout rooms to complete busy work."
1416,1624580,3.0,1.0,"She's an odd one. Super strict about some stuff and super lenient about other stuff. PSYC 250 was the easiest class I've ever taken in college as a result of the labor log system. Just do the work and you'll get an A, but the work can be super &quot;busy work&quot; orientated. Most people just sat in class on their laptops, but the class was fun."
1417,1624580,5.0,4.0,This is the best professor I have ever had hands down. She really cares about students not just academically but as human beings. She encourages students to take interest in learning the material rather than forcing it down your throat which means you actually retain the information later. Absolutely loved her!
1418,1624580,5.0,3.0,one of the best classes I have taken at bucknell. labor work class but as long as you do the assigned weekly homework you will get a good grade. no exams. i have learned so much in this class and 10/10 recommend.
1419,1624580,3.5,4.0,"She's an amazing teacher and human being. The class was hard and required a lot of independent study, but everyone benefited from it. There are lots of opportunities and different ways to get points in her class, from tests and participation to the two big binder projects. Class time is used to clarify things in the readings in small groups."
1420,1624580,3.0,4.0,"Not a really hard class but took a lot of time out of each day. Writing assignments start early, and same with your final group projects. Go and see her before tests and the things that matter most and you will do better! Only a few tests but really require pure memorization, study early to do better and makes final much easier."
1421,1624580,3.0,4.0,"She is a really nice woman and tells interesting and personal examples. In class quizzes are to be expected and memorizing an entire chapter from your textbook is also expected. Exams are brutal, with random information that was not covered in class. Expect to score low on exams but make up for it in participation and other assignments (2 essays). "
1422,1624580,4.0,3.0,"The class is very interesting and Stevenson is very friendly and personable. However, she does not teach the material at all and gives A LOT of assignments, some of which feels more like useless busy work. I love the subject material but I hate how we have to teach it to ourselves. Tests are very fair and do not count for that much overall. "
1423,1624580,5.0,2.0,"Jennie Stevenson is very passionate about the materials she teach and also wants students to really learn for life, and not just for the few exams you have in the class. She makes you do so with very engaging activities, both in and outside of class. The class has fair amount of work, but you WILL earn what you work for. "
1424,1624580,4.5,3.0,I loved Professor Stevenson! She makes the class very interesting and engaging and really makes sure you know why the material matters in the real world. It's a very reasonable amount of work with realistic expectations.She's a really fair grader and as long as you stay on top of the work you will do just fine.
1425,1624580,5.0,3.0,"Definitely my favorite class at Bucknell, largely due to Stevenson being an amazing professor. She expects a lot of hard work in this class, but it's worth it. You learn so much about the biology and psychology behind different drugs of abuse. She is clearly very passionate about her students doing well and is always willing to help if needed!"
1426,1624580,4.5,1.0,"Stevenson is the best! Her teaching style is very clear and linear, which makes even difficult topics easy to understand. Her exams are straight-forward and easy, though she does test you on material that was not discussed in class but was covered in the book."
1427,1624580,5.0,2.0,Really great professor. All material she goes over is applicable to other Neuro/Psych classes. And she makes things really easy to understand
1428,1624580,3.0,4.0,"Professor Stevenson is great in class, but her tests seem to pull out random pieces of information we barely discussed.  In class I enjoyed Professor Stevenson.  She is good at keeping class interesting, has great examples, and seems friendly.  She gives us a lot of busy work homework which seems like a waste of time, but it helps your grade."
1429,1624580,5.0,4.0,"I LOVE Professor Stevenson. This is my first class with her and I would take every other class with her if I could! She is fun to listen to in class and very clear in her teaching. Fair grader and test maker, too. She will help you all she can and do her best to help you do well! You can really tell she loves what she does."
1430,1624580,5.0,3.0,"I overall enjoyed the course and thought Stevenson was engaging and knew her stuff! It is a lot of information to memorize for each test, but a lot of the material is covered in previous classes. Although sometimes class seemed to be dragged out as long as possible and there are a lot of homework assignments, this class is worthwhile!"
1431,2533894,5.0,4.0,"He is one of the best professors I have ever had, he is a great teacher and you will learn a lot no matter what class you would take. Make sure to take the quizzes seriously as they can add up if you are doing poorly or not at all. He is very understanding and will help you through any situation, just talk to him and be proactive. "
1432,2533894,4.0,3.0,Super smart guy but definitely goes through topics quickly so make sure to not miss class to often and go to office hours if you are confused because getting behind in this class sucks. Curves our quiz grades so the person who does the best gets a 100 which was very helpful. 
1433,2533894,5.0,2.0,Had learnt a lot from the class materials. He has some classroom drama and good design that will help you learn. There are many extra credit assignments that will help you get a good grade. Projects and weekly HW are always interesting and I found them rewarding to complete. Would take his classes again. 
1434,2533894,1.0,5.0,Teaches material that is inconsistent with what the other ANOP 102 professors teach. Practice exams are way harder the actual time exams
1435,2533894,5.0,2.0,"A very knowledgeable person, and I benefited a lot from him. His class is full of interactions, and sometimes his drama is very interesting and will help you learning. I recommend to spend more time with him outside classroom, as there are a lot to learn."
1436,2533894,5.0,4.0,"Professor Serra cares a lot about his students, and wants them all the succeed. With that being said he expects a lot from his students and wants to challenge them. His homework's do take a while to complete, but he only gave one major homework assignment per week. He encourages and likes when students participate. He is a very friendly professor!"
1437,2533894,3.0,2.0,Professor Serra's class is very easy but boring. Students get lost and don't pay attention because his lectures don't really make sense. I even felt like I didn't understand half the concepts but still had an A in the class. Not the best at explaining.
1438,467464,3.0,2.0,The man..plain and simple..genuine guy and teaches real easy and in lamen's terms.  Just a quarky good guy all around and is a red sox fan
1439,467464,4.5,2.0,take class with him if you have the opportunity. very helpful and genuine person.
1440,467464,4.0,2.0,real nice guy. sweats a lot and drinks a diet coke every morning.  pretty fair guy overall and tests are not to bad at all.  really liked him and taught material clearly.
1441,467464,5.0,2.0,"Awesome guy, really knows his stuff and is extremely helpful. I would take any of his classes just to have him as a teacher again."
1442,467464,4.0,2.0,I took the half credit math course combinatorics/graph theory.  He is a fair grader and tells you everything on the test.
1443,467464,2.0,4.0,Not a good teacher...not a fair grader...boring and doesn't know how to engage students in material...goes through material too fast and is sometimes unclear...try to switch out if u get him as a teacher
1444,467464,4.5,2.0,Sometimes he goes a lil fast but he is a good teacher. Makes sure you understand the info. Very helpful. Funny at times. tests are fair. Great guy
1445,467464,4.5,3.0,"Only had him for a few days but wished I had him the entire semester, very good at teaching"
1446,467464,4.5,3.0,Really nice guy.  Always interested in helping.  Very intelligent and Probability was his forte.  Differential Equations was a good class also with him
1447,467464,4.0,2.0,"wieda is a really nice guy and a good teacher...a bit fast paced and difficult to understand from time to time, but he is a very lenient grader and test are straightforward. easy to get a B in this class"
1448,467464,3.5,4.0,Weida is the man! Very entertaining. Can be hard to follow b/c he is so mathematical.
1449,467464,4.5,2.0,Good teacher... Sometimes goes a little fast but its not to hard to keep up with him
1450,467464,4.5,3.0,No Comments
1451,467466,5.0,3.0,Loved taking her class. She is not a tough grader as long as she can see that you are attempting.
1452,467466,4.0,2.0,"A little overwhelming but exciting from day 1 because she speaks almost no English in class. Rather strict grader (necessary for beginner language class) but helpful and is an easy grader. Studying is absolutely essential, and do the extra HW sheets too, they help a lot. Tests are difficult but only if you don't study. "
1453,467466,5.0,1.0,Easy test. Easy grader. Have assignments in English.
1454,467466,4.5,3.0,"Very clear, great for a beginning language class.  Speaks almost no English yet makes sure that we really grasp concepts.  Is personable and interesting, very knowledgeable about Germany and the language/culture.  Very slight American accent on her German as her husband is German and it is all she speaks at home."
1455,467466,3.5,4.0,Didn't learn much. professor is a very hard grader for a low level class where we are just learning. She doesn't teach us what we should be learning. Bad class topics and organization overall. Wouldn't recommend her at all.
1456,467466,4.0,2.0,"Very nice prof, flexible with deadlines, cares about the students"
1457,467466,1.0,5.0,I love German.  But Helen's was the worse German course I ever took....
1458,467466,1.5,3.0,Helen has a strong US accent speaking German. LOTS of reading and often very boring. Not an easy grader.
1459,467466,4.0,3.0,No Comments
1460,485899,3.5,3.0,Russell Dennis is the greatest man alive.  He is a sincerely kind person who really loves what he teaches.  The class can sometimes be dull..but he is so great that it is okay.  We love him and don't want him to retire!!!! Bucknell should should honor him as a man and professor.
1461,485899,3.0,1.0,"Boring .. 3 tests if you bomb 1 you get a terrible grade. My semester grades read A,A,B-,D - and that D isn't for Dennis - the books for educ 103 should be burned"
1462,485899,2.5,4.0,"Umm .. Boring........ but if you go the class before exams and read like 100 pages taht day you can get a B - take notes, dont come on dicussions your learn more from the back or your eyelids in your room .. exams will screw you if you don't prepare .. seriously i would know"
1463,485899,5.0,1.0,Professor Dennis Rocks!
1464,485899,3.0,2.0,"Dennis is such a cute old man! But his class is sooooo boring. You dont have to go to class just make sure you read. the tests are easy bc they are just on the key term worksheets he gives out. so he basically gives you the test ahead of time. go to class on the day before the test, hell go over it even more."
1465,485899,5.0,1.0,"A very easy class.  You can Either read the Nelson and not go to discussion days or not read Nelson and go to discussion days, whichever you want.  Make sure to go the day before the test!"
1466,485899,4.0,1.0,"I'm assuming that &quot;R.&quot; Dennis is the &quot;Russell&quot; Dennis, whose class I took in Spring 1970!! The class was informative although aspiring teachers usually aren't very interested in the legal aspects of the profession. Assuming that &quot;R&quot; and Russell are one and the same, he has been there at least 35 years, which in itself is amazing."
1467,485899,3.5,1.0,"Extremely boring to attend, but still very easy.  Don't go on discussion days because nothing constructive is done.  The day before the test he tells you exactly where the questions come from and possible essay topics."
1468,485899,4.0,2.0,"pretty easy class... all you have to do is go to the lectures and take notes.. dont bother going on discussion days, he doesnt notice anyway and its not helpful.. read the book & listen in lecture.. he tells you everything that will be on the tests the day before."
1469,1321483,1.0,1.0,She does not care about what grade you get.
1470,1321483,3.0,1.0,She's really easy. Like really easy. You get one homework assignment a week and there are only three tests all of which are open book and online working in groups
1471,1321483,1.0,5.0,Cannot communicate with students whatsoever. I would highly recommend not taking her class. Hard class
1472,1321483,3.5,4.0,"class discussions are entertaining and funny, I rarely dozed off in this class. she does a really good job of relating textbook lessons to current events and real life issues. majority of midterm and final exams are online/open book, but they are on the difficult side. lots of reading. learned a lot in the class, though and I would recommend her."
1473,1321483,2.0,5.0,"Class discussion is usually entertaining, however her lessons are way too confusing and she moves very quickly. Hard tests, lots of homework, over..difficult course!"
1474,1321483,3.5,4.0,She's kind and humorous but can't communicate with students well. We don't know what she wants and our answers are always not what she wants.
1475,1780238,5.0,4.0,Doc Martine is amazing! He doesn't take attendance but going to class is very important. It's majority lecture but he makes them fun. He's quirky and LOVES teaching about plants. One homework a week and 4 Exams across the semester with a few random assignments in between. There is extra credit available as well. Join the plant party!! 
1476,1780238,5.0,3.0,I took this as a requirement and am a person who previously hated anything stem related. BUT this class is so interesting and honestly look forward to going to. Learned more in this class then before. Gives lots of fun facts and keeps class super interesting. It's clear he loves this and does a great job showing his passion! LOVED THIS CLASS!!!
1477,1780238,5.0,3.0,"His class is fair. It's about how much you are willing to do. Homework questions once a week on a book that's super interesting and gives context to concepts. He uses videos very fun, has own theme song and lectures. Love going to his class always have a laugh and learn a lot. If you want to well pay attention, go to class and study."
1478,1780238,5.0,2.0,"Doc is amazing!! Even though his class was really early, we were always doing something exciting enough to get out of bed for! There was a lot of presentations, but even for an introvert, they were very relaxed and fun! Doc cares a lot for all of his students and even made it a class assignment to meet with him and get to know him a little better."
1479,1780238,5.0,2.0,Doc has been my favorite professor so far. He is seriously passionate about what he does and wants you to get excited about science too! His class was not difficult but it goes a long way when he sees you put effort in/ particulate. I would highly recommend him!
1480,1780238,5.0,3.0,"Best Review for Plants class: One 15 page reading a week with up to 5 reading questions (light), 4 exams a semester (one can be dropped), lecture for class. Prof Martine cares so much about the subject and shows his own produced plant videos! DO THE EXTRA CREDIT -- its easy just post a plant on an IG spam every week. He is very accessible and nice!"
1481,1780238,5.0,2.0,"I took Professor Martine's BIO150 course to fulfill a gen ed requirement, but I ended up enjoying it so much that I'm considering shifting my career path to focus more on plants. Anyone who's looking for a truly interesting course filled with lots of fun facts should take Martine's course! I had an awesome semester and genuinely enjoyed the class."
1482,1780238,5.0,3.0,"Doc. Martine is super passionate, so even though I have a hard time enjoying biology, his passion for plants and nature rubs off and puts the boring stuff --biological processes and structures-- in perspective. There's no textbook which I appreciate, but gotta pay attention in lecture. The book (not textbook) is easy and cool."
1483,1780238,5.0,3.0,This is one of the best professors I have ever had. I have really enjoyed this class and would recommend it to anyone interested in any topic what so ever. He makes everything seem interesting. Anyone looking for a great professor this is the guy for you.
1484,1780238,1.0,4.0,"the class itself is so boring bceause it's entirely lecture. You'd think the class would be easy because science is supposed to be straightforward, but no if you don't pay attention to one speicific word or one phrase used in class than there is no way you will do well on the tests."
1485,1780238,1.0,4.0,"Don't try to argue your grade, he won't budge. Office hours not very helpful because there is overall too much content. Hard to get a good grade because if you don't remember the one word he mentioned during the second lecture of the first lesson you lose 5 points on a test (hyperbolic statement but not far off)."
1486,1780238,4.0,5.0,I don't know why he gets such a easy grading review.... hardest class I've ever taken at Bucknell and its a 100s level course. Many people in my class have already dropped and are failing. Great guy but unfair exams
1487,1780238,5.0,3.0,Take his foundation seminar and any of his other classes. They're the type where you learn a lot but it's easy and enjoyable along the way. He really cares and is a cool guy in general.
1488,1780238,5.0,1.0,"Professor Martine is an amazing professor.  He loves plants, and makes learning about plants really fun.  Even if you are a non-major, like myself, I would recommend this class to anyone.  If given the chance, take this professor."
1489,1780238,5.0,2.0,Great teacher and great guy. Very helpful in office hours. Very clear with the material and keeps you very interested. I highly recommend to take a class taught by him. You won't be disappointed.
1490,1780238,5.0,1.0,Very helpful teacher.  Really loves his material and explains it very well.  Take him if you can because he keeps the class interesting.
1491,1780238,4.5,2.0,"Awesome teacher and great guy overall. One of my favorite professors. He makes jokes and keeps the class engaging. I don't mind going to this class! And it was at 9am. Really helpful during office hours, exams were fair, and homework was minimal/rarely difficult."
1492,762383,4.0,3.0,He definitely wants you to take his class more serious than it is. You don't have to do the reading for class however it helps. There are way more assignments that don't allow for a lot of opinion than i expected from this course. Abe is so nice and helpful.
1493,762383,5.0,1.0,"Super nice Jewish guy Very little time commitment Write like a liberal and he'll give you 100's on papers Thinks he's teaching a Middle-School class so he expects very little ability out of you, which in the end is a good thing Solid option for sure for Educ 101"
1494,762383,3.5,3.0,"No tests or quizzes. Grading became more difficult because he was tired of people thinking his class was an easy A but its still not very difficult as long as you follow along in class and at least skim the readings. Don't miss class. Really nice, genuine, and interesting guy, and is always available for help. I would definitely recommend."
1495,762383,4.5,3.0,"Easily my favorite professor. Makes class very interesting, engages his students, and fair grader. He is very nice and sincere and is always available for help. His class is a lot of reading but it's interesting and relevant material.  I would take any class he taught."
1496,762383,5.0,2.0,Really good guy. Assigns a lot of reading but you def don't have to do it all. Wants you to get an A. Really values you showing up and participating. Interesting class and will help you  improve your writing.
1497,762383,4.0,1.0,"He really cares about his students, and even though he assigns a lot of reading you do not have to complete all of it to participate in the discussions.  He allows you to edit your essays and as long as you follow his ""format"" for writing and add in his your corrections you will be fine.  The class discussions are also interesting."
1498,762383,5.0,2.0,"Abe is the best teacher. He assigns a lot of reading, but you can easily get away with not doing it and rather just skimming. He is a somewhat tough grader of essays, but lets you send in a rough draft which he corrects. Overall, absolutely take College 2.0. "
1499,762383,4.0,2.0,He's a very nice person but I didn't like the amount of unneccessary reading and group projects in our foundation seminar. He is clear and an easy grader. He's fine but I didn't get much out of his class. 
1500,762383,5.0,3.0,"I went on a service trip to New Orleans with Abe, he's hillarious. A really nice, fun guy. I've never had him for class but he's a really awesome dude to be around."
1501,762383,4.0,1.0,"He is a great teacher, one who loves what he teaches. He's very lenient, and also very easy. Interesting teacher who teaches in non-conventional ways. My only complaint is that he sometimes tries too hard to be funny."
1502,762383,3.5,1.0,"Mostly discussion, occassional papers, no tests ever."
1503,762383,5.0,3.0,"Yet another excellent example of why Bucknell has the reputation for hiring caring, dedicated, and qualified faculty members. He is interested in his students' welfare and success, and will go above and beyond for his student. To the subscriber who wants an easy A: enjoy a the short college career you have in front of you. You won't last long."
1504,762383,2.0,4.0,"Ughh, this guy lost all my respect by about the second day of class.  He is a total drone in lectures, misspells just about everything, and has an uncompromising and irrative lisp!  Also, this was supposed to be Educ 101 and had the work of a W2! I took it for an &quot;easy A&quot; and it wasn't even close!"
1505,2292248,5.0,3.0,"I thought she was a pretty good professor. Lectures are somewhat slow, but I think that's mainly because she's trying to make sure nobody gets lost. This course isn't a breeze, but it's also not that difficult if you pay attention in class, do the homework, and study. Expect weekly homework, quizzes, and lab reports."
1506,2292248,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER EVER. Awful experience. Only good thing in this class is extra credit opportunities. Lectures are very confusing, tests are harshly graded, and professor does not know how to communicate properly with students."
1507,2292248,1.0,5.0,Very unorganized lectures. She gets lost in her own material when trying to explain it to students.
1508,2292248,1.0,5.0,"This professor did not care about her students and it seemed as though she wanted everyone to fail. She was such a hard grader and was never specific about what she wanted from you, and would just take off points instead. It was a very difficult class to get a good grade in no matter how hard you worked."
1509,358938,3.0,4.0,Honestly a nice guy but the course is just really hard. He does his best to give partial credit. The homework is WAY harder than the tests and the lectures are pretty boring but I would take him for micro again based on the other options. 
1510,358938,5.0,4.0,"Very challenging class but Kinnaman is an excellent professor and wants to help as much as possible. Not a whole lot of work and tests are right out of his notes. If you put in the work to do well, you will be greatly rewarded"
1511,358938,2.0,4.0,"I did not see what everyone was talking about on here.  I sometimes felt in class he didn't really know how to communicate the material, as he would mess things up on the board and confuse himself.  He wasn't very friendly outside of class to me.  I felt that his tests were tricky.  He was very picky and would take off lots of points for small mist"
1512,358938,4.0,5.0,Have taken Kinnaman twice at Bucknell. he really explained econ 103 really well but do not take econ 259. he prides himself on the course material being harder than graduate school level n it is(i had an economist look at it).  he does not explain the background on it n screws up the math constantly in class.  he will like u if u show interest
1513,358938,5.0,2.0,"Great Class and Professor.  Very little work and fairly easy class.  On top of that, professor is very nice and extremely willing to help.  Can be a bit nitpicky on words on tests/hw but clearly gives you what he wants in his notes/hw."
1514,358938,4.5,5.0,Best ECON professor at BU dare I say. Kinnaman teaches u more than economics.
1515,358938,4.0,2.0,"Best teacher Ive had in college. Tells you exactly what you need to know and explains it well. His tests are right out of the notes, you may have to ocasionaly think outside of the box but if you know the notes you should be fine."
1516,358938,1.5,1.0,Class was a waste. You can sit at home and read the book and get a fine grade if you have to take it.
1517,358938,5.0,1.0,"Kinnaman is a wonderful teacher! Absolutely love him! I was paying high attention to his lecture the whole time, and completely engaged in what he was talking about. He makes the lessons so interesting and easy to understand. You can always feel his high enthusiasm and dedication. Take his class and you will love Economics!"
1518,358938,5.0,3.0,"greatest professor ever! loves what he does, and makes class so much fun, love him!"
1519,358938,4.5,4.0,"Material was right out of the book, but the exams were definitely based on in-class notes. He's a great professor, very willing to help any chance he can, and wants everyone to succeed. Definitely recommend!"
1520,358938,5.0,3.0,"Great professor!  Very enthusiastic and helpful.  Test were a bit tough, but doable if you know the material."
1521,358938,5.0,3.0,"amazing teach...if he's teaching it, take it"
1522,358938,4.5,2.0,Damn good professor.  Made the material very interesting.
1523,358938,5.0,3.0,Kinnaman's class makes economics very interesting.  He relates concepts to the real world and has a great personality
1524,358938,5.0,2.0,No Comments
1525,358938,5.0,2.0,"best teacher i've ever had. If u come to class you will learn so much and you won't be bored. Really great teacher, take him no matter what topic he's teaching and you will have fun."
1526,358938,5.0,3.0,Great professor.  Makes econ fun.  Hilarious personality.
1527,358938,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor.  Great lectures, keeps you awake, teaches material well, gives good notes, and I feel I have a better grasp because of him, fair grader always there to help"
1528,358938,5.0,3.0,"Kinnaman is amazing!  Were I a woman I would have rated him as ‘Hot,’ but oh well.  I am an engineer and I still think that my Econ 103 class with him is the most important class I will take during my whole time at Bucknell.  He knows what he’s talking about and conveys ideas well.  Take his class."
1529,358938,5.0,2.0,"good prof, tests are clear cut straight from the notes!"
1530,358938,5.0,3.0,Great Professor...his tests and homeworks are fair and he is always willing to help...im going to take another class by him
1531,1090081,4.0,4.0,"She assigns a lot of readings, but you can usually get away with skimming. Just make sure to participate in class as much as possible, I think thats what she cares about the most"
1532,1090081,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Wooden is really nice! If you do the readings, work hard on papers, and participate during class, you will be fine!"
1533,1090081,2.5,3.0,"She's very unclear and I was frustrated as a student. She assigned an unreasonable amount of reading, and I felt like I didn't really know what we were supposed to get out of each class period. Would avoid."
1534,1090081,4.5,3.0,awesome awesome awesome! do the readings and you'll do well. i love amanda wooden!
1535,1090081,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Wooden is difficult, but worth it. A beautiful woman! She is very knowledgeable and helpful and available to students. Oh, and did I mention that she is hot!"
1536,1090081,3.0,4.0,"Prof wooden loves her subject and is very enthusiastic....only take this class if you are interested in the material. If you only think it might be interesting don't take it b/c it is very,very boring at times. The class has mostly open discussions on readings"
1537,2519590,1.0,5.0,Can not understand her with her accent & she goes through the material quickly. Isnt clear when answering questions. Impossible to get in touch with via email & obviously irritated attitude when helping students. SHOULD NOT TEACH!
1538,2519590,5.0,3.0,"Great professor in the Political Science department. Very caring for all students, if you put in effort you will do very well. Took for another course after comparative politics. Very knowledgeable and approachable inside and outside of the classroom"
1539,2284092,5.0,2.0,Hes cool
1540,2284092,3.0,3.0,"very nice and pretty easy class, but also disorganized and a little bit weird. Definitely bearable though. Public Speaking is a good class for an english credit."
1541,2284092,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sewell is a great professor. It was a privilege to take a class with him this past semester. He really encourages you to think outside of the box when it comes to film analysis. At the very least, he will turn you into a life-long movie lover. What a joy!"
1542,1888830,3.0,5.0,"Her lectures are organised and clear, but if you don't go to her office for at least 2 hours per week, you will be in deep trouble. Her HW covers stuff that are not in lectures. Well if you are a civil e major, you have to take her class anyway. SMH."
1543,1888830,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor at Bucknell !!! Cares about her students, and really want to help them success. Her homework can be tricky, since she really wants her students to go to her office hour, LOL."
1544,1888830,5.0,1.0,"She is a very lovely professor. She will always be there if you ask for help. Her tests are fine, not very hard if you do everything she required!"
1545,1768002,4.5,3.0,"This class seemed like really  hard work at the start, but it has really fstarted to make so much sense in the end. When the rules  or guidelines are used, it makes it easier to compose. That is why I took the course, so I could compose better. I think Prof. Breslin is a great teacher, shows all of his points well, and is an amazing pianist!"
1546,1768002,4.5,4.0,"Very good teacher /passionate about all of the course. Online, he designed practice tests and listening quizzes - this was useful when trying to cram for a test. The problem is that sometimes this music was so irritating and boring. Also used clicker tests so much, that even if you skipped one assignment, you couldn't do well in the test."
1547,1768002,5.0,4.0,"This was a crystal clear class, if you actually did the work that he told you to. It was well organized, with a lot of online help, assignments, tests, and mp3 downloads. If you listened to the tracks, and read the readings, this class was under control. Cramming was not possible! By the end of the course, I felt that I knew so much about music!"
1548,1768002,5.0,3.0,"If you do the homework and assignments, this is a great course and great teacher. I didn't realize how much I had learned about music until near the end, but it was an amazing course to take. Prof uses powerpoints with lots of videos to show points, and gives a lot of listening clicker tests, which keeps you listening to all of the assigned pieces"
1549,1768002,5.0,4.0,"This Professor is great, enthusiastic and really loves all of this music! I started course thinking that this music was boring, but discovered loads about how music started, and how it arrived at today. You have to attend 5 concerts in the semester. Clicker quizzes during class, but if you do the online assignments and practice tests, these are OK."
1550,827971,5.0,3.0,Professor K-G is one of the most well-respected profs at Bucknell and it's clear why. He is extraordinarily knowledgeable about the subject at hand and can do a great job explaining content that is naturally very challenging. This course in particular had a lot of reading and writing but it was so worth it for all I learned.
1551,827971,5.0,4.0,loved having him as a professor. I was dreading having a three-hour lecture but he gives a lot of breaks during class. the work is not bad at all we have weekly homework assignments that are graded super easily and then 2 presentations that are also graded very easily. he's supper supportive of all his students and its a super interesting class
1552,827971,5.0,2.0,Professor KG is the best! The class was discussion-based and involved a lot of reading and writing outside of the classroom. His in-class discussions were helpful in understanding concepts and ideas and made learning about political econ more fun and interesting. Participation is key to getting an A. By far the best econ professor at Bucknell.
1553,827971,4.0,3.0,"The class involved a lot of writing and reading, but not all topics were boring and he made learning about political economics fun and interesting. Be sure to take good notes and participate in the discussions. Great professor!!"
1554,827971,4.0,3.0,KG is such a nice professor. He talks really quietly but really understands economics and wants his students to succeed.
1555,827971,5.0,4.0,Make sure you go to lectures because the readings are very difficult to understand.
1556,827971,1.0,5.0,Be prepared to sit through a VERY monotoned lecture. Paper due every class. I do not recommend. 
1557,827971,4.5,3.0,"Fantastic professor. maintains a strong personal interest in subject matter, and respects when students exhibit knowledge of the material. Great because his classes are legitimate learning experiences"
1558,827971,5.0,2.0,Best professor i've had at bucknell so far. Just a great guy and highly recommended
1559,827971,3.5,2.0,He is really easy and loves the subject matter that he teaches.  You watch a lot of movies and have a lot of class discussions.   you have two big projects but you get to do them in groups. He is very helpful if you have a questions about the subject matter.
1560,827971,3.0,2.0,"He's a good teacher and a really nice guy.  Most of the time, you watch movies.  Even though he's not that clear when explaining things, he is an easy grader and pretty lenient."
1561,827971,4.0,3.0,Good professor.  The course was very easy and he was enthusiastic about it.  He is very soft-spoken and can be difficult to hear sometimes.  The class itself was easy because we watched a lot of movies... but it was not an easy A.  He expected a lot on the class presentations and was difficult grading them.
1562,827971,3.0,1.0,Easy.  Prepares you well for his tests and does a fairly good job of explaining economic theory.
1563,827971,2.0,2.0,No Comments
1564,1819202,5.0,3.0,"Professor Kupensky is a very patient and dedicated teacher. It was very fun to discover the Russian language and culture with him. He makes learning grammar easy, gives us phrases that people our own age would say, and gives us good music recommendations."
1565,1819202,4.5,1.0,"Although he does assign a lot of reading, he understands most people won't get through all of it.  Very lenient about lateness, for class and assignments.  GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS because he is an interesting guy to talk to and is passionate about the subject."
1566,1819202,4.5,4.0,"Professor Kupensky is always there to help, and is SOOOO passionate about the Russian language. Also, he has many connections in Russia, so he can help you if you want to pursue studying abroad in Russia. Though his class can be a lot of work, he isn't an extremely tough grader, and will help you pass while having fun learning the language."
1567,1819202,2.5,4.0,At the beginning of the class Professor Kupensky warns you that his class will be very difficult. This is also pretty clear considering that he'll make you buy around 12 books. He is a very pretentious professor and wants you to write and speak exactly like him.  Prepare to regurgitate his opinions and not be able to express yours. 
1568,1819202,5.0,2.0,Prof. Kupensky is great! I loved this class!
1569,1997385,1.0,4.0,Teacher was so unclear about grades and all of a sudden is super picky with the final and hands me a C-
1570,1997385,4.0,3.0,Had her for her history of Canada class. There were only 3 assignments but she takes a lot of liberties with her grading so if you talk to her outside of class and get to know her and show to her that you want to learn you will end up with an A
1571,1997385,1.0,5.0,Professor Campbell is very friendly and nice. However she is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. She had no consistency when grading and would be very vague on assignment requirements. I went to her office hours constantly and she told me I was doing well in the class but then gave me a terrible grade.
1572,1997385,1.0,5.0,The very definition of tenure. Alienates kids who don't get as passionate about Canada as her and has a complex. Talks like she knows everything and goes on and on. Will baselessly fail papers Had a class where she taught with another Prof and she was so mean and microagressive to the other prof. Find any possible way to take a course without her.
1573,1997385,4.0,3.0,"She is very passionate and knows  a lot about the material she teaches. She is very relaxed in discussions, but highly respected. One of my favorite professors at bucknell."
1574,1997385,5.0,3.0,"She's very knowledgeable and passionate about what she does. I never liked history,  but I'm enjoying her class; her enthusiasm's contagious! I don't think she's particularly tough, but you need to be engaged and participate in class, or else you'll lose points. I find her to be a little intimidating at times, but she's actually really nice."
1575,1997385,4.0,3.0,"Professor Campbell is one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell! She cares so much about her students and she's super passionate about what she teaches. It's important to participate in class, but if you do the readings and make an effort in and out of class, you will do well! Definitely go talk to her and meet with her during office hours!"
1576,1997385,1.0,4.0,"Don't take this class not sure how Bucknell still offers it. You have no idea what she is looking for in assignments, and she gives out F's like candy. She thinks she knows way more than she does and spews nonsense. She takes pride in ruining your future. Not kidding, F's on papers in her class are common."
1577,1997385,1.0,3.0,I would not take a class under Claire Campbell again. The way she grades gives students no way to know how they can improve their writing and she doesn't seem to care that she frequently fails students on written responses that are part of an overall cumulative essay.
1578,1997385,2.0,4.0,Awful prof - avoid! Grading and expectations are very unclear.
1579,1997385,3.0,3.0,"Do not take her! She is very unclear on grades and will give you a bad grade out of nowhere at the end of the semester, even though it does not correlate with your grades from the year."
1580,1997385,3.5,3.0,"Class was interesting, but 1.5 hour lectures get very long/hard to focus in. Topic was interesting, but it was a lot of work/hard grading, especially for a 100-level class. She loves what she does though, and she is an awesome professor."
1581,1997385,4.5,1.0,"Professor Campbell is the best! She is so sweet and always willing to help. She is such a history nerd, and her enthusiasm for the subject makes even the driest topics really interesting for the students."
1582,1997385,4.0,2.0,"Professor Campbell is awesome. She's incredibly friendly and easy to talk to, and was always available to talk through an assignment and gives numerous rounds of feedback. Also, shes's incredibly understanding with workclass. Work load is low and definitely manageable, but make sure you have some interest in the class or you will end up bored. "
1583,2728522,5.0,3.0,"Such a great teacher. If you can get a class with Xinwei DO IT. He made data analytics and Excel very engaging and interesting, something I never thought I would say. I learned so much about statistics and built a relationship with a great guy at the same time. Xinwei is extremely willing to help you, and gives about one homework a week. Great guy!"
1584,2728522,5.0,2.0,"Xinwei is great!! His style of teaching is super easy to follow, and he really knows what he is talking about. He is more than willing to provide help to students. Would definitely recommend taking a class with him."
1585,2728522,4.0,3.0,"pretty chill class i didn't mind it. there was no final exam, just a group project. just pay attention during lectures and make sure your submitted work is good quality."
1586,2728522,5.0,2.0,"THE NICEST PROF EVER I LOVE HIM!!! First year teaching here but he really cares so much about you and is so genuine. if u dont get something he tries his best to help. quizzes are rly easy, excel homework u have like a whole week to do it, and tests are pretty fair. Definitely take his class"
1587,2728522,4.0,3.0,"Xinwei is a good professor but new to teaching. I was the first class he ever taught and it is structured as a mix of discussion and mainly lecture. He has a good sense of humor, is always willing to help, and if you are struggling, he is very accessible outside of class."
1588,2056780,2.0,1.0,"Altendorf is a kind lady and wants the best for her students. However, her classes are entirely geared towards non-majors. She deals with the same base-level sociology information in all of her classes and never really deep dives or has a coherent train of thought/new idea that she proposes. The class is entirely reliant on Perusal and daily paper."
1589,2056780,5.0,1.0,Had Professor Altendorf last sem. She was super nice and helpful out of class if you need help. Classes were interesting and your grade primary relies on completed the homework (short) and showing up to class. Definitely recommend taking.
1590,2056780,5.0,1.0,"Super friendly and easy to talk to. Loves to make class fun and is really funny. This class was not difficult, had 30-45 mins of HW every class but it was mostly just reading and annotating."
1591,2056780,5.0,2.0,"Absolute queen, she really cares and all her material is super interesting and easily manageable."
1592,2056780,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING!! took 2 of her courses, LOVED both. hw every night, but its just reading and writing provocative questions to discuss in class. course material is actually really interesting, but not too hard. she's hilarious, really caring, very accessible, and always wants to help you succeed. if you can, take a class with her before you graduate!!!!!!!"
1593,2056780,4.0,3.0,You have homework due almost everyday-reading and provocative questions. Group projects. Not hard but not easy either-you actually learn a lot in a supportive environment.
1594,2056780,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely hilarious woman. She has a very good sense of humor, and loves to make fun of herself. She is a very good teacher, who relates most of the material she teaches to real-world stuff, so it makes it a lot easier to comprehend. She is a pretty easy grader, and really respects students who at least show some interest."
1595,2056780,5.0,1.0,Altendorf is an amazing professor- super easy and fun. Definitely take her if you can!
1596,1997390,5.0,3.0,"I generally hate English classes, but Professor Stewart makes it really interesting, and he is really helpful at helping you improve your writing."
1597,1997390,4.0,3.0,"Professor Stewart grades papers very tough, and expects a lot out of his students. Very intelligent and it shows when he speaks to the class. Very well read and knows what he is talking about. He is going to make you work but is an amazing professor to definitely become close with."
1598,1997390,4.0,3.0,"Professor Stewart was the most inspirational professor I have had at Bucknell. His discussions were always well facilitated and fascinating. He is incredibly open to different opinions and always wants to hear what you have to say, but also challenges you to think about things differently than you ever have. Best professor at Bucknell, MUST take."
1599,223829,5.0,3.0,"Professor Santanen is a great teacher. MGMT 303 was probably the most thought provoking class I took within Bucknell's College of Management. He doesn't just throw an A at you, but he will certainly give you an A if you put in a modest amount of work. More importantly, he is a really nice man and cares deeply about his students."
1600,223829,3.0,4.0,"He's a great guy, but also a pain. I learned a lot but he's really patronizing when he lectures about privacy. Group project was a disaster and I did kinda poorly on exams but I did okay because I participated a lot. Speak up in class, go to his office, it'll help you on tests and he'll consider your effort and struggles when he gradespretty fair."
1601,223829,2.0,5.0,"Santanen is very hypocritical when grading. He tells you to be precise, yet often assigns extremely wordy and confusing homework and projects. He is not clear or direct with what he wants. Extremely tough grader, also make sure you participate or else your grade will suffer big time. Avoid him if at all possible, take it abroad!!!"
1602,223829,1.5,5.0,"Absurd grading. Class was interesting but I was so concerned about my grade throughout the course that I kind of lost interest in the material. I'm currently working on his 'optional' final take home exam which is impossible. A little note about the final: once you turn it in, he counts it regardless if it helps your grade or hurts it."
1603,223829,1.5,5.0,"Completely ridiculous class. Tests are extraordinarily hard. Each question is worth 15 points or so and you can only get a 15, a 7 or a 0 on each, which is ludicrous. Everyone has to take it so there is nothing you can do about it, but don't expect to come even close to raising your GPA that semester, because it simply won't happen."
1604,223829,4.5,2.0,One of the best professors I have had at Bucknell. Worth taking him and definitely go to his office hours.
1605,223829,4.5,2.0,Awesome professor. Cooked lunch for us one day and watched a movie at his house.
1606,223829,4.5,3.0,"Had him for my freshman seminar. Great guy. If you participate a lot he loves you. Smart, interesting, good at what he does. I'd recommend having a class with him."
1607,223829,4.5,1.0,Class was extremely easy. Just pay attention and read the slides and you'll get an A
1608,223829,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Santanen's classes are enjoyable and interesting. My class was held in a computer lab, and he would routinely show YouTube clips that were relevant to the topic at hand."
1609,223829,4.5,4.0,The most helpful professor at Bucknell. He would answer every question I ever had. He's very patient.  His tests are very hard and definitely require studying. There's not a lot of homework but you end up doing a lot of work. He's sorta goofy but a really nice guy
1610,223829,4.0,5.0,"Not an easy class as everyone says! Exams were hard and so were pop quizzes. Much of the final grade is based on a major group project based on a company's IS's systems which everyone does well on so it helps your final grade. Everyone takes this for thier tech elective, but there are many easier options."
1611,223829,5.0,3.0,"He's so enthusiastic it makes it very easy to pay attention in his class. All the notes are online and very helpful. I hated it at first and now it's my favorite class, I definitely advise taking it =)"
1612,223829,5.0,3.0,"Hard class.  I pulled off a great grade inspite of the hard tests and awful pop quizzes.  However, his class is more than that.  I loved the class becuase I felt like I actually learned something - that I actually got an education.  The class is challenging at first, then get's a lot better.  I definitely recommend him for a GREAT class."
1613,223829,3.5,4.0,"Took class because heard it was easy, and this wasnt the case. Theres little work besides group project (which everyone does well on). Exams are hard and if you screw up on one, its hard to make up for it. Theres only two. The pop quizzes are a pain. I know a lot of people who did well, and a lot of people who did poorly. Very nice professor though"
1614,223829,3.0,3.0,"All of his notes are posted online. He also offers review sheets and practice tests. His exams, however, are hard. The average was in the high 70s. He does not give that much work though, just one big project a couple of exams and a handful of pop quizzes."
1615,223829,3.5,3.0,"Very energetic about his class.  You can tell he really loves what he does.  He's very helpful, but the tests can be tricky.  The project is time consuming, but he grades pretty easily."
1616,223829,5.0,3.0,"great guy, funny, gives clear and precies notes.... post his notes on the internet, however, questions on test sometimes unclear ....take the class though ... very energetic dude"
1617,223829,3.5,4.0,brings a lot of energy to class....very helpful when you have a problem..
1618,223829,4.5,3.0,No Comments
1619,223829,5.0,4.0,"He by no means teaches an easy class, but he is an incredibly fair, helpful, nice, and even funny professor!"
1620,2054742,5.0,1.0,"Wasn't sure about this class but man oh man I loved it. Show up and talk. Go to appointments and office hours. She genuinely wants students to succeed. Hardest part of the class was the midterm, and even that was just take-home. I thought reading court cases would be difficult but she really made it accessible."
1621,2054742,5.0,1.0,"Professor Hong is one of the best professors in the English department. She is passionate about the material, which comes across in class. Her grading is not too tough, and youll be okay as long as you try. Just make sure to come to class prepared and participate when you can (if needed- I didn't and still got an A-), as it is discussion based."
1622,2054742,5.0,1.0,Read and discuss. Easy grader go to office hours and you'll make it easier. She loves her students and wants to get to know them. This Land is your Land was awesome!
1623,133717,3.0,2.0,"He is an interesting guy, no sense of decent workplace attire, but clearly an amazingly smart individual, but fails at times to keep his lectures interesting. Lots of at times too long papers, but no tests. He is a fair grader, but good luck understanding any hand written comments"
1624,133717,3.5,2.0,"If you're interested in any sort of work in Africa you need to take his African history courses (I'm class of '04).  Trust me.  It's only after 7 years in Africa that I fully appreciate what I learned in a classroom in Lewisburg, PA."
1625,133717,2.0,3.0,"He is really boring and doesn't actually put grades on anything he hands back so coming into spring break I have no idea what my grade is.  Take him only if you need to, simply lectures by reading of a piece of paper."
1626,133717,3.0,3.0,"Ok professor overall. A lot of group work and papers which can get overwhelming at times. No tests, just like 3 or 4 long papers. He has a bit of an attitude and can snap sometimes. Does not seem like he is keeping up with the changing environment in Africa. I think he feels too comfortable with what he knows from his visit in the 70s to Africa."
1627,133717,3.0,2.0,"He's great. Goofy guy, a true character. Open-minded and goes into great depth in his lectures. Papers are at times frequent and long, but they are not too hard. Not too tough of a grader, but not an easy 'A' either"
1628,133717,2.5,2.0,smells quite bad..... no personal hygene. his class is easy but boring at times. resonable work load
1629,133717,2.0,2.0,A unique individual... Class material was interesting but he made it dull and confusing. His accent made it a little tough to understand him at some points.
1630,133717,5.0,4.0,Awesome!
1631,133717,4.5,4.0,"dude's a ****...too smart for his own good...otstanding intellectual...great lecturer...and a confusing teacher, but willing to walk you through it."
1632,133717,4.5,4.0,"Lots of reading, but you're not expected to remember all details. Great lectures"
1633,815704,5.0,4.0,Tons of homework and examples to do outside class. Very possible to do with friends. In class you do a ton of exmaple problems. No real notes. Shes all over the place so its fast but you can keep up. Quizs are very fair. Tons of extra credit. Equation and algebra based.
1634,815704,4.5,2.0,Great teacher who loves the topics she teaches. Goes at a fast pace so it can be difficult but bonus points are helpful so dont miss class. Labs reports are much bigger deals than in other classes.
1635,815704,4.5,1.0,She doesn't lecture very much.  She focuses on giving you time to learn how to the problems she tests you on and I liked that.  She's very helpful if you ask her questions and approachable.
1636,815704,5.0,2.0,"Amazing teacher. Keeps things interesting. Explains things clearly and keeps class moving at an energetic pace, while relating relevant topics. Always extremely helpful for Chemical Engineers."
1637,815704,4.0,5.0,High expectations - but you'll learn a lot.
1638,815704,2.5,3.0,"From what I hear, she really doesn't like to teach Materials Science; however, her Biomaterials class isn't too bad.  An easy grader anyway... although she hands back assignments a couple weeks after you turned them in."
1639,815704,2.0,2.0,"really doesn't teach at all.. she's ok if you ask her questions, but usually doesn't have time for you and if she does she doesn't want to use it to talk to you.  pretty fair and an easy grade, but be prepared to teach everything to youself.  she sure as hell won't do it"
1640,815704,4.5,2.0,"Teaches at a fast pace, so be prepared"
1641,2548321,5.0,3.0,Professor Reeks is no doubt one of the best math professors I have had. He is hilarious in his lectures and his office hours are really helpful too. He really made a supposedly uninteresting Calc class become interesting
1642,2548321,5.0,3.0,"Michael is probably one of the best professors I have ever had. Not only is he a good professor, but he is also very funny. During class, he always works with a lot of examples, which helped me learn the subject. Homework only once a week. 2-question quiz once a week as well (easy).Super fair grader (partial credit). Always available and cares lots"
1643,1196642,5.0,2.0,"Love Lorimor! Took 105 & LING 220 & enjoyed both. Great material & workload's light. No exams, at least during COVID, but projects/hw were doable. One of the kindest profs & cares about students! I had severe health issues in & out of class & she was understanding and went above & beyond in helping me/advocating for me to make sure I was cared for."
1644,1196642,5.0,1.0,kindest woman you will ever meet. Taken online during covid so she is so understanding and made the class 100000x easier for us because she is concerned for our mental health. Would die for her students. Also no quizzes or tests.
1645,1196642,5.0,3.0,"Makes linguistic very interesting by connecting to modern terms like dabbing, very clear when teaching would take a class by her again. If you're looking to fulfill a requirement, would recommend this professor with this class. Very nice and curves tests in your favor. Textbook homework is reasonable, hardest thing is final which is logical."
1646,1196642,5.0,1.0,"In for a social science, leaving satisfied. Lectures were pretty clear and we got to watch some fun videos. Concepts weren't hard at all, though some memorization was required. Homework was graded for completion. Also, Lorimor was helpful and genuinely interested in talking to students."
1647,1196642,4.0,3.0,"Professor Lorimor cares about her students and is very passionate about the material in class. She is a tough, but fair grader, and offers students opportunities to rewrite papers. There is a decent amount of reading assigned, but you can get away with just skimming the material. I definitely recommend you register for one of her classes."
1648,1196642,4.0,3.0,"Professor Lorimor is easily one of my favorite professors. You can tell she cares about her students, and is always there to meet with you or answer any questions. She assigns a lot of writing in her foundation seminar and can be a tough grader, but she makes that clear from the start, and gives plenty of other chances to improve your grade"
1649,1196642,3.5,4.0,"Very cool person and interesting in class, but at times a difficult grader."
1650,1196642,3.5,3.0,Took Ling105 to fulfill a requirement and it was an interesting class. Hard to get into and some concepts were really hard to grasp. A lot of new information to learn if you've never taken linguistics before. Doesn't assign a lot of homework and is really energetic and enthusiastic about linguistics!
1651,1196642,5.0,1.0,"Such a sweet lady. Made the class very easy and was very helpful in answering questions, even though the class had about 50 people in it."
1652,1196642,5.0,4.0,"Professor Lorimor is one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell. She is brilliant in her academic area! She challenges you, but she knows your limits. If you need help, she is very accessible and more than willing to help you succeed. She genuinely cares about her students, and it is very clear."
1653,1196642,5.0,3.0,"Awesome lady. She's funny, nice, helpful, and knowledgeable. One of the best profs at Bucknell"
1654,1196642,5.0,3.0,"Definitely one of the brightest, kindest profs I've had. She's funny, passionate, down to earth and fabulously nerdy. I'd totally be her friend."
1655,1196642,4.5,3.0,"I had her for intro to Linguistics and I thought she did a fabulous job! I don't know what the person below me was thinking when he said the class was boring..she was always very entertaining making funny sounds and joking around. If you participated in class she loved you, and if not its not as if she hated you! Plus, I thought she was pretty too."
1656,1196642,4.5,2.0,"She was a great professor. There were a lot of daily assignments, but the work was always manageable. She was also very lenient on deadlines if you had a lit going on. She was very helpful and clearly wanted to get the class excited about what she was teaching.She is a great professor and I suggest you take her class!"
1657,1196642,5.0,4.0,"Professor Lorimor is exhilaratingly brilliant.  Her knowledge of linguistics is supreme, and moreover, she can impart that knowledge with passion and wit.  Anyone, whether a linguist or not, ought to take her course for sheer and delightful enlightenment."
1658,1196642,5.0,1.0,"Pr. Lorimor is amazing!  She's a great teacher and is really passionate about her subject.  Plus, the material is really interesting.  She's helpful and wants her students to do well.  She doesn't grade hard and makes the course fun."
1659,1196642,4.0,4.0,"I knew next to nothing about linguistics, but it turned out to be my favorite class of the semester. The work load isn't ridiculous and she is not an impossible grader, but try to do the readings and participate in the discussions. She is incredibly helpful during office hours, so take advantage of them. Plus there are no exams."
1660,1196642,5.0,1.0,Take her class! She is very smart and funny and really relaxed. She is really easy to talk with and the work load is not intense at all. Tests are really easy with just studying the night before. She makes the material really easy to understand and makes study guides for the tests which are very similar to the actual tests.
1661,1196642,5.0,2.0,It was so worth taking her class! She is so interesting and crazy smart. I would definitely recommend taking one of her classes if you can!
1662,2437733,5.0,1.0,Sweetest teacher at Bucknell. Would recommend this class to everyone and anyone. Show her respect and this class will be very enjoyable.
1663,2437733,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Turner is the best professor I ever had in my whole life. I have never seen someone care so much about her students and show such passion in the classroom. She is the sweetest person ever and will do anything for her students. If you have the opportunity to take her class, do it. She is a gem for Bucknell, and makes the world a better place."
1664,2212458,1.0,2.0,I only created an account to review Professor Meyers. I have never in my life had a worse professor. Got COVID in the middle of the semester and was not allowed to count my absences as excused and it affected my grade. She is pretentious about films and completely destroyed my interest in film making. Avoid at all costs. 
1665,2212458,4.0,3.0,"Professor Meyers is really knowledgable about film production and film in general. She has a very calming presence so her lectures/class are never stressful. That being said, she has expectations and if you do not meet them, you will not receive a good grade. Just try, do the readings, and participate."
1666,2212458,1.0,3.0,"I created this account so that I could give Professor Meyers a rating. Avoid at all costs. She is a stickler for stupid details and has little in the way of artistic vision. Also, tried like four times in class to get us to like a film club facebook page. I wonder why no one did....."
1667,2505334,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely LOVE her. She is so kind, supportive, and is passionate about what she teaches and is very accepting to different opinions in her discussions. She has organized the semester schedule to make sure that her students dont feel overwhelmed with the work that she assigns. If she teaches any other class, take it. Her feedback is so helpful."
1668,2505334,5.0,3.0,best professor ive ever had
1669,2505334,5.0,4.0,amazing. a gem. everyone loves her and thinks shes so funny and great
1670,383616,5.0,1.0,"My favorite teacher by far. So so passionate about the topic and is totally crazy, you never know what he is going to say/do. Super friendly and you can tell he loves his job. Grades easily and just wants you to pay attention. His classes get filled up so fast its insane, so if you have the option to take one of them, take it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1671,383616,5.0,1.0,"Professor Searles is super friendly and relaxed. He comes up with fun assignments and fieldtrips, and he is understanding with extensions. Most people don't really take too many notes in class, but I would definitely recommend you do because it helps so much for the test study guides. Overall, great professor!"
1672,383616,5.0,1.0,Searles is one of the most interesting people I've ever met; the class can be a bit scattered but you will definitely be entertained and will learn a lot because he is super passionate about everything he teaches. 
1673,383616,5.0,1.0,"AMAZING! I have taken two classes with him and would take so many more. He is so caring, so chill, so funny, and genuinely just wants his students to do well. Classes are very easy, if you need an extension there is absolutely no problem."
1674,383616,5.0,2.0,"Searles is my favorite professor Ive ever had here at Bucknell. He cares so much about the well being of his students, and class is very interesting with a lot of discussion. He is so funny and really the best. Take a class with him!!!!! "
1675,383616,5.0,1.0,"Literally the nicest guy ever, if you can take a class with him please do. He's super easy to talk to and really cares about his students and wants everyone to do well. It's a lot of reading (which isn't really necessary honestly) and a couple papers and that's about it. Super funny guy as well and really personable. "
1676,383616,5.0,1.0,best teacher ever so funny
1677,383616,5.0,2.0,"a real gem and definitely one my all time favorite professors. highly recommend taking a class with him, he's so caring and really gets to know every student individually and cultivates a relationship w them. coursework is also super interesting and he loves exploring different opinions. i had so much fun in this class"
1678,383616,5.0,2.0,"Searles is the best. He is extremely understanding and cares about his students wellbeing. He makes an effort to get to know every student well, he remembered my name and where I was from after I had been in his common reading group during orientation. This class is easy, just reading and discussions with a few papers. Thought provoking content."
1679,383616,5.0,1.0,"I had him for my freshman seminar and he is still my favorite professor at Bucknell. He is so chill and funny, and you can tell he really cares about his student's well-being. You can get by without reading the assigned text, but make sure you know what you're talking about in your essays. I definitely recommend him, he's the best!"
1680,383616,5.0,1.0,I had Searles for my first semester at Bucknell and Im so glad I did! The class is mostly discussion based. He really cares about the mental health of his students and listen to the needs of his students as well. If you have the chance to take a class with him dont miss this opportunity!
1681,383616,5.0,2.0,This Professor is a real G
1682,383616,5.0,3.0,"Ned is one of the greatest professors I took. His lectures are thought provoking! Ned also cares so much about the development of his students. If you are looking to learn like never before, take Ned! He is also stylish and hilarious"
1683,383616,4.0,3.0,Searles was a great professor--his lectures were engaging and insightful but were never too long.  He was approachable and really seemed to care about his students and their success in his class.  Would definitely recommend!
1684,383616,5.0,2.0,Best professor on campus. Open class discussions taught me so much. Great balance between work and fun. Take classes with this man.
1685,383616,5.0,1.0,Fantastic teacher.  Took such a deep interest in his students.  Interesting material about the body and culture with little work.
1686,383616,5.0,1.0,Have to take a class with Searles. Unreal teacher.
1687,383616,5.0,1.0,Amazing professor.
1688,383616,4.0,1.0,"Searles is the best. His foundation seminar was awesome. It was very discussion based, and we basically spent the whole hour and a half talking. We occasionally watched movies and wrote short papers, but nothing in the class sucked. It was an easy A which is what I think a foundation seminar should be."
1689,383616,4.5,2.0,This professor is hands down my favorite person ever. He is absolutely hilarious and willing to talk about basically anything. He does like to go off on a lot of tangents though
1690,383616,4.5,1.0,Do yourself a favor and take a class with Ned.  You won't regret it.  He was one of my favorite professors at Bucknell.
1691,383616,5.0,2.0,"This man is wonderful. He's brilliant, eccentric and hilarious, and there's no way to not have fun in his class. His class is great for lifting your spirits after a long day. He's also very quotable =). Great and interesting class, I definitely recommend it!"
1692,383616,4.0,2.0,Prof Searles is a great guy who has a ton of experience doing research and field work that he uses to make class super interesting.  Paper grades were lower than expected and grading I thought was a bit too subjective but overall he is really easy and fun. All other assignments were pretty much automatic A's. Definitely take one of his classes!
1693,383616,4.5,1.0,"If you don't take one of Searles' classes you are truly missing out. I would seriously take intro to dirt if this man was teaching it. Loves to talk about anything at the beginning of class, keeps everyone engaged, and always has something funny to say. Readings are pretty interesting and relevant. Yea, this class is &quot;grooovy baby&quot; as he would say"
1694,383616,5.0,1.0,"fun, cute, very engaged with the class, really cares about his students, enthusiastic! Material is not hard, Ned will help you if you just ask."
1695,383616,4.5,2.0,"most legit prof at bucknell, taken two classes with him, really smart and enthusiastic, loves teaching, classes are hilarious...i would love to spark a j with Searles, and the best part is he'd prolly be down."
1696,383616,5.0,3.0,"dopest prof on campus, everyone should experience at least one of his courses, he makes learning fun!"
1697,383616,5.0,2.0,Searles is awesome! Knows what he's talking about and makes you want to be involved in class discussions. Finds ways of implementing humor with learning. Kind of person you'd want to be friends with.
1698,383616,5.0,3.0,one of the best professors i've ever had. never discounted the fact that i wasnt an anthropology major. really was extremely caring and cared that he knew who each individual was and what they cared about. best professor ever.
1699,383616,5.0,1.0,so cute!
1700,383616,5.0,2.0,professor searles is the nicest teacher i have had at college. everyone loves his classes. he is the best and most attractive teacher ever!
1701,383616,5.0,1.0,Best professor ever!!! He is great and so is this class.  The class is easy and interesting and he makes it fun.  He is really funny and extremely helpful.  I would defi take any class with him in the future. Two words: GREAT PROFESSOR!!
1702,383616,3.5,3.0,Ned Searles is amazing. He's wacky and hilarious and he really wants to get to know you. Foundation seminar with him is fun because he keeps things light and not super intense and you get to know the rest of your class well
1703,383616,5.0,5.0,I'd go to Alaska with him!
1704,383616,3.0,1.0,"Searles is the kind of professor that you have to manipulate to get a good grade. The readings are totally extraneous; all you need to do is listen for the buzz words in his lectures, and then repeat them on the tests. 109 is an easy way to satisfy that pesky diversity requirement. Not for people who want to learn anything substantial."
1705,383616,4.0,2.0,Ned is a great guy.  He genuinely wants his students to do well and just gain an understanding of the subject matter.
1706,383616,3.0,4.0,Ned Searles cheers everyone up.
1707,383616,3.5,4.0,No Comments
1708,383616,5.0,1.0,"what can I say, Ned is the MAN ... take this class if you like open discussions and want to learn in an easy way, material is interesting, good teaching style, gives all the vocab thats gonna be on the exams to you before you take it... just take this class and youll be more than happy"
1709,383616,5.0,1.0,"Great professor, really funny, entertaining, lots of reading but its mostly fun to read.  One group project but when divided between 6 people its easy.  Really flexable on assignments, laidback over all."
1710,383616,3.5,1.0,really funny and relatively easy class
1711,383616,4.0,2.0,always funny and lenient with deadlines
1712,383616,4.0,1.0,"Easiest class ever! Great prof, funny, always quotes Austin Powers! I definitely recommend this course!"
1713,1057410,3.0,4.0,"Here is an example of why I am going to avoid her at all cost, I did a problem the physics way and got the right answer, but, I lost points because I did it the physics way. I took the Merit Calc 1, which was fine. I should have gotten an A but her test were stuff we've never gone over. Don't take her if you've never had CALC before."
1714,1057410,5.0,4.0,"Professor Garthwaite promotes collaboration in class. She doesn't spend a great amount of time in new materials but instead spends more time revising our proofs, which is one of the most important themes in this course. Expects lots of writing assignments in this course. Finally, she helps us grow interests in Mathematics."
1715,1057410,5.0,4.0,"Really nice professor. Lectures are fine, somtimes hard to keep up but she is always willing to help and answer any question you have. Office hours also so so helpful, she would dive into the details and make sure you understand."
1716,1057410,4.0,4.0,"Prof Garthwaite is one of the nicest professors. She is super enthusiastic about math and truly wants her students to succeed. Sometimes her lectures can be a bit confusing but if you ask questions she will be happy to clarify if you are confused. She makes herself extremely available in office hours to help, even if it is a small question"
1717,1057410,2.0,4.0,"It takes a long time to figure out what the homework is because she lists each one under the wrong day (somehow, not the day it was assigned OR the day it's due). She'll write that the homework due is &quot;HW25&quot;, yet when you go to the list of homeworks they're listed as &quot;HW 3.2,&quot; so they don't even match. I've never seen anything like it."
1718,1057410,2.0,3.0,I don't care for her. She is a poor lecturer who expects students to be already familiar with the material she is teaching that day. It does not seem like she prepares her lectures and her board is always very sloppy. My notes are indecipherable. The way she assigns homework is very confusing. Would not recommend to a close friend or loved one.
1719,1057410,2.0,5.0,Tests are hard and she doesn't curve at all. She focuses on doing the homework problems in class instead of teaching the core concepts from the book which is not helpful at all. First two test averages were between 70-75% and they're worth 80% of your grade. Quizzes are challenging and if you dont know the answer you'll get a C. Avoid if you can.
1720,1057410,5.0,3.0,"Took Math 202 and 211 with her. She is very accessible outside of class and ready to explain material in different ways, so you can understand it. She cares about the success of the student."
1721,1057410,3.0,4.0,"Garthwaite is really nice but tests are unnecessarily difficult, especially compared to some of the other calc teachers.  You can tell she is really knowledgeable but the way she teaches really didn't click with me.  If you're taking her, get ready to really work."
1722,1057410,3.0,4.0,"super passionate about math, Sometimes she tends to rush through lectures though,  and doesn't give the best in class examples. Her office hours are useful, she is willing to help. Even in office hours though, I find she goes to quickly for me. She is a very smart woman though. Lots of hw, quizzes are 2-3 problems each, exams are easy if u study"
1723,1057410,3.0,4.0,"I have had Garthwaite for both Calc 2 and 3.  However, I find she lectures extremely fast, and does not give a lot of time to process information.  She also talks a lot about the theory behind formulas and does not do as many examples in class as would be helpful.  Exams are fair I suppose.  They are tough though.  Be prepared to put time in calc."
1724,1057410,5.0,4.0,"She is an amazing professor. Her office hours are extremely helpful.  If you do the work, which there is a lot of, the class is very fair."
1725,1057410,2.5,4.0,"If there are 30 seconds left in class, she will think of something else she can teach to fill up the 30 seconds.  Assigns a lot of homework.  Speaks very clearly yet somehow I still don't understand anything she says.  The tests are way harder than any of the homework she gives, but not impossible.  Tests are worth 80% of the grade (ridiculous)"
1726,1057410,2.5,4.0,"Assigns homework for almost every day of the week.  It's impossible to get ahead because there are always new assignments, often added the day before they are due.  In class, she never explains the material, just does examples.  You will have to do homework before she has even taught the subject matter because she expects you to read the textbook."
1727,1057410,4.0,3.0,"She has been such an amazing professor. She explains everything with though problems but once you understand them, the other ones are easy. She prepares you well for her tests if you actually go back an study. She is very helpful during office hours if you are ever having trouble. I recommend her to everyone!"
1728,1057410,5.0,4.0,"Garthwaite is very, very passionate about mathematics and you can tell she loves what she teaches. She is a difficult profssor, but you WILL know the subject. Her tests are comprehensive but very fair. Additionally, she is extremely helpful in office hours. I would say the Garthwaite is my favorite professor here. Highly recommend."
1729,1057410,5.0,3.0,Professor Garthwaite was always ecstatic about math. She proved her knowledge of the subject every day but still managed to explain things very thoroughly.
1730,1057410,5.0,3.0,I thought she was a very fair professor who layed out the material very clearly in her class.  She takes the time to make sure you have an understanding of the material.  I found her class very interesting and useful.
1731,1057410,4.0,4.0,"She is fair and explains complicated material well both in class and in office hours. Exams are challenging (as should be expected for Calc 2&3), but everything on them was taught in class (unlike some other professors who throw random concepts on their exams)."
1732,1057410,2.5,5.0,"she doesn't ever explain things very well... she blames everyones failure on not attending her office hours, but when you do, you get nothing out of it, she's just as unclear as ever... her tests contain HUGE curveballs and stuff not even mentioned in class... she goes off on lots of tangents...and this is coming from a kid who does well in class"
1733,383620,2.0,4.0,He is such a nice person but very unorganized. The class is so boring and the exams are very difficult. He is a very slow grader and is not very helpful. Do not take class with him unless you want to die of boredom and fail.
1734,383620,1.0,2.0,do not take education 101 with this professor. he is unorganized it gets really overwhelming and confusing. assigns so much work out of the blue and while it is nice that so much time in class is wasted it gets annoying when he talks about himself for 500 hours - he doesn't let anyone get a word in. dull lectures I would not recommend this teacher
1735,383620,4.0,1.0,"Murray is an easy grader, and tries so hard to make class fun. He's delightfully awkward and fun. If you keep up with the work, it's fine. He assigns a lot of papers, but isn't too harsh when it comes to grades. Participation counts. Attendance, not as much."
1736,383620,3.5,1.0,"Prof. Murray has a tendency to tangent, especially because class is discussion-based, but he is entertaining and informative. The class is very easy as long as you pay attention and review the powerpoints before exams. Reading is basically optional. Attendance is mandatory, but he is forgiving (lots of alternate attendance opportunities)."
1737,383620,2.5,3.0,"I took this class based off of the previous reviews expecting an easy and somewhat interesting class.  Although Prof. Murray is very nice and funny, it is an extremely boring and useless class.  No one pays attention and come exam time, there is no way to reference notes from class other than your own.  Exams are difficult, and overall very boring."
1738,383620,4.5,1.0,"This class was EXTREMELY boring. While very easy, the only reason I attended class was because he took attendance. I wish I hadn't taken this class with him."
1739,383620,3.5,3.0,"He is a sweet guy, but it is a very boring class. I wish I took a different professor for 101."
1740,383620,3.5,1.0,The class is easy but not that interesting.
1741,383620,5.0,1.0,Very dry sense of humor but easy teacher as long as you are willing to put in a little bit of effort...pretty much as long as you go to class you're good with him.  He also always makes himself available to students and cares how they do.
1742,383620,4.5,2.0,"No homework, easy notes and we go off on tangets a lot but he's a fun guy who says the craziest things sometimes!"
1743,383620,4.0,1.0,"Pretty interesting class.  Tests were extremely easy, coming straight from the notes, easy 100's on both midterms."
1744,383620,4.0,2.0,"really cares about his students and loves teaching.  hardly any homework but there are a few papers and exams.  he's a really nice guy who wants you to do well, though."
1745,383620,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher who clearly loves his work and cares about his students. Wants to see them truly learn. Would definitely recommend him!! A sincerely kind person, and a solid teacher. The class is worth the work."
1746,383620,2.0,4.0,"You would think for an education class that he'd be a good teacher, but he's not. LOTS of work - eight 3-5 page papers and one 7-10 page paper, and 3 exams!! Do not recommend"
1747,1979014,3.0,4.0,"He's a really nice professor who tried to make lectures as interesting as possible for us (but didn't always succeed). Quizzes and exams were hard; however, he was great with awarding partial credit, and we reworked exams during recitation.  Go to his office hours! He was happy to help me with homework and to advise me on finding a study group."
1748,1979014,3.5,4.0,"He is a really nice professor. He definitely tries his best to make his students get good grades by allowing you to rework on your exams during recitation in groups, but his exams and quizzes are always long and hard. Go visit him during his office hours. He's pretty helpful, especially on sapling problems."
1749,1979014,3.0,5.0,Super great guy. But exams are long and super tough.
1750,2478727,3.0,5.0,"I like this Professor, but I would avoid taking her because she's a harsh grader. Every little mistake gets points off. The tests are not that hard, but you get lots of points off from small details. Her lectures are okay. She's good at resources for studying for the test. The labs are also graded with too much scrutiny. The class is being remove"
1751,2478727,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lower is amazing! You will learn so much by taking her class. Although she does expect a lot from you, she expects it because she believes in you. Her feedback is very thorough but will always contain something positive! There are in-class participation points, so I would recommend going to class. She is always available during office hours."
1752,2478727,5.0,4.0,"Dr. L is an AMAZING professor. She is a tough grader and expects a lot from her students, but she is always willing to help. She also gives chances to correct your mistakes. You will definitely come away feeling like you've learned something important from every lecture, as she is great at making it applicable to the real world."
1753,383624,5.0,3.0,4 papers. Each is 25% of your grade. But awesome professor. Classes are purely discussion based on the reading. Essays aren't bad if you do the reading but he grades kinda hard. Awesome man though
1754,383624,4.5,2.0,"LOVE HIM. There will be load of writing, but his grading is not severely nit picky. If you don't show up to class, your grade suffers. He is SO FUNNY, and relatable. He is super passionate about what he does. His sense of humor is awesome! "
1755,383624,5.0,2.0,the best
1756,383624,4.5,2.0,"Really nice guy, lectures are usually interesting and keeps the class involved. Weird with grades though. 4 papers account for the final grade and each paper is based on a single chapter from the period since the last paper plus 2 outside references...I.E. not much incentive to do the reading on time or ever."
1757,383624,5.0,2.0,Great professor. He is very fair and his lectures are not boring. He knows his information and tried to get you to think out of the box. HIGHLY recomend.
1758,383624,5.0,1.0,Prof. Lewis is a Bucknell institution. An icon in his field.
1759,383624,3.0,3.0,very boring during lectures. everything he covers during class is read straight from the book. not a difficult class though.
1760,383624,3.5,2.0,"Good professor, lectures can be very boring. Tests are difficult, but grades papers lightly. Should not be a difficult A, only 2 tests a paper and group presentation which he calls &quot;an easy a.&quot;"
1761,383624,3.5,4.0,Not so painful for a lecture.  Professor Lewis adds some flair to his lectures with his Carribean accent and influences.  Assignments are somewhat annoying but not that difficult.  Altogether an interesting course that I would recommend taking at some point
1762,383624,3.0,3.0,"Had to read a brutal essay by Albert Camus.  This section is not an easy A, you have to do all the readings and attend all the lectures if you hope to do well.  His lectures can be somewhat dull at times, except when debating an issue."
1763,383624,3.0,1.0,Hes cool but a loon.
1764,383624,3.5,3.0,"Good teacher, funny, makes class interesting. Not too much work, just a lot of reading. I took Sociology of the Caribbean - we had 2 7 page papers, one 5 page book review, and a class presentation. Fairly easy grader too."
1765,2353801,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Peet was an awesome teacher. She usually gave interesting lectures about the topic of the week and posted her slides online, which was really helpful. For the papers and tests as long as you fill the requirements and clearly put in effort you will do well. One big group project. Loved her class and would definitely recommend her."
1766,2353801,4.0,3.0,I've had prof peet twice and I am taking her for a third time next semester. She is a hardcore feminist but loves hearing people's opinions in class. Decent amount of readings that you don't necessarily need to read thoroughly but they do help when it comes to the midterm and weekly reading responses. She is always willing to help outside of class
1767,1389210,3.0,1.0,"You can do mediocre work and still get a good grade in Heinsohn's class. Just show up, give the minimum and you'll be fine. He will give an extension if you ask for one. The class was a little boring, and I dreaded going more times than not, but it is an easy A."
1768,1389210,5.0,2.0,Amazing!!! Took him as one of my IP course prof. He was so nice and happy to discuss material outside of class.
1769,1389210,4.0,1.0,Amazingly nice guy and a good professor. He is really a German professor but teaches Film History. Keeps the class alot of fun and does not expect students to know anything about Film History before attending. The class is very easy and has minimal work required.
1770,1389210,5.0,2.0,Professor Heinsohn makes German class interesting. There are so many fun and engaging activities that keep you up and active in class. Be prepared to participate. He is extremely helpful. Sometimes he can be too nice with the flexibility of assignments but in all Do Not exhaust that privilege. He is one of the best at Bucknell.
1771,1389210,5.0,1.0,Best language professor in the school. So many fun activities and super helpful. Can grade hard at times but is super fare. Go to the class and you will do well.
1772,271002,5.0,3.0,Amazing man and a privilege to have studied under. He will be sorely missed by us all.
1773,271002,5.0,3.0,"It is with great sorrow that I tell you we just heard from Bucknell University,  Professor Michael Moohr passed away last night after battling many health issues.  He will not only be missed by his family, he will be missed by the all of this previous students who had to privilage of knowing him and learning from him.  He was loved by so many."
1774,271002,5.0,2.0,"Great guy. Great teacher.  Show up, it's always worth it."
1775,271002,4.5,4.0,"Professor Moohr is one of my favorite professors at Bucknell, and definitely my favorite economics professor.  He is extremely clear, and makes complicated topics very understandable.  As already stated, his exams are on the hard side, but if you take good notes in class, you will do well."
1776,271002,5.0,3.0,Very interesting guy. Good jokes and stories and he explains things well. His tests tend to be on the hard side and cover things not addressed in class. Be sure to read the book.
1777,271002,5.0,2.0,"Looking back to my years at Bucknell, he is my favorite professor. Very kind, always wants to help you. I still keep in touch with him. Take his class, talk to him, ask him for job network."
1778,271002,5.0,3.0,"He is a great teacher who is always willing to help you, but moreover, he is the MAN! He makes class entertaining and he is hilarious. He makes sure you get a good grade in his class."
1779,271002,4.5,3.0,Great Prof. Makes Econ actually fun
1780,271002,5.0,1.0,"Excellent Professor, he is a dynamic and engaging speaker who holds your attention throughout the lecture."
1781,271002,5.0,3.0,"Style of teaching is interesting and easy to follow even for the most complex concepts. For the first time, I actually learnd something that I can apply to everyday life."
1782,271002,4.0,1.0,No Comments
1783,271002,5.0,2.0,"best professor at bucknell. exams are tough but very fair, you get the grade you deserve. always willing to help and truly wants everyone to do well in the class."
1784,271002,5.0,1.0,"I am about to send my own kids off the college and I still remember waht a great educator this guy is.  Interesting, fair, dynamic.  Hard to believe he can stand living in Lewisburg!  In any case, he is a &quot;10&quot; - you'll learn a ton and won't ever be bored!"
1785,271002,5.0,2.0,"one of the best teachers at bucknell.  extremely helpful and his lectures are very interesting, and he makes sure that you understand everything.  tests are manageable as long as you study you will do fine"
1786,271002,4.5,3.0,I LOVE THIS MAN!!!! FAVORITE PROF ON CAMPUS!!!! ask him about his fast car that he speeds from the cops in on the interstates.....he is the ****!!!!
1787,271002,3.5,4.0,If you ever wanted Hugh Hefner as your teacher...here is your chance
1788,271002,4.5,2.0,"Took both European & American Economic History with him. Learned a lot. Go to every class and study hard for the exam, then you get at least an A-. He's a fabulous teacher!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1789,271002,5.0,2.0,This guy is a great teacher
1790,271002,5.0,3.0,"He's funny, helpful and know his stuff"
1791,653990,3.0,5.0,She was a very nice person to communicate with about class problems. The tests were fairly difficult and the homework's were time consuming. The lectures were very beneficial because she explains everything in pretty good detail. It just an overall hard class with a lot of work for a half credit. 
1792,653990,1.0,5.0,"Constant homework. Attendance is so mandatory that after a student showed up late to a lecture with roughly 100 students. She said it was ""unprofessional"" to show up late, and if you had two or more unexcused absences, the final wouldn't be curved. That didn't matter much for me since the last only covered the later section of the book. Awful Prof."
1793,653990,2.0,4.0,"Smolka's tests were incredibly difficult, and she refuses to curve or change her style. While she is helpful if you go to office hours, they are often full of students who are lost. The course is almost entirely based off of midterms and finals."
1794,653990,3.0,5.0,This was by far the hardest class I have ever taken. Prof. Smolka does care about her students but her grading is just insane. There isnt a day where you dont learn a new lesson even if you havent tested on the previous one. She is a tough grader. Tons of homework and unnecessary webwork leaving no time to study or work on other classes hw
1795,653990,4.0,5.0,"Professor Smolka genuinely cares about her students and tries to prepare them to excel in life, however she teaches one of the hardest classes and she doesn't want to water it down (which you lowkey have to respect). If you put in the effort she will help you EVERY step of the way without complaint. Basically try and you'll at least pass."
1796,653990,5.0,4.0,"If you are looking to actually learn this is the class you want to take. Very knowledgeable professor and love what she is doing. She assigns many homework but if you do the homework, ask questions and go to class you can get a very good grade. She have a fast pace in the class which make the class less boring. Highly recommended!"
1797,653990,2.0,5.0,"Professor Smolka holds her students to an extremely high standard. So far the hardest class I've ever taken. An extreme amount of written homework in addition to webwork, and very hard and long tests. You must put in tons of time and effort to succeed in this class! That being said, at least she admits its really hard, and is helpful outside class"
1798,653990,1.0,5.0,AVOID if you're not naturally good at math and really like it. Her one class takes up 80% of my time with the sickening amount of work.
1799,653990,1.0,4.0,Tons of webwork and textbook work. Lectures are super boring and tests are hard.
1800,653990,4.0,3.0,"I loved Professor Smolka. She is super nice and legitimately cares about her students very much. Her lectures are extremely organized, which makes note-taking easy. However, she can sometimes throw curveball questions on tests. Also, do your homework with detail, she really appreciates explanations."
1801,653990,5.0,4.0,"She is really a smart person, and she cares a lot about conveying the material needed to be understood. One of her amazing characteristics is that she wants to make everyone on the same page and not lost. She is nice; I had the honor to have her teaching me."
1802,653990,2.0,4.0,Lectures are very dry and difficult to sit through. WebWork HW is unnecessary and is simply more busy work that takes up a good chunk of time with no real benefit that isn't given from textbook assignments. Not an awful class but certainly in the bottom 50% of classes I have taken.
1803,653990,4.0,4.0,Smolka is an amazing professor that really pushes you. If you really study you will do well in her class. I've never like math but Prof Smolka gives the best lectures. There is a decent amount of hw but its only due once a week. Office hours are extremely helpful but you have to make her times (she is really busy and does just about everything)
1804,653990,2.0,4.0,"Professor Smolka is unlike any other Bucknell professor. She is not willing to meet outside office hours, gives bad lectures, and is not very helpful in class. She assigns an obscene amount of homework, but doesn't give you the chance to get help. Do your due diligence and avoid her as a professor."
1805,653990,2.5,4.0,"Left no time in her lectures for answering questions, and wasn't flexible at all with office hours or emailing for help. She wasn't very good at explaining things a different way if you misunderstood her first explanation.  Homework is graded, but it can actually help your course grade a lot."
1806,653990,4.5,4.0,If you want a good grade you gotta work for it. Test are tough but they are a good indication on how well you studied.  Lectures are clear and straight forward. The homework and webworks are tough sometimes. But it is not impossible to get an A. Good professor. 
1807,653990,2.0,5.0,"Her way of teaching is not very useful as she goes only through the most basic material, which is explained clearly in the book, but then the exam questions are much harder than the examples she explains."
1808,653990,5.0,2.0,Professor Smolka is great. If you are taking math192 please choose to take it with smolka. My friends had the other teachers and I did much better than them. She is helpful and nice. Show up to class and give 100 percent on the homework and short quizzes and you'll do great!
1809,653990,4.5,4.0,"Great lecturer. Tries her best to make class interesting. Board work is excellent and easy to follow. Tests are VERY hard, but she prepares you for them. Doesn't make herself too accessible outside of class, but when she's available she's really helpful. I'm looking to take her for every other math course I have."
1810,653990,4.0,4.0,"She gets a lot of criticism probably because there is a great deal of work in DiffEQs.  The class is hard (so are all the DiffEQs classes) and her voice is soft, but she gets to the point.  Occasionally she'll make a joke, and sometimes that's unfortunate."
1811,653990,5.0,4.0,Very friendly -- she think's she's hilarious. Excellent in office hours and really wants her students to excel.
1812,576169,5.0,3.0,"Professor Rothman is a great professor. He is very passionate about what he teaches about, and you will learn a lot of insightful knowledge. "
1813,576169,5.0,4.0,"Professor Rothman was the reason I enjoyed my time at Bucknell. Although I struggled with the workload, he showed unwavering compassion and knowledge in the art history field. It is rare to have a professor impact not only your way of thinking, but also your way of seeing the world. He taught a true appreciation for art that I will cherish for life"
1814,576169,5.0,2.0,"He is SO PASSIONATE about what he does. He will make you love art history, but you need to do his homework and be engaged to do so. I would highly recommend going to his office hours and getting to know him."
1815,576169,5.0,2.0,I loved this class so much. I looked forward to it each week.
1816,576169,5.0,3.0,"An absolute gem, consistent reading and writing every class, but once you pick up on his writing style, it doesn't take more than an hour. Insanely knowledgeable and really cares about his students, and always available to meet. Definitely recommend his classes if you've never taken ARTH, especially 200 level. TAKE HIS CLASSES!!!"
1817,576169,5.0,3.0,"Extremely knowledgable and gives great feedback. He also genuinely wants students to succeed and is very clear on his expectations. I was lucky enough to have a small class, and I definitely benefitted from the seminar-style. There was writing and reading for every class, but it was completely manageable."
1818,576169,2.5,3.0,"Overall a pretty boring lecturer who tends to be very vague in his expectations of students. That said, much better one-on-one in office hours if you bring your writing in and have him point out exactly where you went wrong and explain your feedback. Not the best prof, but a good person, but very dull and boring class."
1819,576169,4.0,2.0,A absolutely great guy!!! He is super nice and more than willing to meet with you anytime! He loves to teach and it shows. His class has some challenging readings and you have to do at least 5 essays/papers. I didn't learn much from his class and class itself is pretty uneventful. He was my advisor and is one of the better people you can talk to.
1820,576169,5.0,2.0,A fantastic teacher.  It is a tough course with a lot of analysis and even more to remember from the art pieces.   Still one of my favorite courses I ever took at Bucknell. He is helpful to students and also a pleasure to learn from.
1821,576169,4.5,2.0,I loved him. The class was one of the best I have taken at Bucknell and I think almost everyone in the class could agree. TAKE HIS CLASSES! He is really amazing and cute
1822,576169,2.0,5.0,"VERY time consuming class, harsh grader,  picky about writing styles."
1823,576169,4.5,3.0,Great Professor! There are weekly assignments which get to be kind of a pain but the class very interesting. he is extremely articulate and enthusiastic. Easy to pay attention during class.
1824,576169,5.0,3.0,"Rothman is a great teacher! He is adorable and cares about his classes. He is very interesting and knows what he is talking about. However, he cares so much about his class that he assigns a lot of work and expects you to spend a lot of time on the work he assigns. Love the guy though, he is so nice and really easy to talk with."
1825,576169,3.0,5.0,A good teacher - loves to talk. Definitely conveys the material clearly. But FAR FAR FAR too much work. I think he forgets his class isn't the only class his student take. The work really takes its toll on the time dedicated to other classes. Obviously doesn't want his students to cut corners. Needs to find a new method in making assignments.
1826,576169,5.0,3.0,Professor Rothman is the best teacher in the Art History Department. He is incredibly knowledgable when it comes to the conceptual approach (i.e. the correct approach) to Modern Art. Modern Art professors sometimes just load tons of memorization on you with minimal conceptual analysis. This course is the opposite. It's awesome.
1827,576169,4.0,5.0,"Tough class.  Lots of writing for an art history course, but was a W2.  Tougher grader than most profs at the school, and strict about world counts.  Rewards thoughtful analysis, and seems to boost grades for consistent participation"
1828,576169,5.0,3.0,No Comments
1829,1843882,4.0,3.0,He's honestly really nice and chill i dont rlly see why people are complaining because the homework isnt too bad and he's a pretty lenient grader if you take proper notes and include all the information in your answers. just wish we got more time on exams. also there was no final exam there was just a research paper.
1830,1843882,5.0,3.0,"I don't understand why everyone is complaining about his weekly &quot;papers&quot;. They take like a half hour to complete if you're in a rush, and he grades them very generously (you basically get a check plus if you put any thought into it). The reading isn't a lot at all, and overall he's a great professor."
1831,1843882,3.0,5.0,"Regularly assigns long readings that take sometimes hours to interpret. On top of this, he assigns weekly one page papers that only can be completed if you take thorough notes and understand the readings (which can take hours upon hours to complete). His lectures are hard to follow as it is never clear whats important information and what isn't."
1832,1843882,3.0,4.0,Young isnt that hard of a grader and he is definitely into the subject matter. He is kind of a hardo about going to class and doing the readings. Definitely dont skip class unless you are like at a funeral because every miss hurts your grade.
1833,1843882,2.5,5.0,"Would recommend practically any other freshman foundation seminar over this one. Took FOUN 098 33 Writing The Buddha.  Literally hours of work a day to read things that didn't make sense. Daily papers and weekly/monthly longer papers. Hard grader, weird essay format, would not recommend this class unless you really love Buddha"
1834,1843882,3.0,3.0,"The classes were long and seemed to lag. Towards the end, you would notice more and more kids skipping class. "
1835,1843882,4.0,2.0,He is a great guy!!! His class is a good deal of work and you have a short paper due almost every class but if you do it you almost cant get a bad grade.  The only down side is that what he is teaching is extremely controversial so it can be very confusing at times and he is very vague
1836,653995,1.0,2.0,Just doesn't seem to care to teach us anything. She'd be happy just screwing around all the time - especially with the guys.  Gets angry when she doesn't know answer to Qs. Makes us learn mastercam - which is ok - but she clearly doesn't know it herself so can't help. Has a student run the labs and answer our questions and she takes off. Terrible!!
1837,653995,1.5,1.0,Had her for mech252 and mech355. Very weak teacher.  You can easily read the book and get A's in her courses. She confuses herself in class a lot and then gets angry if you ask for clarification. She sometimes gives in-class problems we work on without any feedback from her while she works on her computer.
1838,653995,3.0,3.0,"Loves to screw around and get off topic. Very fair and unbiased in her grading. She doesn't use variables in her examples, so it's hard to follow what she's doing."
1839,653995,4.5,4.0,Anybody who says she won't help never asked for it. The classes are fun but not easy and she will help you if you are having trouble.   If you don't try to float through you'll learn. Her classes are not for children.
1840,653995,5.0,3.0,Best Engineering Professor.  Best Professor at Bucknell.  Anyone who has given her a bad rating is out of their mind and didn't get a good grade in her class.. don't listen to them.  She is extremely helpful and she will adjust class to make sure the majority of the students are happy.
1841,653995,2.0,2.0,No Comments
1842,653995,1.5,3.0,Pretty much a terribly awful professor. Does not make sense at all - expects a lot from lectures that don't give us any of the information we need on tests. I would not recommend her at all to anyone.
1843,653995,4.5,1.0,"one of the best teachers i've had. the class was sooo easy, but i still came to class every day because i've never laughed more than those classes. she is very funny and sarcastic, and if you do ever need help, she is more than happy to further explain things to you. if you take this class, make sure to find out what her DJ name was in college."
1844,653995,5.0,3.0,"The class can be a little difficult at times, but she's young, nice, and really really straightforward. And, she's got a sense of humor. Her lectures are mostly powerpoint based, so it's a little harder to take notes and copy down examples. But, you can get to them online. Overall, her class is pretty good and she's a good professor."
1845,653995,5.0,3.0,Great Professor. If you need time outside of class she will help you.  If class thinks she is going too fast she will slow things down.  She's the best statics teacher!!! Don't get anyone besides her.
1846,653995,2.0,2.0,"Had for Manufacturing and Dynamics. Pretty easy for the most part, but not the best at teaching. End up teaching yourself a lot of the material. But very laid back and more your friend than a standard professor. Plus, she ain't bad to look at."
1847,653995,5.0,4.0,"Great course set up. Hard quizzes and exams, but based on lecture. Demands a lot but is always helpful."
1848,653995,1.0,2.0,No Comments
1849,2124460,5.0,3.0,Best professor I've had 
1850,2124460,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gazes is absolutely amazing! She is super friendly and kind and always willing to chat a little after class. About a third of the classes are lectures, and the other two thirds are mainly based on group work. The midterm and final are cumulative, so it is best to take really good notes during lectures (or complete them after class)."
1851,2124460,5.0,3.0,Awesome teacher who's very thoughtful and cares about students understanding the material and doing well. Highly recommend!!
1852,2124460,5.0,1.0,"Gazes is a great prof and super kind person. Her class was pretty easy, I was not personally a fan of the structure of the class but I still learned a lot. Everything was group work but she does survey the class before hand to organize groups of people who will work well together."
1853,2124460,5.0,2.0,"Gazes was great! Projects are clearly communicated, plenty of chances for feedback or help if your group for a project isn't working out well, and Gazes is always super helpful. Class was one where you learned a lot without realizing it--topics are backed up with interesting and relevant experimental data and every day was fun!"
1854,2124460,5.0,2.0,"Professor Gazes is a wonderful teacher and overall good person. She's fun, engaging, knowledgeable, and very approachable. The class isn't difficult, especially if you love the content. My favorite class by far!"
1855,2124460,5.0,3.0,"I loved Professor Gazes. Her class was super interesting and she did an amazing job at keeping her lectures engaging. This class was also laid out very well. My only note is that we were supposed to read the textbook every week, however i found the textbook confusing so never read it. Despite this, I still understood everything and got a good grade"
1856,2124460,5.0,2.0,"Professor Gazes is so sweet. Her lectures are very interesting, informative, and she presents information very clearly. If you show up to class and follow what's going on, you'll do well . She's also available a lot of the time and helpful during office hours. She's a great person to talk to and I recommend taking her class."
1857,2124460,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. She explained everything really clearly and the exams weren't difficult. She's also super friendly and nice, and her lectures were entertaining."
1858,2124460,5.0,4.0,She is the best professor at Bucknell. She is able to explain difficult material so that you can understand it. She also is always available for office hours. I recommend becoming her friend!
1859,2124460,5.0,3.0,"The textbook is dense, but Professor Gazes conveys the material pretty well. She often illustrates the different visually (sometimes with actual videos) rather than just explaining it. But you still have to read it in order to pass the clicker quizzes. Implements all kinds of learning styles as well; hands on and lecturing."
1860,2124460,5.0,3.0,Animal behavior is sooo much fun. You are pretty much assured a B- or higher in the class due to all the free point you get from just showing up. You do so many fun things in her class. Watch out though! The tests aren't always easy and there are a ton of daily pop quizzes based on textbook reading (but she drops most of them).
1861,2169518,1.0,5.0,"I am urging you to not take this class! Prof Gilani is unrealistic is almost every sense of the word in his class. Homework due almost every class and grades more specifically than any other teacher Ive had in my life. If you dont understand something, good luck. He is almost impossible to reach outside of class and when you do, he is super vague"
1862,2169518,1.0,4.0,Very hard to reach outside class. Lots of homework. Tough grader. Would never take again. I probably spent 10-16 hours a week on this class.
1863,2169518,5.0,4.0,Gilani is a really cool and humbly intelligent guy. Reasonable with grading and always knows how to clarify something/make a concept clear. No signs of favoritism at all and is personable and has a good sense of humor as you get to know him. Can tell he wants the best for students as he gives me advice not just about stats
1864,2169518,4.0,3.0,"OG is caring and always ready to help. He really enjoys discussion with students, be it on class materials or other topics. Lectures are very organized and clear. Exams are fair and he is pretty flexible with grading. Do expect to put some effort in if you want an A, because there will be frequent homework and assignments."
1865,2169518,5.0,4.0,"OG is, by far, the best math professor I've had at Bucknell. His classes are demanding, but if you put in the right amount of work, you'll really benefit from his class and end up with a good grade. He is a very fair and reasonable professor. Also, the fact that he has ready notes to print out makes one's life so much easier."
1866,2169518,4.0,4.0,"Gilani will definitely make you work to succeed in this class. There's homework due every class, weekly quiz/lab, and exams, easily spent more than 3 hours per lecture outside of class. But he truly cares about his students and seeing him definitely helps. It's a hard class but interesting and improving is possible."
1867,2169518,4.0,5.0,"Gilani is a great professor. This class was a lot of work, but he cares a lot. If you have to take stats, take it with Gilani."
1868,2169518,4.0,3.0,Professor Gilani is new so he doesn't quite have everything perfected yet but he is super nice and really tries to make sure that everyone in the class understands. He is also a pretty easy grader on labs and exams.
1869,2169518,5.0,4.0,"great professor. intelligent, thoughtful and demanding. Bucknell kids just complain too much, he expects you to put in the hours and then see him with specific questions."
1870,2169518,2.0,4.0,"Gilani's very intelligent but a lot of work needs to be done on his teaching skills. He had unrealistic expectations when it came to workload and previous knowledge of statistics. If you have the time and are willing to put in the effort, an A in the class is achievable but by no means will it be easy."
1871,2169518,3.0,4.0,"He's clearly brilliant and is really funny and nice.  He encourages outside engagement via office hours and email, but, because he is so smart, is not a great professor.  He doesn't, by no real fault of his own, understand the concept of needing to make things simpler and slow down for those who do not understand Statistics right off the bat."
1872,2169518,1.0,4.0,"He is a terrible professor. All we did was go over packets of notes that he posted online late at night before the 8am class. Does not go over practice questions and expects you to understand the material. Despite being an intro level course, he made us do an impossibly difficult project without helping. Unfriendly and not helpful during office hrs"
1873,2169518,3.0,3.0,"I have respect for Gilani. He was brand new this semester, so he definitely wasn't prepared and the students unfortunately had to suffer. But as the semester went on, he got a lot better and is always willing to help. He answers emails quickly. Beware of his grader. She is the worst. Her grading is unfair and ridiculous. But Gilani's grading is ok."
1874,2169518,1.0,4.0,"Awful professor, runs through notes without helping you actually learn the material. gives you no time at all to complete quizzes"
1875,2169518,1.0,4.0,"A horrible professor. The only thing he that helps me learn is reviewing the notes from the lectures because they are detailed and useful, but only if you can print them out after 12 am once he usually posts them for my 8 am class. Not friendly or approachable, cant explain things, homeworks and labs take forever to do bc its a rigorous couse"
1876,2169518,2.0,4.0,"Professor Gilani is a nice enough person, however he is nearly inaccessible outside of class. Even in class he asks a questions that nobody knows the answer to and doesn't offer a response. He is a young teacher and I have hopes that he will improve  in the future. He takes criticism in the form of anonymous surveys but then does not change."
1877,2233021,5.0,3.0,Prof Batista is a great prof that is liked by some but often disliked by some as well in each class. he can give hard tests but he teaches off the textbook so focus on that.
1878,2233021,5.0,3.0,Professor Batista is very organized and a great lecturer. I really enjoyed his courses.
1879,2233021,1.0,3.0,"Prof. Batista taught finite elements and dynamics. Although his lectures are very organized, he is not good at explaining things after you ask him questions. He assigns homework that you have not done in class, and there is no textbook to reference for help. Additionally, he doesn't post solutions to past homeworks so you can't check your work."
1880,2360000,5.0,1.0,"Professor Okparanta is extremely caring. She was aware of the pressures on students during this semester, and was very lenient about deadlines, thankfully. The main requirement is that you attend class and participate. As long as you attend class and turn in the required creative stories at the end of the semester, you will get an A."
1881,1387208,3.0,1.0,Really boring lectures but not a tough grader and you don't really need to participate ever so just turn in the homework assignments due every class and you will be fine.
1882,1387208,5.0,3.0,"Professor Bakir is awesome. Don't be intimidated by the writing assignments, they take an assignment or two to get used to, but after that, they will not take you very long. The tests are totally manageable and if you study the powerpoints you should have no problem getting an A. He is always around for help, and I recommend getting to know him."
1883,1387208,3.0,4.0,Put in your 9 hours or you will not pass exam!
1884,1387208,5.0,3.0,Great professor and great class. Highly recommended.
1885,1387208,5.0,4.0,"I took his seminar on the political economy of financial crises in my last semester at Bucknell. It was the best course I had taken in my four years there. Don't be intimidated by the amount of the readings and writings, you will learn a lot from it."
1886,1387208,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Very enthusiastic about the subject he's teaching. If you're used to getting easy As with little or no work (Bucknell has plenty of such courses), you will find his class challenging and demanding. But if you put enough effort into it (he constantly reminded us of 9 hr of work outside the class), you will find his class rewarding."
1887,1387208,2.0,5.0,"His lectures are very fast paced and unhelpful. This is a &quot;read the textbook to survive&quot; class. Almost condescending to students and people have gone to the dean about him. Impossible to reach outside of class, and very quiet during office hours. Explains things by saying &quot;because it just is&quot;."
1888,1387208,3.0,3.0,"Bakir is SO QUIET so sit towards the front otherwise you'll never hear him.  He doesn't let you leave the room during class, but besides that he's super intelligent and definitely helpful in office hours.  A single spaced paper due every class, but not terrible. Not the greatest I've ever had, but still pretty good."
1889,1387208,4.5,3.0,"A very helpful and kind professor. He gives a long assignment and a short quiz every week, so be prepared to study."
1890,1387208,2.0,3.0,"Nice enough guy but not the best of teachers. Very confusing, lots of reading and homework assignment.  Not a difficult class, just not enjoyable with him. "
1891,1387208,4.5,2.0,Bakir is a great professor and he really gives you the tools to be your own boss. He gives you more than enough chances to get a really good grade in the class. The writing assignments are easy and should get you full credit. The tests are mildly challenging but just study and quit being a bum.
1892,1387208,3.0,4.0,"Very smart guy, some times has issues clearly explaining concepts. Tons of readings. Most of my class did not finish the midterm. Single spaced writing assignments get very annoying. "
1893,1387208,5.0,3.0,"Best economics professor at bucknell. His classes can be challenging, but he's always available for extra help. He's truly an economics genius, I highly recommend any of his classes, but especially Political Economy of Financial Crises."
1894,1387208,5.0,2.0,"Awesome guy. Very fair with his grading and will hear you out if you have a problem, difficulty understanding, or any type of question and give you a solution. He takes effort into consideration and if you do the reading and required homeworks, you should be fine on the tests. Overall, very good class"
1895,1387208,5.0,3.0,The best class that I have taken in my four years at Bucknell. Bakir is an excellent professor!!
1896,1387208,4.5,2.0,"Excellent professor! One of my favorite at Bucknell, highly recommended!"
1897,1387208,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, very approachable. It was the best class I have taken at Bucknell."
1898,1387208,5.0,4.0,Bakir is my favorite Econ professor at Bucknell. I have already taken two classes with him. The readings in 258 were challenging but stimulating. He is always available and  communicated the material well.
1899,1387208,5.0,4.0,"He is the best professors I've had at Bucknell. I first took econ 258 from him. He did incredibly good job at conveying the entirely new concepts and information. Since I enjoyed this class so much, I decided to enroll in his seminar on financial crises, econ 329. It was an extraordinary class. I would definitely suggest taking any class he offers."
1900,1387208,5.0,3.0,He is the best professor I have had at Bucknell by far. He is extremely knowledgeable and very enthusiastic about the subject.
1901,1387208,3.0,2.0,"Bakir is an intelligent yet incomprehensible man who clearly cannot convey material. I have found myself relying on my high school-acquired knowledge of economics all throughout this course. That being said, the tests and quizzes are easy.  Attendance is pointless but mandatory.  If he sees that you're trying, he is very helpful.  If not, good luck"
1902,1387208,2.0,2.0,"This guy is not a successful teacher; he has trouble conveying material, both because of his accent and fair teaching skills.  However, he gets off making himself look like a good teacher by grading relatively easy and giving too much help on tests."
1903,1233611,4.5,2.0,He's probably the best professor I've had so far
1904,1233611,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher.  Entertaining, relevant, and really cared about the students in his class.  Did a good job of clarifying a sometimes difficult class and making the overload of reading manageable."
1905,1102545,3.5,4.0,"A very enthusiastic, but definitely wants to get through the material at all cost.  Write down everything.  Even if you've written it down 50 times before, write it down again."
1906,1102545,3.5,5.0,Funny guy but goes off on a lot of tangents. Pop quizzes are hazardous but no surprises on exams--he tells you pretty much exactly what's one them!
1907,2245329,5.0,3.0,"good guy, he might not even work at bucknell tho, good prof but not an easy a like randall, still pretty easy but you have to give a little bit of effort to pay attention in class so you dont fail the tests."
1908,2413267,5.0,4.0,"I highly recommend taking a class with Professor Suslava. She gives detailed lectures, always available to meet with students, and is super nice. She gives a lot of extra credit before the exams that help a lot, and she always gives more than enough exam preparation material, as well as dedicating class time to questions."
1909,2413267,5.0,3.0,"I love her so much. If you can take her, take her. She is so patient and will always take the time to meet with you."
1910,2245332,2.0,4.0,"While he is nice, his class was very hard for the material being taught. He teaches very conceptually; this style of learning does not work well for many students. Although he allots fair partial credit, I found his tests disproportionately difficult to the homework and packet examples - always a frustrating obstacle to encounter in a course."
1911,2245332,5.0,2.0,"(Teaches @ Wellesley rn) The greatest man I have ever met. Changed my life. He cares so much about his students, even though he's subtle about it. Will get to know you and make sure you understand everything. Gives out the best notes packets and practice materials. Truly, a gem."
1912,2245332,5.0,3.0,Super nice!
1913,2245332,5.0,2.0,"simple and to the point, good guy, is there for extra help if you need, very cut and dry as calc should be"
1914,2491094,5.0,2.0,"Professor Schiff is now at PSU, She is such an incredibly thoughtful professor who cares about her students. She is very responsive emails wise, and though the subject matter could sometimes get boring- She always made it interesting. "
1915,2491094,4.0,3.0,"I took prof Schiff at PSU and she's a fantastic woman. She has so many stories from her time in the white house and she truly cares about her students. Had to read one 40 paged chapter a week from the book with a canvas quiz every Thursday. You also have weekly classwork assignments, two midterms, and a 2 page policy memo to submit."
1916,2491094,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, cares about her students, and passionate about the material. Pay attention in class, get great grades. Favorite professor at Bucknell."
1917,2491094,5.0,3.0,"Professor Schiff is by far one of the best of the POLS department here. She is super passionate about the material, and actually cares about students. Tests are not hard - literally just know the material (everything is from the readings, which she spends most of lectures on). Also 2 short essays and 1 project which weren't bad just do the work"
1918,2491094,5.0,3.0,One of the nicest professors at Bucknell. She cares so much for her students and is a good professor. I have taken two classes with her and have loved both.
1919,2491094,5.0,3.0,"Take American politics with Schiff!!! You will learn so much, and there is barely any work. For the midterm and the final, she lays out exactly what you need to know, which may be a lot, but it makes studying way nicer. Yes, there are a lot of lectures, but she makes them interesting. She's the best!!"
1920,2491094,5.0,2.0,"Professor Schiff grades very easily, gives the exact test as a study guide, and genuinely considers the feedback she receives. Twice this semester she has shortened the reading load from the syllabus which is an incredibly understanding move on her part. She is very clear with what you need to know and where to find it. Amazing professor."
1921,2624215,4.0,5.0,"I had him for engineering 100, and it was super frustrating the way that things were graded. Difficult to do well. However, he was entertaining and very helpful when you needed help with something. Just wish he didn't grade so harshly while other ENGR 100 profs didn't. "
1922,2624215,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Wheatley is very passionate about biomechanics and really enjoys teaching it. His HW needs a considerable amount of work, but it's nothing he hasn't mentioned in class. He's also very accessible outside of class and can help with HW. He will get you very interested in biomechanics and will notice your hard work. Definitely take his class!"
1923,2624215,5.0,3.0,Professor Wheatley teaches with passion. He really seems to enjoy teaching and he is great at getting students excited about the course content. The class is very exciting and will make you very curious.
1924,1997533,5.0,4.0,She cares about teaching.
1925,1997533,3.5,2.0,"Easy A if you go to class, take notes, and do the study guides before the exams. There are 2 exams and a take-home essay for the final. Fairly easy and straight forward. She takes attendance every class."
1926,1997533,5.0,2.0,she's a good teacher who knows her stuff. tests are easy if you study and pay a little attention in class. She always keeps the class interesting by incorporating movies and modern issues.
1927,1997533,4.5,2.0,"Professor Henshaw has quickly become one of the gems of the political science department.  Well-liked by students, she is fair and clear with her assignments.  The class was not overly difficult, but most students who put the work in received As.  I'd strongly recommend this professor."
1928,1997533,4.5,2.0,"Very nice teacher, always available to meet with you and encourages this. Would take class again. "
1929,1997533,3.5,2.0,Overall a pretty good professor. She knows what she's talking about and ties current events into course material. Not intimidating by any means and is pretty lenient with the readings -- it's up to you to do them but she won't come breathing down your neck. Would take again
1930,1843938,4.0,4.0,"This class was very insightful and definitely challenged a lot of my views. She clearly knows and cares a lot about all of the class topics and encourages discussion and debate. There was much more reading and writing than I was expecting, but I thought the readings got more manageable as the year went on."
1931,1843938,4.0,4.0,"really passionate teacher, my perspective on the world definitly changed after taking the class. There are ALOT of reading assignmeents and 5 essays within the semester, 5-7 pages. Not an easy class, have to work hard for the grade and study. Weekly reading quizzes as well"
1932,1843938,5.0,1.0,"Great professor with a lot of passion! Lectures are rarely boring and she gets you thinking about issues that are often avoided. This class completely changed my perspective on life, would 100% recommend!"
1933,1843938,4.5,2.0,"Professor Nikki is a lovely women who has so much to teach, yet is still so open about learning from students. She assigns readings that are in the syllabus and they don't change, I've never felt overwhelmed. The midterm was easy, the final is a paper. There were no other tests than the midterm. Three 4-6 page papers throughout the semester was hw."
1934,1843938,3.0,4.0,"A very smart person, but is very opinionated. If you want a good grade, you have to write to her opinions. "
1935,1843938,4.0,4.0,Amazing professor. Takes ridiculous concepts and makes them easily understandable.
1936,1639143,4.0,3.0,Clare is very nice and cares about her students.  Readings for every class and a 300 word response must be written with them. They are quite easy as long as you at least semi-read.  To do well in a class with Clare you MUST print out the readings/bring the book every day AND engage with her in and out of class. Go to at least some office hours!!
1937,1639143,4.0,3.0,"Clare was an amazing professor. She gives a lot of reading, but homework is easy and class is made up completely of interesting group discussion. There are no tests or quizzes, aside from a take-home final. There are essays assigned, but she is very open to extending deadlines and is always open to meeting/helping out."
1938,1639143,4.0,4.0,"Professor Sammells is more than knowledgable about her subject. She gives lots of reading homework, but there are no exams and your grade is based off of attendance, participation, and essays. However, it takes her a long time to grade those essays."
1939,1639143,2.0,4.0,This class was taken for the IP credit at Bucknell and it was tough. The professors are okay but it is lecture HEAVY and the essay prompts don't come with clear directions. I do not know anybody who sincerely enjoyed the class everyone just said: &quot;well it fills the requirement so who cares&quot;. don't take it unless you HAVE to.
1940,1639143,1.0,3.0,"Condescending , aggressive, rude, the worst professor at bucknell, thinks she's smarter than everyone else. can't handle people not thinking like she does. i thought i would major but she turned me away."
1941,1639143,5.0,4.0,"While there was a good amount of reading, we only had 4 small papers for the whole semester. For two of the papers, we were given 2 weeks to edit and turn it in for a final grade. She is a hard grader, but it does really help with learning how to write better. The readings were long but definitely interesting, and the classes were super interesting"
1942,1639143,5.0,4.0,"Clare is a tough grader, and she doesn't cut you any slack when you screw up. That being said, she's more than fair. She will review and edit your writing assignments before she grades them, telling you exactly where your writing is weakest, AND clear steps for how to improve it. Skimming readings is ok, just be ready with some points for class"
1943,1639143,1.0,5.0,Does not allow students to use bathroom without participation points being taken off. Has clear basis on certain subjects and does not allow students to form own opinions. Do not take class with her.
1944,1639143,4.0,4.0,"She does have a slight stigma against athletes, however if you show that you do want to learn, she will not take off points for absences. There is readings for every day, but as long as you get the general ideas of the readings, you can easily participate in class discussions. No exams, only papers and participation!"
1945,1639143,1.5,5.0,"Too much reading for an intro class. Clare gives very confusing feedback - whenever she gives any. She's a very tough grader, considering that most people take her class as an elective. Attendance is taken every day."
1946,1639143,1.5,4.0,She's nice a person overall. Just a tough grader and a little skewed in her point of view. Do not take if you are not truly interested in anthropology and if you are just trying to fulfill a CCC.
1947,1639143,1.0,5.0,Do not take. Hardest grader ever. No feedback for anything that you hand in - papers or weekly discussion questions.
1948,1639143,3.0,3.0,"She's a hard grader who assigns a lot of reading.  She gives feedback on the two main essays and allows you to edit them before giving you a final grade.  She is very nice and approachable, however, if you do not complete the readings during they year you are screwed for the midterm and final."
1949,1639143,3.0,4.0,SHE TAKES SO LONG TO GRADE THINGS. She assigns lots of homework every night. She's just overall really not likable. 
1950,1639143,3.0,4.0,"I took her for foundation my freshmen year and she gave me more work for her one class than all my other classes gave me combined. Readings, responses, papers. We had at least a 40 page reading with a reading response for homework every day, as well as additional homework including weekly papers. Hard teacher to like, very pushy with her ideals"
1951,1639143,4.0,2.0,"She is energetic, positive, and engaging. Had us do a lot of small group work, and she's big on class discussion. I really enjoyed her class!"
1952,1835752,5.0,3.0,"Loved this class and this professor. He is the reason I am minoring in Creative Writing. This class is a lot of busy work like essays and poems as expected, but he makes it very manageable and is always willing to give extensions. Be prepared to read your work out loud to the class. "
1953,1835752,5.0,4.0,Buck is the man. If you get a chance to take a creative writing course at Bucknell you wont regret it.
1954,1835752,5.0,3.0,"I have nothing but good things to say. He is very obviously passionate and good at what he does and he offers very specific and beneficial feedback on assignments. Our readings are all articles about a variety of diverse, prevalent issues that really caught me off guard but I love. We read about/discuss things that actually matter."
1955,1835752,2.0,3.0,"He's a nice guy, but like someone else say, dreadfully boring. Never once has a class been exciting. He gives a ton of busy work. It also seems he doesn't want to engage higher level discourse in the classroom, he kind of just wants the answer he expected, and that can be frustrating. Attendance mandatory & tough grader."
1956,1835752,3.5,3.0,"Hes a good teacher, can come off as boring in some class discussions but has very good material for the class and great assignments. Overall great class"
1957,1835752,2.5,2.0,"Mr. Buck is a nice guy just so dreadfully boring. He won't give you much feedback when he grades assignment, usually it's just a sentence or two to prove he read it. He also assigns a lot of busy work and I had a quiz per week. It's not that he's a hard teacher or anything but you have to follow his directions and do the tedious work."
1958,1835752,5.0,2.0,"Professor Buck is the man. Great in class, great outside of class, and very personable."
1959,1835752,2.0,3.0,"Assigns tons of work but never gives feedback about it. Can be very condescending in class discussion, maybe without realizing it."
1960,1807084,3.0,2.0,"Easiest calculus teacher at bucknell.  Tests are an appropriate level of difficulty, definitely do the homework and clarify all questions with her.  Final was more difficult than expected.  However I did well in AB Calc in high school, she may have been slightly difficult for those that did not do well in calculus in high school."
1961,1807084,4.5,2.0,Prof. Smith is honestly the sweetest lady ever.  She cares a lot and is great in office hours.  Her tests follow the examples in class so you don't really need much studying outside of class.  She never made us memorize written definition like a lot of the other calc teachers.  Definitely the nicest and easiest for calc 1.
1962,1807084,5.0,1.0,"It takes a while, but you eventually grow to appreciate the Professor Smith's lectures and the homework. If you follow her examples and do your work, the tests won't be too hard to get a good grade on. Wish I could have her again!"
1963,1807084,4.5,1.0,"Her voice is annoying but once you get past the first week, she is actually super helpful and really fair.  The tests are not the hardest compared to some of the homework problems.  Only gives one assignment per week.  Don't need to prepare for the lectures.  "
1964,1807084,1.0,4.0,Honest to god the worst professor I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. 
1965,1807084,1.5,4.0,"Terrible professor.  With a voice akin to nails on a chalkboard, it is all but a miracle to make it through a single lecture.  Extremely unclear when teaching new subjects, with little to no examples given.  The exams are tough, with the difficulty skyrocketing from homeworkin class problems.  AVOID"
1966,1807084,2.0,5.0,She really just doesn't care about how you do in the class. I might as well have been watching a video of the lecture. She tends to mumble through explanations and doesn't show any algebra. 
1967,1807084,2.0,5.0,As a person she seems nice and helpful but her teaching style is hard to follow and she often over complicates the topics she is teaching
1968,1807084,4.5,1.0,"Extremely nice professor. She does not explain the material with the greatest clarity but has filtered out the difficult stuff so that the material is in general very friendly. Exam questions are often times numerically differ from homework by a factor of 2 (i.e., simple)."
1969,1807084,1.0,4.0,"She's really quite nice, cannot teach. Examples given in class provide little to no help when it comes to homework. Office hours were often very crowded."
1970,1807084,5.0,2.0,Prof Smith is a great teacher. The class and all tests are straightforward and she is always willing to help you out.
1971,1807084,1.5,5.0,"Literally terrible, the class is filled with useless examples and the material in the homework and webwork assigned ramp up in difficulty about 10x than the material she taught.  Highly recommend avoiding"
1972,1807084,1.5,3.0,"I hate to be rude, but she was by far and away the worst teacher I ever had. I basically had to teach myself the class and others felt the same way. If possible, pick another professor."
1973,1614574,5.0,4.0,"Takahashi is so knowledgable. I had him for Amphibian Biology, and it was really fun to learn from him! The way he structures the class and assignments throughout the semester is very conducive to learning and growth. He has high expectations, but meeting them is well worthwhile."
1974,1614574,4.0,2.0,"Takahashi has one of the best attitudes of any professor I've had at Bucknell. He is more than reasonable in the amount of work he assigns. If you keep up with the reading (probably 10 pages MAX, sometimes only 3-4) you will be very prepared for anything he gives on the tests. This was by far the easiest of all the biology courses I've taken here."
1975,1614574,4.5,3.0,Takahashi loves biology and it is evident in his teaching methods. He engages students for the entire class period by lecturing but also incorporating group discussion. He used clicker questions to test us constantly on concepts which helped when preparing for exams. Exams were not easy but attending class was helpful. Great professor!
1976,1614574,4.5,3.0,Great Professor. Really wants his students to do well and to LEARN. Organizes class in a great way to keep all students engaged and interested. Love him. One of my favorite teachers at Bucknell.
1977,1614574,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher.  Kept the lectures interesting, and was passionate about the material. Challenging but fair tests."
1978,1614574,3.0,4.0,He is the worst professor that I have had at Bucknell. He gives incredibly convoluted questions on tests and grades papers harder than any other professor I have had. His class is beyond frustrating. He is a nice guy but a bad professor.
1979,1614574,4.5,3.0,"LOVED him. Hes VERY interested in his students doing well, makes very good, very clear powerpoints, does a lot of small group discussions that are a great way to learn the material. I fall asleep in almost all my classes except his. Great professor!"
1980,1614574,5.0,4.0,"Really interested in amphibian biology and conservation. Passionate and knowledgeable. His youth really makes him easy to talk to. He can be challenging, but all of his exercises are purposeful -- even fun for those interested in biology."
1981,778993,5.0,4.0,Fun professor. Great lectures on design. Highly recommend watching a season of project runway before taking costume design class.
1982,778993,4.0,2.0,"she's super sweet and very fun. interesting course so we have interesting projects and work thats actually fun to do. she's an easy grader, do the work and you'll get a great grade"
1983,778993,4.5,4.0,A very fun class if your interested in world dress. She knows a lot about different cultures and their dress. Most homework was to just read. She likes it if you participate in the class discussions. Its an easy class if you're interested in the subject.
1984,778993,3.0,1.0,decent ... i knew more about fashion/current styles. has a bit of an attitude. more renderings than sewing. easy work/not a lot
1985,778993,4.5,1.0,"lol, i know more fashons than everybodys!!! seriously, it's a design class, not intended for people with only an interest in magazine fashion. prof's background is in costume design so it covers clothing design from that perspective. really nice person."
1986,778993,1.5,3.0,she is so frustrating in terms of grading. AND SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT..i know more fashion than she does. horrible teacher..can not talk without her notes
1987,778993,5.0,3.0,"A fabulous professor! In the Design course, she is a great source of inspiration for students. Take her Design class, you will love Design for the rest of your life. The class will change your overall perspective on Design in particular, and on esthetic in general..."
1988,778993,5.0,1.0,"Probably one of the easiest classes I have taken at Bucknell - if you do the work.  I needed to take it for my major, but it turned out to be great.  She is SO nice and helpful and if you are at all interested I suggest this professor!"
1989,778993,5.0,1.0,"she really knows what she is talking about.  the history of costume and fashion is a great class, wish bucknell offered more classes like this.  definitly take it if you have the chance.  exams are very easy, projects and papers are enjoyable because you get to choose whatever topic you want"
1990,586487,1.0,5.0,"Take 241 with Brooks and you'll hate it, math, and everything. Squanders class time on petty tasks, he had zero leniency and viewed his students as a collection of grades. He is ice-cold, and I honestly wonder how this man got his job. Oh, and did I say his grading is muddled based on no criteria, and that he is extremely unapproachable?"
1991,586487,1.0,3.0,"This course was taught via Zybooks. The lectures were simply reviews of the the zybooks plus a little extra material to build on top of that. Problem sets are confusing, which may give the illusion of being hard. Office hours are not efficient. Will assign zybooks to learn new material, plus a problem set in the days preceding an exam. "
1992,586487,4.0,4.0,get out of math explorations if you can. BIGGEST waste of my time. Pete is an absolute sweetheart and funny but god his class put me to sleep. accent was fun but not enough to keep me awake. big fan of always taking at least a point off; only something that goes above and beyond gets a 100. Stan Pete but NOT THIS CLASS
1993,586487,4.0,4.0,"he absolutely knows the material, but oftentimes in lecture he focuses in derivations rather than examples. however, most exam questions focus on theory as opposed to examples, so maybe it's a win-win."
1994,586487,4.0,4.0,"So I had Petey for a res college class, ""The Universal Machine"", about computers and codes and other nonsense.  This class was interesting at first but slowly began to fly over my head.   He grades his essays almost impossibly so don't expect anything good from those.  All in all, math professor teaching an english class 3/10 would not reccomend."
1995,586487,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher who cares a lot about his students, and great guy outside of the classroom"
1996,586487,5.0,4.0,"Most friendly and helpful math professor I have ever had. Course material is hard, but he explains it extremely well. Also, he's from Liverpool :) ."
1997,586487,5.0,3.0,Really great class. Pete is concerned if we understand the material and he is always available to chat about a problem. Problems might be difficult but he always offers explanations.
1998,586487,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher who is always there for help, great job with explanations in and out of class"
1999,586487,4.5,4.0,"Pete is a demanding professor, but is one of the deparment´s best. He is incredibly patient and will jump through hoops to help his students. That said, he is not easy. He expects a level of dedication and work. (We had about 10 hours of work a week). But, if he sees you put in the work sincerely, he will reward you."
2000,586487,4.5,4.0,The subject matter was very difficult but he was extremely helpful. Always willing to spend extra time in office hours with you. Very interested in helping his students
2001,586487,5.0,3.0,"Webwork (online hw assignments) takes some getting used to and his tests are challenging, but a very good professor and i am willing to take another class with him."
2002,586487,4.5,4.0,"really nice. I got a B in the class because I didn't put any effort in. The day after halloween, I missed an 8am quiz and rolled out of bed and into the quiz section 40 minutes late, but he let me take the quiz later in the day...so really nice. plus the accent makes class more bearable."
2003,586487,5.0,3.0,"Superb teacher! He requires you to write in complete sentences....punctuation and all! Imagine that, a professor who isn't bending under the universal pressure to cater to the lowest common denominator.  Give this guy a raise!"
2004,586487,3.5,3.0,extremely helpful outside of class. If you go to meet with him outside class he explains things really well
2005,586487,4.5,3.0,"Solid teacher, gets through the rigors of calc 2 easily enough. Group work in a math class was different, annoying at first, but got easier. 8am rec is annoying as scheduling but fair and knowledgeable."
2006,586487,4.0,2.0,"you need to type your homeworks, which is a pain. but other than that, he is very neat and clear, although you may need to read the material and get some external help for the homeworks."
2007,586487,1.0,5.0,"I had him for my freshman seminar in Crafting and Cracking Codes. This class was so interesting and exciting at the beginning, but then Pete just went completely over everyones heads. No one understood what was going on and when we had to write papers he graded harder than any English professor I've ever had. Get out now if this is your seminar."
2008,586487,3.5,5.0,Great guy. Hard Class
2009,586487,4.5,2.0,"He doesn't give out homework.  The problems on the test are different than most of the homework problems, but if you know the material, the tests are pretty easy."
2010,586487,2.0,3.0,No Comments
2011,586487,3.0,5.0,He's ok i guess. The class was extremely hard and he assumes you know things that you may have never heard of before.
2012,586487,2.0,5.0,Took calc 1 with him; terrible teacher; cannot communicate material in class or in office hours; incredibly hard. Get out while you can
2013,586487,5.0,2.0,Great teacher. Class was easy with little homework.
2014,586487,5.0,2.0,Pete is the man and he is an awesome teacher
2015,586487,4.5,4.0,Pete is awesome.
2016,586487,1.0,3.0,No Comments
2017,586487,2.5,5.0,"brooksbank was a very nice guy.  easy to get along with.  just a ton of work to do and office hours could use a little help.  he obviously is passionate about his work, however his ability to communicate the material could use some improvement."
2018,586487,4.0,5.0,"Pros: nice guy, always there if you need help, very patient.  Cons: LOTS of work, very hard, makes you prove stuff before you really understand it, doesn't teach well"
2019,1487612,1.5,4.0,"I had her for into to environmental studies and she was awful. She had no idea what she was talking about, took things straight from the book and if someone asked a question she never knew the answer and would always have to look things up. her tests were hard because she would say use 1 sentence and expect you to write everything you had learned"
2020,2571012,3.0,1.0,"The class is only lectures and was super boring. GET ON HER GOOD SIDE. I showed up like 60% of the time and was fine. The class was all labor based so press submit and you're fine. We had take home online quizzes, with the option for test corrections so it's pretty easy. "
2021,2571012,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor. Always willing to listen to students in order to adjust and improve class materials, workload, and discussions. Workload could be intense, but manageable overall. Doing readings are important to understand class. Very caring and is always willing to try and help students."
2022,2571012,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Mena is an absolute GEM! If she is teaching your class, you have nothing to fear! Her love for the subject will help you love the subject. She is extremely flexible and understanding. Finally, she really wants to see her students succeed, in and outside of class!"
2023,2571012,5.0,2.0,"Easy to do well in the class if you pay attention and can follow instructions. You will write a lot of papers but she is very understanding, gives good feedback, will meet with you if you have questions, and is very clear with the instructions/criteria. Her exams are very easy and as long as you try and participate, you will do well."
2024,1295108,5.0,4.0,One of the best at Bucknell!  We'll miss her!
2025,1295108,2.0,3.0,Worthless.
2026,934662,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, great advisor, and great person. Very flexible with coursework in my W1 course"
2027,934662,5.0,4.0,"She is absolutely the most driven and involved professor you will ever have. Her classes are hard (duh, they're physics classes) and she expects a lot from her students, but the level of devotion she puts towards making sure you understand the material is nothing short of incredible. Her explanations are AMAZING. My favorite professor of all time"
2028,934662,5.0,4.0,"Sally is wonderful. She expects a great deal from her students, but you can expect a great deal from her. She is so passionate about her students and her work. I have never loved physics more than when she is lecturing. Her assignments are meaningful and it is not terribly hard to do well. If she is teaching a class, it is be worthwhile."
2029,934662,3.0,5.0,"She is very smart and passionate about what she teaches. However, her expectations of her RESC class is too high. A lot of busy work, unclear instruction/guidelines, and grades unfairly harsh. She is accessible and provides good help, but it's just too much. It is unfair when you do better work than other classes yet they will receive higher grades"
2030,934662,5.0,3.0,Wonderful lady. Was very accommodating and could always meet outside of class. Also very understanding and very easy to talk to.
2031,934662,3.0,4.0,"She's a really nice lady! Sally's expectations are a little high for a foundation seminar class. She gives a lot of busy work. This class gives me the most work and I'm in all engineering focused classes... However, very approachable for help outside of class. Also very understanding in that she will change due dates if the class needs it."
2032,934662,5.0,2.0,She is amazing
2033,934662,5.0,2.0,"Sally is so nice and really cares about her students.  She is a very helpful problem session instructor for physics 212.  Sometimes she talks too much and does not do enough examples, but she is very nice."
2034,934662,5.0,3.0,She'sthe best professors I've encountered. Always there to help during office hours and arranges extra office hours if necessary.
2035,934662,5.0,3.0,Very enthusiastic and incredibly adept at explaining difficult concepts. Always willing to go the extra mile to help a student. Highly recommended.
2036,934662,5.0,2.0,Sally is so sweet and helpful!
2037,934662,5.0,2.0,The most helpful professor i had all semester. Go meet with her. She makes things a lot easier if you don't understand them in lecture.
2038,934662,5.0,3.0,"I agree that Sally is the best Physics professor ever! She has an awesome way of explaining things and she is soooo funny, too. Very very helpful also... her office is is always crowded with people even from different classes and she is always willing to help us. Just awesome!!!!!!!!"
2039,934662,5.0,4.0,I love Sally.  And her accent.
2040,934662,4.5,3.0,i looovvveeee salllllllllyyyyy!!
2041,934662,5.0,3.0,She is amazing.
2042,934662,3.0,2.0,"She talks a lot. A very lot. Which is okay, except that the labs drag on for much longer than they should. And the stuff she talks about is all covered in the lab manual anyway, or is common knowledge. She is also very strict on labs (if your data aren't perfect, she won't accept them) and significant figure. Take someone else for lab if possible."
2043,934662,5.0,3.0,Sally is the best professor in the Physics department and probably one of the best at Bucknell. She is incredibly enthusiastic and it very easy to get a long with and extremely approachable. She is very good at explaining things so that you understand and see how they relate to everything else whether in a 300 level physics class or in a 211 lab.
2044,2446086,4.0,3.0,"Dr McGrath is amazing. She cares about students and is so funny! Although she is a very tough grader (quizzes/tests), she will go in-depth in class to make sure students understand everything. If you're stuck on a concept, she is always willing to go the extra mile to make sure you individually succeed. There's also no homework, which is nice."
2045,2446086,1.0,5.0,She was an awful professor who did not know what she was doing. She recently got a job at Bucknell only because she once went here. I took her first class her first semester she taught here. Our class average was so poor that she ended up having to use common hours weekly. Her lectures were horrible. She simply does not know how to teach.
2046,2446086,5.0,5.0,"Not an easy class, but soooo worth it! Useful. Great prof!!!"
2047,2446086,5.0,4.0,I learned in this class. Also think it will help in my future career -- Prof. McGrath has experience in the real world and THAT alone makes her class valuable. Highly recommend this professor!
2048,2446086,4.0,3.0,GOOD CLASS -- LEARNED
2049,2446086,2.0,1.0,"Doesn't know anything about finance. Literally cannot teach to save her life. Easy class but has no guidelines to how she grades. Doesn't follow the book and teaches completely wrong information. Talks about her personal life too much and cannot explain anything clearly or in a way that makes sense. Can't believe Bucknell gave her a job, useless."
2050,2036487,5.0,2.0,"Professor Rea is passionate about anthropology and finds fun ways to bring in his research to the class. You have reading worksheets for each class, but it's easy to find a couple of quotes by just skimming the text. ""Essays"" are easy and he is a very easy grader. Midterm is basically an essay you write out of class. No tests. 10/10 TAKE THIS CLASS"
2051,2036487,5.0,3.0,"Professor Rea is an awesome professor. He is very passionate about this subject and makes the class interesting. The reading worksheets require you to do all of the readings, which can be a lot, but totally manageable work load and I got so much out of the class!"
2052,2036487,5.0,3.0,Very engaging professor. Would definitely take his class again.
2053,2036487,5.0,3.0,He is awesome and has a deep understanding in his field.
2054,2036487,5.0,2.0,He is a great professor. He really cares about his students and their understanding of the material. His classes are always interesting and fairly easy to follow. Highly recommend taking a class with Professor Rea.
2055,2036487,4.5,2.0,"Great professor. He's new at Bucknell and pretty new at teaching, so he's fairly easy on homework, tests and essays. Super easy to talk to and helps you with anything you need.  A lot of reading, but manageable."
2056,2681609,5.0,2.0,The class was super interesting and her tests are so easy. This class requires minimal effort.
2057,1082123,5.0,3.0,"Love his classes. His style of turning in assignments (the Electronic Notebook) can be a bit daunting, but once you get the hang of it you're all good. Take a class with him. He's incredibly generous and always pushes a writer to improve. Be aware of his bias against gerund clauses and adverbs, but don't take it personal."
2058,1082123,5.0,1.0,"Very interesting class, accessible to even novice fiction writers. Workshops develop writers and critics of literaturepoetry. This semester, class was a 3hr block which was overwhelming at times. Rosenberg works with students to develop better writing skills. Warning: it does NOT count towards the English major, but it is a fun humanities credit!"
2059,1082123,4.5,4.0,"Very enthusiastic. Really cares about his topic and his students and wants them to do well. Gives intensive feedback but doesn't go easy on the grading. If you write bull, he'll call you on it. Quizzes cannot be made up and are taken right at the start of class , and you are only allowed one absence. If you put in the effort, you will be fine."
2060,1082123,4.5,3.0,I loved this class! Prof. Rosenberg is extremely helpful and approachable.  He is also really knowledgeable about the subject matter and I learned so much.  One of my favorite classes!
2061,1082123,5.0,4.0,"His fiction courses are a definite must if you are truly passionate about writing, but also caters to those dabbling in the art for the first time. Super helpful and enthusiastic about your work. Be sure to get your stuff done on time and not screw around with his patience and you'll get a lot out of his course!"
2062,1268492,2.0,3.0,"He is a very smart and sweet man. He is occasionally helpful in office hours. Homework is very long and sometimes very difficult. He doesn't necessarily cover the topics that are on the homework before it is due. Mid terms are very easy, they are problems done in class. The final was completely random topics that were never covered."
2063,1268492,3.0,2.0,"Very kind and does offer help when needed. Has offices hours to get help. Pretty straight forward but at times, he assigns homework on content we haven't learned... Start homework on Tuesdays if Hw is due Friday. Also the quizzes(Tests) were pretty easy.  Based on examples done in class and homework assigned."
2064,1268492,1.0,4.0,This class was horrendous. He was completely unorganized and unknowledgeable. His exams were a hit or miss. 
2065,1268492,1.0,4.0,"Prof Aburdene does not present notes in class. Instead, he typically throws some sort of random problem at you, and you spend the whole class looking at it. It's typically not solved either. The tests are graded on an INCREDIBLY arbitrary scale. Avoid this professor at all costs."
2066,1268492,1.5,3.0,"Professor Aburdene is a really nice guy.  He really cares about his students and has a passion for EE.  However, I found his classes to be completely useless and taught myself everything I know about the subject.  His tests can be easy or impossible, depending on who you ask?like someone else said, you either fail or get a 100."
2067,1268492,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Aberdene can be a little frustrating at times, more in the sense that he likes to give work on stuff that he will teach the next week (he only gives weekly homework though which is awesome). But he REALLY cares about his students. Big time. I really enjoyed going to his class. And he is any easier grader to boot. Good intro to the EE dept"
2068,1268492,3.5,3.0,"Awesome guy, knows  a TON, but very hard to understand. On his tests, you either fail or get a hundred."
2069,584465,4.0,4.0,Strein is a fun professor and good for analyt. I found it a boring subject but he kept me engaged in lectures. Good at explaining exactly how to figure out problems. On worksheets and exams he gives lots of partial credit and explains where you went wrong. Sometimes gets a little snippy about certain students but if you do the work you'll be fine
2070,584465,5.0,4.0,I love Professor Strein. His lectures are very interesting and important. He goes over plenty of example problems. Always available outside class. A hilarious man. Teaches you how to really think through problems. About 15 internet homework problems per week. Nonetheless the exams are extremely difficult but fair. Must really know the material.
2071,584465,5.0,5.0,"Amazing professor that makes a boring and difficult subject interesting with great lectures, and cool demos. I do not like chemistry and did not do well in the course, but still think he one of the best professors I have had---a testament to how much I liked him"
2072,584465,3.0,3.0,"I pretty much thought this class was boring, but he's semi-entertaining and he is always available in office hours. If you have to take analyt- take Strein. But I'd never get too excited about it regardless."
2073,584465,5.0,2.0,Awesome professor! He has made the subject I was least interested in into my favorite subject and my new research topic. Incredibly easy to talk to about anything and a great analytical chemistry professor too!
2074,584465,4.5,4.0,He is honestly an outstanding professor.  His lectures tell you all you need to know.  The &quot;all over the place&quot; talked about below is him adding little stories to his lectures to keep it interesting -- otherwise the class would be obscenely boring. Tough class but if you have to take analytical chemistry you need to take him.  Trust me.
2075,584465,1.5,5.0,He was all over the place in lecture and his exams were obscene. I asked him a couple of questions over the course of the semester...and I'm pretty sure in his five minutes of incomprehensible rambling he never answered them. I'm just glad I never have to take him again.
2076,584465,1.5,5.0,"I am doing o.k. in the course, but he's definitely one of my least fav. professors at the university. He's all over the place in lecture, and his exams are only like 7 questions, so every little mistake I make ends up costing a ridiculous amount of points."
2077,584465,4.5,3.0,I will never understand how that man has so much energy at 8 am.  He's an entertaining lecturer and his tests are reasonable.
2078,584465,5.0,4.0,Tests take forever but is an entertaining prof.
2079,584465,5.0,4.0,Makes the least interesting subject in chem very understandable.  That says something.  Man is a jovial genius.
2080,584465,5.0,3.0,"best analyt professor; very helful, fun, great teacher."
2081,748309,4.5,3.0,"I love him! Wish he wasn't on sabbatical. He's really, really helpful and wants everyone to do well. Definitely one of my favorites."
2082,748309,5.0,2.0,"Awesome lectures, very enthusiastic, knowledgeable and interested in the material. Teaches pretty close to the book but goes way beyond it in lecture by giving interesting examples and telling good stories to illustrate concepts. Tests are pretty reasonable. I definitely recommend."
2083,748309,5.0,2.0,"He is very clear in his teaching style, lectures are interesting and he does a good job making sure that everyone understands the material. Also he teaches with the book so it is easy to follow along. i would definitely recommend taking his class."
2084,748309,3.0,2.0,good class but nothing special.  He is a little scattered at times but its a psych 100 course so most of the learning is from the textbook anyway
2085,748309,4.5,1.0,"Great classes, not too hard. He is sometimes a bit difficult to understand but if you read the book that helps. Overall makes the material fun and not too bland."
2086,748309,2.0,3.0,i didn't like his class because he never actually taught anything that wasn't from the book!  It's a pain in the ass to sit in his class for an hour and a half when he teaches you NOTHING!
2087,748309,4.5,2.0,"great teacher, lectures can get slightly boring at times but he's a great guy, and the tests were not hard at all"
2088,748309,5.0,1.0,This man Rocks...need I say more&#63;&#63;
2089,951062,1.0,5.0,"Professor assigns way too much work and is not flexible with dates. Not the friendliest guy and his lectures are boring. Would not take another class with this professor because it is hard to learn anything in his class, and the work load causes stress, and little time for other class work. "
2090,951062,4.0,3.0,"Professor Del Testa was a good professor. His class and readings were interesting. There was just a lot of writing, which he didnt grade until the end of the semester so we didnt know if we were improving. Also, the class was very lecture heavy and couldve used more discussion. He was very flexible though, and all the tests were just essays."
2091,951062,4.0,3.0,"Learned Historical ARCGIS with him. Was very patient with everyone learning the program at their own pace. He nicely admitted that he was no expert either hence his patience. Would highly recommend taking a GIS course with Del Testa. Just keep in mind he can't help with every GIS problem, but he did encourage you to ask peers."
2092,951062,5.0,4.0,Very easy going and relaxed. Workload is manageable as long as you are organized. Class is very informal and he is good at getting people hyped for the subject. However prepare to read a lot and participate actively if you want a good grade. If you do not like reading stay away. Seriously.
2093,951062,5.0,3.0,He's the best
2094,951062,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've ever had. So funny, great at teaching, really caring, and overall a super nice guy. One time he got my class the wrong type of donuts, but seriously no complaints 100% would recommend. Five star guy want to take another one of his classes again."
2095,951062,3.0,3.0,"He gave a ton of reading but admitted it was too much and will give less in the future. Assigned 3-5 page papers every week, and graded on a completion and effort basis. A little dry as a teacher but very passionate about the subject."
2096,951062,5.0,3.0,"Honestly one of the best Professors I have had at Bucknell! A great guy and overall great teacher, Del Testa inspires students to not only enjoy what they are learning about but to delve further and critically engage with the topic. While there is a lot of work, he is very understanding and is more focused on the idea of learning than on grades. "
2097,951062,4.5,3.0,"So much work for a 100 level class. Love Del Testa as a person, but the workload was just way too much. Also the common hour lectures seemed unnecessary. "
2098,951062,2.5,3.0,"Del Testa is not a bad guy, but this class has been a really bad experience. This is a 100 level course, but every week he assigns a 2-3 page write up and 125+ pages of reading. The past 3 weeks we have had to hand in three 7 page essays. This is a ridiculous amount of work for a 100 level course and have really grown to dislike history. "
2099,951062,4.5,1.0,Very good teacher and very enjoyable to learn from.  The project in the class was very cool and gave me and other students a better perspective about the Vietnam War.
2100,951062,4.5,2.0,Very passionate about history. Doing the reading was not always necessary for homework. Assignments were unclear at times but overall a great class with a really nice professor. Definitely awarded grades by the effort you put into it.
2101,951062,4.0,2.0,"I liked Del Testa very much! His lectures were very interesting and we even went on a few field trips. However, the mill research can be very frustrating, and requires a lot of time at the court house. Some of the extra assignments either didn't make sense, or seemed irrelevant. The course was definitely a unique experience!"
2102,951062,5.0,3.0,Love him.
2103,951062,5.0,1.0,"He is a great teacher. Most intelligent teacher i've ever had. Easy Class! He is also very helpful, pretty much what I'm saying is take his class."
2104,951062,4.0,1.0,"Nice guy and very straight forward, no tests just a paper and 2 group projects. Interesting at times and very passionate about his field. A good Prof."
2105,1934102,3.0,3.0,"She is quite rude. Her grading is inconsistent as well, and is not willing to work with you."
2106,1934102,4.0,2.0,Not sure why JT gets bad reviews. She is so nice and wants you to learn! Very accommodating with anything and allows you to complete HW late if you're super busy. Discussion question due based on readings every class but are light. W1 course so lots of writing (5 essays) but she has peer reviews and is always available to help read your essay.
2107,1934102,1.0,4.0,dont take her class she is rude and just not a nice person
2108,1934102,5.0,3.0,Absolutely amazing teacher! She is so approachable and the class is beyond interesting.  The class is very discussion based and even her lectures are not boring. Would definitely recommend!
2109,1934102,4.5,3.0,"Amazing professor. The expectation is not only that you have done the reading, but also that you have formulated opinions on it which definitely leads to more interesting discussions."
2110,1934102,2.5,4.0,She treats college students like they are still in high school.  Boring lectures on how to cite and what a primary source is.  DONT TAKE HER CLASS!!!! She assigns readings that are the same thing over and over again.  You have to participate a lot and she will call on you even when there is nothing left to say.  Most repetitive and boring class!!!
2111,1934102,5.0,4.0,"She is by far the best teacher I have had at Bucknell. Her ability to engage students and force them to think critically about subject matter puts her in a category of her own. She has outstanding lectures each day that engage students in different ways: media, group work, etc. Her HIST222 guides you to deep reflection on US history in a unique way"
2112,1934102,5.0,4.0,Professor Thomson is engaging with the students and creates a classroom dynamic that is open for every student to express their opinions. However you must have an open and critical mind to be truly engaged and learning in her class. She is the Professor Bucknell should aspire to have. Do your readings!
2113,1934102,5.0,4.0,"Professor Thomson is an incredible professor, but you have to be mature enough to have an open mind and critically think about the subject matter. You cannot go into her classes without being willing to look at things differently. If you show up, are engaged, and do the work, you will be happy you took the class."
2114,1934102,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors at this school hands down .  Bucknell is lucky to have her.  All of her lectures are thoughtfully planned out and are incredibly engaging.  I have never been in a class where so many students participate.  Learned so much in her class
2115,1768217,5.0,3.0,"Professor Krout is an amazing professor who explains the material so well that you actually understand it instead of having to memorize it. He's also available outside of class and really helpful during office hours. If you do his optional worksheets, you'll do well in the class."
2116,1768217,4.0,3.0,"Krout was a cool dude for lab. Always a joy to see his grumpy face at 8am. At the beginning of the semester there was a disconnect between TA, students and what he wanted so there were some LOW grades, but once we figured things out, everyone did really well in lab. I loved orgo 2 lab and Krout would help in office hours if needed (with a scowl)."
2117,1768217,4.0,4.0,"Knowledgeable about the topics, tried to relate topics to practical scenarios when possible, had organized class system. Exams and quizzes not easy, but provided worksheets and lecture slides helped greatly. Understanding topics and mechanisms required for success, visit office hours. Can appear distant/impersonal at times, however."
2118,1768217,4.0,4.0,"Organic is of the hardest classes in my opinion, Krout explains the material well and provides many extra study tools. However, his exams are very difficult and long. Even with him being a great prof, your effort in the class may not correlate with your grade. He will give you the grade that your assessments reflect, not what your effort shows."
2119,1768217,5.0,4.0,"Best ORGO teacher at Bucknell. Orgo is hard, but Krout does so much extra stuff to prepare students like making extra worksheets that are incredibly helpful. The exams are just like problems we do in class and on the worksheets, so there are no surprises. Great teacher overall."
2120,1768217,4.0,3.0,"THE BEST orgo professor. Made it incredibly easy to understand, but you still have to put forth your own effort. Do the practice quizzes and tests, they are exactly like the real thing. He is incredibly fair. Overall a great professor. "
2121,1768217,4.5,3.0,Krout is the man. He is truly a gentleman and a scholar. No better option for orgo.. Super clear and helpful and really gets to know his students.
2122,1768217,4.5,3.0,He makes an extremely difficult subject much easier to understand. Practice tests and quizzes show you exactly what to expect.
2123,1768217,5.0,3.0,Professor Krout is the bomb diggity. He's immensely clear and helpful. A good choice for orgo.
2124,1768217,3.0,2.0,He sometimes rambled on when he lectured but overall he was a pretty good professor.  His worksheets and practice quizes were immensely helpful and if you are good at learning stuff by yourself as well you will succeed.  He was probably a little easier than Stayton or Tillman but not as effective as teaching in lecture.  Depends how you learn.
2125,1768217,3.5,3.0,"Very knowledgeable and pretty good for a new professor. Would recommend doing a lot of out of class work with the material. Has helpful practice quizzes, exams, and worksheets."
2126,916260,4.0,3.0,"The class I took was discussion-based, so a good chunk of your grade is judged on how much you participate. Hes a good professor. He has many interesting thoughts on the books we read. Sometimes the discussions can get boring. The papers arent hard, you just need to read the assigned books and understand them."
2127,916260,4.0,4.0,I took Love&amp;Sex on the Silk Road Foundation Seminar with Dr. Shields. He is very passionate about course materials and will go on interesting tangents. It is very hard to get an A in the class (95 or higher). But if you listen to his corrections and meet with him you should be fine. Participate and ask good reading response question
2128,916260,4.0,2.0,"Professor Shields is such a nice guy and cares about the well being of his students. If you go to office hours just once early in the semester, this will help your grade because he knows that you care. Complete the assignments and edit your papers according to his comments and you will get a good grade!"
2129,916260,5.0,3.0,"One of the smartest professors I've ever had. If you get the chance, don't miss taking one of his classes. My class with him was by far the most interesting I've taken at Bucknell."
2130,916260,5.0,2.0,Professor Shields is the best humanities professor I have ever had. Not even kidding! People love him and everybody is concentrating on his class
2131,916260,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Shield's class was pretty simple. Just show up to class, participate, and write 4 papers throughout the semester. Class was very boring though because he used boring powerpoints, and I didn't enjoy the readings at all. The final paper was the hardest to do, and the symposium presentation was graded."
2132,916260,5.0,2.0,"Love & Sex on the Silk Road was extremely interesting and I really enjoyed the class. Professor Shields knows what he is talking about. We had 4 papers assigned throughout the semester and one final paper, all of which were pretty simple. If he knows you are trying your best and are participating in class, you will most likely do well in the class."
2133,916260,5.0,1.0,He is a great professor and really knows what he is talking about.  He is really nice and makes his lectures fun.  I would defi take him again for Buddhism.  It is a great class and is pretty easy.
2134,916260,3.0,3.0,"I heard Mclain's better than him. He's nice but the class is ppt presentation and it's kinda boring. He says that quizzes are easy as long as you read the hw, but that is NOT true. Also, he expects us to know more than we do. He tries to have discussions but he knows what answers he wants, so it wasn't. I learned little from discussion in class/BB."
2135,916260,5.0,3.0,"Professor Shields is a good professor.  The class is easy and he provides you with all the notes.  In this class, your grades are not only dependent on tests but on various other things. This is a great class and professor sheilds is a great teacher;however, i did think that his tests were a little tough but if you study for it you will be ok"
2136,916260,4.0,3.0,"The class material was interesting, but as a professor he made it a little dull.  He knew a ton, but didn't get you excited or anything about it.  Tests were not as i expected, a lot of facts, not too much philosophy in the into to asian religions. If you like the subject i would take his class."
2137,916260,4.5,4.0,"i had shields for buddhism, and i loved him...i recommend taking any asian religions class from him. his grading scale is SUPER easy (think 75% = B), and his tests are fair.  he is hilarious, and makes every class actually enjoyable...you don't end up watching the clock all class."
2138,1405742,1.0,2.0,Materials are easy but quizzes can be unclear and little flexibility in answers. 
2139,1405742,1.0,3.0,The course title is Bullshitology while the course itself is bullshit.
2140,1405742,3.0,3.0,"Prof Ryan is not the best lecturer, but he is always willing to help clarify material if you reach out. The class is very heavily based in a semester long group project that takes a ton of time outside of class. His grading system is confusing at first, but ultimately helpful. His instructions are often wordy and unclear, so ask for clarification."
2141,1405742,2.0,3.0,"Professor Ryan is very kind. However, we do more group projects than actually learning the material. The projects are extremely long and graded harshly. His grading system is unique and hard to understand but benefits the student. He reads off power points (bare minimum information) and does not explain what he's saying. Not the best teacher."
2142,1405742,1.0,5.0,He is the worst professor I've ever had. He does not know how to teach. We get 12 page papers each week that are each worth .2% of our grade. A waste of so many hours a week. We get 2 hours for exams that are 24 pages long... Never been so stressed. He's very nice but really misses the mark.
2143,1405742,1.0,4.0,"Not very accessible outside of class. Also, I didn't think it was fair for him to give me a graded quiz my first day of joining his class."
2144,1405742,5.0,4.0,"Professor Ryan is the nicest professor I have come across during my time at Bucknell. He truly wants to see his students succeed, he is willing to give advice and give his input on how to achieve your goals. As for work, he does give a lot of homework and it is typically difficult , but he is more than willing to help you through every step."
2145,1405742,2.0,4.0,"Super nice guy, only if you go to office hours though. Always willing to give you more time on assignments because he knows the work is so hard and that we all have no idea how to do it."
2146,1405742,4.0,4.0,"Amazing person and teacher. Passionate about the subject and the students. Very helpful in office hours. Not easy to get an A, but makes sure you are learning and offers help if you need it. B's are totally feasible if you listen to his lectures."
2147,1405742,3.0,4.0,Not a bad professor. Okay class if you are good at math.
2148,1405742,2.0,3.0,Work is graded very particularly. Homework is very challenging and can't be completed easily. Tests aren't terribly difficult but have a large impact on your grade.
2149,1405742,1.0,5.0,"This was by far the worst class I took at Bucknell and Ryan is the reason. He was completely unavailable, and did not know how to properly explain things. It was an insane amount of work and I got nothing out of the class. "
2150,1405742,2.5,4.0,He is the worst professor among all the ones I have. I really regret taking this half credit course. It takes me lots of work outside class and the professor is still looking for more work. He gives low grades just because he doesn't view the homework carefully. Don't take his class unless you are very good at math.
2151,1405742,4.0,2.0,"Teaching style takes some getting used to, if you aren't used to learning by yourself. He will assign work for every lesson which you go over as a class, which helps in making sure you understand it. Quizzes are taken in groups. He goes over the harder topics in class, and if there are difficulties with the homework, he postpones the due-date."
2152,1405742,4.5,2.0,"Quizzes are pretty hard but you have partners, so its pretty fun . Tests are pretty hard but there's a big curve. He has really good terrible jokes that are so bad it makes u laugh. He makes u really enjoy the class. hes just a great guy in general, great teacher, and i recommend this guy 100%"
2153,2673459,3.0,4.0,"Very nice man, but his class is demanding and you will be reading a lot. There are a max 5 grades that make up the final grade, so it is very hard to raise grade. Your final participation grade will be made up of how much you talk everyday. Do not want to skip class because that will also be a deduction from final grade. "
2154,2673459,5.0,2.0,"Very dynamic and entertaining professor. Lots of essays, but a fair grader for sure. Very helpful, but can be politically polarizing. "
2155,2673459,5.0,4.0,"I learned so much in this class about colonialism, neocolonialism and the idea of the global south! Dr. Leraul asks a lot but he also gives a ton of support so you can succeed and really learn."
2156,2745148,4.0,2.0,"She is a great teacher and I would gladly take her class again, it's not difficult but it is not suposed to be, it is very lecture driven but the project and essays were few and far between but make the class feel fulfilling. "
2157,2745148,5.0,2.0,"I had Professor Accettola for a summer course in Classical Greek Mythology.  While the class had large amounts of reading for homework, most of this could be attributed to the fact that it was a condensed summer course.  

Professor Accettola gave excellent lectures and encouraged great class discussion."
2158,2083651,5.0,3.0,Major requirement that turned into one of the most inspiring courses within my college experience. Opened many doors and lead me to asking questions I didn't know I could i ask. Professor Mullaney was inspiring and eager to go above and beyond for students who were willing to put the work and and truly learn. A+
2159,2083651,1.0,5.0,Terrible! Take a different class
2160,2083651,1.5,5.0,A lot of reading and she goes off on crazy topics that have nothing to do with the class. Not really interesting and too much work reading wise. I would recommend a different teacher
2161,2278218,5.0,4.0,"Prince is the best CHEG Professor at Bucknell and is criminally underrated. His classes are difficult but his unique teaching style forces you to actually learn and remember the material, which will benefit your career. He has a gift for explaining and is willing to spend extra time helping students outside class. He genuinely cares about you."
2162,2278218,5.0,4.0,"Prince is a great mentor and he gives lots of feedbacks to students. He is one of the most responsive and efficient professor I've ever seen. If you ask questions he is always willing to answer them. The course is hard, but he tried his best to let us struggle the right amount, not too much and not too little, to actually gain the skills we need."
2163,2278218,5.0,4.0,"Difficult, in the sense that the course work is primarily project based and demands proactivity from you. However, you will actually learn in his class, and the knowledge will stick. He is always willing to meet and give additional help and cares quite a lot about his students. He will email you if you miss class, concerned with how you are."
2164,2278218,1.0,4.0,"Does not care about his students. Acts annoyed if your team has any questions regarding the material, even though he does not actually formally lecture unless a student has a question. He has no problem leaving his paid professor career for several days of class to go do a second consulting job, even though we are paying to receive an education."
2165,498507,1.0,4.0,"If you like art history, then it is the class for you. However, she was very hard and critiqued everything. She is very condescending and expects you to know everything about writing, grammar, and art history. I would not recommend her and would not take her class again and would recommend another foundation course."
2166,498507,1.0,3.0,"monotone boring voice, did not learn much at all. Definitely not the hardest class ive ever taken but also watched the clock the whole time"
2167,498507,5.0,3.0,Dr. Andersson is amazing! She gives detailed lectures that never bore you and she knows art EXTENSIVELY. She is so helpful and is always available for extra help or if you just want to talk. She is a great resource and friend. I highly recommend taking one of her classes.
2168,498507,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite professors at Bucknell! Dr. Andersson is so, so knowledgable about art and art history, and has an incredible amount of experience in the field. Her lectures are informative and as long as you pay attention, you're golden. Genuinely one of the kindest professors on this campus, and will lend a helping hand if ever you should ask."
2169,498507,2.0,5.0,"She is very knowledgable about art history and her lectures give the necessary information. Aside from that she is very condescending and expects you to know every detail about the art she goes over. She is a very hard grader, almost absurd in my opinion. Got a C on the first paper that was uncalled for. Would not reccomend"
2170,498507,4.5,2.0,"I'm an art history major, so my perspective is skewed. Despite this, Andersson is a great professor and super helpful. Lectures are long and can be boring, but the information she gives you is always necessary and very helpful."
2171,498507,4.5,3.0,"I absolutely love her lectures! She is extremely knowledgeable professor. She knows every single detail and she cares a lot for students. If you like art, you will love her class!"
2172,498507,4.5,2.0,"Very knowledgable and an expert in her field. She used to be a curator at an art museum in Germany knows her stuff. Always willing to help and give you advice, just ask."
2173,498507,4.5,4.0,"One of the most knowledgeable professors I've ever had. Knows every little detail about renaissance art, and art in general. Genuinely cares about the well being of her students and will bring in cookies from time to time.  However, she has lengthy lectures and tough exams!!!  People who hate her are the ones who don't like art history in general."
2174,498507,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher that I have had, waste of space on the earth. Do not take her class. She is a snob."
2175,498507,1.5,2.0,She is by far one of the most condescending people I have ever met. I will never take another class with her as long as I am here. She treats her students as if they know absolutely nothing and are pretty much complete imbeciles. I suggest that if you are planning on majoring in art or art history to avoid her as much as possible.
2176,498507,1.0,2.0,"Doesn't follow a time line, basically teaches whatever she feel like hearing herself talk about that day. If she doesn't want to talk we'll watch a useless movie. Not to mention she's off putting and lofty."
2177,498507,2.0,5.0,"She was the worst teacher I have ever had.  She should be avoided at all costs.  She is condescending, rude and unbelievable boring.  Although she has an immense knowledge of Art History, she is aweful. Don't take her if you can avoid it."
2178,498507,1.5,4.0,She is a condescending know-it-all.
2179,498507,2.0,4.0,AWFUL.  SHE IS THE WORST PROF I HAVE EVER HAD.  EVIL WOMEN FROM GERMANY.  SHE SUCKS.  I GOT A 4 ON THE AP IN HIGH SCHOOL AND SHE GAVE ME A C+. grades really hard on tests and papers.  2 each.  have to go to nyc for a stupid trip. avoid at all COSTs.
2180,498507,3.0,4.0,"She is one of the most condescending people I have ever met. Her voice will put you to sleep, although she does know an incredible amount about art history. I say don't take her class unless necessary"
2181,498507,1.0,5.0,She is the least interesting professor I have ever met in my life. Her voice will put you to sleep in seconds. She is also not very flexible and will not be there for a student if they need her. Also if you do something to make her upset your grade will suffer! DON'T TAKE HER CLASSES!!
2182,498507,1.0,1.0,"She paced the room while we filled out her professor evaluation forms and then personally collected each one. She also requested that we identify ourselves by SSN on them.  Unfortunately, I gave her an honest evaluation and have no doubt that my grade suffered as a consequence."
2183,498507,4.0,4.0,"This is one of those professors where you get what you put out.  If you do not take the time to realize that she's as interested in you as you are in her, then you might just get left behind.  Moves at a slow-moderate pace for an art history class, but I can see how if you don't like art why it is likely for one to fail or fall behind miserably.  Overall, not for the slacker or the non-art focused being."
2184,498507,2.0,4.0,"Andersson is crazy - very pompous and when she talks to you she always manages to be condescending.  She knows a lot, but it can become very repetitive."
2185,498507,2.5,4.0,"Can talk for hours at a time about nothing.  Nice woman but very pompous, tough grader.  Even if you like art history I would avoid her."
2186,498507,4.5,2.0,"If you have taken art history before, you might want to think twice about taking a class from her.  If not, she will make everything clear as day by repeating it 3000 times.  You do not cover many pieces, and there isn't a lot of history.  But YOU WILL BE BORED if you know the material already."
2187,88910,4.0,2.0,I had Prof. Kuhn for Italian 101. He brings so much energy and really wants you to learn the language. He is also always there to help! I would take another one of his classes.
2188,88910,5.0,3.0,He is such an amazing professor with such a kind heart. Will help you fall in love with the language. He makes (not the best word but yk) you speak in class but DOES NOT CARE if you mess up. Always there to help and answer your questions as best as he can! Recommend having him. I'd recommend doing the homework thoroughly and being prepared :)
2189,88910,3.0,4.0,Prof Kuhn is very sweet and passionate about Italian however he was very hard to follow during lecture and I wish we would've taught grammar a bit more! Many of my classmates were left confused or had no idea was went on after lecture. Also very VERY tough grader. I wouldn't take this with Kuhn if you are not dedicated to actually learning Italian
2190,88910,4.0,2.0,"He's very enthusiastic and passionate about Italian, and this is contagious. His classes are never boring. However, I wish he explained grammar better and corrected our mistakes."
2191,88910,4.5,2.0,"My favorite professor. Always willing to help and SO enthusiastic. Class was never boring and he keeps things exciting. He encourages students to speak and does not care if they mess up, he appreciates when you try. Extremely understanding, great teacher and an even better person. I would recommend him to anyone."
2192,88910,4.5,1.0,Absolutely amazing professor. He made me want to continue learning the language. NEVER! stopped smiling. His love for the language was contagious.
2193,88910,5.0,1.0,The nicest and most enthusiastic professor I have ever had! You can't help but fall in love with the Italian language when he teaches. As an added bonus the class is extremely easy!
2194,88910,3.5,2.0,very nice guy; always smiles; helpful outside of class; lectures are interesting and interactive; lots of work in comparison to other FOUND classes but workload is still v. manageable and he is v. flexible/understanding
2195,88910,4.5,2.0,Amazing professor. Makes the class interesting so that you want to come. He is pretty easy and if you're not doing well he'll make sure that you get the help you need to get your grade up.
2196,88910,4.5,3.0,"He's a wonderful teacher. Even if you're bored in class (its a bit too easy), you'll want to come in just because he's teaching it. Really easy about the homework and coursework, have taken him for both ITAL 101, and 103."
2197,88910,3.5,2.0,"hes really nice and crazy, all over the place but hes soooo sweet and easy"
2198,88910,5.0,2.0,"incredibly helpful... wonderful class. makes class fun, won't let you do poorly in the class. amazing professor."
2199,88910,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2200,88910,4.5,1.0,"he's great, won't let anyone do bad!"
2201,547663,1.0,5.0,Avoid his class. Period. A terrible Professor. 
2202,547663,3.0,1.0,"Haggard is very boring, but the class is easy to get an A in. Labs are literally looking at simple instructions and following them... you can leave your brain at home for labs. The tests are straight from the textbook."
2203,547663,1.5,2.0,"Not very friendly, not very willing to help...kind of yells when you ask for help. Not very hard but definitely need to study because its extremely difficult to pay attention. If I could have replaced any class in my schedule it would be his."
2204,547663,4.5,1.0,gpa booster
2205,547663,3.5,2.0,"Pretty easy if you somewhat pay attention, you never really have to read for the classes, and very easy grader. The only problem is if you take his class in the morning you might have a hard time staying awake because lectures can be boring at times.. besides that tests arent bad and a good course to take for computer science credit.."
2206,547663,3.5,2.0,"Okay, very boring...but the old guy is so cute and so naive and such an easy grader that I couldn't dislike him."
2207,547663,4.0,1.0,Easy
2208,547663,1.0,3.0,Who gave this guy tenure&#63;
2209,547663,1.0,3.0,Wow... this class should be a joke but because he's sooo boring and gives such poor lectures it's actually a little challenging. Keep Clear.
2210,547664,5.0,3.0,TAKE INTRO TO FILM AND MEDIA! Faden is super chill and funny (always cracking jokes). Not much homework and like 2 exams and projects for the semester. Very lecture heavy however not extremely awful to sit through. Compared to other classes it was a perfect laid back class. I highly recommend!!
2211,547664,5.0,4.0,"Great Prof!!! Prof Faden is HILARIOUS and has a great sarcastic humor. Ive never taken a film class before, but he definitely made it worth while. It was a lot of work, but if you show that you tried he will give you a good grade. He also loves what he does, and it shows. Very happy he was a part of my experience at Bucknell"
2212,547664,3.5,2.0,"Eric Faden has become one of my favorite teachers at Bucknell. I was a little scared going into the class because of his rating, but it has not been bad at all. His personality is great and he loves what he does. There are no tests in this class and all the projects are intense but enjoyable. He will teach you a lot if you are willing to learn"
2213,547664,2.0,3.0,"I really wished I had taken this class when Bucknell wasnt making Film and Media studies it's own major. The guy is funny and smart, but is extremely sarcastic and can be quite condescending. Meeting with him is hard to do and he isnt great at responding to help. This may be because of the new major requirements. "
2214,547664,2.5,5.0,He's a really tough grader and it's almost unheard of to get an A in one of his classes. He's also really unhelpful if you go to his office hours. I told him I didn't understand the readings and he told me I wouldn't need the class if I understood them.
2215,547664,4.0,4.0,Great teacher who changed the way I looked at movies. However... Incredibly tough grader and all classes are lectures. Tough to stay awake but if you do you will learn alot.
2216,547664,1.5,4.0,Really hard grader almost impossible to get a good grade on your paper without massive amounts of correction
2217,547664,5.0,5.0,"Take a class with him, if only because he will change the way you write and the way you think about writing. He is incredibly knowledgeable about the material, some units of which are more interesting than others. Definitely one of the more captivating professors I've had at Bucknell."
2218,547664,3.5,4.0,"He's verysarcastic if not outright sardonic, which makes for interesting class discussions. He is challenfging but in the right way and very fair about how he doe things. I would recommend for the intellectually curious but not for grade seekers."
2219,547664,1.0,5.0,god awful class. i would rather die
2220,547664,3.0,5.0,ok
2221,547664,1.5,4.0,Not good
2222,547664,5.0,3.0,"Good teacher, grades papers tough but fairly."
2223,547664,3.0,4.0,interesting but can be boring espically some movies you watch at night and the papers are rough
2224,547664,4.5,4.0,No Comments
2225,547664,3.5,4.0,sort of an arrogant prick. tests are tough; class discussions are interesting and worth your attention
2226,547664,3.5,3.0,"Really into film and writing, he's a pretty tough grader when it comes to papers but he challenges you in the right way. I really suggest him for both film and writing."
2227,547664,5.0,4.0,"Faden is very very tough (but fair) when it comes to grading written work, but his class is usually very entertaining and worthwihle."
2228,2177872,3.0,5.0,This class was extremely difficult for me although he was a very cool guy and was very willing to help. The final was impossible and killed my grade but apparently he curves grades at the end.
2229,2177872,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gallagher AKA Torrey Big Time is the absolute boy! Great teacher for Math 112, hooks it up fatty style, ya heard."
2230,2177872,5.0,3.0,"This Professor is the OG mud bones of Og mud bones. I wish I could've taken math112 4 times. Great guy, great professor, and really understands students and what we go through."
2231,2177872,5.0,3.0,"He is a very good professor. Explains examples well in class. Tests were fair and if you studied, did the homework, and tried, you were golden. Office hours helped a lot. He is very nice and would explain anything that you don't understand until you understand. I think he's a visiting prof but tbh he's so good I hope he stays."
2232,2177872,5.0,4.0,"Explains content very well through examples. Takes a lot of questions and thoroughly explains every detail no matter how obvious it may seem. Very personable, everyone in the class had some relationship with him. Tests were very fair and pulled from lectures and homeworks very well so you knew how to study."
2233,2177872,1.0,5.0,"I switched out of this course pretty soon after I entered it, and I was very lucky. Only writing a  review because I saw no one else had yet and I wanted to send a warning. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Everyone who took it and finished it struggled. Final's average was something like a 55 and he only gave a tiny curve to everyones final grades."
2234,101202,5.0,2.0,"Best philosophy teacher at Bucknell, regardless of your major you owe it to yourself to take one of his classes. If you are looking for a teacher who will just explain to you what long dead philosophers thought, look elsewhere, but if you want a teacher who is more concerned with the posing of questions that make you think, look no further."
2235,101202,5.0,2.0,OUTSTANDING TEACHER. Fleming is funny and really knows his stuff. Class material isn't that bad if you do a few practice problems. You learn a lot.
2236,101202,5.0,1.0,"Fleming is an incredible professor; quite clear and terse. He is very accessible outside of class (although he doesn't use any modern communication i.e. email or phone). This class specifically was VERY easy. All that I had to do was take lots of notes in the class. There is no homework, no reading, and no finals. Would definitely take again."
2237,101202,4.0,2.0,"Fleming has an interesting sense of humor that you may love or may just have to get used to. He is pretty funny during class, and also is great at lecturing. I learned a lot in logic. It's pretty easy as long as you go to class, take notes, and study. There are no homeworks and only 4 tests. Would recommend!"
2238,101202,5.0,3.0,"By far the best professor I've ever had. I 10/10 recommend him. The class itself can be difficult, but the material builds off of itself so as long as you put in the effort you should be fine. The only grades are four exams, but if you show that you're trying to the best of your abilities, then he has no problem boosting your grade from a B to a B+"
2239,101202,4.5,2.0,He is by far my favorite professor at Bucknell. I have this class at 8am and it always starts my day on a good note. He doesn't take attendance so you can just sleep in if you feel like it and easily get the notes from someone else. He gave no homework and we just had 4 exams throughout the semester. No final exam.
2240,101202,5.0,3.0,"Fleming is by far the best professor I've ever had. He's an outright genius, he's hysterical, and he is a great lecturer. You know Fleming is the most loved prof at Bucknell because he can get away with refusing to use a computer or university email, all while having a rock as his directory photo. Do not graduate without taking a class with him!"
2241,101202,4.5,2.0,Great class. Only grades are 4 exams. Each counts for 25%
2242,101202,4.0,1.0,"He's such a cool guy.  I definitely enjoyed his class, although some of the material was tough, as long as you went to class you'd do fine.  Always did his best to explain and reviewed what we learned at the beginning of each class.  However he doesn't use email or phone, so somewhat hard to get in contact with him "
2243,101202,4.0,1.0,"He is clear, precise, and tells you what to expect. But he's also rather brackish for serious students and convinces people he's like Wittgenstein, even though he's really just a gruff version of Turner (who is better). You need to throw his teaching aside-transcend it so to speak-if you really want to learn anything. Take his class; question it."
2244,101202,5.0,2.0,"Fleming is maybe the coolest professor at  Bucknell, or ever, anywhere. He hates the administration as much as the students do, if not more. Refuses to use computers; the only thing in his office is a plain desk with a rock on it. If you dont take his classes, I dont know whats wrong with you"
2245,101202,5.0,1.0,"Great professor.  Must take class.  Course is easy, material interesting, professor nice and funny.  What is not to love?"
2246,101202,5.0,2.0,"By far the greatest teacher at Bucknell. If you take four classes with him, it will be the best philosophy minor possible. Scary smart and also hilarious in class. Not too difficult if you take good notes and study for exams because he pretty much tells you ahead of time what will be on the exams"
2247,101202,5.0,2.0,"Had him for Phil 103 (logic) and 233....He is the greatest prof by far! hilarious...never a dull moment in class! Pretty much tells you what will be on the test, so if you take good notes you'll get an A."
2248,101202,4.5,3.0,"Took this guy in 2003, but he came to mind so I googled him and found this site.  The guy is a bucknell treasure.  I hope he still refuses to try email. &quot;And by that point you will not know logic... you will be logic.&quot;"
2249,101202,4.0,2.0,Fleming is the man. Funny guy. Definitely worthwhile
2250,101202,4.5,2.0,He's a really great teacher. I thought that he taught the material very clearly. Did not study very much and got an A. Just be sure to do some of the problems that he recommends in the book before the day of the test and you'll do fine.
2251,101202,5.0,3.0,"Fleming is a gem! great communicator and easily accessible, sort of, haha. He's STRAIGHTFORWARD, what you see is what you get - pure & simple."
2252,101202,4.5,3.0,"he's a refreshing part of my day between two science classes. he's hillarious, often talks to himself and teases the students which is fun, he called someone in the class a dumbsh*t the other day, but it's all for laughs. the third test is hard, but do the problems in the book and you'll be fine. TAKE HIM, he's a part of bucknell you shouldn't miss"
2253,101202,4.0,2.0,Flemming is a great professor. He teaches philosophy by getting you to think. Go to class and pay attention and it's hard to go wrong in the class.
2254,101202,3.5,2.0,"It's not a difficult class, but not an easy A either."
2255,101202,5.0,2.0,"Fleming is amazing! He makes class really fun and if you go and study before tests you'll get an A. No homework, no papers, no final."
2256,101202,5.0,3.0,Took him for 4 courses- Fleming is absolutely brilliant. I'm not an A student and still enjoyed the class and working for the B+. It would be a shame to graduate without taking one of his courses- HE IS THE BEST!
2257,101202,4.5,1.0,"Funny in his own, unique way, although some people think he's corny (and they're right, but I thought he was kind of funny). He leaves a lot of the work to you, but the class is pretty easy, but gets harder towards the end. Never changes his clothes. Really. You'll see. Reminded me of Pete Townshend or Neville from Harry Potter."
2258,101202,5.0,2.0,Fleming is brilliant. Seriously. He could be one of the smartest people I've ever met. His lectures are clear and he's a funny guy. I felt like I became more intelligent just from being in the same room as him. Bucknell should probably require every student to take a class taught by Fleming in order to graduate.
2259,101202,3.5,1.0,"one of the best chess players in the world, seriously. that's why you should take his logic class, duh. no really."
2260,101202,3.5,1.0,Fleming is absolutely amazing. He is hilarious and unpredictable. He tends to make up dates and stories but they help in remembering important ideas.  Makes a class I would otherwise not care for into my favorite class.  Attendance is not mandatory but is necessary to go to understand the class though its not a problem because you want to go
2261,101202,4.0,1.0,"Logic is the class is the one that EVERYONE at Bucknell should take.  It is amazing and works with any major.  I highly recommend taking a class from this crazy, funny man."
2262,101202,4.0,2.0,"Fun class.  He interacts with the students, even with a large class.  He keeps the class entertaining.  Just keep up with notes - he tends to not like the book often times."
2263,101202,5.0,1.0,hahah i like how there are 50 comments about him and the rest of the professors at this school top out at about 15
2264,101202,4.5,1.0,No Comments
2265,101202,4.0,1.0,"Got an A- in spite of not going to class entire month of November....4 tests, no final....you could just get the notes from what seems like eveybody you know(everyone takes the class) and study a couple of days before the exam and pull off an A......you really only need to study hard on the 3rd test(which i got a 100(not diffiuclt if you study))"
2266,101202,5.0,1.0,"This class was the easiest one i've ever had, yet i still learned a lot and like the material that Flemming teaches.  Logic with Flemming is the #1 class hands down."
2267,101202,5.0,1.0,"4 Tests all year, no homework, doesn't care if you come to class, your grade is the average of the 4 tests, thats it, the lessons are straightforward and he is funny as hell, something kinda wierd is that he wheres the exact same thing every day black button down, jeans and black shoes, hes a little out there but my favorite professor"
2268,101202,5.0,1.0,very entertaining. work load is minimum. dont bother buying your own text book. easy easy easy
2269,101202,4.5,1.0,Very entertaining and comical professor.  The subject matter was interesting and the workload was minimal.  There are only four tests the entire semester and no other grades.  Genuinely cares about teaching.
2270,101202,2.0,2.0,FLEMING IS THE S*IT
2271,101202,5.0,1.0,"EASIEST class at Bucknell, funniest frickin guy"
2272,101202,3.5,2.0,"Good class, He is extremely funny and a good prof.  Just go to class and take good notes and you will bet set for any exam or paper."
2273,101202,4.5,3.0,"Flemming is a great professor, but i thought the class was hard.  A lot of people take it because they think it will be an easy A but you actually do have to study or you probably won't do well."
2274,101202,4.0,2.0,"Hilarious man... one of the funniest teachers at bucknell, if your interested in the subject matter you want to take it from this guy"
2275,101202,3.0,4.0,"maybe i'm retarded but i got a C in logic! you either get it or you dont, and i apparently did not get it."
2276,101202,2.5,2.0,"Very easy class, great teacher...but if you need him outside of class forget it...he doesnt use email"
2277,101202,3.5,4.0,really cool teacher but i found the class to be one of the hardest ones ive ever taken.. you either understand it or you dont
2278,101202,4.0,1.0,"Funny, easy, just go to class and you'll do fine. And btw, on the 3rd exam he gives you the 19 rules to look at on the exam, but he wont tell you about it unless you ask, so now you know. He may not have told you."
2279,101202,3.5,2.0,What a goofball.  Definately take his class.
2280,101202,5.0,1.0,"best prof ever!! You must take him at some point...It is an easy class if you take notes and go to every class.  He is really funny, but has some weird habits.  He is almost impossible to find outside of class though."
2281,101202,4.0,2.0,"Nice guy, funny, needs to change his shirt every now and again though."
2282,101202,4.5,2.0,An excellent professor...makes the class interesting (he's eccentric and hilarious) and knows how to teach the material.  I highly recommend his classes.
2283,101202,3.5,2.0,"Easy Class. No work outside of class, just three tests. No final exam."
2284,101202,5.0,1.0,amazing teacher with little work...hilarious....best teacher ever
2285,101202,4.0,1.0,"Great professor, very quirky, likes to pace a lot in the classroom, but overall a great prof, who is caring about his students and his material!"

2287,101202,4.5,3.0,Amazing
2288,101202,5.0,4.0,"Outstantding teacher.  Great lecturer, too.  Great sense of humor, kind soul.  Interesting material, and he'll let you go out on a limb as long as you can support your claims."
2289,101202,5.0,2.0,"Even if you're not interested in logic, or if you think it's hard, he makes it interesting and teaches it so well that it's easy. You'll find yourself learning and cracking up during his lectures! Awesome guy."
2290,101202,4.5,1.0,"Easy Class just go to class, great professor"
2291,101202,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor, definitely one of the best at Bucknell.  Great lectures, picks interesting course material, and really explains what the author was thinking.  Paper topics are rather broad so you can pretty much write on what you feel like."
2292,101202,5.0,1.0,"I had him for Logic as well, just an awesome professor.  Funny, entertaining, and lays things out in detail so it's easy to do well.  Papers for him consist of following themes he's laid out and commenting on them."
2293,101202,5.0,2.0,The best prof on campus - everyone should experience one of his classes.  Hilarious and brilliant.
2294,101202,5.0,1.0,funny teacher who clearly explains course material
2295,101202,4.5,2.0,great class easy a
2296,101202,5.0,1.0,sooooo easy! easy A just go to class
2297,101202,5.0,2.0,great prof
2298,101202,4.5,1.0,Very interesting course. Super easy if you have a math background.
2299,101202,5.0,2.0,such a good guy i'd def take another one of his classes
2300,101202,5.0,2.0,awesome professor!  really excited about philosophy and totally entertaining... the way all profs should be about their subject.

2308,101202,5.0,2.0,He is the man! Interesting classes.Does he still wear the black shirt and jeans&
2309,101202,5.0,2.0,the best professor at bucknell.  if you show any interest youll get an A
2310,101200,3.0,3.0,Lectures are very boring and labs are totally pointless. He makes you work with this program called mathematica that is hard to understand. I joined a study group and that how I was able to understand
2311,101200,3.0,3.0,professor hutton is a funny guy. his class is pretty straight forward as long as you pay attention in lecture. weekly quizzes are very similar to exam questions. as long as you understand the homework the exams should be very simple
2312,101200,1.0,5.0,"Makes you write paragraphs explaining how you did your work. Barely explains anything in class, lab sessions are pointless, and exams are brutal. Small assignments can pad your grade, but the  amount of effort put in outside of the class does not lead to great results. Hard to do well if you're not good at advanced math."
2313,101200,1.0,5.0,The worst teacher I've ever had. Tests are impossible and you can easily tell if he doesn't like you. Holds vendettas against kids for no reason. Class is brutally boring and I don't think there was a class where at least 3 kids were asleep. Math labs are useless and god help you if you ask for help. Can't explain the material. The worst.
2314,101200,5.0,1.0,He tells lots of jokes and eyes down people who don't do work. Prepare to love his huge lips they are constantly cracking and that is all he complains about.
2315,101200,2.5,5.0,He was a bad professor. Tests were nothing like the homework or webwork although thats what he said. Quizzes are doable if you look through the chapter. very argumentative if you try to get the answer your own way. avoid class at all costs
2316,101200,2.5,4.0,Extremely intimidating and unapproachable.
2317,101200,2.5,4.0,"Hutton is a really good guy, and really loves Calc, but he does not do a great job of explaining it. He is willing to help if you ask for it, but even then his explanations don't always do the trick. Problems on the tests are harder than any examples in class or homework."
2318,101200,2.0,4.0,His lectures are so boring and he reciets the text book and thinks everyone is as interested as he is when most people aren't. He takes off tons of points for little things on tests so grades are bad. He has math lab once a week that is hard and usless. He's a nice person but avoid the class.
2319,101200,5.0,1.0,Nicest Teacher ever 
2320,101200,1.0,5.0,Awful.
2321,101200,1.5,4.0,Didn't like him. Hated his teaching. Super boring. But he was a lovely man once class was over and very kind in office hours.
2322,101200,2.5,4.0,not particularly engaging. homework was not mandatory. office hours were helpful. very nice man though
2323,101200,2.5,4.0,The man is retentive. On one test I showed all my work and got all the right answers EXCEPT I apparently didn't show him the work he wanted to see... Ended up with a C-. If you enjoy banging your head against brick walls this MATH 197 with Hutton is for you!
2324,101200,2.5,4.0,"His class is a bit hard, and he can be confusing at times. I recommend going to his office hours. He is very nice, occasionally telling students to have a good weekend when it is in fact wednesday. He wants us to succeed, and there is no graded homework. Your grade is all based on quizzes/tests/final but he had a great drop policy"
2325,101200,3.0,3.0,Boring he put me to sleep. Nice guy. You would think that not having graded homework is a good thing but then you are not forced to do it so you don't really understand what is going on
2326,101200,2.5,3.0,"Hutton is a great guy, don't get me wrong. But he doesn't put any depth or emotion into teaching, it's all regurgitated from the text. Everything he says is so simple that it doesn't really even help you. Spends time doing the wrong things in class as well. I tell all of my friends to avoid him even though I feel bad saying it."
2327,101200,4.5,3.0,"Reitorating what the last person said, I don't know why Hutton is ranked poorly. The weekly quizzes are homework problems with slight variations, and the tests are the most straight forward of any math class I've ever been in. HW doesn't get handed in. He is extemely helpful and interesting at office hours. IMO they the key to any math class."
2328,101200,4.0,2.0,"Hutton is AWESOME. I don't get why people rank him so low! Doesn't require homework handed in, but tests you on the homework, which is absolutely fair. Quizzes and tests are predictable once you do the homework and actually try to learn the material. Can be funny too."
2329,101200,4.0,4.0,class may cause narcolepsy. make friends with the textbook and do the homework problems and then go to his office hours. he is extremely helpful when you meet with him outside of class. he means well and can explain things better one on one
2330,101200,2.5,3.0,"Put me to sleep every class. Very nice guy, but he didn't really sparked my (or anyone else's) interest in Calc. He was helpful out of class, though."
2331,101200,3.0,3.0,"Not very good at explaining things in class, but is very understandable if you go to him for 1 on 1 help. Class is extremely boring. We play games to the number times he says &quot;okay&quot; during problem session. Do ALL of the homework and you should be fine."
2332,101200,1.0,5.0,he is terrible! classes suck and are a waste of time. tests have nothing to do with anything. horrible
2333,101200,1.0,5.0,This man is a horrible teacher. He doesn't teach and the tests are ridiculous. Avoid at all costs!
2334,101200,3.0,1.0,"hutton is an ok guy. you have a quiz every week, which can usually help, not harm.  the tests are not bad either.  be prepared to love the textbook, though. it explains things better than in class."
2335,101200,3.0,3.0,"How to begin with prof Hutton... If you need to take Calc definitely not a bad prof to get. At first I thought I would do poorly in his class because he doesn't really teach and gives very few examples of anything useful in class- which is frustrating. However, quizzes and tests were not very hard- cover basic material. No enthusiasm in class-"
2336,101200,4.5,3.0,"Prof Hutton is the man...office hours are especially beneficial, and probably helped me get the grade I got....basically - he is a very very good teacher, don't take any other teacher for calc, or else!"
2337,101200,4.0,2.0,"I think Hutton is a pretty good teacher.  He can be really really boring at times, but he knows what he's talking about, and is willing to help you learn.  He doesn't grade homework, which is a good thing, and a bad thing.  It's nice because you don't need to worry about it if you have other more important matters, but you it is beneficial to do it"
2338,101200,4.0,3.0,"I really like his classes. Homework is not required, but if you do the homeowrk and pay attention, you should do well in the class. Professor Hutton is a very nice guy as well. Great teacher to take."
2339,101200,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hutton is a great teacher; I have no idea why he's rated with a frown face. Although calc 2 is not the easiest class in the world, he really tries to make it as clear as possible. The homework is not mandatory, but it helps to do the problems when studying for a quiz/test. He is always willing to help outside of class. Overall a great guy"
2340,101200,4.5,3.0,I think that professor hutton was really a good teacher.  I really feel that I have learned something from his class.  His tests and quizes are just on the material he teaches.  He is also always avaliable for help out of class.  In all I think he is a great teacher and I defi recommend him
2341,101200,1.0,5.0,whoah this guy does not know how to teach copies notes of text  this guy needs to quit teaching and stick to research or whatever
2342,101200,1.0,5.0,he is about the most unclear teacher ive ever had.. i especially liked this examples that were word for word for the textbook..  his tests do not even closely resemble what was taught in class and assigned for hw..

2345,162644,4.0,3.0,"Professor Wolaver is a very solid professor. I learned so much about healthcare and the industry, I will definitely take a lot of the learning away into my life. She gives a fair amount of work, right in the sweet spot where you are learning but not excessive. Quizzes and tests are fair, do the readings and you will understand the content. "
2346,162644,5.0,3.0,Prof Wolaver knows her economics really well and it's reflected in her teachings. There is a lot of textbook reading but it isn't bland. Additionally most of the knowledge you need will be taught in class. As long as you show up to class and pay attention it will not be hard to get a good grade. The workload definitely exists but it isn't taxing.
2347,162644,3.0,3.0,"This class was pretty mediocre. Lecture is generally just repeating or clarification of whatever the reading was about. Material is not particularly interesting, most of the class is devoted to understanding insurance models. Prof. Wolaver is nice in and out of the classroom and is open to helping students succeed, but overall this class is just ok"
2348,162644,1.0,3.0,"- A summary of the pros and cons of professor Wolaver: Pros: + Easy tests + Nice lady, helpful in office hour Cons: + Bad hand-writing + Lectures are unorganized and disjointed. She doesn't teach many stuff that is on the homework + She doesn't do a good job covering the material in the book"
2349,162644,5.0,1.0,"Taking 103? Wolaver is BY FAR the best prof to take. HW is hard and graded hard but there are tons of extra credit opportunities to gain at least 10% of your HW grade back (Like I did) Tests are easy, she posts every test, yes every test she's given over the past 20 years online so you study for the test by taking the test Yes problems are ID"
2350,162644,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Wolaver is wonderful. She really connects with her students and helps them reach their full potential. Go to class and be prepared to read. Honestly, just a little studying before exams and paying attention in her class is all you need for an A."
2351,162644,5.0,1.0,"Awesome professor, who wants everyone to do well, and is super approachable.  Lectures can be a bit boring, but that was more due to the subject than anything else.  Fair/ easy grader if the work you turn in shows you put in the time."
2352,162644,3.0,3.0,"The material is ""easy"" (coming from someone who isn't an econ person) but for some reason her lectures left me confused. A fair grader and questions are worth a lot of points but she gives plenty of partial credit. VERY approachable and nice in her office. would highly recommend going to her for help or guidance "
2353,162644,1.0,4.0,"She was probably one of the worst professors I have ever had. She was so unorganized and extremely difficult to understand. I had some interest in this area and she completely destroyed that for me, as she did nothing but confuse me and make me hate this subject-area. I would not recommend taking her class and to find a different professor ASAP"
2354,162644,3.0,2.0,Seemed completely lazy and unmotivated to teach us. Class was very unstructured even when she decided to group both sections of classes together.
2355,162644,5.0,2.0,"I loved Wolaver. I'm bad at calculus and anything connected with math, but her lectures were very interesting and easy to understand. Also she helped me out outside classroom a lot. I recommend this course and this professor."
2356,162644,2.0,3.0,Wolaver is a very nice person but also very unorganized and tough to understand. Her handwriting is extremely messy and it is often very tough to understand what she writes on the board. She also moves so fast that she will erase things before you get to take notes on it. Don't take unless you can read messy handwriting and can write it down fast.
2357,162644,2.5,3.0,"Fun class- pretty energetic teacher. However, her clarity is just not all there. Lessons confusing and scattered- hard to comprehend at times. Moderate tests and a picky grader- don't worry too much, doesn't curve grades until the end of the semester. I surprised myself with an A in the end."
2358,162644,4.0,3.0,"Energetic, a real live teacher who cares about and knows every student in her class. Her examples are very helpful-highly recommended. Econ homework due every Friday."
2359,162644,3.0,3.0,She is a really nice lady but she is a little all over the place at the white board.  Sometimes her writing can be hard to follow.  The tests and homework assignments aren't too bad but she gives almost daily &quot;clicker quizzes&quot; that can be annoying at times.
2360,162644,4.0,2.0,she uses clickers every day...beware she knows when u dont come because there are little quizzes...she does a lot of inclass handouts and group assignments that u do in class...also there is like 10 hw assignments and 4 tests plus the final.  not to bad overall tests are not to bad and basically just reworded problems from hw and assignments.
2361,162644,4.5,3.0,"great professor. very helpful outside of class, not like it's needed much anyway. there's a lot of writing, but she's a fair grader. joyful and funny and very interesting."
2362,162644,4.0,3.0,Teaches pretty well; makes a confusing textbook a bit clearer. Didn't like her at first but by the end I was a fan. Tests are fairly easy and she gives good in class exercises.
2363,162644,4.5,2.0,"She is generally very easy.  The final assignment can be a pain, but since you do very little work the rest of the semester, you have to get a grade from somewhere.  Also, you only have to go to three movies because she discusses everything important in class."

2367,1991515,5.0,3.0,"A great person you can tell he really wants to be there to teach students. I don't think he always explains material in the easiest way to understand but will take as long as you need with him to make sure you understand it. It doesnt matter, the level of effort he puts into his classes alone is enough to make you enjoy his class. Highly recommend!"
2368,1991515,5.0,2.0,Professor Peck truly cares about his students and their success in his class. I was unsure about being a computer science major until I had him as a professor.
2369,1991515,5.0,2.0,"My favorite professor I've had at Bucknell so far. He really cares about each and every one of his students, and wants us all to succeed. He is super accommodating and is willing to go to extra lengths to craft models to help students better understand difficult concepts. He makes a lot of jokes and keeps things interesting while still teaching"
2370,1991515,5.0,2.0,"Professor Peck is one of the best professors I have ever had. He cares so much about his students and making sure that they understand the material by making 3D models and whatever else we needed. I had never taken a computer science class before and was completely fine in his class. He is a fair grader and if you try, you will do well."
2371,1991515,5.0,2.0,"Evan Peck is the man PogChamp, seriously though just a really nice guy and wants his students to succeed."
2372,1991515,5.0,2.0,"What a beast. Peck puts in the work for his classes, if you also put in work, you will do well on the tests."
2373,1991515,5.0,2.0,"Peck is definitely the best professor in the intro level computer science courses, great lectures, explains stuff well, draws on the board and is really helpful in office hours. The tests are not that hard, but you do need to know the material. Very fair"
2374,1991515,4.5,2.0,"Peck is amazing! I took him for both 203 and 204. While other sections were struggling on tough topics, Peck makes everything relatable and makes sure that every student individually understands the topic. He is pretty much available around the clock and willing to help with anything. His tests are also reasonable and applicable to the real world."
2375,1991515,5.0,2.0,"Peck is the man. He knows how to make even abstract topics relatable with his stories. I highly recommend him for any computer science class, especially the intro ones."
2376,1991515,5.0,2.0,Great professor. Super chill and easy to get help from.  He is young and very down to earth and only tests on what matters. He has a great energy during lectures and tries his best to make them funinteresting.  Definitely take him if you  get the chance. 
2377,1991515,4.5,2.0,Good computer science professor! Love him so much.
2378,2366300,1.0,4.0,Do not take this class for any reason whatsoever. She is extremely unhelpful and lectures definitions straight from the textbook without explanation. She makes you feel stupid for asking questions or going to her office hours. Often times she doesn't know the answers to questions raised in-class and tells you to do research on your own time.
2379,2366300,1.0,4.0,This class should be called &quot;Complaining about the unfair world we live in.&quot; It was supposed to be a globalization geography class; however every single assignment is tended to push her liberal agenda. She does not hesitate to bring political bias into the classroom and it taints everything she teaches. Extremely tough grader and horrible teacher.
2380,2366300,1.0,5.0,This is a pretty boring class and it's hard to follow what you are actually expected to know. she is an incredibly tough grade for an intro class and isn't very helpful. she is very young and it is clear that she's not trying to help you be successful but come off as a serious teacher. do not take this class if you can avoid it.
2381,2444128,5.0,3.0,Interesting class. Professor Baca is a wonderful professor and all around great person. If you take the time to do the readings and put effort into your work you will be fine. 100% would take again.
2382,2444128,1.0,1.0,A terrible grader. Enough said.
2383,2444128,5.0,3.0,"An interesting class taught by a good professor. She relies on small group discussion rather than putting any one person on the spot, which I prefer."
2384,2444128,3.0,1.0,She was OKAY. She had a hard time communicating her thoughts clearly which left people confused a lot. This class was very easy so it didn't matter as much but I feel in a higher level class this could be an issue. Just complete all of the papers and assignments and you will be fine. I would try to take a different 101 professor if possible.
2385,1035109,2.0,4.0,"He taught 211 in a flipped classroom style. Overall I like flipped classroom and learning on my own first, but he did not do much in class which made it very difficult to do his worksheets as he offered little help. He reused old video lectures from the previous year. We had weekly quizzes which had some trick qs and he also did not allow any drops"
2386,1035109,4.0,4.0,"Professor Kerber is great and accessible after class! He always will put a trick question on the quizzes but they're honestly doable and it ends up making you actually use your brain instead of just memorizing content from the textbook. With that being said, READ THE TEXTBOOK! The textbook is what his quizzes and final are based on."
2387,1035109,5.0,3.0,"Kerber is a good guy. Gives lots of homework, but it's usually easy. Tests were difficult, but they were take-home (for CHEM321) and not a huge part of the grade. Very helpful in office hours. Not as helpful on Slack. Makes occasional typos on HW and notes. Lectures were a bit dry sometimes, but I def recommend Kerber to chem majors."
2388,1035109,2.5,3.0,"One of the most boring professors I've had.  You can do well in the class,  but you pretty much have to teach yourself most of the problems as you barely work through any in class.  Very bad at giving partial credit, which can end up hurting your grade pretty significantly."
2389,1035109,4.5,3.0,"He's very organized and put together, but his tests are much harder than the practice problems and stuff he presents in class."
2390,1035109,5.0,2.0,very helpful
2391,1035109,5.0,4.0,I had him for 211 and stuck with him for 212.  He is so helpful at office hours and really down-to-earth.  He even let me post-pone a test to the next day because I had 2 tests that day already.  He is the best!  Definitely take Kerber over Shawe.
2392,1035109,4.0,4.0,"Definitely not easy, but he's a really good prof! I'm taking him again for 212!"
2393,1035109,4.5,4.0,"He's a great teacher and really cares about getting to know everyone by name and helping you learn the material. He's also very good in Lab and is helpful, and doesn't waste your time. Nice guy, lectures aren't boring, and he uses &quot;Cornell Notes&quot; format for notes and it's super helpful and organized"
2394,1035109,5.0,2.0,"Kerber is amazing! He's the easiest of the chem professors and really wants the student to do well. He teaches the subject matter great, and is very lenient, giving tons of partial credit"
2395,1035109,4.5,4.0,I love Kerb! He's awesome.
2396,1035109,4.0,2.0,No Comments
2397,2675566,1.0,5.0,"Professor Beal is arguably the worst professor I've had at Bucknell. He has negative regard for any students mental health, continuously assigning endless amounts of work. When confronted about how much work he has been giving us, he just advised us to work more &quot;efficiently.&quot; The absolute worst, avoid this man at all costs."
2398,1745775,3.5,3.0,"Romberger comes off as a hardass at first, but he's really a good guy and does want you to succeed, if you show you're trying that is. Go to recitation!! He often gives problems that are really similar to test questions. His gives a TON of mastering chem homework, but his tests aren't awful if you are well prepared."
2399,1745775,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Romberger is one of my favorite professors at Bucknell. He is intelligent, passionate, funny and really went out of his way to make sure that his students understood the material. He is extremely helpful and patient (and even plays relaxing country songs) during office hours (which he was more often than not willing to extend.) Love him!!"
2400,1745775,3.0,3.0,Romberger was better 2nd semester with Gen Chem. He finally taught us by teaching on the chalkboard and not reading from the slides. Finally showed us how to solve problems step by step. Exam questions were based on class examples. Mastering chem hw every week was annoying but helpful.
2401,1745775,1.5,4.0,Test questions were always random. Problems in class were basic but nothing like exam questions. Took slides right from the book and also not helpful during office hours.
2402,1745775,2.0,4.0,"lectures are useless, all he does is read off the slides. Exams have the most random questions on them which are never emphasized to study. Very confusing when he attempts to explain things, only gets students more confused."
2403,2188149,1.0,4.0,"This professor was the worst I've had. The material he chooses for class is way too difficult, and he practically requires students to go to office hours if they want a decent grade. He is not understanding of students' situations and was extremely rude in email correspondence. DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
2404,2188149,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Fridman led a very engaging, interesting, and lively class! I would definitely take another with him. He expected a lot from each of us, however, he made that clear at the beginning of the semester. If you participate, do most of the readings, and go to his office hours if you need help, you will do fine. Great guy!"
2405,2188149,1.0,4.0,"Prof. Fridman was overall not a good teacher. His feedback was unconstructive and he rarely gave clear expectations for essays. Not only this but for the majority of the class he didn't even teach, he instead relied on the students to provide the material for the class via their own presentations. I wouldn't make my worst enemy take a class by him."
2406,2188149,1.0,4.0,DO NOT TAKE CLASSES WITH THIS PROFESSOR. The material he chose for this class (although it was 400 level) was way too hard for anyone to understand. He also had incredibly unclear grading criteria and was not accessible. I can't believe that he teaches at the university of Michigan based off of the quality of his teaching. Worst instructor ever.
2407,2188149,5.0,3.0,"The material is so interesting. He gives really good feedback. Definitely, will take another class with him."
2408,2188149,3.0,3.0,"Although he is hard to understand, he offers very understandable class exercises. It's easy if you actively practice and study the grammar rules. If you've had a fair amount of Spanish experience it should be an easy pass."
2409,2188149,1.0,2.0,So boring. He is hard to understand. Not very friendly or funny. Just a not interesting class that everyone takes for the language requirement.
2410,840576,1.0,5.0,Avoid him at all costs for 102. Unbelievably difficult for a 100 level lab requirement. Lectures are hard to follow. Everyone I know failed the last exam and he never curves them. Unless you're truly interested in astrophysics (which is the majority of the class material) find another lab to take.
2411,840576,5.0,4.0,"Jack is an amazing professor. He cares a lot, and contrary to what others think, he understands the struggle certain students have with physics. If you seek him out he's always willing to help out. On top of that, he's super down to earth and is completely relatable, especially if you're a struggling student. His classes are tough, but worth it."
2412,840576,5.0,3.0,"Although his class is large (50 students), Professor Gallimore is willing to help you outside of class. Most of your grade is based on homework questions and textbook annotations. As long as you manage Moodle and Perusall you will be golden. Make friends in the class and labs, you will need help when homework questions get progressively harder."
2413,840576,2.0,5.0,Class is incredibly difficult for a 101 everyone is taking to knock out their lab science. Gallimore is far from understanding to students who may not be as gifted in the very hard physics behind this course. He will grade you hard and office hours offer little help. I can say he is my worst teacher I have ever had in my life.
2414,840576,4.0,4.0,"Definitely enjoyed my time in ASTR101. Jack is funny, reliable, intelligent, and understanding. The homework and quizzes are weekly and are tough but manageable. Take advantage of the 3night labs - 30 extra points (10 per lab) tacked on to your final grade are so worth it. Don't miss a day lab. Take notes &amp; laugh at his jokes and you'll be golden."
2415,840576,4.0,4.0,"Professor Gallimore is a great person, but not the greatest professor. The exams are difficult &amp; the lectures are a way easier version of the exams. However, the material can get confusing very quickly, but Gallimore is very accessible outside of class &amp; hilarious! His office hours are extremely helpful; you will do well if you go to these."
2416,840576,2.0,5.0,"Pros: He is incredibly hilarious, textbook is free Cons: does not often teach ASTR 101 and it shows, lectures are unproductive, bad at preparing you for tests, fails to explain key concepts, also he speaks ridiculously quietly during class as well Take another class for your lab requirement."
2417,840576,2.0,4.0,"He is clearly very knowledgable on the topic, however, he fails to connect with the student who has no previous astronomical knowledge. Many of the topics are breezed through with little explanation, and then tested on in confusing ways. The material itself is confusing enough, but it is made much more difficult by his teaching, or lack there of."
2418,840576,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gallimore is one of the best professors I've had! He's incredibly funny and intelligent, and explains concepts in a way that is both informative and engaging. Coming to class was so fun, I really looked forward to it."
2419,840576,5.0,3.0,Great guy. Enjoys teaching and has a passion for astronomy. Cracks some funny jokes in class too so things run fairly quickly. Do the reading and hw and you'll get an A.
2420,840576,1.0,4.0,"awful professor, i recommend you avoid astronomy 102 with him at all costs, that class made my life hell."
2421,840576,4.5,3.0,"probably one of the better professors at bucknell, you have to study a lot for tests but he's hilarious and makes class really interesting.  he keeps the class laughing the entirity of lecture"
2422,1969028,4.5,3.0,"This class has a very simple grading system: quizzes, participation and a 25 page group project marketing plan. Quizzes are everyday and make sure you read the book for it. Because of the quizzes there is not a final which I loved. I learned a lot from the class and really liked him as a professor!"
2423,2300804,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor!!! Show great interest in individual's learning.
2424,2300804,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors at Bucknell. Highly recommended.
2425,2300804,5.0,5.0,"She is really a huge critical thinker. This was a writing course that was mostly about physics. She cares about everyone. She grades papers very carefully according to the criteria she gives at the beginning of class. She pushed me to think further; although my grades were not good, I had a lot of deep thinking with her."
2426,2585481,5.0,3.0,Waka is easily one of the best professors the engineering department has. He is extremely helpful and friendly as well as very good at making class engaging and you truly enjoy going to learn about what he has to teach. Just do the work he asked and you will have a good time in the class.
2427,2585481,5.0,3.0,"Professor Waka is easily one of the best professors I've had. I was always excited to go to class, and the labs were always interesting and engaging. He's super knowledgeable and does great research for the campus. Wish I could take another class with him."
2428,2585483,5.0,5.0,"Professor Collins is awesome. I had him for Math 202 last semester and rn I'm sitting at home on summer break remembering how kind he was! He would do trivia and make jokes. I really hated the homework, but he made lecture interesting. Only class that ever had me engaged and not daydreaming."
2429,2585483,3.0,4.0,"Professor Collins is a great, funny guy. However, his teaching style didn't sit well with me. He is very smart, which makes it hard for him to dumb down concepts for his students. Overall, I'd say I pretty much taught myself through the textbook and didn't get too much out of his lectures. Be ready to put the work in if you want a good grade."
2430,2585483,5.0,5.0,Great professor!!!!!!
2431,2585483,5.0,4.0,"Requires a lot of independent studying, but makes homework groups and encourages collaboration for homework. Weeks quizzes and homework assignments, so you have to have an organized study plan. Overall I learned a lot and am glad he was my professor."
2432,2585483,1.0,5.0,This professor doesn't care for his students at all. All he wants to see out of his class is the fact that there is a standard curve with test scores. He was picked on throughout his childhood talks about the reason he became a professor is to get back at kids. He is so power hungry. On average I studied 10 hour for exams and still failed some.
2433,2659214,1.0,4.0,Prof Lefebrve is a very nice man but teaching is not his thing. Do not take this class at any costs.
2434,2659214,1.0,4.0,He goes through his lectures way too fast and doesnt explain topics thoroughly. Lots of textbook reading. Would not recommend.
2435,2659214,2.0,5.0,Very nice guy but his lectures were fast and confusing. Lots of textbook reading and his practice exams were nothing like the actual exams. The actual exams took most people 2.30 hours to 3 hours
2436,2659214,1.0,5.0,"Never did I think that a professor could make me dislike a class this much until this year. His teaching style is very different and he usually doesn't explain things in depth. I found that in order to do well in his class, you will end up having to teach yourself each topic throughout the semester."
2437,2659214,2.0,5.0,Very hard for me to learn with his style of teaching. He goes through lessons so quick and doesn't really explain. Also hate is forced participation thing it helps no one.
2438,2659214,1.0,5.0,Gives tests that are nothing like the practice exams.
2439,2659214,1.0,5.0,Don't take this class.
2440,2659214,1.0,5.0,I don't recommend taking his class.
2441,2659214,2.0,5.0,"Nice dude. However, the exams are super hard and the practice exams are nothing compared to the actual exam."
2442,2587543,5.0,4.0,Really helpful and sweet. Field trips were so fun and she tried to make the class interesting. Easy to understand and highly recommend taking one of her classes. 
2443,2587543,4.0,3.0,"Professor Chamberlin is super nice and personable! Coursework/lectures are very manageable, and understanding the labs is probably most important for getting a good grade."
2444,2587543,5.0,2.0,"I took geology for my lab credit but I loved Professor Chamberlin. She was very knowledgeable of her subject, and made the lectures as interesting and engaging as possible. Very fair and manageable workload, but you will gave to put in some effort for an A. The labs tend to be pretty tedious but overall good class with a great professor."
2445,1686428,5.0,2.0,"Such a great professor, I love his philosophy on teaching. Really wants to get to know students and is very accommodating. Class was very discussion based. I highly recommend him!"
2446,1686428,5.0,2.0,"Best professor ever! This man is so down to earth and he teaches his class with the desire to actually understand where his students are coming form and he actually values what each person has to say. The workload is very light and the class discussions are super intriguing. It can be easy to not participate, but that will largely impact grades."
2447,1686428,5.0,1.0,"One of the best professors I've had. Down to earth guy who understands the difficulties of student life. Always varies how he teaches. Light workload (daily writings and some essays), but you come away from the class with a ton of knowledge. Emphasizes learning for the sake of learning. If you do the work, you'll  get the A."
2448,1686428,4.0,1.0,Easy A! Homework due online for every class- essentially for completion not quality. Takes attendance every day but only counts for 10% of grade. Gives extensions very generously.
2449,1686428,5.0,2.0,"He is such a sweet soft spoken guy who really cares about his students.  You never have to read for class because there are no exams just discussions.  I found the material extremely boring, tedious, repetitive, and liberal.  If you put work into your writing you will get an A but if not then likely a B"
2450,1686428,4.5,1.0,"Definitely one of the best professors- kind, nice, helpful, fair grader... Allows and leads interesting student discussions. Most readings are easy to read, try and read all the required ones, papers are fairly graded.If you ask, he gives good feedback on projects/papers before submission. One of the best classes I've had at Bucknell."
2451,1686428,5.0,2.0,"Definately one of the best Professors at BU. Cares about the class. Not only do you learn the material but he allow it to be implemented in class. Really sweet, helpful in and out of class. Good deal of reading, most of it easily understandable. One of the most enjoyable classes taken!"
2452,1686428,5.0,1.0,"BEST PROFESSOR!! He is the sweetest, most understanding and helpful man at Bucknell. He really cares about his students and likes to get to know everyone. DEFINITELY take this class!! It was easy and fun!"
2453,1995679,3.0,1.0,Professor Khanna (Dr. Rags) is the man. Super energetic and really cares about the students. Very passionate about the material he teaches (power electronics). Stay involved in class.
2454,1995679,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Ragz is such a bro. He loves A Tribe Called Quest and GaN transistors and bridging the gap between next generation devices, like, what else could you want?"
2455,195488,1.0,3.0,More boring than the most boring person you have or will ever meet. Plays favorites. Not committed to teaching. Not too nice to minority students.
2456,195488,1.5,5.0,"awful teacher, doesn't care about anything.  He has tenure and truly could not care any less than he does.  Doesn't make any of of the tests for the class or any of the lesson plans. Basically just reads the book to you"
2457,195488,3.0,5.0,"He is a good man.  Let's get that out of the way.  He is always there to help you in his office hours.  In class he expects you to know as much a he does, and thus following him in class if very difficult.  You need to be ON TOP of reading to come close to succeeding with him.  It is very easy to get lost and not get back in the game."
2458,195488,4.0,2.0,"He is one of the those profs that if you actually listen to him (and ignore the boring tone of voice he uses), you can enjoy the class. People hate him because they fail the first test. My suggestion: don't be lazy! Review your notes and you'll get an A...I did."
2459,195488,1.0,4.0,"He's a nice guy but is a bad professor. If you take his class, you'll be on your own so don't do it because it's gonna be a waste of money, time and effort. He was nice when I went to ask him questions in his office, but it was still confusing and didn't help much either...I strongly suggest you NOT to take classes with him. Avoid him at all cost."
2460,195488,1.0,5.0,"Dude is the worst.  Don't take him if you expext what bucknell prides itself on...professors.  This guy acts as though he hates his life.  I don't blame him living in Lewisburg, PA and teaching Accounting is like watching paint dry."
2461,195488,2.5,5.0,I don't hate him but I don't love him.  He's always been nice when I went to his office hours but his directions aren't very clear.  and his tests are hard.  But he's not THAT bad....
2462,195488,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE WILLITS!!!!!!!!!! Incredibly unclear and boring, tests are way too hard and on stuff he never even remotely explained."
2463,195488,2.0,5.0,"it is true that this is an extremely difficult class, mostly due to the fact that willits isn't very helpful and doesnt teach very well in class.  HOWEVER. if you get through his class and go to him for advising on anything, he is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.   basically he can be an ass but if you get through his class he respects you"
2464,195488,2.0,5.0,no need to go to class just read the book- he doesn't teach anything
2465,195488,1.0,5.0,This man could quite possibly be the worst professor in the long and distinguished history of Bucknell University. He is extremely unclear and unhelpful. On the last class when evaluations were handed out his instructions were &quot;Write anything you want. I don't care what is written about me. I have tenure and am not going anywhere.&quot;
2466,195488,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher I had at Bucknell. Very Hard, yet doesn't teach during his lectures.  Anytime a question was asked during class he decided to ignore the question and ramble about some story about the 60s or 70s which had nothing to do with Accounting.  He's the reason I switched majors."
2467,195488,1.5,4.0,"Uninteresting, does not try hard to teach during lectures. Going to his office and asking him questions is like pulling teeth its so difficult to get him to explain something to you clearly!"
2468,195488,2.5,4.0,No Comments
2469,252852,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Voss is a very dedicated professor.  He pushes you with proofs and core concepts, which makes the class more difficult than with other professors. He will go out of his way to help you in office hours and is extremely clear at explaining concepts one-on-one. The class is a challenge, but worth it."
2470,252852,5.0,2.0,Professor Voss is an amazing professor. He really knows his stuff and will be very willing to go out of his way to help you. His tests can be tough but they are very fair. He is a pretty fair grader and his lectures are very clear.
2471,252852,4.5,1.0,He is a good teacher and his class is not hard at all.  If you took AB or BC calculus in high school this class will be a repeat of what you already did.  I hear he is great at giving help during office hours and people who visit him tend to do very well.
2472,252852,3.5,4.0,"The material can sometimes be tough and confusing causing students to stress out.  However, he is always willing to spend one on one time with each student and is easily accessible.  Wouldn't go out of my way to seek him, but I wouldn't be upset if I got him again."
2473,252852,5.0,4.0,"Can be tough, but very clear. Good guy."

2477,1962938,1.5,5.0,Most passive aggressive man on the planet. Just isn't a good teacher. Is never able to clarify his points and doesn't like when you ask him questions or challenge his thoughts. If asked for your opinion on a personal matter his answer would be you're wrong heres what you should think. I would avoid his classes at all costs. Save yourself the time. 
2478,1555396,5.0,3.0,"Lecture heavy class with weekly quizzes. However, grading is very straightforward, so if you take the time to understand the concepts in class, getting an A is very feasible."
2479,1555396,4.0,4.0,"This is my second class with her. Cindy is a great person. She may come off as intimidating at first, but she truly has the sweetest heart. Freshman year, I took Introduction to Accounting with her and was scared of her. Today, as a junior I can say that she is one of the best and most understanding professors. Advice: Get to know her!"
2480,1555396,3.0,4.0,She's a good teacher. Just be sure you know what you're taking about and really tried before you ask questions.
2481,1555396,4.0,3.0,Very caring teacher who knows what she is talking about.
2482,1555396,4.5,3.0,"Great woman, very clear in her teaching and you will learn a lot from her. Quizzes every week really help you learn the material. Very serious and no sense of humor but still a great professor."
2483,1555396,5.0,2.0,Great professor. Weekly quizzes force you to keep up with work and there are numerous opportunities for extra credit. Very well informed and if you go to class and keep up with assignment there is no reason you shouldn't get an A.
2484,1555396,4.5,3.0,Very stiff personality with not a huge sense of humor. Still a very fair professor and you will obtain a huge wealth of knowledge by taking her class. Highly recommend if you want to learn practical information you can use after college.
2485,1555396,4.0,4.0,"Some people might be turned off from the difficulty of her exams, but overall she is very nice and extremely well-versed in subject material.  Just make sure to study for exams.  She may not be 100% clear on her explanation of concepts the first time around but will always correct herself and help a student in need.  A very involved professor."
2486,1555396,3.0,5.0,"Not an easy professor.  You do learn a lot, and the class is valuable, but it's impossible to actually like Guthrie.  She takes everything WAY too seriously.  I swear she has zero sense of humor and doesn't know the meaning of the word fun.  I almost feel bad for her.  The woman needs to CHILL OUT."
2487,2051012,5.0,3.0,Dr. Penniman was knowledgable and helpful outside of class. One of my favorite professors I've ever taken and sparked an interest in Religious Studies. Could not recommend more.
2488,2051012,5.0,4.0,"Not an easy A by any means, yet 100% worth taking. Solid amount of reading. Prof. P has an incredible ability to lead in class discussions about anything remotely related to food and religion - be it feminism, race, ethics, communication, etc. No quizzes/exams, but expects high quality writing and activity in class."
2489,2051012,5.0,4.0,Second class with Penniman and he is AMAZING!!! Literally took this class because I saw he was teaching it. Signed up without even looking at the course description. So passionate about what he teaches and truly cares about his students. All around amazing professor and person.
2490,2051012,5.0,4.0,"Penniman is a wonderful professor. Very caring and open in class and encourages people to come talk to him about any problems they have. He is also great at answering emails in a short period of time. He is probably one of the toughest graders I have ever had, but his feedback does help loads. Would definitely take a class with him again."
2491,2051012,5.0,3.0,Professor Penniman's class was fantastic. We really delved into the topics and he's very enthusiastic about what he is teaching. He does assign a lot of  reading but it is very interesting and easy to follow along. Class discussion is very important in his class. He is great and really takes the time to help his students explore religious texts.
2492,2051012,4.5,4.0,"Amazing group discussions. Probably the best part of my day every day that semester. The readings are interesting and cover a wide breadth of material, even reading material from a Jewish trans professor. Seriously, GREAT course! Only thing is that it is a lot of work for a 100-level course and you have to really work for the A."
2493,2051012,5.0,2.0,"Penniman is the man.  Really engaging, loves what he is teaching and you can get alot out of his class if you do the readings for each class which are usually 10-20 pages.  He also gives great feedback and really brought the best out in my writing"
2494,2051012,5.0,3.0,My favorite professor by far! He's always helpful. This was my first religion class and am now honestly considering turning it into a minor. He makes his class extremely interesting and he doesn't believe in tests or quizzes so just essays and reading prompts.
2495,756678,3.0,3.0,"Professor Rovnyak's exams were very straight forward and very similar to the problems we did in class. If you took time to take good notes and read the textbook the class wasn't too bad, but you do have to take the time and do the work to find success. His teaching style isn't that straight forward, though. Really nice and understanding guy overal!"
2496,756678,4.0,2.0,"Rovnyak presents material in a straightforward manner and is clear about expectations for the course. I have found it hard to stay awake in lecture, but as long as you do the readings and stay on top of the work you can do well in the class. Overall great Professor, take him for Gen Chem if you can."
2497,756678,4.5,3.0,"Rovnyak is a great guy that really wants everyone to do well. He is extremely helpful in office hours and is willing to work around your schedule to help out! I would definitely recommend reading the book, his multiple choice questions are tricky."
2498,756678,5.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher! Funny, brilliant, helpful. Everything you could ask for. It's a bit challenging at points, but that's chemistry. Rovnyak explains things so well and will even stop in the middle of a lecture to answer anyone's questions. Extremely helpful in office hours as well. Highly recommended."
2499,756678,4.5,3.0,"Quizzes are really hard, he asks questions about things he doesnt really explain (reading the textbook for quizzes DEFINITELY helps). Exams are easy if you do the optional problems he assigns. Homework is online and annoying. He is a good guy, approachable, and good at explaining things in office hours. Lab is a pain."
2500,756678,4.5,2.0,"Rovnyak is the best chem prof. Not only will you learn the material, but he is fair and challenging. Not an easy A, especially when you start talking about quantum mechanics, but he is 100% willing to help you do well (if you put in the time). Quizzes are challenging, tests are easy and based on end of ch. problems. No matter the prof, lab sucks."
2501,756678,5.0,2.0,"Rovnyak is a great guy! He is very helpful and he enjoys getting to know the students. His enthusiasm in and out of the classroom is contagious.  If you attend recitation he will love you forever. He may be a bit of an awkward guy, but he makes us laugh even at 8am. I highly recommend him!"
2502,756678,4.5,2.0,As long as you keep up with lecture notes and study for quizzes/exams the class is definitely manageable. Rov is devoted to his students and always easy to contact. Definitely recommend over other 201 profs
2503,756678,4.5,4.0,"I agree with everyone else. I took Gen Chem because I had to and I never was interested but Rov was the man. He was a great lecturer, an easy yet fair grader, and was there for his students. He really cares about the material and is a stand up guy. Highly recommend"
2504,756678,3.5,4.0,"I found his class hard to stay awake for, but then again it was an 8am. He was really helpful and willing to make appointments around your schedule. Most of all he was just such a nice, genuine guy and really wants you to understand chemistry because he thinks its the best thing in the world."
2505,756678,5.0,2.0,rov is freakin awesome!!  he made chem interesting...coming from an antichem person that means a lot.  he puts cartoons up before lecture and says some corny jokes but is totally awesome!!  I LOVE HIM!!
2506,750537,2.5,3.0,"He's definitely there for you, but you may get an email 3 hours before class outlining the homework... He responds well to feedback though, so don't be afraid! He's a great person!"
2507,750537,2.0,1.0,"Prof Grant is enthusiastic and truly loves what he does. His class is engaging and fun, but he can be hard to follow at times."
2508,750537,4.0,1.0,Gary is a great professor. He knows his stuff and you can have a really interesting time in his class. He can be very scatterbrained so it is important to always clarify about due dates and assignment specifics but it's not hard to pass this class. He has been here a long time and deserves a lot of respect. Get to know him.
2509,750537,2.5,1.0,Easy professor and has a lot to learn. His class is a lot of fun. Just put effort into all the work and you will do fine. It is an introductory course to acting and improv so you really can't fail as long as you show him you have made an attempt. He's a really great teacher to get to know throughout your time here at Bucknell.
2510,750537,4.0,1.0,"Discovery of the Expressive Self was a very easy class. Those of us who did the simple journal entries got As, everyone else (even if they were terrific actors) got Bs or Cs. Professor Grant can go all over the place and is a bit scatterbrained when it comes to assignments (and he has a man-crush on Sam Shephard), but he definitely knows his stuff!"
2511,750537,1.5,2.0,He is a great guy and an awesome person...but when it comes to teaching he is all over the place and out there to the extreme that he can be hard to follow
2512,750537,3.5,2.0,"Really nice guy, through and through. A little flighty and absent-minded...which makes him even more lovable. Took freshman seminar and rise to realism with him... fun classes. seminar = REALLY EASY while realism had a lot to keep track of..many due dates. Keep on top of it. I LOVE GARY. He's really an experience. Lots of fun and interesting work"
2513,750537,4.5,4.0,Modernism in Performance and Applied and Interactive  Theatre were the best classes I took in all my life.
2514,750537,4.0,3.0,"One of the more brilliant professors at Bucknell.  At times, he's almost too brilliant and unable to really get his point across to his students on that important level of connection, but otherwise, while never the easiest of classes, he always offers the most intellectually stimulating ones."
2515,383946,2.0,3.0,"A good guy and knowledgeable about the content, but I do not recommend taking your Seminar in Literary Theory with him. You'll be assigned huge amounts of dense theory to read but you'll never efficiently go over this stuff in class. He seemed disappointed in the class's participation/understanding, but never tried to fix his method of delivery."
2516,383946,5.0,3.0,Professor Drexler is not only a very competent English teacher but also a very great human being. He is the only one who's cared for me as much as anyone else since I came here. He is encouraging and helps in any way he can.
2517,383946,5.0,2.0,"Drexler was a great professor. Smart, kind, helpful. He chooses interesting readings and doesn't assign too much work at all. Made me look at fiction completely differently."
2518,383946,4.0,2.0,"he didn't give a lot instruction before you had to write a paper, but he made revisions with him mandatory and you could do as many as you wanted until acceptable. reading is done through a website and annotations are required and can be seen by him. reading due every week, 3 papers, and a final project. no grade given until end of semester."
2519,383946,1.0,3.0,"Drexler is an arrogant, self-obsessed braggart who thinks that making controversial comments is the equivalent to a philosophical discussion. Despite attending every class and getting an A on all of my assignments, he tried to give me a B- because I wasnt afraid to verbally disagree with him in class. The discussions were frivolous and useless."
2520,383946,5.0,3.0,"Good Professor, really gets into the material. Loves to help his students in anyway he can."
2521,383946,5.0,1.0,"Professor Drexler was one of my favorite teachers at Bucknell. Fever, Fantasy and Desire totally changed the way I understand language, how it informs our culture and structures the pscyhe. He has really insightful things to say, and the discussions always made me think. Definitely recommend."
2522,383946,5.0,5.0,Dr. Drexler helped me learn how to think critically about the world around me and literature. He also taught me how to write to a scholarly audience.
2523,383946,4.0,1.0,Drexler by far one of the easiest Professors. I had him for my foundation seminar and he made us write an eight page essay which he never read or graded. His only goal was to make you more comfortable with public speaking. 
2524,383946,1.5,2.0,"Such a nice and caring guy, but he has no interest in what he is teaching, or if he does he is so montonous and impassioned. I feel like i havent learned anything. I feel like i wasted a class course doing nothing. Took public speaking with him, and I havent improved whatsoever. Easy class, but if you want to learn, dont take this class."
2525,383946,4.5,3.0,"One of the best professors at Bucknell. He may seem kind of too serious and harsh at first sight, but once you get to know him better, he's the nicest and the most understanding person ever, with a perfect sense of humor. He's demanding too, but if you  don't slack you'll be fine."
2526,383946,4.5,1.0,"This guy is fantastic. He cares so much about the development of his students. Top-notch guy. Believes in learning out of class as well as in. Rewrites are encouraged, and he provides ample feedback."
2527,383946,1.0,2.0,I was pretty disappointed. He doesn't have much passion or interest in what students think. Not the best Eng prof by a long shot. Take someone else!
2528,383946,1.5,1.0,Lackluster. Doesn't relate well to students. Avoid.
2529,383946,4.5,2.0,"You can pretty much sit in the back of the class, not read the assignments, and never speak, and still get an A (assuming you write a couple of good papers.) Not a captivating or fun professor."
2530,383946,4.0,4.0,No Comments
2531,383946,3.5,2.0,"a nice guy, material is just not very exciting, tough to get class engaged, fairly easy grader"
2532,383946,4.0,2.0,"Drexler's a real no non-sense hard ass but if your still standing when its all over, you can be damn sure you're a better writer than you were"
2533,383946,3.5,3.0,helped my writing. class was boringish.
2534,383946,2.0,4.0,No Comments
2535,383946,2.0,3.0,Was not very helpful in assisting on papers and assignments.  Assigned a lot of reading.
2536,271309,1.0,3.0,"In the beginning of the semester, I loved this professor with his passion for this class. However, he takes forever to grade and when he told everyone that he graded everyones essay, he did not grade mine and I emailed him about it and he said he would get on it and within 5 mins, he read my 8 page essay and gave me a BAD grade with 1 comment tbc"
2537,271309,1.0,4.0,"He came to every class unprepared (opened his slideshows then literally stood and talked about unrelated stuff for hours) and has no clue how to provide specific feedback on papers. I got C's and A's on my papers with no change in quality. He manages to be condescending AND totally unequipped to teach effectively. Not worth it, steer clear of him"
2538,271309,3.0,3.0,"Professor Mulligan is a really cool guy that tries to connect with his students by being very genuine. Once you get the hang of assignments, it is easy to do well in his class. He is more than open to going over papers and assignments before they are due. the lectures are very unproductive. could skip every class and do fine grade wise."
2539,271309,2.0,3.0,"Pros: Open professor (More than happy to talk on phone or email, discussions in class) - Flexible office hours - Open to working one on one on papers Cons: Lectures are boring and unstructured (seems to make it up on the spot) - Rarely discusses readings in depth - No idea how he grades (no rubric that makes sense) - Gives confusing advice"
2540,271309,4.0,4.0,"Mulligan is a good professor and is really knowledgeable. He expects a lot out of your assignments though and you kind of have to agree with his opinion a little, guys really liberal. But you never have to read for class."
2541,271309,3.5,3.0,this class was honestly the highlight of my yr. Very interesting in my opinion. Tough at first because he doesn't give writing prompts but instead makes you figure out what you need to write about. Meeting with him definitely turned my grades around. No tests except one in class essay (gives you the question ahead of time).Final paper is only 3pgs.
2542,271309,1.5,4.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR! One of the worst professors I have ever had. He goes on and on for long lectures and when you go in and meet with him he gives very little helpful instruction. He expects your writing assignments to match up to what he believes and marks down if it does not align. 1st time posting felt it was necessary.
2543,271309,3.0,3.0,"You don't have to pay attention in class at all, all he does is rant. Only graded things are 750 word essays, you get about one a week and its not too tough."
2544,271309,3.0,4.0,Very difficult at first but is good at teaching how to think geographically. First papers are very hard to do well on but meet with him and your grade will go up for sure. Class consists of hour long rants that are hard to follow. But overall the class isnt terrible
2545,271309,1.5,4.0,"Easily one of the worst professors i've ever had. Nice guy but rambles through hour long lectures that leave you feeling very confused. He doesn't explain anything in depth, yet expects you to be an expert on the material. He doesn't give prompts for his papers and makes you guess what it is he wants included. class avg on 1st paper was 70."
2546,271309,1.5,4.0,"Vague teacher. Does not explain any concepts, and answers any of your questions with a question. Did well up until the final paper where out of the blue he decided to give me my lowest grade in the class, effectively tanking my grade. Don't recommend him the class is pretty pointless!"
2547,271309,5.0,2.0,"I love him! He doesn't just hand out A's, but he really wants his students to succeed. He takes an interest in getting to now his students personally, and has offered me assistance not just with work related to that course, but with outside work too. That's the epitome of a great professor!"
2548,271309,2.5,3.0,"I love prof. Mulligan. Awesome guy. But he never took the time to thoroughly explain the abstract concepts in 211, yet expected each student to have a strong hold on them when writing papers. Love the professor, but wouldn't recommend this course."
2549,271309,4.5,3.0,"Professor Mulligan is awesome.  He loves the subject and it shows in his teaching.  Classes are generally interesting, and the work isn't too difficult."
2550,271309,3.5,2.0,Great professor! lectures are so interesting I love attending this class. Assignments for papers are interesting and fun to write. pretty easy grader too.
2551,271309,4.0,3.0,Prof Mulligan is an awesome professor! At first it is difficult to figure out his grading methods for papers but I got an A for the class once I did that. He drops the paper with the lowest grade too.
2552,271309,4.5,2.0,Cool guy who's helpful if you just e-mail or go see him - very approachable and understanding.
2553,271309,2.0,3.0,"He's a really cool guy, but his lectures are random and unorganized at times. He tends to repeat himself a lot, but he lets you know what is on the tests. He's a hard grader on both tests and papers."
2554,271309,1.0,5.0,"He needs to give a grading rubric. Watch out first few papers YOU WILL DO BAD! His grading is very unclear. It took an entire semester in order for me to go from getting F's to getting A's. If you are new to his classes he grades your papers very hard, if your takin him for a second time, vice versa"
2555,271309,1.0,5.0,"He is the most subjective grader. He classified me as a C paper and my friend as an A paper writer. For 2 papers we did, just to prove this point, I put my name on my friends and his name on mine, and I got a C and my friend an A. The name on the paper is what determined the grade, not the quality."
2556,271309,4.5,2.0,"Has a lot to say and is very interesting.  Loves Ireland, and is a very cool guy. There are lots of papers, but he prepares us very well and gives very helpful comments. His tests are challenging, but he gives lots of help."
2557,271309,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2558,271309,4.0,2.0,"REALLY redundant teacher.  Obsessed with Ireland, but pretty easy.  Lots of writing, reading.  Rarely keeps you for the full 1 1/2 hours- more like 45 max. Very nice man."
2559,1903566,5.0,5.0,GREAT! Very challenging but always willing to help. I would take her for any course in the ECON Dept
2560,1903566,3.0,1.0,Not the greatest professor but also not too bad.  Very easy class though so you don't really need to greatest prof. to understand the material and with her it should be an easy A
2561,1903566,3.0,4.0,"If you have Professor Hassane and dont really grasp Econ easily, I recommend going to a study group. She assigns a lot of reading but doesnt go over all of it in class but trust me.. all of it will be on the exams. The pop quizzes shouldnt be hard if you did the assigned reading. She wasn't a bad professor but I wouldnt take her again."
2562,1903566,3.0,3.0,"Read the chapters when assigned,  but her lectures tend to only focus on one or two points from the text, while quizzes and tests encompass all of it. There is a problem set once a week, pop quizzes 1-2 times a week, and 4 tests. Join a study group and do the practice problems at the end of each chapter and you will be fine."
2563,1903566,5.0,1.0,"Great professor, loved her"
2564,1903566,3.0,2.0,"Prof Hassane is very funny and sweet. She can be disorganized sometimes, and tends to cancel class or assignments on a whim. If you go to office hours her class is easy, she is really helpful and will basically give you the answer. Attendance is not mandatory, but she does give pop quizzes so be careful not to miss them."
2565,1629135,5.0,3.0,Very nice and fair professor. Cares about your learning.
2566,1629135,3.5,3.0,On the whole she's a nice teacher but class is all lecture and discussion on the readings.  If you're really into the subject then you'll like her but I found her style dry.  She's a fair test giver and grader.
2567,400340,5.0,3.0,"Public speaking. Nerve-wracking in nature, but offered lots of encouragement and positive critique. By the end of the course, my speaking skills improved drastically. She really cares about her students and expressed her gratitude for our regular participation and willingness to share personally with her and our classmates. Very meaningful course."
2568,400340,5.0,3.0,"Professor Zimmerman is incredibly passionate about literature, which really shows in her teaching. She is an engaging professor who cares about her students and what they have to say. I can't wait to take more classes with her!"
2569,400340,4.5,1.0,"The class was very good! I really wanted to learn more about the Victorian literature, and the class was amazing. She is very nice and really passionate about what she teaches."
2570,400340,2.5,2.0,"She likes everyone who constantly participates. If you're not the kind of person who likes to be REALLY active in class participation, your grade will probably be lower than you'd get otherwise. I thought she goes so. freaking. slowly. She's really not a horrible grader at all, though. Essay comments are rather unhelpful..."
2571,400340,3.0,3.0,"She's super nice...I just personally, as a science major, don't like the way the class is structured. I feel like I never learn anything...because I don't. She's pretty interesting though."
2572,400340,5.0,2.0,"I am a science major and her english class is my only class that I always look foreward to going to. She is a lot of fun, and the discussions that she leads, and even the ones she lets students lead, are very interesting.  She is really helpful when it comes to writing papers and gives you lots of feedback.  Will definitely try to take again."
2573,400340,5.0,1.0,No Comments
2574,400340,3.0,1.0,"She is very passionate about what she teaches and the class is overall very easy, however, her comments on graded papers are confusing and misleading. If you participate in class you will most likely do well."
2575,400340,4.0,2.0,She is very passionate about what she teaches. She loves Harry Potter. Papers are easy to write and she is happy to give you the benefit of the doubt.
2576,271318,1.0,4.0,I'm sorry but this professor is awful.  You have a TON of work to do outside of class- endless readings and papers.  In class all you do is sit there and listen to her ramble for 50 minutes.  She is very unclear about how well you're doing in the class and incredibly critical.  Overall there is simply too much work for a freshman writing seminar. 
2577,271318,1.5,4.0,"awful class. a LOT of reading that you never really do anything with, many, MANY unecessary 10 page papers, and daily journal entries and projects and tests on top of that. grades hard, really boring class. potentially interesting topic, but does nothing to help your writing or your gpa."
2578,271318,1.5,2.0,"EH! She gives too much work for an irrelevant and pointless class. she overburdens you with busy work and reading, often piling on two response papers with 20+pages of reading that youll never talk about, and an 8 page paper for the same day. then she gives an exam on the reading that was never discussed. the class is also abnormally boring and bad"
2579,271318,3.0,2.0,Be prepared to be bored out of your mind.  She's VERY into feminist interpretations of the Bible.  Don't take this class if you want to spew New Testament interpretation.  Doesn't seem to know a ton about what she's teaching- totally a gradeschool teacher
2580,777175,5.0,3.0,"Very helpful and would have been one of my favorite teachers, just such boring readings. Lots of them too. She makes them as bearable as possible and if you are interested in the subject you will adore her. "
2581,777175,5.0,3.0,Super nice lady. You must participate. Need to read. Four quizzes that are kinda tough but if you pay attention you will do well. If you put in a decent effort you will do well. Lots of reading. Interesting content. Great lady would take again. 
2582,777175,1.5,1.0,she is boring. she missed half of the classes and we had to watch movies and write papers
2583,777175,4.5,2.0,Gives really good feedback on essays and writing assignments
2584,777175,4.5,2.0,"She's fair, clear and the material is generally interesting. I highly recommend taking a class with her."
2585,777175,5.0,4.0,"Papers are hard, but the films are great and defi changed the way I watch film. Love Bollywood now. Prof is nice and helpful, responds quickly to email. Also, ask her to write all Hindi terms on the board: nice view!"
2586,777175,5.0,2.0,She is a great professor.  I thought this class was very interesting and changed the way I look at any film now.  I would defi recommend this class.
2587,777175,5.0,1.0,She is an awesome professor.  She is really nice and really helpful.  The class is easy and really interesting.  I would 100% take this class all over again. Best class ever!!!!
2588,777175,5.0,2.0,"so so so so soooo nice. class could be a little boring at times but it's not really her fault. if you go to office hours, which should be unnecessary, she is very helpful and understanding. class is basically like four papers the whole semester and not very much of other assignments. tubular!"
2589,777175,5.0,1.0,"Islam was a great class and Prof McLain is a great prof.  I would defi encourage people to take her.  She is very helpful and really nice.  She is also easy when it comes to giving out assignments and papers.  She will only have you write things that you have talked in class, so if you attend her class, you will defi get a good grade."
2590,777175,5.0,2.0,Prof McLain is really available outside of class -- seeing her for help raised my grade. And she's really into comic books -- you should see how many she has in her office!
2591,756713,4.0,3.0,Professor Traflet is a great professor who certainly cares about her students. She is very focused on improving writing skills and provides a ton of feedback on papers. Class is mostly lectures and discussion based but the lectures are enjoyable and relevant.
2592,756713,3.0,3.0,Lectures were boring. Gave a good amount of work but nothing too hard.
2593,756713,3.0,2.0,"boring lectures, but nice professor.  exams are decent and she is a lenient grader"
2594,756713,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher.  Although this class was only a half credit, I learned more about stocks, bonds, and other financial securities than I ever imagined.  She always had relevant examples and she is a lenient grader if you work hard and show interest. Go to class, it's certainly worth it."
2595,756713,5.0,3.0,One of my favorite Professors at Bucknell. Take one of her classes!
2596,756713,4.5,3.0,Couldn't find a nicer and more genuine person.  She's awesome and comes into class with great MODERN up to date examples.
2597,756713,4.0,2.0,No Comments
2598,756713,5.0,2.0,"Very clear about expectations, gives feedback on progress, has a few projects that take time, but you learn a lot"
2599,1838058,1.0,1.0,"Personality: Laughable, incredibly rude, knows no boundaries. Teaching: Not clear whatsoever. Communication between her and her TAs is absolutely awful. She won't ever have a set schedule of the semester. She'll tell you one set of instructions and then completely follow the opposite. She uses GR..."
2600,420845,4.0,4.0,"*Edited Review* I now realize that, while he was an undoubtedly harsh grader, it was to make us more critical writers. I was angry because, up until his class, I got away with reciting facts and posing arguments with clear answers. However, he doesn't accept that -- he makes you try and argue very difficult points. And I am now thankful for that. "
2601,420845,3.0,5.0,"Doesn't assign much reading for class, but contribution to the class discussion matters. Not a bad lecturer, but hates technology and refuses to use it. My main problem with him is that he has no real clear grading guidelines for the papers, and grades them very harshly. After finishing his class, I still have no idea what he looks for in a paper."
2602,420845,5.0,4.0,"I've taken 2 classes with Prof Goodale now and have nothing but good things to say about him. His main objective as a teacher is to engage with his students, and truly wants to share his knowledge of history with them. His classes have 3 assigned papers, that's it. The reading is usually very interesting and directly related to the class."
2603,420845,5.0,3.0,"Professor Goodale is a talented teacher who offers keen insight and really helps his students develop their writing capabilities. His gives fascinating lectures, which are enhanced by his strange and witty modern day connections. He certainly knows how to teach an interesting class and help his students improve their writing abilities."
2604,420845,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Goodale is very passionate about helping his students grow. He can be a tough grader, but it has improved my writing tremendously. He is extremely well versed and dedicated to his subject area which makes his lectures interesting and engaging. One of the best professors I've ever had."
2605,420845,5.0,3.0,"Take him, you won't regret it."
2606,420845,5.0,4.0,"Pros: Absolutely hilarious, knowledgeable, really cares about his students, fascinating readings Cons: Lots and lots of reading, can be a tough grader (only because he genuinely wants you to get better at writing. My writing has gotten loads better after just one course with him) HIGH RECOMMENDATION"
2607,420845,5.0,2.0,goat
2608,420845,5.0,2.0,"Professor Goodale is a great lecturer / professor. If you show up his class without reading, you probably wouldn't learn anything, but if you choose to read, it will be the best class you can take at bucknell. He really cares about student and tries to help student to improve writing"
2609,420845,5.0,4.0,"Professor Goodale is passionate and engaging, all while caring immensely about the successes of his students. He takes the time to give thoughtful feed back on all essays and makes what could be boring material exciting and interesting. Overall, he is an amazing professor and is willing to help students succeed no matter what."
2610,420845,5.0,3.0,"Professor Goodale was a thoroughly engaging professor and I grew to like his class a lot. While his subject of expertise is a little off the beaten track, he teaches with passion and I never had a boring day."
2611,420845,5.0,3.0,"He is very unconventional (doesn't use ppt or technology in general), but he is by far one of my favorite professors. He knows his subjects inside and out and he truly wants to show you the significance of the events that took place. I would highly recommend any class he teaches"
2612,420845,4.0,2.0,"Very far left, and extremely opinionated, but super engaging.  Easy to get good grades."
2613,420845,5.0,3.0,"had him not for history but for pol theory (2 courses)- one of my two very favorite professors at bucknell.  anticipated hating pol theory but ended up loving it (and am now working on a phd in it-- thanks to him!).  extremely engaging, knows his stuff, and kept class very much discussion oriented.  great personality as well, and a keen wit."
2614,420845,5.0,3.0,He is good.
2615,420845,5.0,3.0,"great teacher, makes boring stuff fun. papers arent killer but they arent easy either."
2616,1590254,3.0,4.0,"He is a very nice and funny person. He is overall a decent professor who cares about the success of his students. His class is very difficult though, especially for an ecology course. The questions on exams/quizzes are very challenging with often a lot of answers that seem could be correct but somehow are not. Just be prepared for difficult exams. "
2617,1590254,2.0,3.0,"He's a bit scatterbrained but is caring and always entertaining. Research seems super cool and he frequently draws from it in lecture. Lectures are pretty useless, but I enjoyed the course."
2618,1590254,5.0,2.0,funny mfer. FUN getting him on tangents. Loves this school but also acknowledges its problems &amp; I think thats important + admirable. Big believer in the liberal arts. Lectures you about reading your emails but doesnt answer his class was discussion based which was great to have after 2 lecture heavy classes. I loved him and def recommend!!
2619,1590254,5.0,4.0,"Hands down one of my favorite professors at Bucknell. Dr. Jordan is super knowledgeable and really invested in helping students succeed. Make use of office hours bc his classes aren't easy, but well worth the effort."
2620,1590254,5.0,2.0,Talk to Prof Jordan and develop a relationship with him. He's super caring and loves his students. Don't be afraid to disagree with him because he will challenge you but not take it personally. My favorite professor at Bucknell and I learned so much from him.
2621,1590254,4.0,2.0,"Super nice guy, easy to get off-topic, but overall is easy to talk to and helps out if you need anything"
2622,1590254,5.0,4.0,Really nice guy and a good teacher. Not always very organized and doesn't consistently respond to emails so sometimes you have to go to his office hours (which are super helpful)
2623,1590254,4.0,4.0,"Really accessible prof, excited and passionate about the course material, goes off on tangents from time to time and not great at answering emails promptly but is super helpful during office hours"
2624,1590254,3.0,4.0,He was a cool lab prof. The problem was more his TA who was super hard. There was a big miscommunication of the 208 crew this past semester and it really showed. Problem with Jordan was you would send him emails and sometimes he wouldn't answer. Was willing to help if you got an answer.
2625,1590254,5.0,4.0,"have him now, great prof"
2626,1590254,5.0,3.0,"Nice understanding prof. Do the readings, participate in class, work hard and you'll be fine"
2627,1590254,5.0,4.0,Professor Jordan expects a lot but is available to students. He's a funny engaging lecturer and passionate about his work. Highly recommend!
2628,1590254,5.0,4.0,Professor Jordan is a great dude. Challenging but very accessible. I learned an incredible amount and really enjoyed the class
2629,1590254,5.0,3.0,"Has high standards for his students, I learned a lot. Great guy"
2630,1590254,5.0,4.0,Great prof great class. I worked hard and learned a ton.
2631,1590254,5.0,3.0,"Disappointed by the outdated, misleading reviews for Dr. Jordan. He has high expectations for his students but is very committed to helping them succeed. Really knows his stuff and is a passionate and enthusiastic teacher. I learned a ton and really grew as a student. Would absolutely recommend!"
2632,1590254,1.5,4.0,Jordan is not a bad guy but his 208 class has not been an enjoyable experience. His tests are unclear and hard to do well on. He also is fixated with plagiarism is very quick to accuse students of wrongdoing. DEFINITELY AVOID THIS CLASS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.
2633,1590254,4.0,3.0,He's a super amazing professor. A lot of reviews on here are really old and outdated. He's super helpful during office hours and loves seeing his students really dive into the material. He's also really willing to work with his students if you have any concerns. He's super down to earth and a really fun professor. I would recommend him to anyone.
2634,1590254,1.5,2.0,"Professor Jordan is such a nice guy and a great person. He is very quirky and keep class interesting. That being said, he is NOT fit to be a teacher. He trips over his own words and confuses himself with things that he says. You're better off just reading the textbook or taking another teacher. He is also terrible at responding to emails on time."
2635,1590254,3.0,3.0,"He tries to help students understand but he often gets confused and does not know the full answer.  He is nice, but also kind of country.  He tries not to offend anyone, but it often seems like he is stepping on egg shells.  His exams are pretty specific and focus more on details than than the broader concepts."
2636,1590254,1.5,5.0,"Professor Jordan was my least favorite biology professor at Bucknell. His tests were very hard to do well on. Even if you answered a question correctly, he wouldn't give you full credit if someone else in the class answered it ""better"" than you. He brings in some political biases into the classroom as well. Lectures were often tangential."
2637,1590254,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Jordan expects A LOT from his 300 level students. His tests are super hard, but there is a substantial amount of other class work that acts as a booster for your grade. I don't think I have ever learned so much in a class before at Bucknell"
2638,1590254,4.0,3.0,A nice professor. Goes of on tangents a lot but they are usually pretty interesting. Class is hard to miss just because you learn a lot in every class
2639,1590254,3.5,3.0,"truly cares about his students- go to office hours when he assigns a paper- he is a tough grader on written assignments.  gets very off topic, but the tangents make class infinitely more interesting and thought provoking"
2640,1590254,1.5,5.0,"would not explain the material on his slides when students would ask him questions, rarely approachable outside of class, often yelled at the class, compassionate for his work, but did not care to help students learn, short tempered, worst professor i have had"
2641,1590254,4.0,3.0,"Liked the class a lot.  Good Prof., friendly and approachable.  Helpful during lab.  Helped spark my interest in ecology."

2644,1117165,5.0,4.0,Over the top funny. Thanks for a great two semesters!
2645,1117165,2.0,3.0,his class was so boring. he doesnt take attendance but you definitely need to go in order to keep up with the material. all he does is lecture while you take notes and he will call on you for answers so pay attention..........
2646,1117165,5.0,4.0,Nice job Bucknell. Found a good one and kept him around for 3 months.
2647,1117165,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor. makes class fun and is funny. Very helpful and makes everything easy to understand. He should definitely not be the one in this department leaving!
2648,1117165,5.0,4.0,Learned as much about life as accounting. Shame they could not keep this one.
2649,1117165,5.0,4.0,Usually walk out laughing or smiling. Watch out for the exams though.
2650,1117165,5.0,2.0,Great professor
2651,1117165,5.0,4.0,Wow! Where did they find this one. An accounting professor who can actually teach! Funny and interesting.
2652,1117165,5.0,4.0,Wow! Where did they find this one&#63; An accounting professor who can actually teach! Funny and helpful. I recommend.
2653,2446320,3.0,3.0,"Great class, really passionate professor. I just wish there was more lecture. Her style of assessment ( 5 in class quizzes, writing assignments, take home finals) is exactly my jam, I just wish I'd had a little more guidance on what we should focus on. Still, I had an ok time making up that gap with office hours. Very accessible, glad to talk."
2654,2446320,4.0,3.0,Very nice lady and genuinely cares about what she's is teaching. She's approachable and happy to work with you if you need extra help. She encourages class discussion and gets kids thinking. I certainly learned a lot about Latin America.
2655,312301,1.5,5.0,"Never wrote a book, yet he's chairman of the dept at BU He did NOT ' get '  2/2 of my papers and gave me a D. I wrote a 3rd paper and asked him to change me to pass / fail. He did NOT read , and left me with a D.  An end note.   40 years later, my writings have brought me royalty checks from Europe.    Payne has nothing on amazon or google."
2656,312301,1.0,4.0,"was no help in understanding Shakespeare. made me hate the subject matter. sure, he can talk quietly for hours, but about what &#63; If you criticise the subject matter, the best you get is a C"
2657,312301,4.5,1.0,"really sweet man, really easy A. you don't have to go to class... you don't even have to read the plays or participate. if you want to be challenged don't take him. i loved him... he's very intelligent, kinda funny, and loves shakespeare. so easy."
2658,312301,5.0,2.0,"he is the best. i love him. he's so cute and sweet. he's also smart. people say he is easy, and he is, but it's because hes nice and doesn't try to f with people. he's a good guy, if you take him, you'll love him too"
2659,312301,3.0,1.0,"His Shakespeare course is so easy, TAKE IT. I went to class 3 times (the first day, once for the midterm, and one last time for the final) and I pulled an easy A without even reading ONE PLAY. He loves to mutter to himself, but he's so helpfully easy, I love it."
2660,312301,5.0,2.0,"Foundation on Darwin, Marx, Nietzche, and Freud...Really lenient grader.  I got an A and I slacked off like crazy."
2661,312301,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2662,2446326,1.0,4.0,"He could not teach. Know so many people that had to drop because of him. Was not clear in teaching, and pretty much tried to say exactly what the textbook was saying (so you didnt have new examples to look at). He would also go part way through an example, decide it was too much work to do, and just move on. AVOID."
2663,2407415,5.0,1.0,Just the best ever.
2664,2407415,5.0,1.0,"he is the best teacher ever so funny, so entertaining, and so understanding he will do anything to help you succeed. he rocks."
2665,2407415,5.0,1.0,The best teacher I have ever had here.
2666,2407415,5.0,3.0,The best professor I have ever had at Bucknell. He truly cares about his students and wants everyone to succeed. He makes lectures super interesting and fun and makes sure to keep everyone engaged. He memorized everyones name in the entire class during the first week of the semester (120 students). He is really great.
2667,2407415,5.0,2.0,Awesome professor- Tells you exactly what you need to know for exams. Didn't use textbook once. Made class interesting and funny. Overall great guy
2668,2407415,5.0,3.0,"This is one of the best professors I've ever had. He is the most personable individual and makes a class that should be boring for non-majors one of the most interested classes I've taken. He truly cares about his students and makes the content on the tests very clear beforehand. If you need to fulfill your lab science, take bio with Steinberg"
2669,2407415,5.0,2.0,"Professor Steinberg is one of the best Professors I've ever had at any level of academia. He totally understands how to resonate with large bodies of students, and his approach to teaching biology for non-majors was spot on. If you need a lab science, this is the man to fulfill that requirement with."
2670,1074168,3.0,4.0,Prof Boomer is a hard grader but very nice and passionate about stats. She is a bit awkward but will help you if you go to office hours and write down questions that you have to ask.
2671,1074168,4.0,4.0,"She is a really kind and caring Professor. Though Professor Boomer is not the best when it comes to explaining things, with that being said if you try hard enough you should be able to do fine in class."
2672,1074168,2.0,4.0,"She's a really nice professor, but her flipped classroom layout is a disaster. Video lectures are often unclear or ambiguous, and there is no way to ask questions unless you write them down. Homework doesn't take too long, but tests are extremely long and difficult for 52 minutes. You must study a lot to have any chance of passing the tests."
2673,1074168,3.0,5.0,"Very passionate about stats, but the good parts of her class ends there. Extremely tough grader, specific classroom rules about bathroom use and tardies, difficult tests and EXTREMELY difficult labs. Focuses a lot on writing in labs and tests which I respect, but the specificity required is over the top and far too difficult. Avoid if possible."
2674,1074168,4.0,3.0,"I love professor Boomer! She is really nice and understanding and connects with her students -- however, this does not mean she is an easy professor. Get ready to work, but you will learn a lot."
2675,1074168,1.0,5.0,"This teacher is going to get bucknell into a lot of trouble one day. Her actions are totally unethical. For example, going to the BATHROOM can negatively impact your grade! Students have complained to deans, but nothing helps. It is very sad to see bucknell going in this direction and I hope they correct this behavior one day"
2676,1074168,1.0,5.0,"If you want to fail, take this professor. She does not want students to succeed. She rarely curves exams, the course is basically graded on ""who knows minitab the best,""she has way to many rules that simply are not beneficial nor effective to a productive learning environment. She is an awkward lady. Save yourself now, and do NOT take her course!!!"
2677,1074168,1.0,5.0,Avoid at all costs. This class is a lot of work and it will be the most stress-inducing course you will take the semester you take it.
2678,1074168,3.0,4.0,"Stat is super easy but she gives a ton of busy work in the form of labs.  Half the class is basically learning to use minitab.  Shes pretty weird but at the end of the day she does want students to succeed but if you're not passionate for math, she might not be the best prof to take."
2679,1074168,4.0,4.0,"This course overall was very difficult. However, I do believe that this professor is very informative and helpful and I learned quite a lot from this class. If you do choose to take a course with this prof, get ready for lots of labs, long homework assignments, and very tough grading."
2680,1074168,2.0,5.0,One of the hardest graders in the math department.  The amount of effort you put into homework/labs is not reflected in your grade.  The tests are HORRIBLE. The online portion can be as long as 4 hours and there is also an in-class portion.  She is the only professor that teaches this class so best of luck!
2681,1074168,1.0,4.0,Too smart a professor to actually understand how to teach her students. Unrealistic expectations without proper instructions. Could have learned everything taught by reading the textbook alone. Long and tedious labs. Lots of work. Very hard tests.
2682,1074168,3.5,5.0,only way to do well in Boomer's class is to visit office hours everyday. Tests are extremely difficult and projects are difficult and tedious. If you get stat with Boomer drop it immediately.
2683,1074168,5.0,3.0,"I found Prof. Boomer as a great professor with a lot of passion for statistics. Her class is not an ""easy A"" but if you work hard you will succeed. Most importantly, she is incredibly helpful, she makes a huge effort to help students understand the material."
2684,1074168,2.5,4.0,Boomer knows exactly what she is talking about but almost too well.  She is extremely difficult when it comes to grading and curves very little.  She takes off many points if you phrase one sentence even the slightest bit incorrectly.  It is very difficult to get an A and you should avoid taking her if you can.
2685,1074168,3.0,4.0,Boomer loves statistics plain and simple.  I don't know if anyone could love them more.  She seems like a very irritating teacher at first but she grows on you over time.  There is a ton of busy work/homework and the group project is terrible.  You had better be good at stats or have someone good in your group other wise it sucks.
2686,1074168,1.5,5.0,I took AP stats in high school and still did not feel prepared. The amount of time and effort I put into this class was not reflected in my grade at all. 
2687,1074168,1.5,5.0,"Grades your homework for accuracy, quiz every week, starts out easy, but becomes much harder, most of the class failed the second test."
2688,1074168,1.5,5.0,"Tough grader, specific with what she is looking for, office hours and email are the best way to ask for help. Lecture style is to print out skeleton powerpoints and have students fill in notes (not the most beneficial method). If asked a ""stupid"" question she will refer to some handout online, but not offer any specifics. "
2689,1074168,3.0,4.0,"Boomer is a sweetheart, but when it comes to grading she is incredibly tough and specific, helpful in office horsing over email, tests are incredibly hard, makes you know definitions, and the group project is very time consuming, notes are helpful and homework isn't too bad. "
2690,1074168,1.0,5.0,"The absolute worst. Unclear in her expectations and thinks that her students are only taking her class.  A LOT of work, and then, no matter how much time you put into the workproject, you still come out with a disappointing grade. Her unrealistic expectations will kill your grade.  Exams are impossible, harping on minutiadefinitions. AVOID!!!!!!!"
2691,1074168,4.0,3.0,"I found Professor Boomer to be a sweet and helpful lady.  She assigns homework in small, but daily doses and allows you to work in groups of 2-3 for hw.  The class itself is pretty boring I will admit and the project is hell no matter who you have.  She helped my group a lot with the project and makes herself available.  The tests are fair."
2692,1074168,1.5,3.0,"She was super nice, but not a very good instructor. Oftentimes in class, when a student had a question, she would just say that we would get to in the PowerPoint. No guarantees there. Not to mention, when she would attempt to answer a question, she wasn't always totally clear. Boomer is probably one of the worst professors I had at Bucknell."
2693,1074168,3.0,3.0,"Very nice lady, and conveyed the material relatively clearly. Her exams/ quizzes are not too difficult if you ask questions, review homework, and do the practice worksheets. However, the class project is KILLER, and the expectations were not always clear."
2694,1074168,3.5,3.0,"Thoroughly mediocre. The class content is not overly difficult, but she will grade you hard and give you a stupefying amount of work. Project will kill you. She is a sweet, available lady that is always available to help, but the sad truth is she just isn't that good at teaching. Avoid if possible, but not the end of the world if you get her."
2695,1074168,2.0,3.0,"Sweet lady, but not good at teaching. If it isn't on her slides, or something she's planned to say/answer, she can't help. Don't take her if you actually like math. But even if you don't like math, my advice: learn how to do well with her grading (rubric/ key words& phrases)."
2696,1074168,3.0,3.0,"Nice lady, difficult sometimes. Exams aren't quizzes, but the project will kill you. Not as bad as everyone makes her out to be."
2697,1074168,2.0,4.0,"A very nice lady, but an AWFUL professor.  She is willing and available for office hours and responds to e-mails very efficiently, but that does not make up for her lack of ability to teach.  She cannot relay the concepts well at all and assigns ridiculous projects and homework assignments that are useless.  Avoid taking her if it all possible."
2698,1074168,3.5,5.0,"She's really awkward and its pretty obvious she has no idea how to teach statistics. Although she may be very intelligent, her lack of teaching skill amuses me every other day in class. If attendance wasnt mandatory, i would just sit and read the textbook everyday instead of going to class. She is really nice and wants the students to learn though."
2699,1074168,4.5,3.0,"She's a great teacher and really willing to help outside of class. All of these other reviews are probably from people who weren't willing to try hard. People  can pass sat 216 by reading the book, so it must have been lack of effort. I think she's great!"
2700,1074168,1.5,5.0,"HORRIBLE! Boomer's mission is to make you work very hard and get a bad grade. Presentations and tests are graded as though this is an upper level math class, not a required course. If you are taking this class for a requirement (like everyone does!) take another teacher or get credit from a summer class. AVOID BOOMER!!"
2701,1074168,1.0,4.0,"Horrific teacher.... avoid at all costs!! She is very awkward while teaching and she doesn't convey concepts well... tests were always too long for the class period and even when you go to office hours for homework help you don't get a good score.  After my class's teacher reviews, I don't know how she is still here...."
2702,1074168,2.0,3.0,"She assigns homework that is redundant and requires you to spend so much time doing stuff you already know how to do (ex: calculating means from 25 values- takes up time, and simple). She doesn't know how to teach unless she is using what is exactly in the textbook. She tries to make stats fun, but bringing in props doesn't entertain kids over 6."
2703,1074168,1.5,5.0,"Avoid taking statistics with boomer! worst teacher I have ever had def at Bucknell, possibly in my life. She just stands in front of the room writing full sentences on the board, so you are bored and don't actually learn anything.  There is no class interaction. Homework/tests are hard.  a LOT of work for a 1.2 credit class! AVOID her at ALL costs!"
2704,1074168,1.0,4.0,very bad professor.  she can't explain the material that she teaches.
2705,2554877,5.0,2.0,"She is one of the better professors I have had at Bucknell. As long as you participate and give her the time a day in class, that positively reflected on my grade. If you display interest in the topic you are writing about to her she gives good grades. She also breaks down the writings for us so if you just do the work its impossible to do bad."
2706,2554877,5.0,2.0,"Prof Xydias overall was an ideal professor. The class didn't have tests, just essays, which she graded tougher than most - but considering it is the only thing she grades us on, it makes sense. If you need it, she is very friendly and willing to help. Her attendance policy was also very laid back and she is extremely understanding."
2707,2554877,2.0,3.0,"Professor Xydias has consistently failed to provided meaningful and substantive materials in class. 90% of what we discussed was content in the other 3 polisci foundational courses. The class only actually used one case study over the whole semester, so I legitimately learned nothing about how to compare different political systems."
2708,574471,1.0,5.0,"Had this guy for green utopia my senior year. Went to every single class, had B average on essays (he gave me an F on my first one because he thought I handnt read the book), but spoke only a couple times the semester. Guy gave me a C+ average due to class participation, even though I did extra credit. Stay away from this guy."
2709,574471,4.0,3.0,"Keitel is one of my favorites. Gets a bad name for politics; even though he and I don't agree politically, I have never felt uncomfortable in his classes and it has never affected my grade. He loves students who WORK and are passionate about their studies. Always available and willing to help outside of class. Helped me get an internship in Germany"
2710,574471,2.0,5.0,"Will not give you good grades unless you repeat his opinion word for word, and is very critical. This makes some students afraid to give a wrong answers, which affects their participation grade. Very unprofessional, left class having learned very little."
2711,574471,1.0,5.0,He doesn't grade essays by the quality of writing as much as he does by the ideas and concepts written about.  He also demands literal perfection in each essay making it beyond frustrating when he gives you a bad grade. I would never take his class again.
2712,574471,3.5,4.0,"He's really a nice guy, but can be a very harsh grader.  If you really want to get to know him, do.  You'll need an open mind, as his views are very different from the typical American mindset.  I highly recommend him as a teacher, just be very open and flexible when taking a class taught by him"
2713,574471,3.5,2.0,"Peter can be a very intimidating professor if your German isn't very good yet, but after you get to know him the classes become a lot better.  He assigns a lot of hw but it's very easy to get a good grade so long as you actually do the work."
2714,574471,4.0,3.0,"Probably one of my favorite professors at Bucknell, very intelligent with very interesting insights.  Loves open discussions and values students' thoughts and opinions on matters, awesome guy, not unreasonable as long as you read and think"
2715,574471,5.0,2.0,Not nearly as bad as people seem to think...get to know the man outside of class...very intelligent and very fair
2716,574471,1.0,5.0,"One word, Cuba"
2717,574471,1.0,5.0,"Basically, he makes you write about Communism in German.  Your German isn't what's important here.  Pretend to agree with his political views, and you'll do well."
2718,574471,1.0,4.0,No Comments
2719,574471,1.0,5.0,Has different grading standards depending on your previous German experience. Makes you rewrite papers if they do not fit with his communist/marxist point of view which he blatently extends into the classroom. Lots of work!!
2720,1360907,4.5,4.0,"Anjalee is one of the most valuable professors here at Bucknell. She continuously looks for ways to make class challenging, but also tailors it to what students need. We are lucky to have such a talented and approachable professor like Anjalee  "
2721,1360907,5.0,4.0,Great professor who has an awesome sense of humor and is always willing to listen and to help. Has a lot to offer and knows what she is talking about. Great professor and friend to have.
2722,2743309,5.0,3.0,GOAT. Clearly explains everything and makes everything feel relevant. 
2723,2743309,5.0,4.0,"Marwil is the best prof I have had at Bucknell. He is so kind and caring. It is a hard class but he does a great job explaining subjects. Attendance not ""graded"" but you have to go or else you will be majorly behind. GO TO OFFICE HOURS EVERY WEEK!! They are so helpful and you get to know Marwil better. Homeworks due once a week, midterm, and final."
2724,2743309,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, had him at 8:30am on Mondays and he kept everyone engaged and I learned a lot without ever being bored or too confused. Definitely recommend taking a class with him.
"
2725,2743309,5.0,2.0,"EXAMS ARE 60%, however there are 5 questions on an exam and you can choose 4 of them. Also, Marwil is a gem in the econ department and I was very fortunate that I had him as my professor. His lectures are super engaging, and I promise you that there won't be a single class that you will find yourself bored in. "
2726,2384909,5.0,3.0,Love her as a professor! Her classes are very insightful and engaging. She's very easy to communicate with and her class discussions really help understand what we're studying in class. I've learned so much and I'm going to miss her next year!
2727,2384909,5.0,3.0,"I loved having her as a professor! She cares about her students and the course material so much, it is clear that she is very passionate about what she teaches. I've taken 2 courses with her and would definitely take another. Lots of essays and group work, very engaging lectures. Great professor!"
2728,2384909,5.0,3.0,She is a fantastic professor! She loves getting to know her students and engaging with the students during class. She is also extremely accommodating and genuinely wants her students to do well.
2729,2384909,5.0,3.0,"Professor Silva is a terrific teacher. She truly cares about her students and works her hardest to ensure we are gaining a holistic view on today's social issues. She is open-minded, intellectual and I highly recommend her."
2730,2384909,3.0,1.0,"Show up, talk, get an A."
2731,2384910,5.0,2.0,"mick is so so nice. he does treat his class like you are in preschool but that might just be because we were in a freshmen foundation course. if you put in effort into the assignments, you will be rewarded."
2732,48148,1.5,4.0,"She came in like a wrecking ball, and wrecked my semester. Her .5 credit class was a nightmare. She is an extremely harsh grader who doesn't give a toot about her students and is frustrated with her life. But... she knows Math."
2733,48148,1.0,4.0,"What I couldn't stand is how she would NEVER answer your question.  She would always say ""look in the book"" or ""I said that earlier"". Sometimes she would simply ignore you. The most shamelessly unhelpful and rude teacher I've ever had.  Her tests were hard but graded fairly."
2734,48148,2.0,4.0,Don't take her class! Her final exam was pretty hard and refused to curve. She repeated everything in textbook but didn't explain them. She is the worst professor that I met in Bucknell.
2735,48148,2.0,4.0,Rude and hard to understand.  Has high expectations of her students.  Expects students to spend close to 20 hours outside of class studying / working.  Harsh grader.  Do not take this professor
2736,48148,3.0,4.0,"She has an accent but is almost always easily understood. She grades VERY hard on the projects, but other assignments are alright."
2737,48148,2.5,3.0,"She definitely knows statistics, but she is kind of rude when it comes to getting that info to her students.  In addition, I was sometimes too tired to make the mental effort to sort through her phrasing of things...her accent was a bit of a problem.  She's very helpful outside of class.  Homework is straightforward.  Tests are relatively easy."
2738,48148,2.0,5.0,"The worst professor I've had at Bucknell by a long-shot.  Not only is she difficult to understand, she is condescending to students, to the point of bordering on rude.  She grades on an impossible scale.  In a class of 40, not a single person got over an 89 on an exam and she refused to curve it.  Avoid her at all costs, she is absolutely terrible."
2739,48148,2.0,4.0,She is very hard to understand because english is not her first language. It isn't that hard but it is extremely boring.
2740,48148,2.0,3.0,"Honestly, worse teacher I have ever had.  One time she threw a tantrum when everyone was dozing off in her class.  I've seen her yell at students who don't understand her explanations of things and ask clarifying questions.  She can be nice outside of class, but if she's your professor...that's not too helpful."
2741,48148,1.5,5.0,"Acuna is THAT professor that every school has.  She is condescending if you ask questions, difficult to understand and she gives out difficult exams in my opinion.  She takes off a lot for minor mistakes.  Stay away from her as I read the comments on this site before taking her class and thought that it couldn't be as bad as people said... she was"
2742,48148,3.5,4.0,"Honestly, she's not that bad. Her tests are relatively easy and straightforward. If you do the homework, you won't have to study too hard for the tests. Also, she drops your 5 lowest homework grades, which is pretty sweet. However, she is an EXTREMELY hard grader when it comes to projects."
2743,48148,2.5,4.0,"Acuna is definitely a nice lady, but she is condecending when questions are asked, and even though the class seems like it will be easy, it definitely isn't.  She also makes her test difficult and the questions are worded weirdly. Projects are graded EXTREMELY hard.  I'd stay away ..."
2744,48148,3.0,4.0,I really liked her! Acuna does not have the best reputation but if you do the work in her class and take her seriously you will be fine. I'm not a particularly strong student and passed with an A but you have to go in and talk to her if you are concerned about your grade or need help. She is always available and very sweet if you give her a chance.
2745,48148,4.5,3.0,"I think Carmen explains math very clearly, as only people who know it can do. She has a funny accent, which is not a problem, since she speaks English better than many of my fellow students. She is fair and nice."
2746,48148,2.5,2.0,"Prof. Acuna is really nice and friendly and her stats class is easy. She has a bit of an accent, but I didn't really think it was a problem."
2747,48148,4.5,1.0,"Anyone who bashes prof. Acuna is a slob. If you don't do well in the class it's because of you, not because she's hard of hearing. You're not in high school anymore, take responsibility for your own education and stop blaming others for your short comings."
2748,48148,1.0,5.0,"Imagine someone touching a rose and it wilts in pain.  This is what she causes her students.  I warn you, do not take this class.  It will be your worst choice.  She is the hobbit that everyone fears"

2750,48148,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! She is the worst professor in the world. I can only regret that the ratings on this website cannot go below 1. I am petitioning for all her previous students to make sure she gets fired! Please show your support!!!
2751,48148,1.0,5.0,"I personally believe that Carmen Acuna should not be allowed to teach anyone.  She is the college students worst nightmare... She takes daily attendence, then doesn't explain the material well (because she doesn't speak English) then grades unfairly hard and won't answer questions. Made me hate learning, dont worry, she is probably being fired soon"
2752,48148,1.0,5.0,"bottom line, she is the worst professor ever to teach in the history of academics.  she is a short little devil.  if you ask questions, she will yell at you.  do not ask questions during the test.  you will get yelled at.  she cannot speak the native language.  prerequisite: chilean.  don't ever take her"
2753,48148,1.5,4.0,Confusing as hell
2754,48148,1.0,3.0,"Speaks Chilean, not english.  Hated her, worthless class, couldn't understand her, don't take her class"
2755,48148,2.0,3.0,"She's a character.  Her grading policy is weird, I failed the first test and got good grades on the rest and ended up with an A.  Even I was surprised."
2756,48148,1.0,5.0,This was the only class in 4 years that i failed.  she can't teach at all.  avoid at all costs.
2757,48148,2.0,4.0,"Terrible grading policy, very sketchy."
2758,48148,3.5,5.0,"She's hard to understand, but hilarious if u know her"
2759,48148,1.0,5.0,If I ever have to come across this professor again in my undergraduate lifetime I will most probably commit ritual suicide with a spoon.  Avoid at ALL COSTS.
2760,48148,1.0,5.0,"Not enough can be said about this abomination of a professor, and I use the term professor loosely.  Her broken english can only be topped by her lack of hearing, shes literally half deaf.  Worst teacher I've ever had, and worst advisor, actually tried to screw me into not getting the class I wanted"
2761,48148,2.0,4.0,"difficult to understand, never knew how an assignment was going to be graded, sometimes easy others, impossibly hard"
2762,48148,1.5,4.0,"Can't speak english, grades way too hard"
2763,48148,2.5,3.0,"marks any answer wrong that is not word for word with her answer key. you can understand everything that's going on, but still do bad on tests because she can't grade."

2768,1631253,5.0,2.0,i loved her and this class! exams and quizzes were pretty easy as long as you study and do homeworks. textbook is needed!! fun class and she's a relaxed grader. I'd recommend if you're looking to fulfill language req or want to learn a new language
2769,1631253,5.0,1.0,love her!!! the weekly papers are kinda annoying but they're quick and the grading is pretty relaxed on them and most other assignments. was not a huge fan of the material but it was an easy foundation seminar would recommend taking. shes also a really good advisor and cares a lot. chill with deadlines and is understanding
2770,1631253,4.0,2.0,This class was very interesting and I learned alot! Professor Perrone is kind and cares about her students. There are weekly papers due every Monday but they are short and usually on readings for homework. There were two larger papers due towards the end of the semester as well. Overall I liked this class and the professor too!
2771,1631253,5.0,2.0,I really liked this class and Professor Perrone!! She is a great teacher and I feel well prepared for the next level of Italian. She is considerate and caring about her students and is there to help when needed. The material does take time to learn so be prepared to put in time to study and complete homework assignments. Overall great class!
2772,1631253,5.0,3.0,I took Italian 101 in my first semester and loved having Professor Perrone as my teacher. Class was interactive and we covered a lot in such a small period of time. I would definitely recommend this class.
2773,1631253,5.0,2.0,She's the sweetest professor ever! I have had her for two semesters now and she is so helpful. She even recommends classes that aren't her own and helps make transitioning into college less stressful. She becomes friends with all of her students I love her sm!!!
2774,1631253,5.0,2.0,I had Prof. Perrone for my freshman seminar class. She's so sweet and is willing to help you with anything. Her class is really interesting and she makes it easy to participate/understand whats going on. She also makes the class very low pressure so everyones comfortable.
2775,1631253,5.0,2.0,"I also had her for foundation seminar and she is just a great professor and person all around. She cares about students &amp; wants them to do well. She will take the time to meet with you &amp; work with you if you need help. Easy grader and very considerate about late work or having to miss class. If you show up and participate, you will get an A."
2776,1631253,5.0,2.0,"Shes my queen!!! Honestly one of the best teachers, so sweet and so good at teaching material. Yes there are a lot of quizzes and exams, but all of the language classes have those and hers is the easiest by far, and you will still learn enough for the final. highly reccommend!!!!"
2777,1631253,5.0,3.0,Professor Perrone is the absolute best. She's one of the nicest teachers that I have had at Bucknell. She provides great feedback on paper assignments and really cares to get your writing to the next level. She works really hard to make sure that her students are having a successful first year. DEFINITELY take her.
2778,1631253,5.0,1.0,"I took this class to fulfill my language requirement and it turned out to be such a great time. Perrone is very caring of her students, she is engaging and enthusiastic, gives a reasonable amount of work, and has reasonable expectations for her students. If you have the opportunity to take Italian with her, I would 100% recommend Prof. Perrone."
2779,1631253,5.0,2.0,"I started Italian for the first time here at Bucknell. After taking 101 with Perrone, I have decided to minor in Italian. The class is really fun and overall pretty easy. She is always willing to talk to students and help them."
2780,1631253,5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors I've had, she really cares about her students."
2781,1631253,5.0,1.0,Amazing.
2782,1631253,5.0,2.0,She really got me to love the language
2783,1631253,5.0,1.0,"I had her for my Foundation Seminar. She was so caring, helpful, genuinely interested in her students and material she was teaching, and responsive to student concerns. She really worked to help improve our writing. She engaged students during class and was a fair grader. Take her if you have the chance."
2784,1049623,4.0,4.0,"Dean Shinko is incredibly knowledgable and gives great readings. I learned a ton of new information. She assigns a lot of readings, but is receptive to burnout and cut a few at the end. Be ready to write and schedule a meeting with her BEFORE the first essay to talk through your ideas. Give a ton of examples, you got this!"
2785,1049623,5.0,5.0,"Dean Shinko was by far the BEST PROFESSOR I have ever had! She really cared about her students and our success in the class. She is willing to schedule a Zoom with you whenever you need it! She even talked with me while making her Thanksgiving dinner. But be aware, there is A LOT OF READING AND WRITING. By far the hardest class I've taken."
2786,1049623,4.0,5.0,"Difficult. Lots of reading, lots of hard reading with short turn around. Her classes are very modern though, with a lot of creative outlets. She knows what she's talking about. You'll work hard but you'll get a lot out of it."
2787,1049623,5.0,3.0,"Professor Shinko really knows what she's talking about. I'm learning a lot in her class- she assigns a lot of reading which you do have to do but you really do learn a lot. As long as you put effort into papers, she's not a hard grader. I would highly recommend taking her class!"
2788,1049623,5.0,4.0,"I took Contemporary Conflict Resolution with her and I absolutely loved it! Sure she is a lot of work and you MUST do the readings to do well in her class, but you will also learn more than with anyone! We skyped with people that were cited in out textbook and got to have great conversations with some world renowned scholars! She is my favorite!"
2789,1049623,2.0,5.0,"I was really interested to take Modern World System and boy did Shinko ruin that for me. Her class was unnecessarily hard and we had to read weird extremist postmodern stuff because that's what she believes in. She is not at all open to other perspectives, limits participation, picks on some students and talks down to the rest. worst prof at buck"
2790,1049623,3.0,4.0,A lot of work and readings. Rough grader and does not give you a reason why you get the grade that you do. But in all you learn a ton and sets you up nicely for a lot of other classes. She is very liberal in her political views and therefore siding with her goes a long way. Average teacher overall.
2791,1049623,1.5,2.0,"Boring, dull class with forced participation. Very little engaging conversation. Brown-nosing goes a long way, she's very liberal and responds well to those who parrot her opinion back to her. Easy grader on papers if you know basic writing and formatting. I would not recommend her or this class."
2792,1049623,3.5,5.0,"i did way more work in this class than my other classes, but i also learned a lot more. she's very nice and will help you out if you reach out to her. A's aren't easy, but they aren't impossible either"
2793,1049623,4.5,4.0,"She is a fabulous professor and one of my favorites here at Bucknell. I have also taken a senior seminar with her.  She works hard and if you work hard and meet her halfway, you will learn a lot and come out with a good grade."
2794,1049623,3.5,4.0,"Nice woman, I have found her to be very knowledgeable and helpful.  Her classes can be a lot of work but she's a fair grader.  I have had 2 classes with her and would take her again."
2795,1049623,1.0,3.0,She is never around; very low level of knowledge; easy grader; very boring; the worst professor in IREL.
2796,1049623,4.5,5.0,"Professor Shinko is a hard, but dedicated professor. You have to do the readings and attend class, but she wants you to succeed and will work with you until you get there."
2797,1049623,1.5,4.0,Terrible professor.
2798,1631257,2.0,5.0,Seriously beware of taking an intro-level class with Professor Herman. She is not mean but she is horrible at explaining things. She expects students to know things she ACKNOWLEDGES she never taught. It's impossible without a geology foundation. I am always in office hours and still so confused. BEWARE. Choose a different professor if possible
2799,1631257,3.0,3.0,Ellen is great but only if you already like geology or science. She expects students to know the material even though she doesnt teach it. Take 204 instead
2800,1631257,2.0,5.0,"Herman is very into geology, but does not know how to teach it. Does a terrible job explaining things during her lectures and moves through material very fast. Her powerpoints make no sense and have no information necessary, yet she expects students to use it as a study tool. Gives a lot of homework/labs, and has no regard for students' other work."
2801,1631257,2.0,4.0,"hydrogeology is hard to teach, ellen tries her best but sometimes I feel she doesn't even know how to explain the information. You have to teach yourself mostly everything you need for problem sets and tests. Only take this class if you need it for your degree."
2802,1631257,4.0,4.0,"Professor Herman is extremely knowledgeable about her subject and she cares about her material. She makes herself very available to subtends who need help, but if you do not go to her for help and then are struggling in the class she has no sympathy."
2803,1631257,4.0,4.0,"Geology 203 is a pain.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time doing labs, problem sets and studying for exams. I would suggest taking baby bio. However, if you go with 203, Professor Herman is willing to help with studying, problem sets and the lab."
2804,1631257,4.0,3.0,"Professor Herman cares a lot about the subject matter, her bark is not as bad as her bite. Tests don't count for as much as you think, as labs are a big part of the grade. If you need a lab science I'd look at 204, but if you don't believe in your memorization abilities i would go with 203, just based off of the amount labs are counted for."
2805,1631257,4.0,4.0,"The class is way easier than biology or chemistry.  Homework problem sets are not that hard, you just have to do them."
2806,1631257,4.5,2.0,"Great Professor. Very smart. Loves subject matter. Decent amount of work, but her bark is worse than her bite."
2807,1631257,4.0,3.0,"The material seems extremely hard, especially in class because she knows everything so it comes off as difficult to the students. If you go to recitation it's VERY helpful because they can make sure you get your homeworks correct, which is a big part of your grade. Exams were take-home for us, but they were closed book using one sheet of notes"
2808,1631257,5.0,2.0,"I had her for Environmental Geology lab. She was very engaging, enthusiastic about the material, and available for help. The labs were mostly field trips and were fun and interesting. She always held review sessions before tests and if you studied hard you could do well. She was very helpful with any questions you had for labs. She's a fair grader."
2809,1600539,1.5,3.0,Very poor communication skills. Couldn't answer questions helpfully or explain things clearly. Final looked like it was tossed together last minute and was missing crucial pieces for completion. Quizzes tested silly details rather than overall comprehension. Lectures were complete repetition of textbook.
2810,1631260,4.0,3.0,"Good professor, but subject is quite difficult but he makes it easier."
2811,1631260,5.0,2.0,"Good prof.  Go to class, do the homework, get an A/B.  Accent was not bad at all."
2812,1631260,1.5,3.0,"Terrible class. Too think of a Spanish Accent to understand. Loses train of thought so teaching is all over the place, and it is impossible to follow along. Structure of the class isn't bad, 4 tests drops 1 and attendance is 13% of grade. Read the textbook because lecture will not help. Go to class because it counts towards your grade!"
2813,1631260,4.0,2.0,Fairly dry lectures cover exactly what you have to know for the exam. He talks with a relatively thick accent (Spanish) so understanding may be difficult sometimes in class. Test questions are almost identical to the problem sets.
2814,1631260,3.5,2.0,Hard to understand the accent. Tests are difficult but based on the homework assignments. He is very approachable and a real nice guy.
2815,1631260,3.5,3.0,This class was hard and a lot of work. A lot of material had to be covered in a short amount of time. You need to study hard for tests and go to him ahead of time for clarification of things you don't get. He likes to know you are making an effort. He is not always clear in class. He grades fairly.
2816,828446,5.0,4.0,"Probably the best professor I've had at Bucknell. Classes are interesting and informative, and Professor Csernica's a great guy outside of class. Not always the easiest, but he gets you to learn the content."
2817,828446,3.0,3.0,Love professor Csernica he is awesome. Definitely the top 3 professors I've had at Bucknell!
2818,756769,3.0,3.0,You'll either love or hate him. Class is very loosely structured which was kind of annoying and hard to follow. Does not clarify most things in his lectures. Assigns an unrealistic amount of reading with little time to do it. Must write three pages a week on those readings which is not that bad. He definitely knows his stuff but can't teach well
2819,756769,5.0,4.0,Best professor at Bucknell. No question.
2820,756769,4.0,3.0,You have to read a lot to do well in this course. Hilarious person who has very high expectations for students as far as doing assignments.
2821,756769,5.0,4.0,Top five professor at Bucknell.
2822,756769,4.5,3.0,Enyeart is one of my favorite professors at this school.  He's a great guy who loves to joke around and have fun.  Be prepared to read but in return you will get out a lot of the class.  You will be engaged with the material and appreciate how he wants his students to be engaged with the material.  Highly recommend this man
2823,756769,3.5,3.0,"He's alright.  There's a TON of reading required.  A book a week, and then there will be a quiz on it.  The quizzes don't count for much however, compared to the papers and tests.  I found him to carry the swagger of what I can only describe as a &quot;football jock&quot; which I didn't really connect with."
2824,756769,4.5,2.0,He is a good teacher. There is alot of reading but he is a very fair grader and his tests are relatively easy as long as you study your notes. Essays count for the majority of your grade. He is a good teacher
2825,756769,4.5,3.0,"He is really cool and very very nice guy. His lectures are enjoyable and interesting. You have to take a lot of notes and there is a fair amount of reading, but I strongly reccomend him as a professor"
2826,756769,3.5,3.0,good teacher. a lot of reading. grades based on essays and research paper
2827,756769,5.0,3.0,"He is an amazing professor, you will work hard, but learn a lot and be interested"
2828,756769,4.5,2.0,No Comments
2829,756769,4.0,3.0,"Johnny Boy is a cool cat. I have taken two of his classes which has caused me to want to become a history major, I do not think you can pay a better compliment. His lectures aren't the best. The subject matter isn't the best. It's just solid. My roommate and I would come blacked out for our 830s and he wouldnt get mad when we left class to puke..."
2830,918562,5.0,3.0,"This class is a fast, hands on intro to technical theatre for beginners. Attendance is super important, because you get the explanation and a chance to try this/learn for yourself. Get the book used/an edition behind. Heath keeps the class moving, never boring. Great at explaining all the basics, while giving more information to ppl that want more."
2831,918562,5.0,3.0,You have to love that flat top haircut.
2832,918562,4.5,2.0,"Great professor, but if you don't stay on top of the explanations in class, you will soon be lost.  Pay attention and have fun.  Heath is good about making sure that you understand and he aways answers questions.  The exam is Tech Olympics, which is basically a Tech Theater field day."
2833,2434082,5.0,2.0,Really easy class. Fun lessons.
2834,2098212,1.0,4.0,Madame is a non-native speaker who struggles with modern french lang. norms. Multiple assignments are due every class. Her demanding ways will not come together at the end of semester in an ah ha moment of gratitude. My peers were a close-knit group that questioned her temper. She is the worst prof I've had. PS Bucknell's grade system has no A+.
2835,2098212,5.0,3.0,She's great and caring! I'd love to have more classes with her.
2836,2098212,5.0,2.0,"Madame Renck is a compassionate teacher who truly cares about her students. Although the work load is difficult, she is a generous grader and wants her students to succeed. Class participation and attendance is mandatory, but by the end of the semester, the work load pays off."
2837,2098212,5.0,4.0,"I did not enjoy this class until the last few weeks, when I realized just how much Prof. Renck had taught me, and how she had really helped me through the mountains of material we worked through. She will work you, but if you stick with it, you will come out on the other side alive and so much better off than before! She's a great Prof and Person!!"
2838,48172,5.0,2.0,He is one of the nicest people I met in Bucknell. You have to take notes to be able to refer back to them and understand the material. He tries his best to make topics interesting. He is a funny guy as well. He would not trick you on a test unless he declares it before the test.
2839,48172,4.5,2.0,"Perhaps the best professor at Bucknell. He is extremely entertaining  and is the most quotable professor you will have at Bucknell.  Lectures can be pointless, but he will cover what you need to ace the test. He is very approachable outside of class and will go over it until you get it! I studied about 1 hr per test and got A's. Great class!"
2840,48172,5.0,4.0,"I took every linguistics class offered with him-a great professor, very enthusiastic about his field and will draw you into linguistics/syntax! I ended up going to grad school in a related field, and I feel incredibly prepared from readings, class discussions, and exams--once you're past the intro classes, you're on a grad level. thanks lavine!!!"
2841,48172,4.5,1.0,"Lavine is an awesome professor who shows genuine interest in his students and cares deeply about what he's teaching. Although the content may be dry at times, he does his best to engage everyone. I never dreaded heading to his class."
2842,48172,3.5,2.0,"He is such a great professor who is so, so, so funny! He obviously loves the material and gets all of his students to feel the same. He works in a lot of different languages and makes you want to advance your study in linguistics. I really recommend his class! I never found the exams hard, but I know some people had difficulty. Just study!"
2843,48172,5.0,3.0,"i've taken 3 classes with him....he's a great professor, awkward but funny, and is approachable if you need any help"
2844,48172,4.0,2.0,"Most classes were very interesting, I'd def recommend. He says ummm a lot, and often goes off on political tangents though. Nice guy; very funny."
2845,48172,4.5,3.0,"Such a great teacher.  Has a bit of trouble keeping focus, he's easy to get off track.  Be prepared for a lot of &quot;Ummmm&quot;s.  I recommend his classes highly.  He's incredibly approachable."
2846,48172,5.0,3.0,Amazing class...great professor. So personable and aware of students' needs
2847,48172,5.0,2.0,Such a great guy. He is hilarious and makes class fun. Can't wait to have him again.
2848,48172,5.0,1.0,No Comments
2849,48172,5.0,2.0,"Excellent Ling prof, very open & approachable, makes class fun"
2850,48172,5.0,2.0,"Awesome teacher... take him for ling, or russian, he is the best, dont miss out!"
2851,859180,5.0,4.0,Interesting. Readings can be tough but he's a dynamic lecturer. Doesn't give number grades just vague letters. Overall I'd recommend taking him!
2852,859180,5.0,3.0,"Turner is a very thoughtful professor who's pretty funny and cares about his students understanding the material. Overall, your grade is determined by three in-class essays and he's available for help outside of class to prepare for them. As long as you have a general idea of the readings and go to the lectures you'll be set."
2853,859180,5.0,2.0,graded on literally your responses to his email and your 3 essays during the semester. take this course if over Prof. Slaters on godddddd. Thank me later.
2854,859180,5.0,4.0,"I think that Turner himself is an awesome professor, I have never taken philosophy and no matter how hard I tried on all his in-class essays I always got a B+. I worked very hard and still could not manage an A. He's a great guy and very entertaining but I wouldn't take the class unless you are a good writer."
2855,859180,4.0,4.0,Very smart. He is always around to help if you need it when prepping your in-class essays (there are 3 in total and determine 75% of your grade). You do not really need to do the readings or participate in class as long as you attend class and prepare very very thoroughly for the in-class essays.
2856,859180,5.0,3.0,"He is by far my favorite professor at Bucknell. From the first day of class, I knew I was in for a treat. He is hilarious and a true gem. Only graded off of three papers, attendance, and participation. He keeps track of who participates very closely. Accessible outside of class, and if you cannot make office hours he will offer to call you by phone"
2857,859180,5.0,3.0,"I wish I could take all the rest of my courses at Bucknell with Turner. He is the rare professor who wants you to succeed, makes you work for it, and has a good time doing it. Like no joke this guy came in and was *on* every. day. Never talked down to students even when they clearly hadnt done the reading, genius level smart, just the best. 10/10"
2858,859180,5.0,1.0,"Professor Turner genuinely cares about his students. He offered extensive review sessions before each in class essay-- if you don't know how to answer the prompt, its probably your own fault. He will go out of his way to explain a concept to you, and is fair, respectful, and enthusiastic in listening to his students opinions and ideas."
2859,859180,5.0,1.0,"Turner is a funny dude, gives entertaining lectures and really wants his students to do well. He treats them as adults and is very open to discussion and interpretation. Goes OUT OF HIS WAY to be accessible to students, especially during crunch time before exams. Never had a prof who worked this hard to help his students succeed. What a great man."
2860,859180,5.0,2.0,"From the first minute, he was very intriguing and I could tell he was passionate about not only the subject matter but also teaching in general. Def got the feel that he wanted the best for us as students. Great class that opens up your mind and freely express your opinions on deep philosophy as well as modern controversy"
2861,859180,4.5,2.0,"Best professor I've ever had and one of the funniest guys I've ever met. Does a fantastic job explaining the material, paper topics are fair, and he is a very fair grader. Also grades heavily based on attendance and participation which can save your semester. Highly recommended you take at least one class even if not a philosophy major."
2862,859180,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Turner is great! He makes the works of ancient philosophers important and understandable. His grading is based entirely on in class essays, but if you take good notes during his lectures, you will be fine. He is very caring and encouraging and he recognizes students who put in the work necessary for higher order thinking. Highly recommended"
2863,859180,3.5,2.0,"Professor Turner teaches purely based on discussion and the readings. Assigns alot of reading but it is not necessary to read to do well in the class. Difficult to get an A without doing all of the reading, participating, and being a good writer. Very easy to get a B"
2864,859180,4.5,3.0,"Great sense of humor. Very quirky guy, kept class entertaining-fun to watch teach. Sometimes throws chalk at the wall. =P He's clearly passionate about what he teaches, and very approachable. A lot of reading and take good notes in class-you'll want them to prepare for the in-class essays. If you like philosophy, take a class with him!!"
2865,859180,4.5,3.0,"Professor Turner is one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell. He is extremely passionate about what he teaches and has a great sense of humor. I originally was not big on philosophy, but he makes it easy to enjoy. Overall, I highly recommend having at least one class with Turner at Bucknell."
2866,859180,5.0,3.0,"One of the best. Entertaining, engaging lectures. Lots of time outside class for consultation. Incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter. Even speaks Greek. Moderately hard grader, but very good at improving your writing skills. Recommended."
2867,859180,5.0,1.0,good teacher
2868,859180,5.0,2.0,great professor. really knows his stuff. great help outside of class.  make sure you speak up during class and go to his office hours--he knows who participates and who doesn't.  not a terribly hard grader.
2869,859180,5.0,2.0,Turner is so cute! He is funny and approachable. He gives you ample opportunity to boost your grade and is VERY fair- great class- highly reccommend
2870,859180,4.0,2.0,Turner is the man... he is quirky and kind of finds himself hilarious. Its okay though because he really is funny. Not to difficult of a grader... will meet with you outside of class.
2871,859180,3.0,3.0,the best professor i've have ever had. bar. none.
2872,859180,5.0,3.0,"A really engaging professor and very quirky. Really easy to meet with outside of class, goes out of his way to make sure you're doing okay and understanding the materials."
2873,1643566,5.0,2.0,Class only meets once a week but classes are long and demanding.  He expects his classes to be silent so don't think about taking to the person next to you.  He likes to dim the lights during class also so it is sometimes hard to see the board.
2874,1643566,4.0,1.0,"I took Snoozeberry for both 101 and 256. I think that his 101 course is a little easier, but both of them are good courses. The only problem with 256 is that every assignment takes about 2 or 3 hours longer than you expect it to. You might be planning your day on completing one in just an hour or so, but once you start it takes hours to complete."
2875,1643566,3.5,3.0,"Very good professor. He makes you work for your grades, but if you put in the time you will do well. I have to admit to keep up with the huge assignments he gives every day, I often have to skip some other classes, but his course is really rewarding if you do all the work. The work is also very pleasant, and makes you feel great."
2876,734256,4.0,3.0,"Although his class wasn't the easiest, I found BIOL206 with Professor Stayton rewarding. Sometimes he could be a little condescending, but he was ultimately a pretty understanding guy. If you're confident in yourself as a student and not afraid to put in the extra hours, I think you'll be successful in his class."
2877,734256,5.0,3.0,"At first I honestly didn't like his teaching style because he oftentimes doesn't give you direct answers to questions, but give it time and you'll get used to it. Gives fantastic lectures which are extremely interesting and engaging. His grading and quizzes are fair. Super nice, funny, and approachable as well. Definitely recommend."
2878,734256,5.0,3.0,"Love this man. Great professor and a great person. Really cares how you are doing in the class and whether you are understanding the material. A little quirky and has an unconventional teaching style but once you get used to it, the class is so interesting. Make sure to actually do the reading the night before so you can do well on quizzes."
2879,734256,4.0,4.0,Prof. Stayton was such a good bio teacher. He found ways to make the lectures interactive and fun. The class was difficult but he helped you if you were confused about anything. Also the tests were pretty easy if you were on top of the readings.
2880,734256,4.0,3.0,"Anatomy was cool and Stayton is cool. You'll do well if you ask questions and do your work. Most of the class did not study or try during the labs which was a bummer as the class can be frustrating at times, but it is really not that hard."
2881,734256,4.0,4.0,His tests are completely short answer so be ready to write and explain or draw out topics. Kinda querky but will help. Very intelligent so some of the stuff was explained in very complicated terms.
2882,734256,5.0,4.0,"I gotta admit, I was initially very frustrated with his teaching style, but it's not that bad once you get used to it. I find him to be a little odd and eccentric, but he's funny, quirky, and nice too. Make sure you read and study often and a lot, and word your test responses carefully, as he's a tough grader."
2883,734256,1.0,5.0,"Stayton is an interesting man, though his fun facts during class are interesting, if you don't do the reading you will not be learning it in lecture, unreasonable amounts of reading, clicker quizzes at the beginning of class will bring down your grade unless you have incredible memory, not very helpful in office hours, super hard grader. "
2884,734256,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, always ready to help. One of those cases that he is so nice and wants to help, but not too many people seek it out because he is so intelligent its a bit intimidating. Lectures are gold and interesting, and the test material is mainly basic concepts harped on in lecture. grading is tough, but he will let you argue your point."
2885,734256,3.0,2.0,"Wasn't my favorite teacher.  Kinda condescending and made people feel stupid when they asked reasonable questions.  Overall he only wanted us to know simple topics which was nice, but sometimes the questions on his test were worded oddly."
2886,734256,4.5,2.0,"Keeps lectures interesting, lets you have a full page sheet for exams so you don't have to memorize stuff."
2887,734256,3.5,1.0,"Great prof! Easy, interesting, and fun. Gives lots fo extra credit. Nice guy."
2888,734256,4.5,2.0,Definitely take Stayton over Spiro if you have the choice.  He is really nerdy but it makes him hilarious.  He's enthusiastic about biology and keeps lectures interesting by including real life examples.
2889,734256,1.0,5.0,He is so mean and not helpful!
2890,734256,5.0,2.0,"Had him for 206 and vertebrate anatomy. He's awesome, he's a complete geek and he's fully aware of it. he's funny and really cares about getting the message across. I was confused on the divisions of the circ. system and he stayed after class with me for almost 45 minutes going over the dissection with me. Practicals suck no matter who you have."
2891,734256,4.5,4.0,"Had Stayton for lab. I liked him so much that I'm researching with him next semester. He is amazing. Crystal clear, really knowledgeable, quirky (he likes metal music, and does a little bit of Karate during lecture I've heard). He's professional and serious about academics though, so it's not all fun and games with him."
2892,734256,3.5,2.0,"Stayton is the man! he will let you use a single sheet of paper double sided for his tests with whatever information you want on it if you ask nicely...he also tries extremely hard to make sure you understand the material and offers a lot of extra credit assignments..take stayton if you can, you wont regret it!"
2893,734256,3.5,3.0,"He's not THAT great. His tests are completely short answer, whereas other professors' tests have a variety of questions (multiple choice, matching, etc). He gives 10 pop quizzes throughout the semester, which I found really annoying. But he's relatively nice and the stuff he posts on Blackboard can be helpful."
2894,734256,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic professor.  Makes everything clear and really cares about what the students think.  Study the quizzes, notes, and blackboard materials and you will do well in this class.  Also, he is hilarious.  If you like bio, take this class!"
2895,734256,4.0,4.0,Great Professor! Hilarious comments! Provides a ton of material on Blackboard for study purposes.
2896,734256,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Stayton is a great professor.  He really knows his material and his biology 206 class is easy.  He tells you exactly what you need to know for the test, and he is a fair grader.  I would defi encourage anyone taking bio 206 to take Dr. Stayton"
2897,734256,4.0,3.0,"Great in lecture, but not in lab.  Definetly take him for lecture. Tests are all easy short answers. Kinda awkward and geeky but he goes with it and comes off funny."
2898,734256,3.0,2.0,"He tries to be funny, but really isn't. Kind of geeky, really hard lab practicals, but he is intelligent in his field. Not the best, but not the worst."
2899,734256,4.5,3.0,He is a great professor that makes class interesting. Tests are a little hard but pretty straight forward. Overal good experience in the class
2900,734256,4.0,4.0,"I enjoyed him as a professor very much.  Each week he had us tell him which concepts we thought were important which was very helpful in determining what to study.  Nerdy, but funny."
2901,734256,3.5,4.0,"Horrible! Horrible! Grading is ridiculous- he was never satisfied..I would spend 8 hours on a lab to get a 75%. I would definitely avoid him if you can! He may be good for class, but he's definitely not at all for lab"
2902,734256,4.5,1.0,Sooo easy.Take him for bio. Avoid others at all costs.
2903,2094129,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mir is not only great at explaining difficult CS topics, but she's an AMAZING and invaluable mentor. She goes above and beyond to help with everything from class topics to post-grad plans and so much more. Especially if you're a minority in comp sci, 1,000% recommend Darakhshan as one of the absolute best profs Bucknell has to offer!"
2904,2094129,4.0,3.0,"Darakshan really cares about studet and take time to help you. CS187 got a lot of homework but mostly not diffcult, just time-consuming. The grading is not easy, but if you work hard A- is easy. Her rules for participation and attendance is not clear so better go to every class."
2905,2094129,4.0,3.0,"This was a great course for non-STEM majors. There are multiple projects throughout the semester that you should prepare to put a lot of time and effort into. Coding itself is not difficult, its just tedious and time consuming. Only 2 exams for the whole semester. Someone said average score was 45% but thats definitely not true. It was 75%."
2906,2094129,3.0,5.0,"Took CSCI187 which is for non-STEM majors. I needed to fill a math requirement so I took the course. Darakhshan wasn't bad, but we had 2 exams throughout the course where the class average was about 45%. Labs & assignments due weekly, not a lot of homework but coding is difficult."
2907,2094129,5.0,2.0,"Professor Mir is a young professor, yet she's amazingly good at teaching this course. If there is one office hours that was extremely helpful, it would be hers. She never failed at extricating anything that confused me. She really cares about you as a student and a person. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her. Would take again!"
2908,2094129,5.0,1.0,"Amazing lectures! Everything is well-explained and sometimes with appropriate Internet memes, which makes the classroom dynamic so good. Her help hour is also extremely helpful."
2909,48176,4.0,3.0,"Prof. White is really nice and willing to talk with you outside of class. Took her res college class. No usual homework, had three essays and a project for the semester. Tough grader for sure, but if you listen and participate in class and just write your essays based on what she said, plus some of your own opinion, you will probably do fine."
2910,48176,5.0,3.0,Professor White is absolutely brilliant and needs to be respected more. She wrote her own book in a leading field and teaches in ways not many professors on campus would.
2911,48176,5.0,4.0,"Dr. White is one of the most thought-provoking professors I've had thus far. She's always pushing you to consider your own opinions/perspectives, and why it is you have them. You learn a lot in her classes, and the discussions are amazing - just be sure to do the readings!"
2912,48176,5.0,5.0,"Professor White gave the challenge of my Philosophy career thus far, but if you're up for it, you'll never learn more from anyone. She is so incredibly smart that sometimes she would get so deep into a lecture that the whole class would lose her, but she never failed to explain everything carefully and thoroughly. She basically taught me to write."
2913,48176,2.5,2.0,"The subject material is extremely interesting, but sometimes difficult to understand.  Read and be prepared to participate. Class discussions are fun. Essays are very open-ended and allow for personal interpretation. Prof. White is often absentminded, but she means well. Patience is important, but she is very willing to work with students."
2914,48176,2.0,4.0,HAd her for Religion and Science.  expected way too much of her students.  Readings were long and hard to understand and work outside of class was unreasonable.  Would grade a paper with no markings and write a letter grade at the top
2915,48176,5.0,4.0,She is one of the most intelligent professors on campus.  She grades hard but you would learn a lot if you keep up with the readings and discussions.
2916,48176,5.0,4.0,"She was one of the best teachers, in general,I've ever had. She's exactly the kind of professor I expected to have coming to Bucknell. She was fair, enthusiastic, and relatable. However, if you're not willing to actually do work, you'll probably hate her. Overall, great experience!"
2917,48176,1.0,5.0,"The worst prof I've ever had. She's unclear, unfair, and incompetent to be teaching at Bucknell. She thinks she's great because she went to Harvard. In all honesty, she's lazy and has little respect for her students. Cancels class ever other day. I guess my tuition dollars mean nothing to her. Stay far away."
2918,48176,4.0,2.0,"She's very open to different beliefs. Expects you to do a lot of reading and participate in class. Takes attendance every day (unless she forgets, which happens quite frequently) and penalizes you for missed classes. Doesn't mind putting people on the spot. Rarely tests or gives written assignments."
2919,48176,3.0,3.0,"If you're a good writer, you'll do well in her classes. Make sure you edit because she takes serious points off and complains about grammar/typos. If you raise your hand and say something intelligent maybe once every three classes, you're in. She's intimidating, but appreciates participation and wont nail you as long as you act interested"
2920,48176,2.5,5.0,"expects ridiculous amounts out of you on papers. if you're not a religion major or something where this class would be relevant, don't take it!"
2921,48176,2.5,2.0,"Very passionate about it. A lot of class reading, all class discussion. Tough paper grader. I'm Catholic and she tends to look down on my inability to get past a lot of my traditions."
2922,48176,4.5,3.0,"Very approachable and always willing to discuss anything, be it related to a reading or to work in class.  Very critical of religion, but pretty inoffensive and openminded.  Definitely recommended for an interesting and stimulating class."
2923,48176,5.0,4.0,"hell yeah.  shes on point, introspective, and great to do battle with philosophically cause she's interested in new ideas and VERY well learned.  any spiritual warriors on campus up there interested in taking on a 10000 ft view of theological theories woul"
2924,48176,1.5,4.0,"unclear, not very nice, not helpful, has trouble connecting ideas"
2925,48176,4.0,3.0,"she's hard to handle at first, especially if you get offended easily or if you are catholic; but, i enjoyed her class in the end and am a more open minded person because of it."
2926,48176,2.5,3.0,dont take her class if you get offended easily
2927,2356281,2.0,4.0,"She's very caring and tries her best, but also very disorganized. Her readings seemed pointless and seemingly had little do with the discussions in class. The discussions also seemed pointless and coming to class felt like a waste of time. Also, she assigned a lot of papers with unclear grading criteria and seemingly don't have a point."
2928,2356281,1.0,4.0,"While Professor Fourshey is very caring about her students and will bring in food, she's pretty disorganized. After this past semester I still do not know if she graded all my papers. She assigns a lot of writing and grades it harshly, she is not an &quot;easy A &quot;class. Her class discussions have no direction and are based off of 50-100 pages per class."
2929,1557564,3.5,5.0,Interesting professor but very demanding in terms of writing. Make sure you pay attention to THEORY THEORY THEORY as his syllabus says....
2930,2569277,5.0,3.0,"He's a very patient and approachable professor. He's willing to explain the same material in different ways many times until you understand it. Lots of notes to take in every class. It's a heavy class, and it's not easy to get a good grade."
2931,2569277,2.0,5.0,"This class is so hard. Homework is so difficult with averages in the 60s. The tests were different from the homework and the quizzes and were very overwhelming. Even after receiving many similar complaints about the pace of the class, nothing changed."
2932,908352,5.0,2.0,"Paula is a great professor, really throws students into the work the minute they get there. If we did 'lecture' five days the whole semester that sounds like a lot. Lots of reading and talking and workshopping. Just make sure you pay attention because tangents can happen easily, but we eventually make our way back to topic."
2933,908352,2.0,4.0,"While Paula is a pretty good poet herself, she is not the best at teaching or guiding others. Her lack of attention to punctuality aside (if you are going to office hours, expect her to be running 30 mins behind), she does not give a lot of comments on your poems. And if you want a good grade, you have to edit it how she wants, no compromise."
2934,908352,3.0,4.0,"You really have to put the work in to get a good grade, and she does not round up.  Definitely feel like I learned a lot in her class, but it was a lot of work and I ultimately don't feel as though I received the grade I deserved."
2935,908352,4.0,4.0,"Some days I felt good being in class others, I didn't . There are little readings every night and a small write up. Nothing unbearable. This class won't be the brunt of your homework, but the portfolio's are heavy pts.  Paula tells you what your work is missing, but I didn't feel as thought I was guided enough."
2936,908352,4.0,3.0,"While her class was definitely a lot of work and her guidelines were not always clear, Paula was a great professor who really made her students want to try their best.  She was engaging and generally made sure not to assign too much ""busy work,"" though the class is definitely time consuming."
2937,908352,2.0,3.0,Really cares about her subject but if you don't like it beware
2938,908352,3.0,3.0,"Paula is a sweetheart, but her class is based a lot around what she likes to read and write in poetry. She isn't always open to other opinions and interpretations of poetry, so be prepared to have your poetry nudged towards what she wants to see. Sometimes it improves the poetry, sometimes it doesn't. Not an easy A, but not an impossible A either."
2939,908352,3.5,2.0,"A solid professor. You may not love her, but you wont regret taking a course by her. She does play favorites, but getting a good grade is attainable. Good, engaging subject material. Her own work is very good."
2940,908352,3.5,2.0,"Kind and supportive.  Prone to biases and favoring certain students, but even if you're not her favorite, a good grade is  attained with some work.  Quirky and engaging, and a fun seminar leader. I would recommend her, especially for students early in their education or discipline."
2941,908352,3.0,3.0,"Paula is nice, but kind of spacey.  She is a very good professor for students who are already good at her subject, and more difficult for others.  Don't use adjectives."
2942,908352,1.5,3.0,"i had this prof. for a 100-level english creative writing class.  She is possibly the most ambiguous, biased grader.  I went into her office to see what I can do to improve my paper, and she basically said, &quot;if i like it, i'll give you an A.&quot; Not helpful at all, has her favorites, stay away from her"
2943,908352,5.0,4.0,"Paula's writing workshops are always engaging and helpful: just the right balance of sincere appreciation and thoughtful suggestions. If you're just looking for a pat on the back, avoid her class. She'll expect you to work hard and grow as a writer. An added bonus is her delightful sense of humor and eagerness to form relationships with students!"
2944,1719361,5.0,4.0,"Dr J is a very smart professor, and he really cares about everyone in his class. Although his teaching is a bit fast paced, if you pay enough attention and ask questions you will get nearly everything (He likes asking him questions). He is very friendly, and try not to get out of his course without a good friendship with him."
2945,1719361,2.0,5.0,He goes through the slides SO fast. It's so much material and it's very hard to understand. He goes though examples very fast. I went to his office hours but left just as confused. Would not take this engineering seminar again
2946,1719361,4.0,2.0,"Dr. J is the only professor at Bucknell to have played basketball at MIT. He has amazing hair and is the most Anglican man I have ever met. He cares very deeply about his students. Sometimes gets flustered in class but ultimately feels like he owes it to his students to prepare them for real life. If you have a chance, sit down for a talk with him."
2947,1719361,4.0,1.0,"I love this man. Sure he gave us way to much homework sometimes, but it was all in our best interests. I can honestly say I came out a better person and more confident in my studies. Dr J is one of the most intelligent and underrated professors at Bucknell."
2948,1719361,2.0,4.0,"I'm convinced this professor doesn't want his students to do well in his class. Homeworks are often much more difficult than the problems we learn in lecture, or on topics that we never covered. The book isn't very useful either. The labs are really hard and too long. Students usually feel unprepared for exams. He's a pretty cool guy, though."
2949,1719361,2.0,4.0,Very bad in class. Very smart guy but is terrible at conveying the information to you. Better in a one-on-one setting.
2950,1719361,4.5,1.0,Pretty good and very helpful. The class is easy and straightforward.
2951,851009,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, very helpful, super nice, highly recommend! Easy to do well if you pay attention in lecture and take notes."
2952,851009,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Reeder's Behavioral Neuroendo. class is a must for any bio majors. While challenging, the class is stimulating, the labs are pertinent to class material, and you are guaranteed to walk out as a better biologist than you walked in."
2953,851009,5.0,1.0,Great teacher i have ever seen.. Very friendly too...
2954,851009,5.0,2.0,"Greatest teacher ever!!! Wish I can have her again.  Amazing lectures, never borring.  Tests can be hard but not if you study.  Overall, PERFECT TEACHER!!!"
2955,851009,4.0,2.0,"Good teacher- very passionate about organismal biology- tests are almost completely on the notes, and she'll tell you about anything that she's going to test on otherwise. Read the book, study the notes, don't hesitate to ask questions, and you'll be fine. Great lab professor as well."
2956,900161,3.5,3.0,"She has a bit of a weird way of explaining topics, especially when it comes to Data Structures, but she still makes sense. If you need her help, she'll walk you through every step and teach you tricks, you just have to make the effort to go to office hours."
2957,900161,1.5,3.0,"Gave very ambiguous exams and was an extremely harsh grader. It's basically full credit, half credit, or no credit on 20 point questions. However, there are a ton of extra credit opportunities. If you take the time to do them, you can do well in the class."
2958,900161,1.0,5.0,About as good of a professor as daffy duck would be as a speech therapist
2959,900161,5.0,1.0,Lots of extra credit opportunities. Don't have to do reading because lectures are clear enough. Very willing to help if you needed it. Overall good experience. 
2960,900161,4.5,3.0,"Her grading is very straightforward. She gives you a checklist that lists literally every element that she is going to look for when she tests your project. Quizzes are easy, tests are average, but you know what's going to be on both. The way the class is structured, you could not truly understand anything and still get an A if you're persistent. "
2961,900161,2.5,4.0,"I had her for Computer Science 204, and it was a very average experience. I liked her a lot more than my rating shows, but everything about this class is hard. If you don't show up to class, she knows and will say something about it, and if you don't get it right away you're going to have a hard time."
2962,900161,1.5,3.0,"She is very nice but her grading system is extremely aggravating.  Its hard to know what she wants from you on tests.  Her labs are confusing and she will spend all of the lab time with one student.  Her projects have minimal direction, which makes it hard to know what to do. They are also exceptionally difficult. I would try to get dif professor"
2963,900161,1.5,4.0,"Not recommended. Project handouts are extremely ambiguous and make understanding what she wants impossible. When going for help, she erases what she wrote on the board before you can take any notes. Doesn't circulate to help in lab sessions; stays with one person for 45mins+. You will have stressful nights trying to decrypt her project guidelines."
2964,900161,3.0,1.0,Generally good. The class is straight forward and fairly easy. But pretty boring too.
2965,900161,4.5,2.0,"Really cares about her students, good teacher."
2966,900161,3.0,1.0,"Very straightforward and fair. The material is kind of hard, but she gives you a good background. You get a free cheat sheet for every test too."
2967,900161,4.0,4.0,"Extremely knowledgeable and wants to see students succeed, lectures are a little scattered but questions are encouraged.  Be warned, the grading scheme for projects is harsh but you're always given information on exactly what is expected.  Tests/quizzes aren't too difficult.  Helpful in office hours."
2968,900161,1.5,4.0,"She obviously knows her stuff, but doesn't know how to teach to save her life. You will rely on the book to learn it yourself. Projects are overwhelming but easy grade boosters. In general the grading scheme is bad, and the labs are just straight up boring. She is quite nice and tries to help in office hours, but it doesn't always help."
2969,900161,3.5,2.0,"I thought she was cool. A little scatterbrained, but definitely friendly and approachable. Languages are her thing, so she had a lot of interest in 208. Thought the class was relatively easy too."
2970,900161,1.0,5.0,"She is terrible, never explains anything, and has the worst grading scheme ever known.  If you have t o take comp. sci do not take her as a professor, you will regret it."
2971,2606152,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sebree is an amazing professor! I'm a biology-related major, but I took her poetry workshop class to put some variety in my schedule and fill a writing requirement. 10/10 would take again! Lots of reading but 90% of it is pretty good poetry, and her feedback is really great! You will definitely grow as a writer &amp; have fun if you have her."
2972,68681,4.5,2.0,Great teacher!  Easily the best math teacher I have ever had.  He is from Wales and has the best stories and really makes class enjoyable.
2973,68681,4.5,2.0,"Awesome! He's got a really thick Scottish accent, and explains everything to death. If you're ever having problems, he is happy to help. Tests are slightly challenging, but Smith is truly awesome."
2974,68681,4.0,5.0,This is a true mathematician !
2975,68681,4.5,2.0,"he is an awesome guy, tries to clarify everything. even though  it sometimes gets too boring and hard to concentrate he makes good jokes to refresh the attention. there are few kids in the class which are his favorites and he keeps messing with them. don't worry about doing all the homeworks properly, just do them and you are fine."
2976,68681,4.0,4.0,"Howard Smith is THE MAN!  He is extremely helpful, very witty, and his accent is pretty sweet, too."
2977,68681,4.5,3.0,"Such an awesome guy!  A bit hard to understand at first, but very funny in lectures!  Very very helpful outside of class and really nice and approachable.  I would definately reccommend him!"
2978,68681,4.5,3.0,"I heard many scary things about Calc II but Prof. Smith made it very manageable and, almost, easy. He doesnt care if you come to class for as he says &quot;I wouldnt come.&quot;  Tests are fair, he never tries to trick you. Incredibly funny guy from Wales"
2979,68681,3.0,2.0,"ohhh howard.  111 is all about the greeks and stuff, easy quizzes once a week on handouts.  homework assignments can be challenging but not terrible.  nice guy who loves art"
2980,68681,3.5,3.0,"good guy, but goes off on wild tangents and seems to be from a different planet at times. he can be funny tho. his tests are pretty hard. his lectures are boring at times, but presents stuff in a pretty clear manner."
2981,68681,4.5,3.0,"Howard Smith is the GOD of calculus.  A very challenging professor, but definitely one of the best at the university.  Schedule one of his classes if you get the chance."
2982,68681,3.5,2.0,"the greatest man i have EVER met. yes, the homework is hard, but the helpsessions make it so much easier and it's not like they count for much anyways.  the tests much easier than the homeworks.  although math lectures are pretty boring his humor and actions made it enjoyable.  i learned a lot from him.  GREAT teacher!!!"
2983,68681,3.5,3.0,"He's a nice guy and a pretty good teacher, though sometimes he's hard to follow.  He goes on tangents sometimes and the homework can be very difficult (the tests too), but overall it was a good class."
2984,68681,3.0,4.0,homeworks are unbelieveably hard...will put you to sleep real quick early in the morning.  kinda a funny guy though if he's in the mood
2985,68681,4.5,3.0,such a cute welsh-man..i really liked him but i've heard of people that don't...goes off on serious tangents staring out the window and stuff...funny guy
2986,68681,2.5,3.0,nice guy but not it was hard to understand the way he taught...
2987,68681,2.5,1.0,"Very funny guy, goes off on tangents a lot which are funny but a bit distracting. He grades for accuracy, not attempt. Love him as a person and I wouldnt hate to take another of his classes but I will probably avoid it just because its hard to follow him for a subject that is already hard to follow."
2988,68681,3.0,3.0,"Funny guy, enjoyable class. everything went well until the final when he decided to not tell anyone that we couldn't use our calculators. When everyone showed up to the exam he told us &quot;No calculators for part 1&quot; (Like the whole test.) Totally screwed my grade over. U decide if you want to take him"
2989,68681,4.5,2.0,"He is a great funny guy. If you are taking math, definitely take prof. Smith."
2990,68681,5.0,4.0,he's great!
2991,68681,5.0,4.0,No Comments
2992,615498,5.0,2.0,"FREN 103 was super easy and I suck at French. The class work was very light and the material was interesting. There is HW daily but it's super easy plus you get the answers to ""grade yourself"". She's super nice and kind and will work with you for issues. "
2993,615498,5.0,3.0,"I love her. Shes so energetic and funny. She tries to make her classes enjoyable. If she sees that youre making an effort and that you participate multiple times, shell love you. Overall, very kind. Not much work and easy grader."
2994,615498,5.0,3.0,GOSSON IS AMAZING!! so passionate about french but very strict about cell phone usage so use at your own risk. Put in work and participate and she will LOVE you.
2995,615498,4.0,3.0,"I really liked Gosson. Thought she kept things entertaining at 8:30 in the morning. Everything about her class was great EXCEPT the stupid podcast. Was put with a partner who I have never seen put so little effort into a project before. Other than that, the class was perfect!"
2996,615498,1.0,3.0,"She is very unorganized, always has errors in her powerpoints, has a short temper and is not very understanding.  If you talk a lot she will like you."
2997,615498,4.5,2.0,such a nice professor! she seems to love what she does and is really enthusiastic.
2998,615498,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic professor. She is very friendly, approachable, and makes you want to do well. She is also very understanding and cares about her students beyond the classroom but doesn't pry. If you keep up on your homework and pay attention she's easy in the 100 level."
2999,615498,3.5,2.0,"She is pretty easy.  The homework isn't challenging, just read the text."
3000,615498,5.0,2.0,No Comments
3001,615498,5.0,1.0,"Awesome professor! Very helpful, very friendly and nice. She wants you to do well! Definitely take her if you can."
3002,615498,5.0,3.0,"awesome, to say the least. Good explanations, very friendly, keeps you awake with whatever activities, treats students well, and very enthusiastic. I difinitely enjoyed class with Madame Gosson"
3003,2292810,1.0,4.0,She was very bad at explaining and the tests did not reflect the material taught in class. Quizzes every week were brutal and the tests made up a significant portion of the grade. Avoid this class at all costs. Never went far enough in depth on the material and then would expect you to know it without ever covering it. 
3004,2292810,5.0,1.0,"Math211 is definitely a challenging class, but I really enjoyed Prof. Hamlet&#39;s explanations. She is clearly very passionate about math and teaching. I think the reason people are rating her so harshly is that she teaches a class that a lot of people fail. If you enjoy math, you will enjoy her class! Also, she is very cool person"
3005,2292810,1.0,1.0,"Professor Hamlet is the worst professor I've ever had. She is the definition of tenure. Despite being the head of the math department she is disorganized, bad at explaining the material, and unable to answer even the most basic questions. The fact she is the head of the math department is an embarrassment to Bucknell, she can barely teach Calc 1."
3006,2292810,1.0,5.0,"Professor hamlet is very unorganized, lectures are confusing. overall a nightmare of a teacher and class. avoid at all costs."
3007,2292810,2.0,4.0,"Hamlet really cares about her students and puts a lot of effort into the class/online videos/office hours -- she expects the same from you. Tons of work, more than any other math class. Her lectures can be very confusing to follow, ask a TON of questions. She can be flexible and accommodating just talk to her"
3008,2292810,1.0,4.0,Poor lectures. She goes off on tangents. She has poor knowledge of the material. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
3009,2292810,3.0,3.0,"Professor Hamlet was a very good Calculus professor. I thought she was extremely fair and really cared about her students. She never put any surprises on the exams and was a huge help in her office hours. She tailors her class to the needs of her students in class, which is very rare among most professors. She is one of the better ones for calc I."
3010,2292810,2.0,5.0,"She genuinely cares about her students, but in her performance in actually lecturing it comes through poorly. She's more than willing to lecture about how the class &quot;isn't listening enough&quot; while further being unclear on the material. She frequently has mistakes on her notes and the board, so be vigilant and pay attention."
3011,2292810,1.0,2.0,"To be honest, Professor Hamlet was my least favorite professor at Bucknell. I did well in the class, but at the cost of a lot of stress. In my opinion, I would avoid if you can."
3012,2292810,4.0,4.0,"Sometimes Professor Hamlet's lectures would get a little unclear, but after working an example it makes more sense. She is an extremely caring teacher and overall her class is very fair. If you study and occasionally go to office hours, you will do well, and she's always there to help you."
3013,2292810,2.0,4.0,"Lot's of homework, tests are very hard, not a very organized teacher."
3014,1631309,3.0,4.0,"Awesome person, a fair class, not the easiest, not the hardest. "
3015,1631309,4.5,3.0,"Everything she teaches is straight-forward. All her lessons are to teach you the ""tools"" you need. Tests are based on problems in the textbook. Sometimes she can be very quick and all that leaves you is enough time to copy down notes. I found myself not being able to comprehend the material in class when trying to catch up with her notes."
3016,1631309,1.5,4.0,curses a lot terrible handwriting never available for office hours i dont know if shes more boring or hard avoid at all costs
3017,1631309,5.0,1.0,"Great at explaining the concepts of calculus. All quizzes and test are based on the problems in the text and homework; therefore, if you put in the time to complete and understand the homework studying becomes significantly easier."
3018,1631309,3.5,3.0,Made calculus as it should be: quick and to the point. We just learned the essentials to making it through with the occasional mind number. Organized the class into lecture and problem session very well. Became too easy to blow off some point and slacked a lot though in the end. Try not to just copy the notes and cram them later! You'll fall behind
3019,1631309,5.0,2.0,"Jodi was a great Professor! If you try you can do very well! she tests from the book so you should make sure you do a lot of practice problems before the exams and rework all worksheets and hw. Overall college calc is supposed to be hard so dont come in lackadaisical. she is helpful during office hours, gives extra credit & curves well."
3020,1631309,3.0,3.0,"Calc II is easier to grasp with Jodi than Calc I. She just gives you the tools you need for your ""tool box"" as she says. She gives examples throughout class which you use to guide yourself through problems. All exams and quizzes are based on problems in notes or homework. No surprise, just study. Overall class exam grades vary from 40% to 90+%."
3021,1631309,3.0,4.0,"Jodi is a really fun lady. It's pretty obvious she's a first year teacher, however, she tries her best and I think she has potential to be a good teacher. Sometimes she comes off confusing, but if you do the work and study, you'll be fine on her tests. They're not easy, though"
3022,1631309,3.5,2.0,"Prof Jodi is a wonderful teacher. She's engaging and very concrete with what she wants to teach for that day. You have to put a lot of your spare time to study for exams and stuff, but they are no surprise. If you want a true crazy mathematician, Jodi's a good option."
3023,1631309,4.5,4.0,"Professor Jodi is pretty good. She makes time for her students and really tries to explain things you don't understand in office hours.  Exams are really hard, but if you do homework, you have a fair shot."
3024,1631309,3.0,2.0,"Prof. Jodi makes class legitimately fun; she's quirky and humorous. Also, she goes to great lengths to engage students, and is always willing to help."
3025,1631309,1.0,4.0,Professor Black is a first year professor and is not good at all. She lectures straight out of the book and EVERYTHING is based on theory and concepts of calculus and not actually of learning and doing math problems.
3026,1485906,4.0,3.0,Great professor she really knows how to teach the subject. Class seems to fly by because of all the practice problems we do in class. Her homework is very useful and there is nothing unexpected on her tests. She is a wonderful teacher and very helpful if you get a chance to have she is amazing
3027,1674323,4.5,2.0,"Sik is very enthusiastic about art history. She grades fairly, and if you put in a lot of effort/show great improvement she will recognize that. Although the class could have been more interactive, her lectures were interesting. She's always willing to help, and does not assign nightly homework. I highly recommend her."
3028,2341972,4.0,3.0,Really loved Vernengo. Had for macro and he's super passionate - as long as you show you care (office hours/do your work/go to class) you will do totally fine in the course. One of my fav professors in generally and specifically within the econ department. 
3029,2341972,5.0,3.0,He is a great person and also a very knowledgeable professor. He knows a lot about Economics history and is good at explaining you the magic behind Economics. He likes to make an entertaining class and care for his students. Sit in the front and don't use a computer in class tho! He does not like when people are distracted in class.
3030,2341972,5.0,3.0,"Hands down, one of the best professors at Bucknell. He is very knowledgeable in his field and will make sure the student understand the material taught."
3031,1797206,2.0,5.0,I received a D on the first exam. I then had 24 points taken off because I wrote f = ma instead of f(vector) = ma(vector). None of the questions were incorrect just the formula was written wrong. My grade never recovered and I ended up dropping the class. 
3032,1797206,4.0,4.0,"Professor Amthor is a solid choice and is able to explain the material. However it is hard to hear him in lectures. Does not always respond to emails, but available during office hours. 211 is challenging but manageable if you out the effort and time in."
3033,1797206,4.0,4.0,Prof. Amthor is a great guy who wants to help his students! He is willing to explain things until you understand it and his method of explaining is thorough and logical. He sometimes speaks quietly in lectures but most of the time I can follow him. The class itself is challenging but 100% doable if you put in the time.
3034,1797206,3.0,4.0,Overall good guy but do your readings or homework will become difficult
3035,1797206,5.0,4.0,"Very thorough and helpful lectures. I loved the layout of this class. This was the first time I felt such a strong connection between the lecture and labs. Matt was fairly accessible outside of class. The exams and labs were pretty difficult, but not ridiculously so. As long as you don't expect him to explain everything for you, he's very helpful."
3036,1797206,4.0,3.0,He's nice and not bad
3037,1797206,5.0,1.0,"had him for lab, he wasn't bad at all, was understanding, but i can see where he can be confusing in his explanations."
3038,1797206,1.0,3.0,Horrible at giving help. When he tries to explain things he just ends up creating more confusion and leaving you to sort it out.
3039,173143,1.0,5.0,Took her during the partially remote learning COVID semester. Online lectures were slideshows that she flew through and moved on even though it was extremely dense with material. Asking questions did not help. Grading was possibly the hardest I've ever seen and the tested material was harder than anything we went over. Could not recommend less.
3040,173143,5.0,4.0,"Dee is one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell. I had her for Orgo 1 and 2, and she's amazing for both. She makes you work for your grade, but you'll be fine if you do the worksheets she posts and study her PowerPoints. She is always willing to help you out, and engages the class well (her chemistry songs are great!). Definitely recommend."
3041,173143,5.0,5.0,"I LOVE Dr. Casteel. She is HARD, but her expectations are so clear. I had never taken a chemistry course before taking orgo. I struggled so much at first, visited office hours a couple times, and I was able to figure out how to do well. She cares about your success. Do the textbook problems bc she puts them on tests like she says!"
3042,173143,5.0,4.0,"Love Casteel! She's super funny and quirky, and she has a lot of tips and tricks that you don't get from other orgo professors at Bucknell. My advice is to use her powerpoints like a Bible. The textbook takes much longer to understand."
3043,173143,5.0,3.0,Teaches a lot (more than other CHEM212 professors). Great professor.
3044,173143,1.0,5.0,"Easily worst professor Ive had at Bucknell. Makes it unreasonably hard, especially if you had someone else for orgo 1. Take a different professor and get a higher grade, Simple as that. I was forced into taking her class due to being the last scheduling period and my grade is a reflection of that. I worked very hard but in the end she didnt curve"
3045,173143,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Very passionate, engaging, informative, and funny. The class is hard, and you need to do the work, but Casteel provides you with everything you need to succeed. One of my favorite professors at Bucknell."
3046,173143,4.0,3.0,"Probably my favorite professor from freshman year. The class was pretty basic and got increasingly harder. Started off doing very well and slowly did a little worse, but not bad. I also had not taken chem since 10th grade. However as a teacher, I like her, she is to the point and quite funny at times."
3047,173143,4.0,2.0,"If you have taken AP Chem in high school and understood everything, this class is an easy A or A-. Professor Casteel was nice and funny/quirky, but if I hadn't taken AP Chem, I don't think I would have done well with her teaching style. Recitation is expected, but the way she sets up worksheets is odd. She also took a while giving back grades."
3048,173143,5.0,4.0,"Orgo is difficult no matter who you take it with, but Dee gives you all the tools/opportunities to do well if you have a slight proclivity in science.  You MUST stay up to date on the material/cramming does not work. She gives you a ton of practice worksheets/recitation packets/uses textbook practice on exams.  You have to work hard  for sure."
3049,173143,4.0,4.0,"Organic Chemistry is a very hard class no matter who your teacher is, but Casteel is a good teacher. She moves very quickly, which I don't like. Make sure you actually do the textbook reading and problems that she assigns for outside of class! I know it seem like a lot but trust me it will make or break your grade."
3050,173143,5.0,3.0,"Dee is literally my favorite person. She is so cool and so smart. While orgo is obviously a tough course, she really does a thorough job teaching the material. Her lectures go by quickly so you really need to reinforce what you learn in class with the textbook problems outside of class. If you don't do the textbook problems, you're in trouble."
3051,173143,2.5,5.0,Very willing to answer any question asked.  Exams are impossible.  Someone should teach this prof how to design a test.  Questions presented in the course work do not even come close to the difficulty level on the Exams.  Difficult just to be difficult.
3052,173143,2.0,4.0,Enjoys being difficult.  She will answer questions but do not expect help past the question that you have asked.  Brutal tests with questions that are far more difficult than anything presented.  Make the jump on your own
3053,173143,2.0,4.0,Casteel is funny and quirky but I learned nothing during her actual lectures. She went so fast I didn't know what she was talking .The textbook was a life saver. Her office hours helped a bit but if it wasn't for help from my study group leader I would have done very poorly. Tests are not that hard but she doesn' give enough time to learn the info.
3054,173143,5.0,4.0,"Orgo is obviously a super hard class but Casteel did a great job of teaching it.  She posts long objectives before every test and quiz which are very helpful.  She really emphasizes doing book problems to learn the material.  If you do what she asks, getting a good grade is very doable."
3055,173143,3.0,5.0,"Awesome teacher.  Hard grader, but fair.  You leave the class knowing the material down cold.  Sadly she is now a Dean"
3056,173143,4.5,5.0,"This was one of the hardest classes I have ever taken, but I came out really knowing my stuff about organic chemistry. Casteel is an amazing teacher who really has a caring interest in the success of her students. Definately take this class, just be prepared to work really hard."
3057,173143,5.0,3.0,Very good teacher. Tests are a little hard.
3058,173143,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher, just very difficult class"
3059,173143,3.0,4.0,"such a hard teacher. I had to drop this class and take a w!!! if u haf a choice, def not take her."
3060,173143,5.0,3.0,"I heard horror stories both about orgo and about Casteel but I found that she is a fun, entertaining teacher. When she left for a weeklong conference, we actually all missed her! She makes sure you know what you're doing, and if she corrects you she does it nicely. I can't wait to be in orgo2 next semester! Her labs are awesome too."
3061,173143,5.0,3.0,Prof. Casteel explains everything thoroughly and doesn't hesitate to help if you do something wrong.
3062,173143,4.0,5.0,"If you wanna actually learn organic, she's the way to go. If you wanna just sleep through organic, she is definitely not the one u should be taking."
3063,173143,5.0,5.0,Difficult
3064,173143,1.0,5.0,Took organic chem with her; crazy woman. Incredibly hard-you'll die with her tests or her teaching style.
3065,173143,3.0,5.0,First semester 97 was horrible.  I was working double as hard as any other freshmen.  Got a b- in her class. Took orgo with someone else next semester and got an A. She gives tons of work.
3066,173143,5.0,5.0,No Comments
3067,173143,1.5,5.0,She is a total hag!  STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM HER CLASSES!
3068,173143,5.0,4.0,"Yes, she's a difficult teacher. However, if you work hard you can still keep your grades high. She knows her material down cold and isn't afraid to make fun of herself to get it across. I'm so glad I took her, even though I don't like Chemistry. She's definitely worth the work."
3069,173143,2.5,4.0,"I took her class 1st semester at bucknell in 97.  She made me think college was going to be impossible.  Don't take her, she's really hard and grades devilishly.  Took another prof. 2nd semester and got an A, understood the material too."
3070,173143,4.0,4.0,"Good at explaining things, but a extremly hard grader, grades exactly no partial credit given"
3071,173143,4.0,3.0,"Not the easiest teacher, but not really really hard.  Just pay attention.  And her tests are not THAT hard."
3072,173143,5.0,3.0,I got a 100 on the final.  She's fun.  If you do good on easy quizzes you can drop a test grade.
3073,173143,3.5,5.0,"Hardest teacher I've ever had.  While I learned a lot, her tests are torture.  You can think you totally understand whats going on, and then she craps all over you with her exams.  Don't take Casteel if grades are important to you."
3074,173143,2.0,5.0,Had her for lab: she is psycho in her rainbow tie dye lab coat.  She paces around the room critiqueing you at your lab station...it is scary.
3075,173143,1.5,3.0,annoying and doesn't understand that everyone is not an organic chem person
3076,173143,2.0,4.0,"She is a feminist, which is fine. However she carries it to the extreme of eagerly helping female students and being very impatient with male students."
3077,173143,1.0,5.0,This Woman is the Devil
3078,173143,5.0,5.0,"You have to do a lot of work, but you understand everything much better than with easier teachers. She makes it make sense."
3079,676951,2.0,4.0,"He is not the easiest professor for someone who has never been exposed to stats material before. It was clear he was very smart, but this caused him to often get frustrated by questions and students getting wrong answers. Also, he was not welcoming at all for students to come to office hours."
3080,676951,3.0,4.0,"Frey is a bit too educated to be teaching an intro-level statistics course. Although he is clear, he does not completely cover the entire material and basically expects you to learn everything yourself. His exams are very short (each question is worth like 20 points...), but he is rather easier on grading."
3081,676951,1.5,3.0,"Honestly, he is the worst professor I have ever gotten in Bucknell. If you ask questions, he would tell you to 'read your notes' . Also, his exams are not hard yet ridiculous. Sometimes he will have 40 percents of his exams be about something he never talked about in the class. His handouts are more useful than his lectures."
3082,676951,3.0,4.0,"He is a very intelligent man and has a good heart. But he seems to be too smart to teach a Stat 1 course. When you ask about a concept or a problem, all he says is ""go reread the chapter"". Students do that and still don't understand. He never tells you what is on the test and he always puts the one concept no one knows and it screws everyone grade."
3083,676951,4.5,4.0,"He assigns homework twice a week and although they are challenging with no partial credit, he give more questions than actually count so you can receive extra credit. He is very clear and his notes are helpful. He follows the book almost exactly but his quizzes are very specific. Tests are all cumulative but fair. Awesome professor, very passionate"
3084,676951,2.5,5.0,The class got drastically more difficult throughout the semester. He teaches the class so unlike every other section of stat at Bucknell. There's homework due twice a week (saturday at 5...) and they're so hard with no partial credit. Every test throughout the semester is cumulative and he doesn't tell you what's going to be on them at all.
3085,676951,1.5,5.0,"The most horrendous professor I have had at Bucknell. Smart guy, but doesnt know how to help students, and when we asked questions he would get so sidetracked trying to tell us to study that he would never answer the question asked. No partial credit on homework making it easy to fail. Tests are few problems worth many points, so grades drop quick."
3086,676951,3.5,4.0,"When I went to office hours several times he was condescending. If you ask him a question he gives you a 5 minute explanation that doesnt really help. However, in class he is very clear. His exams are consistent with homework and classwork and he is VERY fair with partial credit. He is a harder math 226 professor though."
3087,676951,4.5,3.0,"had him for stats. great guy. helpful. Know's his stuff, and expains it well. the more you put in, the more you'll get out. he works out"
3088,676951,4.0,2.0,"Nice guy. He's in great shape for his age! He is excited about his subject and very helpful. Sometimes he gets too involved in explaining useless details and skips the main, important facts."
3089,676951,5.0,3.0,"If you plan to take STAT class, don't hesitate to choose him! He is the best professor who's good at teaching I've met in Bucknell."
3090,676951,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, makes it easy to learn the material, not a hard class at all"
3091,676951,5.0,4.0,I had the most amazing math course in my life with Professor Frey. He is such a knowledgeable person and seems to be very passionate of what he is doing. I learned so much in his class. Keep in mind that his classes are not an easy A. You will have to work A LOT but what you will get out of the class will worth it!!
3092,676951,5.0,4.0,"Lectures are EXTREMELY well organized and clear.  The class is demanding and you should be prepared to spend lots of time on homework/exam review, but this is a class where for every ounce of effort you give, you get back a pound of knowledge.  Very fair grader.  Definitely take a stats course with Prof Frey if you can."
3093,676951,4.0,4.0,Prof Frey is a good teacher but he is defi hard.  I think after sitting in his class you will have a sense of achievement that you have learned something.  He does teach a little more than the textbook but his tests are not bad at all.  Take only if you want to learn your stats well and are ready to work hard.  He is a very fair grader.
3094,676951,4.0,5.0,"He is very tough, but you will learn more with him than with any other professor. His hw is tough, and he isn't the best teacher. You should take him if you really want to know 303/304. Because he will make you learn it."
3095,676951,4.0,3.0,I thought this class was really hard but Prof. Frey is a nice guy and if you go for extra help he really will devote time to helping you.  I don't know what people mean by the fact that he has a split personality that he's mean but I never saw it.  I thought he was very helpful and did his best to teach the material in class when it was confusing
3096,676951,3.0,3.0,"this is the perfect case of someone having a split personality. don't let him fool you, as nice as he seems at first, wait untill the end of the semester and then BAM his evil twin emerges and completely screws you."
3097,676951,2.5,5.0,"Online homeworks are a major pain. He explains certain concepts, but then sometimes ask questions either in an unclear manner or requiring other information he has not given or thoroughly gone over."
3098,676951,1.0,5.0,"Horrible, please run away."
3099,549975,4.0,3.0,"She's a really nice and energetic professor. She really encourages class participation, so make sure to participate otherwise your grade might suffer. As long as you participate often in class discussions and put a decent amount of effort into your papers and studying for quizzes, you should do just fine. Really interesting class."
3100,549975,3.5,2.0,"She was extremely energetic and had a fantastic personality.  A lot of reading was assigned but if you paid attention in class and didn't read you could stell pull out a B+ or A-.  She was a little tough on grading her ""quizes"" which actually should have been called exams.  But overall a very interesting course."
3101,549975,2.5,4.0,Honestly the worst class i have taken at Bucknell. She is a very tough grader and the class is extremely boring. Two long papers that are so vague on topics. She is a strict grader and does not help you at all during office hours. Avoid at all costs.
3102,549975,1.5,4.0,"Class is boring. Way to much reading between classes. Her grading is completely random, and if you ask her a reason for your grade she simply says I rarely grade wrong, so dont ask. She picks favorites. My absolutely least favorite professor at Bucknell."
3103,549975,2.5,4.0,"Heavy on class participation. Have to read alot, talks likes shes reading an essay."
3104,549975,4.0,4.0,Very helpful and easy to go and talk to but a very hard grader; your papers need to be perfection!
3105,549975,1.0,1.0,Too easy. i learned nothing and got an A. She's disorganized and evil.
3106,549975,5.0,2.0,"energetic proffessor with interesting subject matter, class is mostly just a discussion/debate class without too much work...tests were easy, paper were graded a little tougher, regular attendance and decent notes will bag you an A or B. She's very friendly and helpful"
3107,173146,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pizzorno was one of the best teachers I have ever had. She cares about your understanding of the material more than anything which was important to me. In order to do well, show you care about your grade by going to office hours and making private meetings with her. Also, read the textbook everyday before class or you will be lost."
3108,173146,5.0,4.0,"Overall, Professor Pizzorno is very knowledgeable and wants everyone to succeed in the class. She offers a lot of opportunities to go for extra help. My only problem with the class is that the tests are EXTREMELY difficult because the content is much more specific then what is taught in class. You will probably never be fully prepared for tests."
3109,173146,5.0,4.0,Dr. Pizzorno is by far the best bio 205 professor. Bio 205 is an extremely hard course especially if you are taking it first semester but Dr. Pizzorno cares whether you really understand it. She is always accessible outside office hours and there to help during office hours so go to them if you are confused at all! Read the txt book n do the Ws's!
3110,173146,5.0,5.0,"BIOL205 is 100% the hardest class that I have ever taken and I did struggle however Professor Pizzorno was extremely helpful! She was always willing to look over my old test with me, answered all my questions, and gave me tons of study strategies with helped so much! She is super sweet and loves to help her students! Don't be afraid to ask for help"
3111,173146,5.0,4.0,"Pizzorno explains the content well and teaches in accordance with the slides. She is very critical on tests and quizzes, but only takes off a few points. If you go to class and participate you will do well in the class."
3112,173146,5.0,4.0,"She's a very clear lecturer, cares about her students, and truly wants you to learn. She gives an A to the top ten percent of the class, so you really have to work for it! But it's worth it; I learned a lot, and it helped me a lot on the MCAT."
3113,173146,5.0,5.0,"Pizzorno is amazing. She is one of the sweetest ladies in the department but my god is she a tough grader. Finished with a B in the class, and I was in the upper percentile of the class so look out if u take her for the 205. Happy I had her though as she really pushed me to do my best"
3114,173146,4.0,4.0,"Definitely study for this class. I worked hard for a B but its worth it in the end. There is no reason to fear this class unless you are not willing to spend the time it takes to know the material inside and out. Her test questions make you think about connections between concepts. Beware, this class is more than just memorization."
3115,173146,4.0,5.0,"Cellular biology is very tough. Pizzorno is a great person and intelligent, she uses lots of analogies that make the topics seem simple and you loose sign of complexity. She is super nice but often really busy as she teaches lots of classes. She does not work with my teaching style and basically re-reads the book to you."
3116,173146,3.0,5.0,Tests are awful and do not represent the level in which the material is presented in class.  You must make the jump on your own. She will answer any question asked but does not take her answers to the level that she requires for answers on her tests.
3117,173146,5.0,4.0,"The class itself is hard and even if you know the information by heart you may get a bad grade, but Pizzorno is a great teacher and really cares about students. If you go to office hours she will reassure you and spend hours answering your questions and emphasizing what you will be tested on."
3118,173146,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, I wish I could take all my classes from her! She's really helpful and will go way out of her way to meet with you (and bring her dog Darwin in to cheer everyone up!). TAKE CLASSES FROM THIS AMAZING WOMAN!!"
3119,173146,4.5,3.0,"BIOL205 is definitely a hard class and you have to put the work in, but Pizzorno was really an awesome teacher to help get through it. She seemed very passionate about what she was teaching, and really wanted all of us to do well. She was extremely helpful if you needed it. Very approachable and charismatic. Loved her!"
3120,173146,4.5,3.0,She is great at explaining things and keeping us engaged during lecture.  If you go to her office hours she will be super helpful and explain any questions you need. Reading is very reasonable and tests are difficult but reasonable. Very charasmatic and knowledgable! Love her! Best teacher/prof I've had!
3121,173146,5.0,1.0,"Take Phage Hunters!!! Dr. Pizzorno is hilarious, very knowledgeable and very approachable! Even though I found the computer research for the second semester to be more dry than wet lab, it was great being led by Dr. Pizzorno! The journal clubs were easier and she made an effort to mix up class time."
3122,173146,4.0,2.0,Very Helpful. Especially at her office hours. Really nice person in general as well.
3123,173146,5.0,2.0,"Really loved this course and professor. She was entertaining even at 8 am. The subject matter was interesting and she presented it in a clear, straight forward way. There was a lot of information to study, but if you knew the notes you were fine."
3124,173146,5.0,3.0,She is the best research professor ever.  She really makes you understand what techniques you are doing and is really nice and helpful.  She is the best ever.
3125,173146,5.0,3.0,She is GREAT!!!! THE BEST EVER!!!
3126,173146,4.5,4.0,Great Professor
3127,173146,5.0,4.0,Very challenging but you will learn a lot.  I learned way more about **** simplex virus than i ever thought i would.  Really cool prof.
3128,173146,4.5,3.0,Great teacher. Explains things well. Tests are a little difficult.
3129,1074270,5.0,5.0,"Ben is one of my favorite professors I've had at Bucknell. I was terrible at physics but he still made it fun. If he taught a non-physics class, I would definitely take a class with him again. He is the best kind of professor because even if the subject is really difficult, he still makes it enjoyable because of his encouragement and positivity."
3130,1074270,2.0,5.0,"Ben is a cool guy but physics 211 is an awful, awful class. Lectures are super confusing and I honestly considered not showing up several times in the semester."
3131,1074270,5.0,3.0,"He's really knowledgeable, especially when it comes to physics. His lectures are inspirational"
3132,1074270,4.0,3.0,I had him for problem session and he does a very good job of explaining the lecture material and assigned problems that confused me. He is very approachable and is very knowledgeable if your looking to hear about some cool applications for the material.
3133,1074270,5.0,3.0,"To say that he is an amazing Professor is an understatement. If you truly want to learn the material, he will do everything in his power to help you. His lectures are extremely informative, his office hours beyond useful, and he is just a great person overall. I would highly recommend taking a class with him if you can!"
3134,1074270,5.0,3.0,"Keeps lectures interesting and is very thorough in the explanation of the material. Extremely smart. Go to lecture and ask for help during problem session if you need it, should pass no problem."
3135,1074270,4.5,2.0,"I had Professor Ben for PHYS211 lectures and also problem sessions. His lectures were quite good. In the problem sessions, you are sitting in the driver's seat; if you don't ask for help you simply won't get it (or at least you won't get what you need), and that's only fair enough. He treats us as responsible grownups and that respectable."
3136,1074270,4.0,2.0,Overall a great teacher
3137,1074270,5.0,3.0,"Amazing (but fast) lectures, but make sure you read the material beforehand if you want to get the most out of his lectures!"
3138,1074270,4.0,3.0,"Ben gives great lectures and clear as he teaches. If you ever need extra help, his, and the physics professors, doors are always open for question and office hours. Tests come back the day after you take the test, and are difficult, but definitely do-able. I recommend Ben and the entire physics department."
3139,1074270,4.0,3.0,"Awesome lecturer for physics. Encourages you to ask questions, so do so even though it's a big lecture with a lot of students. Very willing to help you understand the material well."
3140,1074270,4.0,1.0,"If you don't preview the material you'll feel confused; otherwise you'll be fine, get decent grades and enjoy the sci-fi jokes everywhere in the lecture : )"
3141,1074270,5.0,3.0,"Ben is the man. He is an amazing teacher. He is very clear, and is willing to help."
3142,1074270,4.5,3.0,"Ben is an excellent teacher, who knows can not only teach the subject matter, but also discuss more in depth topics with ease and clarity."
3143,1074270,5.0,1.0,"He was my lecture and problem session professor. Just like every other class, all you have to do is pay attention and do the work whether it is mandatory or not. If you need help he's there for you and really goes out of his way to make sure you understand physics."
3144,1074270,4.5,3.0,"I like this guy! I don't know what these other posts are talking about. I think he is very willing to answer questions, he explains things well, he has a good sense of humor, and the whole department has a very good system for office hours. Unlike the last post, I had no interest in physics coming into this class but I find myself liking it more."
3145,1074270,1.0,5.0,"He is by far my least favorite professor I have had so far. He seems put off when I go for help, doesn't really explain very well. There goes my GPA and any inclination to learn physics, however small it may have been in the first place."
3146,1074270,5.0,4.0,No Comments
3147,1074270,3.5,4.0,"Him and his department all try to help out. They all post their office hours, so if one isn't available, you can see another one. Physics is not a class where you can just get away without reading and without doing the homeworks.  They give away easy points just for reading the book. It was a challenging class, but I came out knowing my physics."
3148,1068128,5.0,2.0,Ben-Fred is by far one of the best profs I have every had. She is a super kind person who really cares about her students. Her class was taught well and was pretty easy. As a course full of first years she put in the extra mile to help us adjust to college life. Almost all of the projects were group work which is not for everyone.
3149,1068128,5.0,3.0,"This is a class that I genuinely looked forward to going to, which is all thanks to her. Professor Benfred is an inspirational teacher/person who genuinely cares about the success of her students. I would 100% take another class of her's."
3150,1068128,5.0,4.0,"BenFred was one of my favorite biology professors. She knows her stuff and teaches it in such an inspiring way. She cares about her students and will help you as much as you ask for it. I learned so much, but you have to work hard to get the most out of the class, which in turn will help you do well."
3151,1068128,1.0,4.0,This was an unpleasant semester to say the least.
3152,1068128,2.0,5.0,This was my worse experience in the bio department. Shes a nice person but didnt understand why an entire class was frustrated at her for not testing us on the material. We were taught straight from the textbook. Wouldn't have bothered showing up to class if not for the in-class quizzes bc we would do nothing. Will likely be my lowest grade ever.
3153,1068128,4.5,3.0,Bio205 is a pretty difficult class overall and Professor Benowitz knows that so she is so good about helping out. She gives you all the resources to succeed so don't wait until after the first tough test to take advantage of them! She genuinely wants everyone to do well so talk to her and do not cram!!
3154,1068128,4.0,3.0,"Professor Benowitz-Fredericks is an amazing professor! Her tests are tough, but if you work really hard to understand the application of the material you will be rewarded! As for every class, you must study after each lecture because there are cumulative concepts and you will get lost fast. My one recommendation is to keep up with the material!"
3155,1068128,4.5,3.0,I LOVE Benowitz-Fredericks. She is so sweet and I would have failed lab without her. She saved every single one of my lab reports. I also spent so much time in her office hours that I got to talk to her about other things and she is an awesome person!
3156,1068128,4.0,3.0,"Benowitz is an absolute sweetheart, this class is hard, but she really helps you and wants you to be successful, she is super helpful in office hours and any other time, tests are tough but thats because the material is touch, completely recommend her. "
3157,1068128,4.5,4.0,Loved her. Hated the class. She definitely made Bio 205 tolerable.
3158,1068128,4.5,4.0,"She is extremely caring and really looks out for you and your grade. Her test are tough and she admits that, but she's totally inviting and office hours are fun"
3159,1068128,5.0,4.0,"The class itself is very hard and you need to keep up with the readings to do well- which I did not do.  Benowitz-Fredericks is amazing though, very nice and helpful and really wants you to do well."
3160,1068128,5.0,3.0,"She is a fantastic professor and a genuinely caring person! She does everything possible to help students succeed. Her exams can be pretty hard, but you really learn the material. I would absolutely recommend her, but don't expect a cakewalk."
3161,1068128,5.0,2.0,She cared a lot about her students and she genuinely wanted everyone to learn.  She was fair on grading and great to go to office hours.  I would highly recommend her.
3162,1068128,4.0,3.0,"Very interested in the material and her students. Extremely excited to be there and to help. I would recommend this class, but it is a lot of work. Keep up with the material and you'll do fine."
3163,1068128,4.5,5.0,Great teacher but impossibly hard
3164,1068128,3.5,5.0,"I preferred her lectures over Chernin's in class. However, I got more out of office hours with Chernin. It's a hard course, especially if you go into it having no idea how to study"
3165,1068128,5.0,2.0,"Great professor and passionate about teaching. Always there to help you if you need it. Just show up and take notes in class, go over study guide she hands out, and you will do well."
3166,1068128,5.0,2.0,I love Dr. Benowitz! She is enthusiastic about biology and is so good at explaining processes in a way the class can understand. Can't wait to take another class with her!
3167,1068128,5.0,2.0,Absolutely the BEST professor I've had in my college career. I had her for baby bio and bio 206 and I guarantee I wouldn't have made it through 206 without her.
3168,1068128,5.0,3.0,"Probably the best class I've taken at Bucknell. Professor Benowitz-Fredericks was extremely helpful, interesting, and focused on topics that were relevant to the students. There was never a dull moment."
3169,1068128,4.5,5.0,Really nice.  Tests are unbelievably tough.  I took 4 of her tests and still couldn't figure out what she wanted/ what to study.  Rely on lab to bring your grade up.
3170,1068128,5.0,3.0,So helpful! Wants you to get a good grade.
3171,1068128,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I have ever had in my life. She is very passionate and it shows in her teachings. Her tests aren't too bad if you put in the work. She is very helpful outside of class and also just to talk to about life in general. I highly recommend her!
3172,1068128,5.0,2.0,"Really great professor! Not too difficult, but super helpful if you are having trouble! Very recommended!"
3173,1068128,3.5,5.0,"Way too hard, tests are completely unfair and all subjective. If you want a good grade dont take her. Very nice and helpful person, horrible teacher."
3174,1068128,5.0,5.0,Very nice and outgoing.  Always available for help or to just chat about interesting things.
3175,1068128,5.0,2.0,I was taking this class as an easy science elective and ended up loving it! Prof. Benowitz-fredericks makes everything interesting and easy to understand. It's hard to be bored in her class and not a lot of work at all
3176,1068128,4.0,1.0,....
3177,1068128,5.0,4.0,Professor Benowitz-Fredericks is a great professor for an intro Biology course because of her clarity and passion for the subject. She makes an effort to know every student and is willing to take time outside of class to help anyone who needs it.
3178,1068128,5.0,4.0,a great prof and very interesting; she is very helpful both inside and outside class... if you can get her for a lab instructor i would HIGHLY recommend it; exams are difficult but there are many opportunities to earn extra points.  she really wants all of her students to do well in the class...
3179,1068128,5.0,3.0,"Labs stress me out, but Professor Benowitz made this class do-able. She is the most out-going professor and she really wants everyone to do well. If you put in the effort, she will make sure you get the grade you deserve. She took hard subjects and explained them in 100 different ways until they were understood. Greatest professor for this lab!"
3180,1068128,4.0,3.0,easy class. don't bother buying the text book. the exams were straight out of the notes. class no mandatory but you won't have to study hard if you go to class.  she really wants you to do well so the tests were always curved.
3181,1068128,5.0,2.0,By far my favorite professor at Bucknell. Tests were very fair and she made lectures and labs enjoyable.
3182,1068128,5.0,3.0,One of the best teachers! Her lectures are anything but boring. Her tests are semi-hard just because she wants you to apply what you know to real senarios She has plenty of other opportunities to earn points and bring your grade up. She is willing to meet with you at any time and she is EXTREMELY helpful!
3183,1068128,5.0,2.0,"One of the best, most patient and caring teachers I've ever had! She's great. Finally someone who actually cares about her students!"
3184,1068128,5.0,1.0,Awesome prof.  Actually makes bio interesting for non-majors.  Exams were easy and she gives you a bunch of other easy points to raise your grade.  Strongly recommended if you're looking to fulfill a lab science requirement.
3185,1068128,5.0,3.0,Best lab section ever - got to listen to music in lab! She was super helpful and really friendly. Graded labs a little hard at first.
3186,173152,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Exner is an interesting old guy. Don't take him unless you truly want to learn Math. There's a lot of work and exams are hard, but you will learn a lot and the grading is not tough. Office hours are very helpful but usually you need to queue."
3187,173152,1.0,5.0,"He literally not teach; Please expected to teach yourself in the god damn class. During the classtime, he will just sit on the student chair and let students to lecture. "
3188,173152,1.0,5.0,"Avoid at all costs. Very rude, unfriendly, and muddled explanation. He should not teach first-years. No, he shouldn't teach Bucknellians."
3189,173152,5.0,5.0,"I must admit that there are a bunch of homework and the exams are unimaginably hard, yet the grading standard is not that tough. If you read the course material carefully and pay full attention in the class you can learn a lot. It is stressful to take his course but also really beneficial."
3190,173152,2.0,5.0,"This class was very difficult, even when I had taken Calculus 1 before. The lectures don't really make much sense but you still need to go to hand in homework. We typically had about 3 different homeworks a night which was annoying."
3191,173152,3.0,4.0,"Put in effort and he'll like you. There is a lot of homework, and don't rely on chegg or anywhere online for answers-- you'll get sent to the judicial board"
3192,173152,3.0,5.0,"Prof Exner is a very understanding professor, however, I felt like he didn't teach the material rather u had to learn it on ur own outside of class. Luckily I had taken calc in high school so I already knew most things. If you have never taken calc don't take it w/ this professor. He expects u to already know everything. Goes thru sections fast!!!"
3193,173152,2.0,5.0,"It was a lot of work he does to help you out, but the workload is crazy and sometimes unmanageable. Nice guys when you talk to him and get to know them. Take good notes and write down everything he says."
3194,173152,3.0,4.0,"Prof Exner has a tough rep, but if you go to office hours and do the work you will be okay."
3195,173152,5.0,5.0,"Ok so in all honestly his class is hard. There is A LOT of homework, but you will not get another teacher that cares as much as he does. Not only does he care about if you understand the material he cares about how you are doing personally. Very good teacher."
3196,173152,4.0,5.0,"Despite what I've filled out, Professor Exner is not a terrible professor. He is one of the nicest and most caring that I have come by. However, he does hold a VERY high standard for his students. If you are going to take his class (or get stuck in it like I did), GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS. Go as much as possible and ask as many questions as you can."
3197,173152,5.0,4.0,"Professor Exner's class isn't necessarily hard, it's just A LOT of work outside of class. He takes attendance very seriously, but it really isn't worth it to skip in the first place. He cares very much about his students and is very understanding as long as he knows you are working hard and putting the effort in."
3198,173152,2.0,5.0,"Exner is a good, quirky, and fun guy. He makes jokes and puts in the effort to really get to know you. However, the class is very hard. He teaches well, but the homework is obscure and doesn't tie into lecture. Exams are insane. Put in maximum effort and you'll do okay at best (pray the curves will save you)."
3199,173152,4.0,5.0,"He's a really interesting person and you never know what he's going to say. His classes will always keep you entertained and he explains the material pretty well. However, his tests are insanely hard and you will struggle immensely in the class. There is a curve at the end of the year but don't expect it to save your poor test grades."
3200,173152,1.0,5.0,Terrible at explaining
3201,173152,1.0,5.0,"If you're thinking of taking an Exner class, don't. He made Math 112 the hardest class I've taken. His explanations of problems are extremely difficult to understand and he is barely helpful in office hours, refusing to answer homework questions. His homework is busy work and there are no tutors or study groups for the class. Stay away"
3202,173152,5.0,5.0,Sometimes of the knowledge we learn do not appear in the test so it is diffcult for me to do it
3203,173152,3.0,4.0,"The exams are absurd, but so are the curves. The course was very interesting and to be honest, I have learned quite a lot in just a few months. There is a very large amount of homework assignments and lectures can sometimes be quite unclear. However, his office hours are very helpful."
3204,173152,3.0,4.0,"Exner is a very tough professor and you definitely have to put in a good amount of effort if you want to succeed in his class. You have a decent amount of homework every night and he will give you a ""bell quiz"" everyday in class. Even though his tests are hard there is a decent curve on all of them. Also he is extremely helpful in office hours!!"
3205,173152,1.5,5.0,"Seems like a nice guy if he wasn't teaching calculus I may like him, but test are very difficult and did not finish practice problems in class (not that they had any relevance on the test)"
3206,173152,2.5,5.0,"Professor Exner is one of the most notorious professors at Bucknell for his tough tests and even tougher grading. I expected good explanation in return; however, although I took about 80% of the content we had to learn for Calculus I in high school, I got even more confused by his way of teaching. I would not recommend taking that class with him."
3207,173152,1.5,5.0,"He is funny in class, but does not teach anything and does not finish problems. His tests are some of the hardest I have ever seen and the questions do not correlate to what you studied. Thus man should not be teaching freshman, let alone Bucknell students"
3208,173152,3.0,5.0,"If you have the option of taking Calc I with any other professor, do it to save your GPA. Exner is intimidating in class but surprisingly extremely helpful and kind during office hours. You *must* go to office hours ASAP if you aren't doing well, ask for help right away. Exceedingly difficult grader."
3209,173152,2.5,5.0,"Homework after every class, don't go to his office hours if they're ending in at least 20 minutes, he rushes to leave. quizzesexams are impossible, I could spend the whole time on half the questions. Close to seeing if theres any chance i have a learning disability to get more time on them, you must be a math prodigy. Very smart, interesting guy, "
3210,173152,4.0,4.0,"He is easily the most cultured person I've ever met and far too humble for his own good. He has written poetry and has a deep appreciation for the arts. If he sees that you are putting in effort but not performing well, he shows a level of caring that I have never seen in a teacher. It's a shame calculus has to get in the way of what he has to say."
3211,173152,1.0,5.0,He insists on doing things his way and his tests are basically impossible.  You have a quiz every day and big quiztest once a week.  The homework load is also ridiculous.  Oh and also he doesn't believe in teaching
3212,173152,4.0,4.0,Must study and work hard. Has a bad reputation but he's much nicer and funnier than you might think. Don't drop the class.
3213,173152,1.0,5.0,Don't take this professor. Mean and degrading. Absolute worst professor I have had so far at Bucknell. Change sections NOW.
3214,173152,3.5,5.0,Ex gon' give it to ya.
3215,173152,1.0,5.0,"Exner assigns the hardest homework even though he has not taught us any of it. This class is a lost cause. I feel demoralized and abused (emotionally). I suggest you save your pride, dignity, manliness, femaleness and uranus and never take his class!"
3216,173152,1.0,5.0,"Awful, just awful. Avoid at all costs. Nothing is worth having to sit through class with this guy."
3217,173152,4.0,5.0,"Professor Exner is an entertaining guy, but his class is VERY difficult. The work load is intense (a couple hours of annoying online homework every other night) and the quizzes and tests are near impossible to do well on. If you have trouble learning on your own and haven't taken calculus before, I suggest you stay away from his class."
3218,173152,2.5,5.0,Exner is insanely hard. He does not prepare students for tests and quizzes. He also never gives students enough time to take the assessments. Do not take a class with him! You will regret it.
3219,173152,1.5,5.0,"Probably one of the worst teachers I've ever had. Unnecessarily difficult, confusing, combative, and unhelpful in office hours. Tests were ridiculously hard and he seemed genuinely confused about why people had questions about the material."
3220,173152,2.5,5.0,"This class was very difficult and poorly set up by the university. Why would the people who could not master calc 1 in high school in nine months be able to master calc 2 in six weeks. George was a pretty good teacher, but the only reason I liked that class was because of his personality. He is a great person to talk to and joke around with."
3221,173152,3.5,5.0,"People hate Exner because his classes are so hard and they let it overlook that he's actually an amazing teacher. He makes you think mathematically too, which really helps. His tests, quizzes, and homework are really hard. If you don't think you can make it through his class, you probably can't. Hilarious too."
3222,173152,3.0,5.0,"He's called the executioner for a reason.  If math's not your thing, don't take his class.  He's not very interesting, but he knows what he's talking about.  Try to see him outside of class or get a tutor."
3223,173152,4.0,5.0,"He gives really hard exams, but also curves them"
3224,173152,4.5,4.0,"I dont know why he gets such a bad rep. he is hilarious!!! and a realllly good teacher! if you have to take an early morning class definitely take it with exner, he's very entertaining so you wont fall asleep! such a great guy!"
3225,173152,4.0,5.0,"Calc 2 with Exner was one of the hardest classes I'd ever taken in my life and I spent more time on it than any other class. However, if you take the time to visit him during office hours and make a real effort to understand the material, do well on homework (it's actually graded) and Webwork, it will pay off. Great guy, hard class."
3226,173152,3.5,5.0,"George is a great prof.  He is really challenging, but so into what he his teaching.  I have had him for two semesters and learned so much."
3227,173152,3.5,4.0,"Exner is an entertaining guy, pretty good teacher. A lot of information to learn in a short time, long homeworks and difficult but curved tests make it a hard class but Exner doesn't do a bad job. Calc help sessions were much more helpful than office hours. Start strong and try hard while the material is easier and you shouldn't have any problems"
3228,173152,3.5,5.0,He is very tough to pass. Despite of the he has a brilliant sense of humor.
3229,173152,5.0,5.0,"George is, without a doubt, the best teacher that I have ever had.  That's not to say that his class is a breeze...it was definitely the most difficult class that I have ever taken.  However, I learned SO much about math and just how to think mathematically.  If you work extremely hard, it WILL pay off.  He's definitely a great guy."
3230,173152,4.0,5.0,"Linear algebra is very difficult with exner! However, the rumor that he is an ogre is not true! George is generous with grades and very helpful.. although this is not a class for an easy A."
3231,173152,4.0,5.0,"I agree...tests are very hard and lots of hw. BUT...I did learn a lot and Exner is quite helpful outside of class. As a person hes a great guy (and sometimes rather funny) and I would love to take another class with him. You cant slack off in his classes tho. Overall, good prof but very hard."
3232,173152,2.5,5.0,Alright teacher. Lots of work. Tests are impossible big curves. Extra help almost useless.
3233,173152,2.5,4.0,this professor did a mediocre job of teaching. He gave so much homework and explained so little that you couldn't do the homework. Almost all of class is spent going over homework and hardly teaching anything new(maybe 10min). You might as well just buy the book and teach yourself. Do not take this class!!
3234,173152,1.0,5.0,"please, save yourself. run away."
3235,173152,2.0,5.0,"please people, take my advice. as many have stated, exner is a horrible teacher, i agree. i've been very talented in math my whole life, best in my AP calc class in high school. i took this class nearly failing it. people say that at least you'll learn something. um def not true. there's so much homework, it's not worth it at all. yes, run away."
3236,173152,1.5,4.0,This was the worst professor I have had in my whole life.  My worst high school teacher was better than this poor excuse for a human being.  His tests never reflected the homework and if you tried to get help out of class he got mad at you.  There is a good reason why he's called the &quot;Executioner.&quot;  Bucknell made a huge mistake giving him tenure.
3237,173152,3.5,4.0,"Very good teacher, tests a little hard but he gives a crazy curve"
3238,173152,4.0,4.0,"Tests are difficult, but overall a good professor, I really learned a lot."
3239,173152,2.0,5.0,he's always scoffing at you
3240,173152,2.0,3.0,"Very structured lectures, not the best teacher. I had to reread the chapters before doing the homework. Exams are difficult but fair."
3241,173152,5.0,5.0,"People who think he's not good cannot appreciate his style of teaching. He makes you work like a mathematician. If you are only after grades and not learning, then of course you hate him. But for learning purposes, he is the best there is."
3242,173152,1.0,4.0,"horrible teacher, got absolutely nothing out of any lecture he gave all semester, there was no point in attending class, except to try and get on his good side.  if you get this professor, try and transfer out, waste of a semester."
3243,173152,2.0,5.0,Awful... very unclear in lectures and irrelevant test questions.  He has earned the name the &quot;executioner&quot;
3244,173152,3.0,3.0,"pretty easy grader, gives a lot of credit even if you dont know where to begin on a test problem"
3245,173152,1.0,5.0,OMG. He doesn't teach. He wouldn't even let us take notes!! Grrr...
3246,173152,5.0,3.0,"Very challenging, but taught me more than any professor I had at BU."
3247,173152,4.0,4.0,They don't call him the Executioner for no reason.
3248,173152,4.0,5.0,This guy is hard!
3249,173152,4.5,5.0,"George is great, you will truly understand any class he is teaching by the time you finish it. I'd recommend him to math majors, although if you're not a math major, or if you're not extremely interested in math, his classes may be a bit extreme."
3250,173152,3.0,5.0,No Comments
3251,173152,5.0,3.0,One of the greatest and funniest profs at BU
3252,173152,5.0,4.0,No Comments
3253,173152,2.0,5.0,Calc2- ridiculous amount of work that he doesnt teach you how to do. You end up learning it well though. Averages on tests are in 60's but he curves.
3254,740454,5.0,1.0,Her classes are easy and she's extremely nice.  She's always willing to help if you're struggling.  I definitely recommend taking a class with her!
3255,740454,5.0,1.0,the class is easy and fun. she's a very fair professor.
3256,1641578,5.0,4.0,"Only had Beeman for Lab. Outstanding professor. READ the lab manual and take light notes for reminders. Know all SAFETY measures, no one wants a lab partner that acts helpless. Beeman loves to play Pandora after he lectures of course. 1 quiz per week, microscope test, 2-broth to broth transfer or streaking a broth to a plate, lab practical, final."
3257,1641578,2.0,4.0,She usually begins class by finishing up a problem that we started on the board the previous day and if you have not completed it or if you don't answer he questions she raises her voice at you. Her tests are 4 problems worth 100 pts total and they usually take 2 hours to complete. They are very hard if you don't do every problem in the book.
3258,1641578,5.0,2.0,Prof. Hazra is one of the best Teacher I've ever had! She emphasizes more on the important topics and explains  difficult concepts in an easy way. This is an easy class. She puts lots of effort so that students understand and always willing to help you get good grades but you too have to put some effort into it. I strongly recommend this class.
3259,1641578,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor. The nicest, most accessible one I have met so far. She is a huge asset to Bucknell and is clearly passionate about her subject and her students. But be warned, if you take a class with her, you will keep coming back for another each semester!"
3260,1641578,5.0,3.0,"Amazing. Nearly my entire 102 class decided to take 103 with her again, which I think says a lot. She is extremely helpful and truly wants you to do well. She explains everything until you understand it. Class is extremely enjoyable and a ton of fun."
3261,1641578,4.5,4.0,Awesome professor. You can't go wrong with choosing her. She loves her job and makes class as fun as possible. If you put the effort not only into this class but into French you can easily get an A. She is always offering to help you and is extremely patient. Learning a new language can be a very sad and difficult experience but she makes it great
3262,1641578,5.0,3.0,"This is why you come to Bucknell, to have professors like her. She is one of the best and most fun professors at this school. Learning a new language can be really distressing and boring but she makes it easy, accessible and fun. You have to earn your grade but she makes it easy as long as you put effort into it. I would recommend her for any class."
3263,1641578,4.5,3.0,She is an amazing French teacher. She wants you to follow  her guide lines explained in her syllabus to a T but that is understandable. Our entire class loved her and we had a blast every day in class. Recommended her for any class.
3264,1641583,3.0,2.0,"I took her class of Mask and Meaning as my writing level 1. This course is definitely an easy A as you do your work and  crafting, no need of writing BTW. Prof williams is very nice and kind and is a nice grader. But her criteria is not clear and her thoughts are random. You are not going to like her lecture unless you are very into theater."
3265,1641583,4.0,3.0,Very interesting class. She taught my foundational seminar and she is a very caring professor. Be prepared to read and engage in class discussions.
3266,1641583,2.5,2.0,"Just know what you are getting into. For those who are naturally inclinded to art (and the work ethic needed to create it) will do just fine. This course requires a lot of work on your own. She loves what she does but is very unorganized. You never really know what to expect from her which can be frustrating. However, it was a fun course."
3267,1641583,2.0,1.0,"She loves what she does. With that said, she doesn't really know what she's doing. She kinda makes things up on the fly and you are never really sure what to expect next. Her syllabus is well planed but she doesn't always follow it. That being said I loved her class and I learned a lot. She is very skilled and you just have to go along with her."
3268,2589811,4.0,2.0,"Prof Kabalan is a very nice lady. Though in ECEG 210 (Circuits), her online lectures became hard to focus on. You could find the answer to all her homework assignments by google-ing them anyway. Overall not too difficult of a class."
3269,2589813,5.0,3.0,Professor Landsman is the way to go if you are going to take Economics. She is extremely caring and understanding about any circumstances you may have. She is a professor who truly wants you to succeed. The classes material is moderately difficult however Prof Landsman helps you through it.
3270,2589813,5.0,3.0,I've never had a better professor- so supportive and understanding. she makes the class super easy by breaking everything down well. She's also very understanding if you need extensions which is definitely helpful. 10/10 recommend taking any class with her if you can- behavioral econ is really fun with her because shes really passionate about it
3271,2589813,5.0,3.0,I love Professor Landsman. Only professor I've had to claim to care about mental health and ACTUALLY walk the walk. She is just the best.
3272,2589813,5.0,3.0,"Professor Landsman is genuinely the kindest professor I have had the pleasure of being taught by at Bucknell. Always checks in on students and their mental health, flexible with course schedule based on how the class is reacting to the work and everything going on in their lives. Hope to take a course with her in the future, as everyone should."
3273,2589813,5.0,3.0,"Genuinely the one of the most caring people you will ever meet. Will always make time for her students and actually cares about you regardless of how well you do. Also, she is always willing to help you learn in and out of class. If you have a question - ask it. I learned so much from her and I am definitely taking class with her again."
3274,2589813,5.0,3.0,"The most student mental health aware/ generally caring professors I've ever had. Has changed up class styles if class seems overly tired, given days off when she detects burnout, takes stuff off tests if no ones getting it after several homeworks. She provides note packets and reading guides. The reading is sizeable but doable. Exams are fair."
3275,2589813,5.0,2.0,she was so caring about every student and very clearly wanted everyone to pass and do well in course. always offered extra help outside of class and would go above and beyond to talk to you if you appeared to be struggling. there was reading almost every class but it was very manageable. her lectures were very clear and she made note packets.
3276,824441,5.0,3.0,"Thought he was an overall great professor, who is very easy to talk to. His homework's are not too bad even though there is one every night. His lectures are great and super easy to follow. I would take him again for sure. "
3277,824441,5.0,3.0,"A great 400-level ceeg class to up your grade! You know prof Crago is awesome after you take ENGR222 in 2nd year and big lost if you miss this 422 class! Lectures are inspiring, labs are fun and quick, you learn Hec-Ras for group project. he will include big picture of water resources engr in class too. Expect papers, essays, and reflections."
3278,824441,4.0,2.0,Absolutely love him! Love the way he structures the lectures and assign HW. HW due everyday but it's a great way to keep up. He does pop quizzes and initiates class discussions which is great for an engineering class.  Big lost if you don't take him! Easy A class with a caring prof!
3279,824441,4.0,2.0,"He makes the subject matter really easy. There is homework every night, but it doesn't take longer than 30 minutes. He gives practice exams before the real exam so you know what to expect. He has in class assignments so it doesn't get too boring which is necessary because he's a boring prof."
3280,824441,3.0,2.0,He is kinda of goofy. Sometimes he goes around in circles. He also has beautiful eyes and nice glasses. He's gigantic cutie.
3281,824443,4.0,5.0,If you take cheg 200 you are in for a complete shock.  You will probably have no life durring the course and just barely scrape by unless you are a super genius (and there are a few in cheg 200).  But he was interesting in class and a good guy.  You just need to do alot of work outside of class like 15 hours a week.  But that's chemical engineering
3282,824443,5.0,2.0,"I love this guy.  I'm not an engineer but I took ENGR/UNIV270 with him.  It was interesting because we basically got to pick our topics and the class revolved around group work.  He is a great, funny guy and the class actually turned out to be my favorite of the semester!"
3283,824443,5.0,1.0,"if love had a face, it would be his. i enjoyed every aspect of his class because he made it so much fun. he made it easy, yet i learned more in that class than all my other classes combined. take this class and i guarantee you won't be disappointed."
3284,824443,5.0,1.0,"Great professor, easy tests, very funny guy"
3285,824443,5.0,1.0,"He's a really nice guy - just easy going all the time. A bit nerdy, but it's fun. He's a good lecturer and he provides a lot of handouts and whatnot. He's pretty understanding and sympathetic about workloads and stuff and his tests aren't bad at all. Overall, he's a great teacher."
3286,824443,5.0,1.0,just a great guy
3287,2735233,5.0,2.0,"Prof Shirk is the best professor I have had so far at Bucknell. His lectures are interesting and full of Information to help you with papers. There are 3 long papers the entire semester as well as blog posts scattered in. The class material is super interesting and the workload isn't bad at all. No textbook, only one small book near the end."
3288,132245,5.0,2.0,Professor Dubois is one my favorites so far at Bucknell. He cares a lot about his students and loves to see when they make progress. He is a real gem and I definitely recommend taking one of his classes.
3289,132245,5.0,2.0,I LOVE PROF DUBOIS. He is hands down one of my favorite people at Bucknell. He's so charismatic and fun. He's super into his classes and gets you excited for the day! He always has a smile on his face and he makes learning French something I looked forward to everyday. Can't wait to take another class with him!
3290,132245,4.0,2.0,"One of my favorite profs of all time! Definitely a class worth taking, no tests, only five short essays the whole semester. You'll learn a lot without realizing it. Not to mention Professor Dubois has a great personality and loves to joke around. Would recommend teacher and class 100%."
3291,132245,4.5,2.0,"So long as you put in the effort and complete assignments on time, Professor DuBois will give you a better-than-fair grade. French 150 was actually enjoyable with him and he helped me improve my writing abilities tremendously without hurting my GPA."
3292,132245,4.5,3.0,Class is much more interesting than originally thought.  He is goofy and makes class a fun time - one of the better french teachers take him if you can.
3293,132245,4.0,5.0,"I didn't love the subject matter but he made it interesting. He plays French music every day to foster a fun atmosphere. He requires participation, likes group work, grades papers fairly, and gives quizzes that are tough but straightforward. All in all a good guy and a decent professor; do take one of his classes if you get the chance."
3294,132245,5.0,2.0,"most lovable and entertaining professor I have had at bucknell! he makes the class fun while keepingn the material clear, and plays french music as we enter and leave the class =)"
3295,132245,3.5,3.0,nice guy... fair grader... pretty helpful
3296,132245,4.5,2.0,very enthusiastic and very nice. classes are interesting. loves to teach and makes you want to pay attention. he likes participation. he is willing to help. I loved his class. try to take one of his courses.
3297,132245,5.0,3.0,Lots of work but fun class and he was always super excited to be teaching it. He made class really fun...plus he's hot!
3298,132245,2.5,4.0,never done so much french work in my life- expect about 3 hours of work a night but he will only collect a random 2 of these assignments over the semester. enjoy. :(
3299,132245,3.5,2.0,"goes at a pretty good pace so its easy to keep up in class.  hardly ever checks homework, and quizzes and tests are pretty easy as long as you study"
3300,132245,5.0,3.0,His appearance makes paying attention in class easy!
3301,132245,5.0,3.0,He is an amazing professor!!  He was my prof on BEF and he rocked; really knows his stuff and was a great role model for the students
3302,132245,3.5,3.0,No Comments
3303,132245,3.0,4.0,No Comments
3304,2194581,5.0,3.0,Hiram is the best professor ever! I would recommend his classes to anyone and everyone. He is also an amazing person and so accomodating to all his students.
3305,2194581,3.0,3.0,"great guy and funny but as a professor it was rough. lectures had very little structure, mostly just talked at you which got extremely boring, you never knew where ur grade stood. His grading is also rlly confusing,and not consistent at all. My classmate and i would turn in the same work and receive diff grades. Goes thru topics quick, 5 exams"
3306,2194581,5.0,2.0,"I was just so impressed by his patience, his charisma, his geniality, and more. He would thrive in any college/high school etc, which I think speaks to his teaching abilities as many professors are experts on their subject but are not necessarily the best teachers. He's always smiling, always engaging, and just the best."
3307,2194581,5.0,3.0,"Professor Smith is awesome! After not taking Spanish for many years, I was scared to take it here, but he was so helpful and so interactive. Least boring class I've ever taken"
3308,2194581,5.0,2.0,Hiram was the funniest teacher I have ever had. He is hilarious in class and makes the material interesting. He is a little vague and unclear but otherwise loved his class. Would take his class again.
3309,2194581,5.0,2.0,Awesome spanish teacher. Makes a hard subject easier to understand. Really makes sure students understand the material and if you do your work it's nice and easy!
3310,2194581,5.0,3.0,He's super awesome and makes the material very manageable. Office hours with him are so so beneficial and worth it. Hes super approachable and I enjoyed the class a lot. In case I got the class code wrong it was Hispanic Linguistics that I took with him. Super interesting but difficult for a native Spanish speaker with no grammatical background.
3311,2194581,5.0,2.0,I would 100% recommend taking a class with Professor Smith! He's super funny and is easy to understand. He is very approachable and makes learning fun. The class was not very difficult but you were still given a lot of opportunities to raise your grade if needed.
3312,2122906,5.0,3.0,LOVE her. Class is hard if you do not pay attention but if you actually try then she will love you and will be your friend too. Is understanding and genuinely wants us to succeed with learning how to teach elementary math
3313,2122906,2.0,4.0,"There were excessive group projects and other assignments. She only teaches a little and makes you learn through group labs with individual homework assignments as well. I understand why, but it is not necessary for the statistics class as it does not help a lot and takes a lot of time when other classes are more important."
3314,2122906,4.0,4.0,She's a very good professor and will help you outside alot of class if you go to office hours. Explains things very clearly but alot of work you have to put in.
3315,2122906,5.0,4.0,"Extremely caring for her students, but expects the best in them! Will have to work hard, but I HIGHLY suggest taking her as a professor!"
3316,2122906,3.0,4.0,"She is really nice, and easy to talk to. However, she is so unclear of what she expects from her students, and gives an insane amount of unnecessary homework. Her take-home quizzes are okay if you work hard on them, but no one ever gets a 100%. I honestly think she picks grades out of a hat and randomly distributes them..."
3317,2354331,5.0,2.0,"took this as a requirement, class was a lot better than i expected. prof grant is great at communicating concepts and brought in good speakers from industry. seems to favor the students that participate a lot."
3318,2354331,5.0,3.0,"really fun classes. lots of fun activities. lots of reading and mini-quizzes, but no midterm and final! "
3319,2354331,5.0,4.0,Wish I had taken this class sooner! Now I know I want to major in marketing. Prof Grant's enthusiasm for the subject and experience outside the classroom really made this the best class I've taken at Bucknell. Hoping to get a job in marketing later. Thank you Annetta for opening my eyes to marketing! She loves the subject and cares about students.
3320,2354331,5.0,3.0,"Grant is one of the best professors Ive had. Show up prepared to engage in class, stay on top of the readings and assignments, and youll do fine. And keep your mask on correctly, or face the wrath. Have a much better appreciation of marketing after taking this course."
3321,2354331,4.0,3.0,"Great class, super interesting material and teaching style kept everyone engaged. The class content was pretty easy but mini quizzes were tough so I dont expect a super high grade in the class."
3322,2354331,5.0,4.0,"Best class I've taken at Bucknell!! This professor made me want to be a marketing major. Lots of great examples, she brought in high level speakers. She's genuinely excited about marketing, cares about students, and wants you to succeed. Definitely take Grant!"
3323,2354331,1.0,4.0,"I really did not enjoy this class. We didn't receive grades all semester, only verbal feedback, so it was impossible to understand our final grades. There was also a ton of busywork that took forever to complete, and at the end of this class, I could not tell you what exactly the focus of this course was."
3324,2354331,5.0,3.0,Ignore the haters - she's great
3325,2354331,1.0,5.0,One of the worst professors I have had at Bucknell. I never received feedback on any of my assignments your whole entire class grade is based on &quot;your own motivation&quot; which can be seen as a curse or blessing but for almost all it was a curse. Soooo many unnecessary assignments and the class/lecture was hard to sit through. Fits all WOAT criteria.
3326,2354331,1.0,4.0,Horrible. Just horrible. For your own sake do not take her. Never gives feedback and is unfair with grading things such as group projects and stupid assignments.
3327,2354331,5.0,4.0,"The way she teaches is unconventional, but interesting. She really wants her students to develop skills and confidence needed once they graduate and this is reflected in class assignments and projects. She is passionate and helps a lot when you ask questions. You have to take this course with an open mind and be ready to work hard."
3328,2354331,1.0,4.0,"Grant is one of the worst professors I've had. Rather than helping anyone that may be struggling and asking questions, she gives evasive answers and plays it off as &quot;helping us build problem solving skills.&quot; She gives us a lot of busy work and is very critical about anything we do even if we've given it our absolute best. She drains me every class."
3329,2354331,5.0,2.0,"Professor Grant is so passionate about Marketing and it makes the class so interesting, and one of the only classes that I actually look forward to attending. She's funny, nice, and very approachable. Always willing to work with me on coursework and has helped me prepare for internship interviews!!! Definitely take her if you can."
3330,2376862,5.0,2.0,"One would think having a Friday Lab at 2 pm would be the worst part of your schedule. In truth, Professor Meriett made it the best part. I genuinely learned a great deal from the lab and found it quite useful in terms of applying class concepts. If you can, take Meriett for every lab, she's an incredible professor to have. "
3331,2376862,5.0,2.0,"I love Prof. Merriet. She's a very likable person, and her lab was actually fun (even on Friday).  She is personable and wants her students to succeed. If you have any questions she will always answer them, but in a way that will make you think so you can succeed in the lecture portion of class. Definitely get to know her!"
3332,2376862,5.0,2.0,"Professor Merriett is absolutely amazing. She was very clear with her pre-lab lectures, and she was always accessible outside of lab for questions. She gives really thoughtful feedback and tried her best to ensure that her students understand the lab concepts. I would 100% recommend taking her for organic lab!"
3333,2376862,1.0,3.0,Absolutely did not like. Would not suggest her to anyone. She is a new teacher and has much to learn.
3334,2376862,5.0,3.0,Great chem lab instructor. Could always go to her for help outside and answered my emails. I really felt like I understood the material.
3335,752804,4.0,4.0,"Definitely extremely knowledgable but can come across as scatterbrained or tangential. Essays are graded surprisingly hard but will give feedback and is generous with due dates. Lots and Lots of reading which can be hard to keep up. but requires minimal text. Worth it if you are engaged with the material, you will get as much out as you put in."
3336,752804,5.0,4.0,"One of a kind, incredibly passionate but you need to be just as engaged with the readings and in class as he is. If there was one course at the school I would retake, it is this one. Ideas are abstract but essays are very open ended and he cares more about your original interpretations than you rewriting his lectures for him. Best class I've taken."
3337,752804,3.0,4.0,He assigns a lot of work for seemingly no purpose. Is a super interesting guy but adds some truly unnecessary work.
3338,752804,4.0,3.0,Nice guy. But his class is REALLY boring.
3339,752804,2.0,2.0,if you don't like lord of the rings do not take this class. the entire semester is reading all three of them. we rarely talk about the book in class since he goes off on so many tangents. i wouldn't say attendance isn't mandatory however if you do miss class you wont miss anything. short responses before each class but very manageable
3340,752804,3.0,3.0,"I took Alf's foudation seminar class and found it manageable.  I mostly read sparknotes, showed decent participation, and had a high school AP/Honors background in English so it wasn't too hard.  Meeting with him in office hours makes all the difference for weekly blogs and essays.  Class was extremely dull and complex but didn't affect my grade."
3341,752804,4.0,3.0,"Alf's class usually consisted of a weekly blog about something in which we discussed in class or are reading about.  Topics are often really abstract and difficult to comprehend, however Alf is very dedicated to his students learning and is open to meeting with you to ensure your learning.  Will meet with you on how to better your writing skills."
3342,752804,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Siewers' class is not easy, and sometimes he can be scatterbrained, but in terms of writing feedback, passion, and pure enjoyment, I cannot recommend his class enough. I loved the spiritual element, as it gave me insight into some of the deeper parts of sustainability, and why anyone would care about this beautiful world in the first place."
3343,752804,5.0,4.0,"Every lecture that Alf gives is well researched and engaging. The class material is tough, but deeply rewarding, and Alf makes it fun. The papers he assigns always align closely with the course material while allowing for a great deal of freedom for students to explore their own directions, and his grades are abundantly fair and well-explained."
3344,752804,1.0,4.0,"Where do I begin. This class is a mess. He is late an incredible amount, assigns 7 page papers a week before they are due and really, REALLY doesn't care about his students. He will email you back 3 days later. He assigns papers on parents' weekend, over breaks, etc, when you are supposed to be with your family. His reading quizzes are impossible."
3345,752804,2.5,5.0,"I  really really disliked his class. He grades papers very harshly and is a complete bore as he talks on and on and...  Unless you are an English major who is passionate about literary studies, I highly recommend you to stay away from taking his foundation seminar if you want to maintain a decent GPA."
3346,752804,3.0,4.0,"Very passionate with literature but subject material was abstract, which was inevitable. Tries to be very personal with you but old age is catching up to him it would seem and he will forget about you in days. Nice guy who means well, overall."
3347,752804,4.0,5.0,"Professor Siewers is a great professor. He genuinely cares about his students, as well as the material, but he can take things too seriously sometimes and can be extremely scattered. His quizzes are not hard but he can mess them up and then not reward any lost credit. His papers were also some of the most harshly graded papers I have ever had"
3348,752804,5.0,3.0,"Top notch professor- friendly and helpful! His papers can be difficult, but he always provides tons of comments and ideas on rough drafts and schedules individual meeting times with everyone.  Lectures can cover several topics, but just focus in on anything that pertains to the subject of your current paper.  You'll get a lot of good ideas!"
3349,752804,3.0,4.0,"His lectures are extremely boring and although he lets you hand in a second draft of both of the major papers, he makes the same corrections on the second draft despite the fact that you made changes which is very frustrating. Class time is not hard, just tedious, and he is so extremely sweet, you can't help but love his personality."
3350,752804,1.5,4.0,I really disliked his class. He was disorganized and often talked about nothing during lecture. It was incredibly boring. His grading made no sense and he would tell you to change something in your first draft and then to change that exact thing back in a later draft. Very frustrating. Especially as an adviser.
3351,752804,5.0,2.0,What a wonderful educator! genuinely cares for his students and wants them to learn and do well in his class! medieval lit can be pretty boring material but he manages to make it interesting. Such a nice professor that you'll feel bad slacking off... so you pretty much can't avoid doing well in his class!
3352,752804,3.5,2.0,"He's a great professor, really into the subject material and always enthusiastic.  He will surprise you and challenge you.  His own writing is top notch."
3353,752804,4.5,1.0,A really nice guy... he tries really hard to involve and get to know his students. Lectures can be boring but its a pretty easy class
3354,752804,5.0,2.0,"I mean he's pretty much the man. Enthusiastic about the subject and cares about how you do. Weekly journals, test and 2 papers along with some other stuff."
3355,752804,5.0,3.0,This is my 3rd class with him and I wish I could take 10 more. He makes seemingly borringing texts come alive and reveals much more than is apparent on the surface.  He also has one of the best grading systems I have ever seen and is just an overall great guy.  He's the best professor I've ever had.
3356,752804,5.0,2.0,"He is a ray of sunshine that can make any day a great one! Really interesting and passionate. Even if medieval studies isn't your thing, by the end of class you may wish it were :)"
3357,752804,4.0,3.0,"GREAT guy.  SO funny and passionate about what he teaches...really corny sense of humor.  Sometimes his lectures get boring and you can zone out for a little while and still know what's going on, but boy, does this man SURPRISE you sometimes. Crazy! Won't go through a class w/o saying &quot;Tolkein&quot; at least once."
3358,781479,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely love Professor Knisley! She obviously cares so much about the material, and she really wants her students to care too! If you meet with her outside of class time to discuss lab reports or anything, she's always willing to help and it will really increase your score. Best lab professor this school has to offer, hands down."
3359,781479,5.0,4.0,"Professor Knisely cares about her students and is very helpful in the lab. The lab reports are really difficult, and she grades really hard on stupid little formatting things, but it makes you realize how important formatting is. There is not a full lab report done in bio 205, and she guides you along with each one. All-in-all she is a great prof"
3360,781479,5.0,4.0,Professor Knisely is amazing. She loves her students and will do anything to help. I advise going to have her help on lab reports prior to turning it in as she will help. She plays music during lab and time flies.
3361,781479,4.5,4.0,"Professor Knisely is the best. Labs are long and tedious, but she plays music and walks around answering any questions you may have. She grades harshly on lab reports, but if you go and talk to her about what you are doing wrong she is more than happy to help. I feel like my lab skills have improved so much thanks to her!"
3362,781479,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Knisely is the nicest person I have ever met. She knows exactly what's going on all the time and will go out of her way to help you and make sure you understand too. She'll even let you send her your lab report for proofreading. She's fun, helpful and really wants everyone to do well. Best professor I've had so far."
3363,781479,4.5,3.0,"Knisely is very adorable and lively, and obviously is passionate about biology. She is generally pretty clear on lab instructions and is easy going, but is VERY picky on lab reports."
3364,781479,4.0,3.0,"Good teacher. She is really into biology and her students. She makes understanding labs easy. She guides you through writing a lab report (so helpful!) You really do learn a lot in her lab, which helps for lecture. Lots of points earned in lab!"
3365,781479,2.5,5.0,"She's friendly enough, but she clearly plays favorites. She wrote the book that's used for lab, so she's pretty snobby. She also grades much harder on you if she doesn't like you. If you finish with the lab early, she'll make you stay there until time's up. Our lab section NEVER got let out early. It felt like high school all over again."
3366,781479,5.0,2.0,She's so sweet and she knows what she's doing!  And she is more than willing to help and is very patient (esp. with labs)
3367,781479,4.5,2.0,"Very helpful, great workshops, plays music during lab :)"
3368,781479,5.0,3.0,Knisely is really great. She's relaly helpful and nice. The reports are really straightforward and she's willing to help alot outside of class. Labs fill the whole three hours though.
3369,781479,5.0,2.0,"She's very easy if you just follow the guidelines in her book.  Plus, she's very into her students learning so she will help all she can."
3370,781479,5.0,3.0,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! She's really that great! She's very helpful, even willing to reach out to you before you to her! She really wants every student to succeed. She seems pretty popular w/ students; her classes fill up quick! Avoid all others and go for Knisely!"
3371,738472,4.5,4.0,"This guy is awesome! He likes to make jokes about our readings and takes the time to help his students individually. He is kind, responsive, and understanding. He also has an easygoing and chill personality. Yes, this is a VERY difficult course, but so worth it! You will learn so much. I feel satisfied that I got a good education in Latin prose."
3372,738472,5.0,3.0,"He's a very entertaining lecturer with a quirky, sarcastic, and sometimes dark sense of humor. He dresses weird for class (jeans, graphic tees, tennis shoes), but is very knowledgeable about his subject. The quantity of reading can be a shock to someone with no interest, but it's nothing extraordinary."
3373,738472,3.5,2.0,"He is very into the subject and will discuss anything relevant for the whole class. Pretty chill guy as well. A lot of reading, and dumb mandatory journals that go with it.  The three papers aren't terrible.  With some help from him (to show you care) and doing the reading, you should be able to get a 90."
3374,738472,1.0,5.0,Worst professor ever.  DO NOT TAKE CLASS.  He gives out 100 pages of reading for every class and this is a 100 level course
3375,738472,2.0,3.0,"Some days he will wear fancy suites and on others jeans and band shirts from the 70s.  Weird guy, really.  His lectures are horribly borring.  I'm not really sure that he understands what he is talking about, but it's an easy class so I can't complain too much."
3376,738472,3.0,3.0,"He's an OK teacher, just a stickler for certain things. Very fair. Although he doesn't seem very welcoming, if you ask for help, he will help."
3377,1068201,5.0,3.0,"He is a good professor, and he explains points well. His teaching is straightforward, and he is clever with computers (his specialty). The labs in this course were hard, or they needed more details. He is helpful, and go to his office hours if you need help with a project or anything else you want to understand."
3378,1068201,4.5,3.0,"Really interested teacher, and keeps class interesting. Posts great lecture notes, but they are riddled with errors. His projects can be LOTS of work. Gives very vague directions, but grades HARSHLY. Very helpful, but always seems to leaves things out that he clearly knows would help you. Still a very good teacher that I would recommend."
3379,1068201,4.0,2.0,"New professor here (and in general), but is pretty good overall. He learns quickly from mistakes, and really wants to be a good professor. He is goofy as hell, which will at least keep you entertained. Workload is pretty easy, but labs are rather involving."
3380,48305,5.0,4.0,"I was really worried going into 202, but Prof Cassidy's lectures are easy to follow and make the material easy to understand. I didn't get a feel for how he is as a person at all, but he clearly knows the math and is very good at explaining it. Try to be on time to his classes, he will respect you more."
3381,48305,5.0,4.0,"MATH 245 is not an easy course by any means. But, Cassidy was very helpful and always eager to offer any help. He responds very quickly to emails and always gives very thorough explanations both in emails and in lectures. Don't be afraid to ask him any question, because he will go out of his way to review material from several weeks/months ago."
3382,48305,5.0,2.0,I would recommend every math class he teaches. Clear lectures. Tests are not hard if you do your homework and review.
3383,48305,5.0,3.0,"Favorite Professor I have had at Bucknell. He really engages you and makes sure that the students are learning the material. He hates timelines and if students do not understand the material as a whole he will move back 3 weeks and reteach some fundamental steps. Fluent in many languages, an absolutely brilliant teacher"
3384,48305,4.0,5.0,"very clear with in class notes and examples. textbook wasn't helpful. Lots of homework. this class was easier than calc for sure, but his exams were BRUTAL! I could know all of the material and still not do well because he would ask things way beyond what we were capable of doing based on homework and in class learning. SHOULD'T BE .5 CREDIT!"
3385,48305,4.5,2.0,Very good at teaching the subject material. Grading was fair and tests were easy if you knew the subject material.
3386,48305,3.5,5.0,"He is really fair, but the class was SO hard. Even if I went into an exam feeling good about the topic... I still ended up doing poorly. I respect him a lot. In most classes I end up getting 100% on homework, but I hardly passed the homework grade."
3387,48305,2.5,5.0,learned a lot.  class was very difficult. material on the test was much more difficult than class work.  homework grading was very tough
3388,48305,4.0,3.0,Great professor. Made calc III as clear as possible despite the abstract material.
3389,48305,4.5,3.0,Hard but good at his job. Make sure to take notes and take time on the hmwk...and he is a total babe
3390,48305,5.0,4.0,Professor Cassidy is a great teacher.  Calc 2 can be hard due to the amount of content but he does a great job making everything clear.  He gives hard tests (a girl left his final crying) but they are fair and he gives extra credit.  A great teacher and he looks like John Malcovic
3391,48305,5.0,4.0,"He's a great teacher, very fair, tough, yes, but a worthwhile challenge. He is enthusiastic and cares that the students learn the material. Cassidy is the best teacher I've had so far at Bucknell. Plus his hair looks like Egon from Ghostbusters which is ultra ****. And if you can't spell &quot;Calculus&quot;, don't complain about your professor."
3392,48305,4.5,4.0,"good teacher, hard material, tries to be a fair grader"
3393,48305,3.0,5.0,"good guy, very nice... however assumes you know everything even if you have never had calculous in high school, very tough teacher, however, willing to help you during office hours ... he knows a lot, however, doesnt teach it well .. moves fast ... hard class, good guy... def. need a tutor to do wel"
3394,48305,5.0,4.0,"Wonderful class!  Difficult, but taught in a clear and enthusiastic manner. You learn so much!"
3395,48305,2.0,4.0,calculus taught in an unclear fashion.  Acted like you should know exactly what he is saying already.

3399,2184371,4.0,2.0,"Great professor overall, gave a lot of extra credit opportunities for us to do well in the class. He makes the exams very easy and I highly recommend to take his class for an A."
3400,2184371,4.0,2.0,"Rainforests was a more interesting class than I anticipated. You get some environmental, some political, and some anthropological viewpoints on how the rainforest is viewed, used, lived in, and being destroyed. You have 2 take home exams for the mid term and final, a weekly moodle entry, and 1 small presentation on a reading. Not hard to get an A"
3401,2538684,4.0,2.0,"The class was easy especially if you've ever used excel before and have taken a statistics class. He is the kindest, most thoughtful professor I have had. I had his class in S2020 and he still recognized me walking around campus F2020 with a mask on and asked me about my semester. He is also very accommodating and is always willing to help."
3402,2538684,5.0,2.0,Professor Lu is awesome. His class is easy if you pay attention in class. Homework is easy and you know exactly what is expected of you. Super nice guy.
3403,2538684,5.0,1.0,Professor Lu is awesome. He is an easy grader and cares alot
3404,2538684,5.0,2.0,"Prf. Lu is a new professor, but he cares deeply for his students' education on the topic and the professional world. Very understanding when it comes to grading and will change deadlines half the time if the whole class comes to a consensus. He actively seeks participation from every student and will hold extra hours to accommodate. 11/10 person"
3405,2538684,4.0,4.0,"He is not the expertise in MGMT 102, avoid and take Chan's MGMT 102 instead."
3406,586946,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed taking this class with Professor Pollack. It was my first English class at Bucknell, and I really appreciated how she introduced us to the genre of Modern American Literature. I could feel her passion for the subject as she lectured in class, and I think my writing improved greatly over the course."
3407,586946,5.0,4.0,I really enjoyed Professor Pollack's course. She is very personable in the classroom and encourages her students to participate in lively discussions. She is also incredibly supportive outside of class and always accessible via email or phone. Her timely feedback improved my writing greatly. 
3408,586946,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Pollack is one of the best professors I have had the chance to learn from. She expects a lot from her students, but she is also equally as generous with her time and feedback. It is also clear that Prof. Pollack cares a lot about not only the material she teaches, but engaging her students in discussion and collaboration as well. "
3409,586946,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Pollack helped me learn to write at a college level, helped me learn to read literary texts closely, and also has been endlessly supportive in helping me outside of the classroom. The university could use more people like Dr. Pollack! "
3410,586946,5.0,3.0,Harriet inspired me to love Faulkner. I was probably destined for failing out of college if it hadn't been for her 20th American literature class. I highly recommend. She's tough reader but will make you a better writer. 
3411,586946,3.5,2.0,"Ok. She is a really quite lecturer, but really smart and nice. She's pretty easy on kids that hand in assignments late etc. She really improved my writing. I'd take another course with her."
3412,586946,4.0,4.0,a good lecturer but needs a microphone
3413,586946,3.0,2.0,"She's a genuinely nice woman and clearly loves what she does.  She's very encouraging in terms of writing journals and papers.  My one complaint would be that she talks EXTREMELY quietly, thus it's easy to get distracted and zone out in class.  I'd recommend her though and the course."
3414,586946,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher. Easy, approachable, very nice. Her class was interesting and I enjoyed her lectures."
3415,586946,4.0,2.0,"Good lecturer.  However, VERY SOFT SPOKEN! But very nice indeed.  Don't worry about deadlines...she's one of the most flexible professors you'll ever have."
3416,586946,3.0,4.0,one of the most disappointing classes I've had at Bucknell...
3417,586946,5.0,1.0,"she's sometimes hard to listen to, but overall she's an easy teacher. she's nice and helpful if you approach her and she's flexible with deadlines. i reccomend her."
3418,586946,4.0,3.0,Interesting lecturer. A true expert in souther literature. Very flexible with assignment due dates and extensions. Recommended!!!
3419,2677957,5.0,3.0,"POLS 290 was awesome. I knew nothing about Military and Politics going in but learned a lot. She's also incredibly engaging. You'll do well in the class as long as you do the readings. Quizzes were online and were throughout the semester, but as long as you did the readings you were fine. Would highly recommend Professor Burns if you can."
3420,2677957,5.0,2.0,"Professor Burns is really good. Shes cool and interesting. She gives 3 papers and isnt a harsh grader. Her lectures are really interesting and makes you think. Her readings outside class arent bad, just make sure you watch her videos before class. She had us do group projects throughout the semester, which were not hard. Definitely take her."
3421,2677957,5.0,3.0,Military and Politics is the best class I've ever taken at Bucknell. Dr. Burns is so smart and such a good teacher and I cannot recommend highly enough. A ton of cool group projects like coup simulations and debates. I only wish I could take more classes with her.
3422,2677957,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Burns is one of the best political science professors at Bucknell. I was nervous to take POLS 296 as its the hardest pols classes at Bucknell, but with Dr. Burns the class is as hard as you make it. If you meet with her, in which she always finds availability for her students, you will be just fine. Im looking forward to taking seminar with her"
3423,2677957,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Burns was a great professor--she was super funny and nice in her lectures, and the tests and essays were very fair--it's not an easy A in that you don't have to try, but if you apply yourself it's not at all hard to do well."
3424,2677957,4.0,2.0,"I've had her for two classes and I really like her. So knowledgeable, funny, and understanding, the exams normally have some essay component that she is understanding with grading. A lot of reading for 274, no textbook but lots of academic journals. If you don't find the material interesting proceed with caution since you will be reading a lot."
3425,2677957,5.0,2.0,Shes super nice and really passionate about what she teaches. Shes also very understanding of her students because she has a lot going on and she understands that we have the same! 10/10 would recommend
3426,2677957,5.0,3.0,super nice
3427,769222,5.0,5.0,This man is a legend. He wrote our textbook. Also he is very hot.
3428,769222,4.5,4.0,"Hanyak is the man. A little intimidating at first, but he's awesome. You will spend so many hours doing work for that class, but it's not too hard. Also, he kills trees like he's a lumberjack."
3429,769222,4.5,3.0,Dr. Hanyak = t'awesome
3430,1322182,3.0,3.0,This course was just plain not interesting.  I think she made the class feel pretty awkward.  Everyone in it was just &quot;dead&quot; the whole time.  I also sometimes questioned her knowledge of Comparative Politics.
3431,1322182,2.5,3.0,Fupa&#63;
3432,2188485,3.0,2.0,"She is very passionate and knowledgable, however, is very unorganized and difficult to understand/follow. Do not need to read, and grades extremely easy. A nice person and a super-easy A but you won't learn anything unless you do it yourself/ genuinely try to pay attention."
3433,2188485,4.0,2.0,Can seem very disheveled and disorganized but you can ask any questions to clear up any confusions. All of the information that will appear on the test and quizzes is always clear and explained during class. She is super easy to talk to and ready to help you with anythings. Highly recommend.
3434,2188485,2.0,3.0,"She teaches in a way that is extremely high energy to the point that it can sometimes give anxiety to the students. Often instructions were unclear, there were 25 minute quizzes on reading during class, and speaks at a mile a minute to the point where there are tangents every ten seconds. She is unbelievable intelligent but this doesn't work for me"
3435,2593995,4.0,4.0,"Professor Chow is very, very intimidating, but he does truly care about the welfare of his students and tries his best to make sure everyone is included in conversations and no one goes unheard. He really enjoys diving deeply into intense topics and discussing them at length, which can get a little uncomfortable but are very thought provoking."
3436,2593995,4.0,3.0,"Banned Books is a very small but close class. The books you will read are very good and the discussions in class make them even better. Jeremy expects participation and if you are not trying, he will call you out on it. There are a good amount of essays but he allows you to choose the prompt. He cares about his students if they care about the class"
3437,1780939,4.0,2.0,"The only homework we had was a reasonable amount of reading, three short papers and one final paper. I really enjoyed having him because he was so interested in what he was teaching. Definitely a good professor to have, and a pretty easy class."
3438,2067661,1.0,4.0,"First and foremost, foundation seminars are supposed to be an introduction to college reading, writing, and testing. This was more of an ECON 231 class (as the presentations were labeled for over half the semester). Prof doesn't prioritize students success in his class, lectures are lengthy and hardly any explanation is given."
3439,2067661,5.0,2.0,This class is really interesting and the group project that happens throughout the course is a nice insight into how you can use econometrics in the real world. Professor kinnaman is very forgiving and wants people to succeed - hed rather you learn the material without tons of stress than focus on a grade.
3440,2067661,5.0,2.0,I love professor kinnaman. He makes class fun and is very understanding. Always willing to help students outside of class.
3441,2067661,3.0,5.0,"Prof Kinnaman was a tough exam giver/grader, and his lectures were often difficult to follow (all notes written on board, no PPT/use of textbook, etc.). To be fair, the course is difficult in and of itself, and teaching the class is surely a challenge. He used no concrete material for us to reference, making the class all the more challenging."
3442,2067661,1.0,5.0,"Prof Kinnaman is extremely lazy and a pretty terrible professor. The entire class is spent doing questions on the board which he even has trouble getting correct himself. It is very easy to get board and lost in his confusing lectures. Overall, a very unenjoyable class and I would avoid taking this professor."
3443,2067661,4.0,4.0,Very Nice guy. Definitely go to his officer hour if you have any question
3444,46297,5.0,2.0,I never thought that Philosophy could be that interesting. Professor Groff had definitely inspired me to learn more about the subject matter.
3445,46297,5.0,2.0,Pete Groff really cares about philosophy and his passion shows through into his lectures. Tests are really easy if you prepare well which is easy to do because he gives you all of the information on the test ahead of time. Would recommend to anyone needing a philosophy credit
3446,46297,4.0,2.0,I really enjoyed taking Philosophy with Prof Groff. He was very passionate about the material which helped make it more interesting. I also liked that he combined his lectures with a lot of class discussion. The tests are pretty straight forward/similar to study guides and he is very open to meeting with students for office hours. Would recommend.
3447,46297,5.0,2.0,"Professor Groff presents high-level concepts in an easy, digestible manner. His lectures are clear and inspiring. If you're willing to grapple with the subject matter, you'll enjoy his classes. He lectures particularly well on religious philosophy and is good about pointing out common threads between religions. Laid-back and occasionally funny."
3448,46297,5.0,3.0,"Pete Groff is the MAN. He does a great job of taking some really confusing topics and making them easy for his students to understand. He's clearly very passionate about philosophy, which makes it that much easier to be interested in what he's talking about. If you have the chance, take his class!!!"
3449,46297,2.5,4.0,"I can easily say that it was a struggle to stay away in Pete Groff's Philosophy 100 class. I would legitimately turn to my friend at the end of class and say, ""wow I actually didn't fall asleep for a second this class."" He is so boring that it's so hard to stay away. But Groff is clearly very interested in philosophy and shows enthusiasm. "
3450,46297,4.0,3.0,Dr Peter is 100 percent and is a freshmaka
3451,46297,5.0,2.0,Groff is the man always keeps class interesting and fresh.
3452,46297,4.0,1.0,"Pretty cool guy. The class itself was pretty boring, but the course is easy. You just have to go to class and take notes and then turn your papers in. Easy A and overall I actually learned some things!"
3453,46297,5.0,2.0,great guy and really smart. understands the logic behind everything
3454,46297,5.0,3.0,great teacher. passionate about his work. Makes philosophy very interesting and enjoyable.
3455,46297,5.0,1.0,"Professor Groff is one of the best professors there is.  He will make philosophy incredibly interesting and easy to follow.  You do the basic work required and participate in a 100-level class, you've got an A.  More importantly, he'll make you enjoy what you're learning."
3456,46297,5.0,5.0,Cool dude and great teacher.  Mistaken though in his belief that Islamic philosophy has anything near as important to offer us as recent analytic work on vagueness.  Also I hear he plays a Jap Strat.
3457,46297,5.0,1.0,Peter Groff is awesome!!! He is the most interesting professor I've ever had. He is my HERO !  I wish to take all of his classes...
3458,46297,4.0,1.0,"Pretty the man. loves what he does, interesting, easy class, dont really need to go to class too ofter, easy grader.TAKE HIM"

3465,1780956,5.0,3.0,Professor Isleem has been one of the best professors I've ever had the pleasure of working with. His instructions are very clear and he puts a lot of effort into his instruction and teaching. He is always very flexible with assignments and grades will be no issue only if you show effort and improvement. And his lectures are always very interesting.
3466,1780956,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors here at Bucknell! Professor Isleem is the sweetest man ever and I would highly recommend taking 101 for anyone who needs to fill a language requirement.
3467,1780956,3.5,3.0,"Such a sweet guy! Even brought us homemade hummus one day. Honestly if you put in the work this class is not that challenging. However, it is difficult to prepare for tests/quizzes because the activities on it  are harder than those in the homework."
3468,46301,2.0,5.0,"Only 3 tests each are 100 true or false, but often the questions border on opinion questions. Hard to focus during his class as he lectures every day and is monotone."
3469,46301,4.0,3.0,"I love this man. Surprisingly funny, very insightful, injects a lot of personal experience which made for very interesting anecdotes. Kind of a tough grader, but nowhere near the worst I've had at Bucknell. One of my favorite classes to attend. won't get bored if you like pols True, his lectures are a bit monotone and hard to hear /sometimes/."
3470,46301,4.0,3.0,"This professor seems dull at first, but the class is really interesting if you are interested in politics, and he also has a dry sense of humor which is nice. I would also recommend sitting in the first row. You don't need to read the book much, just pay attention and take good notes, and don't miss class."
3471,46301,1.0,4.0,"monotone, doesn't care much about anything"
3472,46301,4.5,1.0,"Seems to be very monotone but is actually a really funny guy. Great teacher. Just show up to class, take good notes, and review them every once in a while. Don't really need to read. Very easy and interesting class."
3473,46301,4.0,2.0," Very straightforward. 2-3 tests a year of 100 true false and one paper. No homework is ever assigned and the reading is not necessary to passing but is often really interesting and useful if you enjoy the subject. Sit in the front rows because he is really quite, very boring but if you pay attention he's actually got a huge dry sens of humor. "
3474,46301,1.5,4.0,Provides no motivation to read any of the books but thats the only way youll pass. 3 100 true or false tests and randomly checking attendance twice is the only thing he does. Impossible to hear his lectures. Exams expanded past material only covered in class. High regret for fulfilling my requirements. 
3475,46301,1.5,5.0,"This was an awful class. Even sitting in the front row it was hard to hear his lectures and his tests were so obscure that the best notes in the world would not prepare you for them. Not to mention his lips are always blue from smoking right before class. Bad guy, bad teacher, bad class."
3476,46301,3.0,3.0,"Sanjian is a nice guy, but he is exceptionally boring and his exams don't make sense. They are 100 T/F questions, but they are unclear and don't really reflect your understanding of the material. Office hours help a little bit but for the most part Sanjian makes the class a lot harder than it actually is."
3477,46301,2.0,5.0,I found this teachers tests quite difficult.  They are true and false and so random that if you take perfect notes and read the text you can still do terribly on a test.  I would recommend finding a different teacher for the subject you are considering taking with him.
3478,46301,2.5,5.0,Very boring. Only gave two tests which consisted of 100 T/F questions and were so hard.
3479,46301,3.5,2.0,"The course consists of 3, 100 True/False question exams.  That's it.  So if you're bad at True/False, this course is not for you.  He seems like he'd be really boring, but I found the course to be extremely interesting.  He's subtly hilarious and a pretty nice guy.  I'd definitely recommend this course with him."
3480,46301,5.0,1.0,"By far my favorite teacher at Bucknell. I almost switched classes when i heard him speak, but now I love it! Has monotone voice but I don't even notice because everyhting he says is genious. take this class if you like politics"
3481,46301,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic lecturer, can seem a bit monotone at first but it goes away/ you get used to it. One of fav. profs at Bucknell"
3482,46301,4.0,1.0,"Everyone else was right. He is very monotone, but what he has to say is really interesting. Sit in the front to hear him especially when he turns on the AC. He has a very dry, sarcastic, and subtle sense humor-I loved it!"
3483,46301,2.0,3.0,awful. monotone. mumbles notes the ENTIRE class. awful.
3484,46301,4.0,2.0,"He's a pretty good teacher, not the loudest teacher, so if you prefer to sit in the back you're kinda screwed.  He is a fairly funny teacher, sometimes makes jokes, but never laughs at his own jokes.  I liked him."
3485,46301,3.0,4.0,"interesting proffessor, talks dry just like ben stein tests arent' so bad, just have to study from the notes."
3486,46301,4.5,3.0,"Lectures remind me of Ben Stien in Ferris Buellers day off. MONOTONE, but very interesting. Never found myself watching the clock. You almost dont have to read if you take good notes. Tests are strange (True false mult. choice style&#63;). Tests are harder than they seem, but managable. Highly recomend!"
3487,46301,5.0,2.0,"As long as you go to class and take notes, this class is quite possibly the easiest, yet informative, class I've taken.  No reading necessary if you go to class."
3488,46301,3.0,3.0,"Easy tests, enthusiastic, XENOPHOB!"
3489,46301,5.0,3.0,"he's a wonderful lecturer, not such a great adviser -- hard to find."

3492,1049823,3.0,1.0,"Professor McKinneys class was interesting since it was mostly discussion based, but none of us got much out of the class. As a foundation seminar we didnt really learn how to write, and the writing assignments we had werent useful. The class was very easy though, and you can tell Professor McKinney really cares about his students."
3493,1049823,5.0,1.0,"McKinney's class is a discussion-based class. When talking about identity and diversity, he was very respectful and made students feel like they could be open during the discussion. He truly tries to get to know his students and build a relationship with them."
3494,1049823,5.0,2.0,"Professor McKinney is the best Spanish professor I have ever had. He transfers his excitement about Spain and its culture to his students quite well, getting everyone involved and interested in the subject. The course itself was not too difficult, but I learned a lot. Highly recommend the course to anyone considering it, and McKinney himself."
3495,1049823,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely wonderful. He gives really interesting culture lessons and his tests are always fair. I was nervous about taking a higher level spanish class, but McKinney was great! Take him!"
3496,1049823,4.0,2.0,Really nice teacher. Not a hard class at all as long as you show up and speak up occassionally. Classtime can get a little boring but he is so nice it doesnt matter
3497,1049823,5.0,3.0,He has a great appreciation and enthusiasm for what he teaches. He is very helpful outside of class and tries to keep class interesting.

3499,1477855,1.0,4.0,"Be prepared to ask him questions and here ""oohh well I haven't done the problem yet"" and receive absolutely no information that answers your question.  If you take him I hope you have a chegg account."
3500,1477855,1.5,3.0,"I'm sure this guy knows his stuff, but he can. not. convey. information. He makes lots of mistakes, is unhelpful, and often confuses himself. Because of him I did not understand Thermo 1, and am now doing horrible in Thermo 2. Be prepared to listen to tangents during class. Avoid him if you enjoy having a decent GPA."
3501,1477855,1.5,3.0,Great guy! Terrible professor. He is not clear in class. He spends more time talking about random stuff. He pauses constantly and makes sooo many mistakes. Don't try to take notes in pen!!! Not helpful outside of class either. Try to get a different teacher for this class!!!
3502,1477855,1.5,4.0,"This guy is very smart, but CANNOT TEACH. You'll learn more about sailboats and clouds than actual class material. Any class with him is more or less a self-taught course. If you have Thermo with him, you are in serious trouble. He spends more time fixing mistakes on the board than teaching. When he does teach, he reads out of the book. Have fun."
3503,1748193,4.0,2.0,"Professor Kurdia was a great intro to computer science professor. She was very helpful at office hours, gave lecture notes to study, and posted study guides for the tests. The homework assignments were fairly straightforward, but her and her army of TAs were always there to help. "
3504,1748193,2.5,3.0,"This is the first time that Kurdia is teaching this course and teaching at Bucknell so I try to cut her some slack. For a pretty big class, her constant use of PowerPoints and her quiet voice did not help to make the class interested. But she was helpful outside of class. Office hours were good."
3505,1748193,3.5,3.0,I had her for CSCI 203 and she's developed her teaching techniques very much for the better. Her lessons were mostly interactive and engaging. We worked in groups to develop methods to solve usual technical questions and it cultivated our own problem-solving techniques.
3506,1748193,3.0,1.0,"very nice lady. not the clearest teacher, but she was good with one on one situations. made it easy to do well in the class"
3507,1748193,3.5,2.0,"I have to admit that the beginning of this class was dreadful! She would lecture from the Powerpoint all the time and since she has the quietest voice , at any time 5-8 people were sleeping. BUT she's developed her teaching technique and now engages her students with much more group work and practice in writing in Python before the homework."
3508,1748193,2.0,4.0,"Very hard to understand in class. Whenever someone asks a question in python, it was somewhat ignored and ambiguously answered. I didn't feel the need to go to extra help because I thought it would confuse me a bit more but the textbook was the classes bible."
3509,503014,5.0,2.0,"Best professor ever! If you show that you care even a little, she will make geology so fun. She makes things super clear and explains them on a basic level so everyone can understand. If you need help, she is always willing to meet in office hours. There is no way to do bad in her class if you just give a little effort."
3510,503014,4.5,3.0,"Professor Gray was amazing. I went into the class expecting not to enjoy it whatsoever, but I was happily surprised. Towards the end, the material becomes much more interesting and you begin to realize how much you have actually learned throughout the semester. Take good notes, read the textbook if you need and do not be afraid to ask for help."
3511,503014,4.5,2.0,"One of the best professors I've had! She is the sweetest person, genuinely wants everyone in the class to learn, and is very approachable. Her door is, literally, always open if you need help. Tests very reasonable, no trick questions. If you get the chance, go on the New Jersey Structure trip! She can definitely tell if you're putting forth effort"
3512,503014,4.0,2.0,"Extremely nice and clear for the most part. Gets upset when you don't know the difficult topics as a class. Does not review a lot but that's what taking notes are for. She has a degree in Engineering so knows what she's talking about. Will not know your name or expect participation. Just take your notes, study, and go. Not bad."
3513,503014,4.5,1.0,Great professor.
3514,503014,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. She is very nice and will help you out as much as she can. Tests not hard at all. Easy to take notes. I reccomend signing up for her classes.
3515,503014,4.5,2.0,Incredibly nice woman. wants her students to do well and will do anything to help you do so. doesn't really use the textbook at all... just take good notes in class and youll do fine. tests arent hard
3516,503014,3.5,1.0,Total flake. She'll go off on a tangent complete with tons of &quot;um&quot;s and tests you on things neither in the book nor notes. Takes points off for random tiny things. Avoid at all costs.
3517,503014,5.0,4.0,Awesome teacher!! Loved her class and how she taught it.  Very smart woman who will do anything to help you.  Wish I could have taken another class with her.
3518,503014,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, keeps the class pretty interesting; possibly one of the nicest people I've ever met, will bend over backwards to help her students out"
3519,503014,5.0,2.0,"Really sweet woman, tests aren't too horrible, very very good at explaining things.  Talks at a good pace so I had no problem keeping up.  Hope to take another of her classes in the future."
3520,503014,4.5,3.0,"Very sweet woman and class was fairly well explained, but tests were difficult and contained a lot of information. She is always willing to meet with and help students."
3521,503014,4.5,1.0,"lots of lecturing, but as long as you take notes you'll be fine on tests.  quizzes really easy and she's really sweet"
3522,251122,1.0,1.0,DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS MAN. He is incapable of effectively teaching a class. He wastes an immense amount of time every class and you can learn more by lightly skimming the textbook. Coming to class feels like a waste of an hour and a half every time. He is nice but expects a lot for no reason and gives you an A anyway.
3523,251122,1.0,1.0,WASTE OF TIME! we learned nothing in this class! I took AP environmental science in high school and this is literally environmental science for dumb middle schoolers! all he does is ride around the room on his high horse talking about how we are the reason the world is going to end bc we don't care enough. stay away!
3524,251122,1.0,3.0,"Someone else said &quot;A discouraging presence in the classroom&quot; and that's a great way to describe him. He doesn't care about teaching, he's given up on that part of his job. He's just riding out his tenure. So just keep that in mind if taking his class. Not HARD content-wise, but he simply does not care about teaching lol. Good luck staying awake"
3525,251122,5.0,4.0,"This class changed my life! You HAVE to take notes, download the slides and put everything together. Really teaches you to think but you have to work for it. This is what I expexcted from college and don't get much"
3526,251122,3.0,4.0,"I took this course in a freshman only class and he was trying to help us out but wasn't very successful. I definitely recommend the course mainly because of the second half of the semester project. The first half is all earth science and he tends to stop himself and restart a lot- he's kind of all over the place. Nice guy though, willing to help"
3527,251122,1.0,5.0,I have never been more disappointed in my life. I have never met a more arrogant person in my life. I regret taking this class. This class and this professor are completely disjointed. To blatantly and constantly reject student opinion is NOT how you tech a class. 
3528,251122,1.0,3.0,"I have never known an educator more self-absorbed than Griffin. His classes, when not completely empty of substance, involve lectures pertaining to topics that only he would find relevant. No clarity in assignments or grading criteria. A discouraging presence in the classroom."
3529,251122,1.0,5.0,"Quite possibly the worst class I've ever taken.  His tests do not cover the material presented in lecture, he doesn't like athletes, and is unconcerned with 18 out of 21 people failing."
3530,251122,1.0,4.0,Terrible professor. Expected students to know information for tests that he didn't even teach about it. Awful grading system. I will never take a class with this professor again and advise no one else to either.
3531,251122,1.0,4.0,"Hey was horrible, expected you to understand everything the first time he spoke of something. If you are struggling he makes things harder and expects more. If your an athlete DO NOT take this class."
3532,251122,4.0,3.0,"Duane is a little quirky and kind of out there but overall a great professor. I took this class as a sophomore and expected to get my butt kicked. He's really helpful though and wants you to do well. He doesn't really give many grades and tests were very general. Field trips are interesting, definitely a lot of work but it could've been a lot worse"
3533,251122,2.0,5.0,"Grades harshly and not clear on all assignments.  He clearly is very intelligent and expects you to understand everything you say the first time through.  The class could have been really interesting but he ruined it.  Oh, and DO NOT tell him your an athlete, you're guaranteeing a low grade from the start."
3534,251122,2.0,4.0,not clear at all about subject/grading
3535,251122,4.0,3.0,"He is a really nice guy! If you try hard in his class and stay on top of the assignments he asks of you then you will seriously do well. Try to get on his good side, it pays off. He is a really smart guy and is very willing to help you out if you need. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! It makes him take you seriously and you learn a lot from his genius!"
3536,251122,4.0,4.0,"Take advantage of extra credit opportunities and office hours. There is a lot of material, but the tests ask about broad trends and general connections, so just memorizing isn't that helpful. He is kind of a picky grader. Field trips are kind of random but fun, and he has a lot of jokes and interesting stories, so the class is laid back and fun"
3537,251122,3.0,2.0,"such a funny guy, love him. he is a genius and is a bit confusing when he talks about the subject matter. he is really into what he teaches. as long as you try hard in the class you will do well even if you do bad on exams. show effort that you care about the class and meet with him though if you dont understand."
3538,251122,2.5,4.0,"the whole time i thought i was going to fail and even considered withdrawing after basically failing all the impossible exams. However, he gives so many extra credit opportunities that only require your attendance and he makes group projects worth a TON so i actually ended up doing well in the class. His grades seem subjective. Just try hard."
3539,251122,1.5,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN AVOID IT. I'm a deans list student, great GPA and took him and it dropped my average significantly. If you just need a lab credit do anything else to avoid this- I'm so mad the reviews didnt warn me enough. People are right he is quirky and sometimes nice but overall his tests are impossible and he is not helpful at all."
3540,251122,5.0,5.0,great class. he never said hed curve the grades. high score earned in teh class sets the top of hte scale and its 10% down from that for each grade. totally fair but science majors set the top. i did ok xcept for the final. shouldve studied more cuz it killed me. learned a lot tho. makes you think.
3541,251122,5.0,4.0,"Perhaps it's just the 231 class that is hard, because I don't know what everyone else is whining about. Duane is an absolute GENIUS when it comes to problem-solving and abstract thinking, and he looks at the subject matter in such an interesting, fresh way. He is a fair grader and it's not hard to do well if you study your book. And he's hilarious."
3542,251122,4.0,5.0,great class if you love weather. great prof if you want to learn. don't take if you're looking for an easy lab credit. his class really should be 300 level because its a serious science class. weather is a lot of physics. small number of engineers/science majors set the high grades and the rest of us got screwed.
3543,251122,1.0,5.0,this is the worst teacher I've ever had in my entire life. he was useless- DO NOT TAKE! he told us not to worry about our grades however he screwed us all in the end and gave us lower grades than everyone expected...AVOID AT ALL COSTS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!
3544,251122,2.5,5.0,"from what i gather classes before mine seemed to have taken advantage of duane, or at least he felt like they did. so then he made it too difficult...not worth the stress esp. if you reading humidity graphs and such is not going to be part of your life in the future. stay away."
3545,251122,2.5,5.0,"cool guy, but we were told he would scale grades at the end (esp considering most of the class was getting 60/70 averages on the tests) but he didnt curve in the end.  interesting class, but in the end it ended up hurting my gpa and just causing more stress in my life, not worth it if you're simply searching for another lab science credit"
3546,251122,5.0,4.0,"He is a mysterious and powerful device, whose mystery is only exceeded by his power. A walking encyclopedia who strides the earth as a colossus, leaps tall trees in single bounds, and no longer suffers fools gladly. And he's funny too."
3547,251122,5.0,3.0,"Great lab credit for seniors; he really enjoys upperclassmen & the subject, so its fun.  &quot;End of the World as we Know It&quot; CAPS was unconventional & basically brilliant. Watched movies, had intelligent discussion, & party at his house on last day, when final paper was due. We all worked hard and all got A's ('cept the kid who didn't turn in a paper)"
3548,251122,4.0,3.0,"I took this class cause I heard it was an easy lab science.  Well, his tests are insane and his teaching methods are hard to follow sometimes.  Aside from that, I have figured out that he curves the heck out of everything, so all should be good in the end.  Interesting class.  Very hard in the short run, but pretty easy in the long run."
3549,251122,2.0,4.0,"a bit scattered in his lectures, hard to follow.  tests are very difficult, he looks for minute details that are hard to recognize.. nice guy but not the best teacher"
3550,251122,5.0,3.0,"I'm not big on the subjecy matter, but Duane goes all out on this stuff.  On field trips he gets down on his knees and digs in the mud to find pieces of wood.     Fun guy."
3551,251122,5.0,3.0,Duane is the man
3552,251122,4.5,3.0,"really nice guy who will go to all extremes to make sure you will do well in his class, he LOVES giving extra credit on tests (yay) and is extremely helpful! take his class!"
3553,251122,5.0,2.0,fun guy who loves what he does. i wasn't interested in the stuff when i started the class but i am now. great teacher
3554,251122,4.5,3.0,best.class.ever
3555,251122,5.0,4.0,"Hard, but I leanred SO MUCH."
3556,490739,4.0,3.0,"Meinke does a lot of lectures but allows for class discussions and group work in class. You'll do a lot of reading and writing (on the shorter side), but you should definitely make note of what you read because chances are high that the information will show up on your exam."
3557,490739,4.0,3.0,"three tests, research paper, and then small homeworks. tests are all short answer and then essay. realy kind man though if you reach out he will help you"
3558,490739,5.0,3.0,"While he gives alot of work, Professor Meinke really makes sure students have an in depth knowledge of the political system. He is a fair grader and gives a lot of chances for students to raise their grades. He is also extremely unbiased and gives his students the place to voice their opinions."
3559,490739,5.0,1.0,"As long as you do the readings, the class is a breeze. The lectures are typically based on the readings, and the exams are often simplified. He keeps the lectures interesting with room for discussion."
3560,490739,2.0,4.0,"Not the most caring professor. He wasn't the best professor for this particular course, but others love him for other classes."
3561,490739,4.0,2.0,"Prof Mienke was a great and reasonable professor. After all 3 of the exams throughout the semester I knew I did well because I studied. If you don't study, you definitely won't do well. Get ready to read a lot, especially in the textbook, but his lectures cover almost everything in there. Very much a class you'll get an A if you do the work."
3562,490739,5.0,3.0,Lots of reading but truly a great lecturer who will keep you engaged for the entire class period. He does not like having laptops in class so all notes are hand written. If you talk to him he will make an exception. Good guy and a good professor.
3563,490739,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed my political science class with him so much so that i'm considering taking more classes on the subject. although there is a lot of reading, and all of it (especially from the textbook) may not seem necessary at time, he really makes it worthwhile. Makes really good connections to 'current issues'."
3564,490739,4.0,4.0,"Not the most entertaining lecturer, but he knows his stuff."
3565,490739,5.0,3.0,"I've taken several classes with Prof. Meinke and he is my favorite professor at Bucknell. He is passionate about the subject and truly wants to help students learn. He assigns a lot of readings, but if you're interested in the topic it isn't bad."
3566,490739,4.5,3.0,"Meinke is by far the best teacher I've had at Bucknell so far. He is so helpful in every respect, especially when you go to office hours it's so clear that he really cares and wants to help you. He is also just one of the smartest guys. He's so smart that you want to do well just to respect and impress him. Everyone should take a class by him! "
3567,490739,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely wonderful professor! His lectures can be a little boring because if you do the reading, he is mostly going over everything from the book. He does tend to lighten it up though and show interesting clips or provide discussion time. His tests can be slightly hard but he does give you ample time to prepare."
3568,490739,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, great class. Definitely my favorite class of the semester. He is entertaining, clear, interesting, and straight forward. Tests are doable and he is extremely helpful in office hours. Highly recommend."
3569,490739,5.0,3.0,take him! hes awesome
3570,490739,4.5,2.0,Professor Meinke's American Politics class was easily my favorite class this past semester. Everything is very straight forward and he's a really great guy overall. Definitely take this class!
3571,490739,5.0,2.0,"Meinke is an awesome guy and a great professor. He is politically unbiased and connects current events well with class discussion. His class consists of lectures, class discussion and group discussion. In general, if you do the reading and pay attention in class you'll do well. Make sure to participate! Definitely one of the best profs. here!"
3572,490739,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, easily one of the best at Bucknell. He is very unbiased and keeps his lectures somewhat interesting. His tests are certainly not easy, especially for non-IR majors. If you have an interest in the subject then you should certainly take it."
3573,490739,3.5,3.0,Professor Meinke is very intelligent and unbiased. He connects the material with current events and his class is very interesting! Fairly easy as long as you read before class and prepare thoroughly for the tests! He's a great guy overall.
3574,490739,5.0,3.0,"Meinke is an incredible teacher and a great guy. I have taken three classes with him and have enjoyed all of them. He is fair, politically unbiased, and very helpful. Take Meinke if you get the chance"
3575,490739,2.5,5.0,"Meinke is a nice guy, but I hated his class.  He continually called on the same three students who loved to hear themselves speak and it was miserable to sit through."
3576,490739,5.0,3.0,Best teacher I've ever had at Bucknell!
3577,490739,5.0,3.0,"LOVE MEINKE. he was on sabbatical this fall but is back for spring '10... take any class he offers. he's fair and interesting and just a really good teacher! an A in his american politics class is totally attainable if you read occasionally, take notes, and actually prep for the in class essays."
3578,490739,4.5,2.0,I didn't really know too much about politics before taking this class but Meinke made it really interesting and engaging. Also focused a lot on current events.  Great class overall!
3579,490739,4.0,4.0,"Very enjoyable class due to his passion and excitement for the material he was teaching all of us. He cared about our understanding of the material and would never mind saying something twice. Tests were a bit difficult especially with the terms section, but essays were not hard if you prepared for them. Overall, I highly recommend this class toyou"
3580,490739,5.0,2.0,"LOVE MEINKE!! take a class with him if you can! He is great and makes classes fly by. He is very bright and cares a lot about his students. Grades fairly and sometimes even allows you to re-write or edit papers. Great teacher, very interesting. Highly recommend him!!"
3581,490739,5.0,2.0,awesoooome
3582,490739,5.0,2.0,"take every class that you can!!! fantastic professor, very reasonable, very interesting class! you will enjoy going to class and can get a good grade without working yourself to death. it's a win-win"
3583,490739,4.5,3.0,"Very bright and engaging. Contrary to one reviewer's rating, he never once discussed his political views in either of the classes I had with him.  Is passionate about his field and is a great resource."
3584,490739,5.0,3.0,GRAT PROFESSOR!  I have absolutely no idea what previous poster is talking about.  He seems to go out of his way to avoid exposing his opinion on topics discussed in class.  Take any class you can with this guy.
3585,490739,3.0,3.0,"do NOT take a class with him... very biased, opinionated view on topics"
3586,490739,5.0,3.0,Great Professor!! Have taken almost all of his classes. Fair and intelligent. Judicial policy making is his best class.
3587,490739,5.0,4.0,No Comments
3588,490739,5.0,2.0,great professor. Material is very interesting and lectures are beneficial. Have almost taken all the classes he offers and enjoy all of them. One of the best professors in the department.
3589,1494260,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Phan did an incredible job teaching this class.  His presentations were lucid, concise and insightful.  He is clearly a man of the book, embodying erudition and scholarly discipline, while maintaining a very friendly demeanor.  He has no tolerance for Klingons."
3590,1494260,2.0,3.0,"Chris Phan was just hired to teach at Bucknell. He is a terrible professor and all over the place when he teaches. AVOID taking him. He really knows about calculus but certainly does not know how to teach the course, especially to students who havent been exposed to calc. DO NOT take him."
3591,1494260,5.0,1.0,Chris Phan is incredible.  He knows every episode of Star Trek: TNG by episode number.  He's the man.
3592,46325,5.0,2.0,Participation matters to her!! She is a really intelligent and caring prof. She wants everyone to succeed. I learned a lot and was taught in a way so that the info will actually stick with me. I would def take again.
3593,46325,5.0,2.0,"Professor Abowitz is my favorite professor at Bucknell by far. The class was extremely interesting and she kept us engaged by leaving it to a discussion, rather than lecturing at us. She gave take home reading quizzes each week that were an easy grade boost, but she's a little tougher on the papers. You also had to give two easy presentations."
3594,46325,5.0,2.0,She's so passionate and extremely helpful. I loved going to class every day to listen to her talk. She is the reason I am now minoring in Sociology. The course in general is also just really interesting overall. She's very willing to help outside of class too! Go to her office hours! Great personality
3595,46325,5.0,2.0,"Really liked this professor. Always willing to meet for help and accommodate your schedule. She's actually a little harder of a grader than I was expecting, particularly on the ""homeworks"" (2 per semester). Class was fairly interesting. She knows her stuff. Very sweet, wants her students to do well."
3596,46325,4.5,1.0,"Abowitz is a really good teacher and a nice professor overall. I really enjoyed her class, as we talked about a range of interesting topics. As long as you do the readings and pay attention in class, an A is almost guaranteed."
3597,46325,4.5,2.0,"The class is pretty easy and Abowitz is passionate and knows her stuff. She tends to ramble, though, making the lectures slightly boring"
3598,46325,5.0,1.0,"Abowitz is all about making sure you get a good grade. Those who say it's a lot of work, don't know what college is. She gives fair amounts of work, which really just involves reading assignments and one take-home quiz per week (that can be done in less than 3 hours). Tests/HW assignments were simple and she will go out of her way to help."
3599,46325,5.0,3.0,The only students who would not love Professor Abowitz are those that are not at Bucknell to learn. She is not only inspiring but honestly cares about her students education ! LOVE LOVE LOVE HER !!!
3600,46325,2.5,4.0,hated the class
3601,46325,3.5,3.0,"gives an absolutely unreasonable amount of work for a 100 level class. I think she does it just to make your life difficult. She has a huge passion for sociology which is really cool and she is an excellent teacher, but she tries to make sociology harder than it needs to be."
3602,46325,5.0,4.0,"One of my favorite professors at Bucknell! A bit difficult, but GO TO OFFICE HOURS. She will give you everything you need to know and just loves actually having students come in to talk to her. Amazing!"
3603,46325,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor at Bucknell. Not easy easy, but definitely manageable, cares about her students, and flexible with student needs. Very good at teaching her subject!"
3604,46325,5.0,4.0,"intimidating at first to scare off the kids who shouldn't be there, but then gets nicer. lectures are interesting, and she is more than willing to help you with any paper or studying. overall solid professor."
3605,46325,5.0,4.0,She's wonderful and she makes the most boring things sound interesting.
3606,46325,5.0,3.0,"she is pretty cool, fair grader. willing to help."

3610,46325,4.0,3.0,"she comes across mean at first, but after a few classes she lightens up."
3611,1367286,1.0,4.0,"Prof Meiser assigns A LOT of work. I took Drawing 1 (an intro class) and we were cranking out multiple large scale charcoal/graphite drawings a week. My biggest complaint however isn't the workload, but his inability to listen to feedback and his emphasis on technical quality over effort and improvement. Only take his class if you're an art major."
3612,1367286,1.0,4.0,"I don't recommend taking a drawing class with him. I am not an art student and thought that this would be a fun course to help me improve. While it helped me improve my art, the tradeoff of taking this class wasn't worth it. I spent more time on this class making art than my other classes bc he grades on quality of your art vs how much you improve."
3613,1367286,1.0,5.0,"It honestly came as a shock as to how high Professor Meiser's rating was. Do not take his sculpture 1 class whatever you do. I put in many hours into my projects as a non art major, asked for advice, you name it and received a B. Gives reading/writing assignments and expects your sculptures to look professional, even as a beginner. Beware."
3614,1367286,5.0,4.0,"Great, thorough professor, very nice person. Made me very excited to come into class everyday to 3D model and sculpt our creations. Projects required a lot of work, but was always somewhat fun and hands-on, unlike most regular homework. Fair grader. Would definitely take one of his classes again."
3615,1367286,5.0,4.0,"His classes are extremely enjoyable. There is both structure and opportunity for creative freedom, it's the perfect balance. Students from a variety of majors seem to take sculpture classes and almost everybody I've witnessed seems to enjoy the course. You will learn many new techniques and skills that will be useful, regardless of your major."
3616,1367286,4.0,3.0,"Prof Meiser provides a good balance of instruction and feedback. He challenges students to create original and thought-provoking pieces of art. Really good professor, highly recommend"
3617,1367286,4.0,4.0,"Joe is an overall great professor! He is motivated, caring, willing to guide students through their work,  and passionate about his students. Some might expect to get an easy 'A' but Joe makes all his students invest quality time and effort into their work. I have gained much more respect for artists and their work while creating cool pieces myself"
3618,1367286,4.0,4.0,"Professor Meiser teaches drawing with a thorough and rigorous approach. He pushes you to achieve technical excellence as well as conceptual depth. Your understanding of the process of drawing will be supplemented by research into contemporary artists, giving you new contexts for thinking about and making art."
3619,1367286,4.0,4.0,"I took Prof. Meisers Sculpture 1 course and I did spend a lot of time completing projects for this class, but the projects were really cool and I still have all mine!  I would say he has pretty high standards but at least he made the expectations really clear from the beginning. Id take more courses like this if I had time. A great class!"
3620,1367286,5.0,4.0,I thought Professor Meiser was an effective professor and one of the best I have had. He was inspirational while also being easily relatable. He is without a doubt a professor I know I will stay in touch with. I feel fortunate I have had the opportunity to take one of his classes while at Bucknell.
3621,1367286,4.5,4.0,"Joe is a great professor, however he has expectation for each student, especially if you are an art major. The course required a lot of outside class work which consumed a lot of my time eventually hurt me in other classes. But he is very much into his works and students' learning in class. I would recommend him if you are serious about sculpture."
3622,1367286,4.5,1.0,"Incredible teacher, if you do the work and show up to class you will get a good grade. Super passionate about what he does and making sure his students succede"
3623,1367286,4.5,5.0,"Joe makes you work very hard and you'll have to do a good deal of research and may have surprise assignments, but those are the downfalls. I learned more about art in his class than in any art history or studio art class. He's there to help almost all the time and helps you with whatever research you need. This juice is worth the squeeze."
3624,1762550,5.0,1.0,"Ian is the man! Class is very informative and very entertaining. Minimal work and the tests are fair. If you have a choice, take him!"
3625,1762550,4.0,1.0,Really funny guy class is always entertaining and interesting. Very knowledgeable and he barely assigns work. Some reading but you can get by without it. Tests are fair and he prepares you very well for them.
3626,46326,4.5,3.0,Very helpful professor and great guy. Always willing to talk about papers/tests in depth and answer questions. Wants you to do well. Lectures can get boring but worth paying attention to because that stuff is on the exams. Very clear about paper/test format and what he wants. I had no interest in this subject but now I may double major in it.
3627,46326,4.0,2.0,He is a GREAT professor.  He really is passionate about the subject matter and cares about his students.  If you put the time and effort and show him that you are working hard he will reward it.  Not too much work and pretty interesting class.  Very nice down to earth guy!
3628,46326,4.5,3.0,"Great Prof. Dont need to read, he covers material in class. Very Interesting. All Lecture."
3629,46326,2.0,4.0,"this man cannot teach.  period.  He teaches by giving examples withought teaching the concepts - so, basically, you are lost during class.  he is monotone and very boring.  dont get me wrong, he's a very nice guy, but he cannot teach.  each assignment is beyond ambiguous and everyone had a different idea of what to do - very frustrating.  good luck"
3630,46326,5.0,3.0,"Excellent professor. Don't be fooled, classes are a lot of work, but totally worth it."
3631,46326,5.0,4.0,"Awesome class. Tough. Tons of reading. Dr. Silberman opens his mouth, closes his eyes and out rolls volumes, books...he's a &quot;frickin' genius.&quot; And a beautiful man and an activist to boot.  Gives his life to social change.  What more do you want&#63;"
3632,46326,5.0,4.0,Best professor I had. Brilliant.
3633,46326,3.5,1.0,"Sooooo easy- you don't have to do the reading, just show up, he summarizes them in class. Understand American culture&#63; Seen a couple episodes of Law and Order&#63; Payed some attention in US History&#63; This is a great teacher for you!!"
3634,46326,5.0,3.0,this is a great class and I loved it but it's by no means a  fluff  course.
3635,46326,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3636,46326,3.5,4.0,"don't be fooled by 123, it is NOT easy"
3637,214265,2.0,3.0,"He gave incredibly boring lectures (powerpoint all day, every day), spent a lot of time taking attendance, and often discussed things that weren't relevant to the class. The material was easy, but he didn't teach it well and it felt like a waste of time coming. The online textbook was just as bad, so I had to use another book. "
3638,214265,4.5,1.0,Generally very nice. Tests are short and easy. He is very helpful during office hours.
3639,214265,2.5,2.0,"Very inconsistent with his grading procedures.  I saw two programs (identical logic, different comments) receive a 7% difference in grade.  Difficult to work with if you've done something that he wouldn't have done - shuts down kind of like a little kid until you change your logic to his style."
3640,214265,4.5,1.0,"Great teacher, easy course"
3641,214265,4.0,2.0,Good guy. Keeps the classes interesting and creates a generally fun atmosphere while still teaching you the material. Fair grader.
3642,214265,4.5,1.0,No Comments
3643,214265,4.5,3.0,"I found him to be a good teacher, fair grader, and generally a nice guy."
3644,214265,5.0,4.0,The things I learned in his classes in the early nineties have carried me through almost ten years in the industry.
3645,214265,4.0,2.0,No Comments
3646,214265,4.0,3.0,Great professor!  He has a lot of energy and is really hysterical!
3647,214265,4.0,1.0,"His labs were espcially helpful.  Nice, but not particularly intense person."
3648,214265,1.0,1.0,No Comments
3649,1156348,5.0,1.0,Great course.  Professor is very helpful both during lecture and outside class (at office hours).  Would love to take another course with this professor.
3650,1156348,5.0,1.0,Mihai is the best professor I've had. Extremely easy and extremely nice and helpful. His class is enjoyable and he keeps you entertained. Plus he has a sweet accent.
3651,1156348,4.0,3.0,"Really Nice Guy.  Will definitely go out of his way to get to know you.  Statistics is inherently boring, but he found ways to make it more relevant and interesting."
3652,1156348,5.0,1.0,totally awesome
3653,1156348,5.0,2.0,"He is one of the nicest professors. Some people said his class was a bit hard, I didn't think so at all. HW due about once  month, 2 exams, and a project. Attendance not mandatory."
3654,1156348,4.0,3.0,"Class is easy.  Homework due every few weeks.  Tests are a little harder than the homeworks.  If you pay attention and follow along, the class will be a breeze."
3655,1346826,3.5,3.0,"Calc would have been dreadful without Bourke! While he tends to go on tangents, his lectures are generally easy to understand and sometimes quite interesting. He's pretty funny, and has a very amusing accent. Study well for tests, he grades mostly on concepts rather than a million practice problems"
3656,1346826,4.5,3.0,fantastic and hilarious
3657,1346826,4.5,3.0,Odd young guy. Can be persuaded into showing YouTube videos and such on Fridays. He teaches well.
3658,1346826,5.0,3.0,"This professor is so much fun.  He's kinda quirky, so he makes jokes in every class.  He is able to teach the material so well, that some people don't even have to read the textbook to do the homework.  I thought he was really great."
3659,1346826,4.5,2.0,"He's incredibly awkward, but I love him. He's great. He explains things clearly and is very helpful in office hours. He's able to talk to students on a level that they can understand. Unlike many math profs, he is a fellow human being and communicates to students a sense of equal humanity--rather than setting himself on a pedestal."
3660,1346826,3.5,2.0,"New teacher, pretty young.  Had him for Calc 1 and it was sort of hard to learn from him since he was nervous and talked really fast.  Opened up in the last few weeks and made the class enjoyable."
3661,2733323,5.0,3.0,One of the best teachers at Bucknell.
3662,1707281,5.0,2.0,She's a great professor who's always willing to help. Her portion of the class was not too tough.
3663,2729233,1.0,5.0,Worst teacher ever
3664,2729233,1.0,4.0,dont take his class
3665,2729233,1.0,5.0,"The lectures were unorganized and hard to follow. The homework was easy but he assigned a lot. Unfortunately, homework was easy but they didn't prepare you for exams. Chee Han is a nice guy who's willing to meet any time but he often leaves you confused and worse off."
3666,2729233,2.0,3.0,"Chee Han is a nice person but he didn't organize his class very well. Lectures were confusing and choppy. The homework wasn't representative of exam questions, which made it difficult to study. I wouldn't say the content of Calc III is particularly challenging; however, I found it difficult to follow the material based on the way it was taught."
3667,2729233,1.0,5.0,"Chee Han is nice, but he wasn't meant to be a professor. He assigns ALOT of homework and extremely lecture heavy. Lectures are fast and difficult to follow along. He often leaves you confused after you ask a question. Some people just aren't meant to be professors and Chee Han is one of those people. If you want to be successful, avoid his classes."
3668,2729233,1.0,4.0,"Tough on grading, never answer questions in a way that u can understand "
3669,2729233,1.0,5.0,"Flew through lessons super quick and often covered 2+ chapters a day so it was really difficult to keep up. Your grade essentially depends entirely on exams so if you don't do well on them but still show up to class, take notes, do well on homework & quizzes etc. it doesn't matter. Extremely unaccommodating when it came to unforeseen family matters"
3670,2729233,2.0,5.0,"Professor Tan runs a very difficult Calc class. He is there to help, but can seem harsh at times. Unless you love math, I would not recommend taking one of his classes."
3671,1355027,3.5,2.0,Great professor but an even better dude. He is super chill to talk to and doesn't care at all if you show up or not. Lectures are mostly engaging but very rarely dry. Knows a lot about his subject and is very passionate. Doesn't give back any graded work. overall a great class!!!!!
3672,1355027,4.5,2.0,"Matt Adams is a great professor.  His lectures are interesting and informative and he is extremely approachable outside the classroom.  Exams are very fair, not difficult if you study a decent amount.  Overall a great guy.  He's the man."
3673,1355027,5.0,2.0,Matt Adams is my favorite professor at Bucknell. I had no interest in classics before taking this course and now I am going to add a minor in it. I think he really knows his stuff and is enthusiastic about what he teaches.
3674,1355027,5.0,2.0,BEST CLASS EVER!
3675,1355027,4.0,2.0,"Good guy, not the most difficult class if you're taking Ancient Tech.  Loads of writing though."
3676,1355027,5.0,2.0,No Comments
3677,2059542,2.0,4.0,"Assigns reading and makes us ask questions about them to engage with the readings. Has the other students in the class answer those questions-- We're not experts! Hardly teaches a thing-- only useful for assigning readings and asking ""__, do you have a question for the class?"" Seldom is prepared for when students ask her anything."
3678,2059542,2.0,4.0,Assigns papers a week after an exam that is made up of three handwritten essays. Too much work for an intro class. She's also a pretty tough grader.
3679,2059542,2.0,5.0,"Professor Nielson was a less than adequate professor. The class is insanely boring and will make you want to fall asleep. There are two tests which are very unreasonable and if your answers don't perfectly match hers, you're doomed. ALSO, the ways she grades the one paper is very harsh and unfair. I would not recommend this class to anyone."
3680,2059542,1.0,4.0,"Professor Nielson is THE worst professor I have had at Bucknell. She is unbelievably boring, unapproachable, and not understanding about anything you maybe going through outside of class. Also her tests are unreasonably difficult. DON'T TAKE HER CLASS! You'll regret it"
3681,2059542,2.0,3.0,"She's super boring and has no personality. She basically reads right off the PowerPoint and gets anxious when students ask questions she can't answer by showing them a slide. She's very clear when telling us information, but she's also the most boring prof I've had at Bucknell."
3682,2059542,3.0,3.0,"Class was boring, slow, and repetitive. Prof. would read off her powerpoint slides and students would take notes, hand in an end of the class assessment, and say what they learned-- treated like first graders. Not much room for participation, stressing ""no time"" in the curriculum to engage in discussion/outside thinking. Very by the book!!!!"
3683,2059542,2.5,4.0," It's so hard to pay attention in her class because of her lack of enthusiasm and monotone voice. She does give extra credit opportunities, but they're usually extremely long lectures (Once sat through a 2 hour debate only to receive barely any extra credit). Not prepared to answer questions from students. Was no help when I went to office hours."
3684,2059542,4.5,3.0,Extremely nice professor. Provides make-up credit opportunities. Her midterm was very fair and the pop quizzes are not hard to do well on if you read the assigned material. 
3685,2059542,4.0,2.0,"Great teacher that is pretty easy and helpful. Her class structure itself is interesting, mix of lecture, group activities and class simulations which are very helpful/fun. You need an interest in her subject though."
3686,2489627,5.0,4.0,HE'S THE BEST. He made me want to be a French major. Seriously so awesome. Definitely take a class with him he's dope!
3687,2489627,5.0,1.0,"This is my second class with Amine and he is by far my favorite professor at Bucknell. He clearly cares about his students and wants you to understand the concepts we discuss in class. He also does not need you to agree with him all the time, so don't be afraid to participate in class. He grades for effort, not grammar or pronunciation."
3688,2489627,5.0,1.0,"I've taken two classes with Amine and I've loved them both. Great balance of language and culture, always willing to do whatever is best for the student, and always super funny and approachable about whatever. Grades are given for effort and participation, not perfect grammar or accents, and I laughed every day in his classes. Always a blast."
3689,2489627,5.0,2.0,He's a really helpful professor inside and outside of the classroom. He has great energy and is a really great communicator as well!
3690,2489627,5.0,2.0,"Amine is one of my favorite professors at Bucknell, he's super approachable and supportive. He focuses on growth and not grades--I don't think I've ever progressed more in a class. Highly recommend!"
3691,2489627,5.0,3.0,"Amine is the GOAT! He is my favorite prof at this University! He was there for me during a rough time that I was going through this semester, I would take another class with him anydayy"
3692,2489627,5.0,1.0,This is the second class I've taken with Zidouh and he's always so nice and willing to accommodate anything! Can't get an assignment turned in on time? He'll adapt! Super nice but get ready for class debates.
3693,2489627,5.0,2.0,Literally the best professor I've ever had. I highly recommend selecting him as your foundation professor. Class discussions are very engaging and he always keeps the class entertained with his jokes.
3694,2489627,5.0,4.0,"I am transferring from Bucknell but Prof. Zidouh is hands down the person Ill miss the most! We had the best time in class. Kids were never absent because he made sure to keep everyone motivated and engaged. Also, out of all my classes hes the one who made the transition after covid feel as seemless as humanly possible. Thank you profe!"
3695,2489627,5.0,4.0,"He s the most dedicated professor iv ever had, he cares about us and we engage in a lots of activities. I wish to have him next spring."
3696,2489627,5.0,4.0,"Amine is the GOAT. He keeps everyone engaged and literally every kid in class thought he was dope, best class I had my freshman year by far."
3697,2489627,5.0,3.0,"Amine is probably my favorite person on the entire Bucknell campus. He is dynamic, prepares interesting and relevant coursework, and above all truly cares about his students. I would recommend taking his class to anyone, or simply just to get to know him, because professors as amazing as Amine are few and far between."
3698,2489627,5.0,4.0,Best Foundation seminar of the year. Most kids in my hall were struggling with their seminars
3699,2489627,5.0,3.0,"Amine is the best!!! I had him for my foundation seminar, and he is such a nice guy. Incredibly understanding with students, and is always open to talk outside of class. You have to do work, but if you do the work you'll get an A- most of the class is discussion based."
3700,2489627,5.0,2.0,Amine is hands down the best French professor at Bucknell. He is so caring and genuinely wants you to both pass and learn French. He doesn't assign homework but he does assign a lot of classwork but its fun and easy work. I highly recommend taking him especially if you are simply taking a language for the language requirement.
3701,927013,3.0,5.0,Boring. Tests were impossible unless you can memorize little facts that don't have any use.
3702,927013,3.5,4.0,"10% of his exam questions seem impossible. He pulls things from the margins or a figure, but after one exam, you know how to study and think through &quot;impossible&quot; questions to take educated guesses(or he curves)All of the other questions are verbatim from his notes/textbk. Very challenging, can be boring, but means well. Congrats on your retirement!"
3703,927013,1.5,4.0,"The most dry and boring lectures I had ever sat through. He assigns a reading, you get quizzed on the reading before class, then he lectured on the very same things you were quizzed on 5 minutes previously. HUGE waste of time. Test and quiz questions were sometimes unclear and ALL multiple choice. He is very smart I'm sure, but a horrible teacher."
3704,927013,3.5,4.0,"Horribly boring lectures. Tests are hard and revolve around straight memorization of little facts, not overall concepts and applications. If you have photographic memory you'll do well..."
3705,927013,2.5,4.0,"If only this class depended solely on the book, which was way more interesting than Floody's lecture. He would nearly put me to sleep every time, and his notes wander from the point. Tests are difficult, and beware of the pop quizzes! Can be kind of awkward to talk to, but it would be advantageous to attend office hours."
3706,927013,2.0,4.0,"sooooooo boring. drools on overheads. fantastic, happy-go-lucky man though. always excited about brains and hamsters."
3707,927013,4.0,4.0,"Several years ago, I wanted a hamster. Prof. Floody was only too glad to give me one - he doesn't want to kill them any more than you do. If it makes you happy, you can whine anonymously here- but if you actually want to do something about it, take one as a pet!"
3708,927013,1.5,4.0,"Do not take him, he is one of the most boring lecturers that I have ever had, he explains something that would take me 15 minutes to explain in 40 minutes. And he uses overheads that he stands in front of most of time and so are useless."
3709,927013,1.0,4.0,"The class was very inhumane.  We had to mutilate hamsters and observe their behaviors...at the end of the semester he killed them off...really sad, this guy should not be teaching."
3710,927013,5.0,4.0,"Professor Floody is amazing. His class is very interesting and he is very clear. He gives really great examples and if you pay attention in class and take notes, you never even have to read the textbook (which is also extremely well written). His tests are fine if you study the material."
3711,927013,4.0,3.0,"Floody is awesome.  Sometimes it's hard to pay attention but for the most part the material is extremely interesting and he conveys the information clearly.    Test are a little hard, but if you study well you wont have too much of a problem."
3712,927013,3.5,4.0,"Great class.  He's a tough grader, but he does go over material very well in class so if you pay attention and whatnot you can get a pretty good grade"
3713,927013,3.5,4.0,"Difficult grader on homework and tests. Tests are challenging and picky, and classes can be slow, but interesting material."
3714,927013,4.5,4.0,"Professor Floody is the cutest old man I have ever seen. I want to adopt him as my grandfather! Nevertheless, the class is pretty slow-moving, but he explains things very well. Homeworks are easy, but tests are pretty hard!"
3715,927013,2.0,4.0,"Very nice person, but lectures are such that they don't involve much discussion, which makes the class very boring. The notes from the lectures come from slides available on ERes. Tests are moderately difficult, so study hard."
3716,759082,4.0,3.0,"Professor Faull is very kind and really funny, but you need to make sure you do the homework on time, because that is where you will learn the most. Pretty much, the homework is the actual material and class is just practice. There is a LOT of speaking German in class and the final and midterm are entirely spoken."
3717,759082,5.0,3.0,Professor Faull! What a woman let me tell you. She's honestly the only professor that got me through college my first year. She's the sweetest person imaginable and hilarious. She really cares about her students and takes time out of her day to make classes fun. I highly recommend taking a class with her.
3718,759082,5.0,2.0,FAULL AT IT AGAIN. 10/10 would take again. Everyone should take a class with this English gem.
3719,759082,5.0,2.0,"Took professor Faull for my res college course. SHE WAS THE BESTTTTTTT. We did a lot of work and daily writings but its was so worth it. All we did was laugh, have fun and learn a lot of material. Show up to class, don't be rude and do your homework and she'll reward you. Professor Faull is absolutely the amazing!!!"
3720,759082,4.5,5.0,The most important thing you need to know is that &quot;I just died in your arms tonight&quot; was written about her.
3721,759082,4.0,2.0,"I'm happy to have had Professor Faull as a professor and advisor. The material of my class was boring but she made a good effort to keep it entertaining. She's a pretty easy grader, and she loves when you show that you care. If you don't have a problem with British accents I recommend her"
3722,759082,3.5,2.0,"Both 150 and 250 classes taught by her were awesome. hands down one of my fav professors at bucknell. she takes interest in her students and has a great sense of humor. she is very helpful and will tell you ways you can improve your grade. you will learn a LOT in her classes, and they are fun learning too, not the boring kind."
3723,759082,5.0,4.0,Her class can get a little bit boring because of the texts but she's a really great teacher. She tries to wake everyone up and she gives you many chances to rewrite your two papers which are half your grade. She is honestly one of the smartest people I have ever met and her incredible understanding of topics really helps in understanding them.
3724,759082,5.0,2.0,"This was one of the best experiences in my life.  Through rigrous analysis of first hand sources this course became the Kinsey course of career at Bucknell.  Not too much writing but She makes her paper count.  Dr. Faull also treats her student's writing very seriously!  If you want to make your education worth every penny, then take classes with h"
3725,759082,2.0,3.0,"Boring class, you can tell she doesn't really care because it's a Foundation Seminar. Not a lot of work. We watched Gladiator and had one paper for the whole semester... easy course (do not take Social Justice)"
3726,693555,3.5,1.0,"This professor is nice, but kind of all over the place in lectures. Does not facilitate conversation well, and leaves many awkward pauses as she tried to figure out where to go next in class. Grading is easy, expectations are somewhat low (it is a 100-leve, but a W1). I would take her again, but not to be intellectually stimulated. Easy A."
3727,693555,1.0,5.0,the worst
3728,693555,1.0,4.0,She is so boring and talks non-stop from powerpoints the entire class period. Never take a class with her.
3729,556352,5.0,3.0,"If you want to develop your conceptual messages, Tulu's the professor for you. She will help you develop your visual skills and build meaning behind art. Also, she's really open to all forms of presentation, so it really gives you the freedom to explore art and what it can be."
3730,556352,2.5,4.0,She is a very tough grader- gave myself and classmates 65's on artist presentations- how can you almost fail someone when they did the assignment and did it throughly? During the critiques she will be brutally honest so be prepared. The TA was more helpful with technical questions by far. Her demonstrations are vague and then she tests you. 
3731,556352,4.5,2.0,Demanding of her students which helps you to cultivate your own standards of work. She gives you some leeway in the beginning to mess up. Very much believes in learning from your mistakes. Extremely helpful in carving out your ideas and themes. Very inspiring.
3732,556352,4.5,4.0,A very inspiring and demanding teacher. She helps you a lot outside of classroom. She made me very excited about art and photography. She knows the field very well.
3733,556352,2.5,2.0,"she's pretty straight forward about what she wants from her students and fairly easy about grading assignments, generally increases your grades as the semester goes along. some people were a little afraid of her but if you participate in class discussions and critiques it pays off."
3734,556352,2.5,3.0,No Comments
3735,556352,4.5,3.0,"very inspiring teacher, very passionate about photography and visual art - asks a lot from students - a lot of time in the dark room, time management skills, but in the end is worth it because it makes for a better learning experience. grades pretty easily if you do the work and put the time in."
3736,556352,4.5,3.0,Very nice an inspiring professor. Willing to open your mind. Can be intimidating at times but in a good way (it makes you progress and it makes you be demanding about yourself).
3737,2551107,2.0,3.0,"Mixed emotions. He is a very nice guy and very laid back. When it comes to class, he never specifies when anything is due and has trouble explaining assignments. Very hard grader especially on tests but open to conversation about them and in office hours. The only way he would teach us was through endless notes on the board. Boring class"
3738,2551107,3.0,3.0,As long as you put some effort into assignments and study pretty thoroughly for exams you will be fine. He does not give HW daily but when there are assignment they take a couple of hours. Participation matters a bit so be friendly with him and talk a couple of times in class. Class is kinda all over the place but very lax.
3739,2551107,5.0,1.0,loved this professor!! he is so chill and funny - actually is encouraging to participate and show up to class. he is so helpful and very insightful so I actually learned a lot as well but never felt overwhelmed with work or that any assignments were unfair. would definitely recommend him!!
3740,114005,5.0,4.0,Amazing professor and person. Lectures were filled but information and attendance is important but he is a very clear speaker and answers all questions. Tests are difficult but office hours are very helpful. Respectful to students and really cares about your education. Recitation is a short quiz (replace a test) and time for questions.
3741,114005,1.0,5.0,"Chernin is a nightmare.  While he knows the material exceptionally well, he is incapable of simplifying concepts for the students to comprehend.  His tests rarely reflect what we have covered in class, and most questions require inference, rather than testing us on material we were actually taught.  Extremely condescending. DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
3742,114005,2.5,5.0,A very hard teacher. Did not find him as helpful when I went in for office hours
3743,114005,3.5,5.0,"Very difficult. You hear everyone saying this going into the class but you really do have to put more time and effort into this class compared to any other. Chernin loves biology, and if you are struggling make sure to seek help!"
3744,114005,4.0,4.0,"His tests are hard; it doesn't really matter how much time you put into studying, because it's all about truly understanding concepts, and they are challenging concepts! Rote memorization will get you NOWHERE in this class. He is extremely friendly if you go see him outside of class and he truly wants to help you do well. I recommend him."
3745,114005,4.5,3.0,"He was very into his material.  Relatively fair, but kind of hard.  Sometimes seemed a little condescending but overall pretty fair."
3746,114005,5.0,5.0,Great professor and really funny/ interesting but is impossible grading wise.
3747,114005,4.0,5.0,"In class he seems really intimidating. However, if you go to him in office hours he is extremely friendly and helpful. He's a great mentor."
3748,114005,4.5,3.0,"Awesome! Chernin is a great professor, loves the subject matter. His exams can be tough, but don't let it discourage you. It's worth taking the course."
3749,114005,4.0,3.0,I hated Chernin at first. He is so smart that sometimes he isn't good at explaining processes but he has grown on me. Extremely helpful if you are interested in biology. I'd take another one of his classes.
3750,114005,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Chernin's class only requires you to pay attention in class; however, the book is necessary if you really want to memorize the material. &quot;To do well on my tests you only need to know the major trees in the forest&quot;"
3751,114005,5.0,3.0,"Professor Chernin is extremely smart but can still teach biology at the introductory level.  I am not a science person, nor do I particularly enjoy the subject, but he made the course interesting and catered to students like myself.  I dont know what the person below was talking about.  Print out his ppts to take notes on, they are super helpful!"
3752,114005,5.0,4.0,"The perfect professor for an interested and motivated student.He has a lot of experience in the field and supplements his already engaging lectures with cool facts. He requires no extra reading or work, but his tests use only short answer questions that force you to think. Can be really hard, but never asks for extraneous information ormemorization"
3753,114005,5.0,2.0,He is the best teacher at bucknell.  No memorization.  Just need to understand concepts
3754,114005,5.0,4.0,"One of the best teachers I've had. Enthusiastic, jovial, extremely knowledgeable, etc. Very helpful outside of class. Challenging though!"
3755,114005,4.0,5.0,"Teaches as if everyone is a neural science major, and expects you to know the material as such. Takes it personally when the class doesn't do well on an exam, but should take the hint that he expects too much from a 205 class."
3756,114005,3.5,5.0,"His tests were very difficult and I was often shocked to realize that I did not know the material as well as I thought I had. He can be very nit-picky on the exams. However, he loves what he does and is very enthusiastic. If you are naturally proficient in biology, than you will do fine. If you are not a natural at science, then you wont do as well"
3757,114005,5.0,4.0,"His tests require you to really think, so you better learn the material. But if you don't understand, there's no better person to go to office hours for. He is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable both in his office and in the lectures. I really enjoyed him."
3758,114005,4.5,4.0,Chernin is awesome.  His tests and different and a little tough but if you study you will be just fine.  Defi take him if you can.
3759,114005,5.0,3.0,Awesome!!! Challenging but extremely reasonable. I have never had a problem meeting with him Extremely helpful. One of the best professors I have had. You will learn a lot.
3760,114005,5.0,3.0,"He is a great teacher! Extremely helpful outside of class and his tests are fine, gives so much partial credit, difficult to do bad on tests"
3761,114005,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3762,114005,5.0,3.0,"awesome professor, really cares whether you understand the material. extremely approachable and willing to help whenever you need it. HIGHLY recommended!!"
3763,114005,5.0,4.0,CHERNIN ROCKS MY SOCKS!!! he is amazing!!
3764,114005,3.0,4.0,"boring lectures, exams are detailed to theyre pretty difficult, but he really tries to help you do well"
3765,114005,5.0,2.0,chernin is the man - he is an awesome teacher (especially to someone that is totally uninterested in biology).  He is extremely fair and helpful.  I reccomend him highly.
3766,114005,5.0,2.0,"Chernin rocks.  You learn a ton, and while his tests aren't easy, you will be prepared.  He's also really easy to talk to and will take the time to explain things in detail."
3767,114005,4.5,3.0,No Comments
3768,46427,1.0,4.0,Beginning of the semester she was fine but as it continued she was SO passive aggressive.She got PRESSED when people left the room for anything or came right at the start of class. Her exams are extremely difficult!No one passes them and she doesn't do anything about it!There are no chances for ec either.Whatever u do don't take a class with her!! 
3769,46427,3.0,5.0,"Prof. Halpern is very knowledgable, the people complaining are lazy IMO. Halpern does not put up with BS'ing assignments; the class is hard. She is a bit conceited and will bring her own achievements into discussion often, but very accessible outside of class & willing to help. Class is formulaic & lectures are dense, so be ready to study for exams"
3770,46427,1.0,5.0,Professor Halpern does not know how to teach. She consistently has test averages that are in the low C range or even lower. AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS IF YOU VALUE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH OR GPA. 
3771,46427,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HALPERN. Starting off she was so passive-aggressive. You won't get above a c on any exam or essay. She is not approachable at all and will most likely belittle you when talking about grades. Her lectures are not helpful as she only talks about her achievements. Please take our word from the negative reviews. A NIGHTMARE
3772,46427,1.0,5.0,Ive never had a teacher that was more rude and unwilling to help their students. Prof. Halpern grades exams like youre her equal &amp; not learning about cognitive psych for the first time. Gives vague answers when you ask for help and has terribly confusing lecture slides. Only cares about boosting her own ego and not the well-being of her students.
3773,46427,1.0,5.0,"Uncaring, rude, and in the middle of the pandemic, has essentially no empathy for students. Cannot convey material in a clear or interesting manner, asks incredibly vague questions and is visibly angry when we answer vaguely in turn. Is downright mean while grading and often berates class for not including things she didn't ask for. Avoid - awful"
3774,46427,1.0,5.0,"Halpern is the worst professor I've had in my three years spent at Bucknell. She's unapproachable, loves to talk about herself, and her exams are on completely obscure information. She is not helpful when you go to her, and very condescending. Good luck getting above a C on an essay. I am great at psych, but I barely passed this class. Avoid."
3775,46427,1.0,5.0,"I feel the need to post about professor Halpern. Not only is this particular class essentially months upon months of wildly useless and unengaging information, she decides to teach so incredibly much of it. She asks you three times to write 8 essay questions in an hour and then grades it as though you had weeks. Avoid this professor at all costs"
3776,46427,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor or teacher I have ever had. You can be a slave to her class and still barely pass. She's condescending, expects too much, and has extremely obscure exam questions. You can get an essay back with her telling you it's good with only a minor suggestion, and still not even receive a B. This woman is a literal witch."
3777,46427,1.0,5.0,"Confusing, off topic, awful explanations. If it weren't for the TA I would be f*cked. DO NOT I repeat DO NOT take any class with Halpern that is not absolutely mandatory. If you do, you best become her pet and kiss *ss with excess."
3778,46427,1.0,4.0,"She is the worst teacher I have ever had. I have taken psych before and I really enjoyed it but she makes me hate psychology. The test is made completely up from the textbook, you really don't need to go to class. If you don't read the textbook and remember everything from it you will not pass the test. Trust me, find a different section of Psych."
3779,46427,1.0,5.0,Very hard grader and very specific. Creates un attainable guidelines and has way to high expectations. Acts as though her class is the only thing that matters. I have had to have her twice for requirements and dreaded every second of it. I work SO hard and do so poorly in her class. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS. Cares more about tricking you then teachin
3780,46427,5.0,5.0,"My initial perception of professor Halpern was negative - due in part to my 2.4 GPA in my first semester. However, it was through her mentorship, and corrective guidance, that I became a 4.0 student for all subsequent semesters. Tough love instills grit, and grit lasts a lifetime. Ceaseless passion does not go unnoticed. Thank you Hal - ML"
3781,46427,1.0,5.0,Prof. Halpern the worst professor I have ever had. She expects her students to read the entire textbook word for word and then has huge comprehensive exams throughout. I am usually an A student and had to WITHDRAW from a 100 level class with her. The class avg of our first exam was a D. You could spend days studying and be unprepared for her tests
3782,46427,1.0,4.0,Expects too much of students and only accepts definitions that match her's perectly
3783,46427,5.0,4.0,"Super knowledgeable about psychology, which makes her lectures really interesting. Course was graded all on writing assignments, with all short answer exams. The nightly reading assignments are manageable. Be ready to take lots of notes, but taking her class will help you develop better study habits and writing skills. Highly recommend for psych!"
3784,46427,3.0,4.0,"Halpern is obviously a very established member of her field. She is very caring and a sweet lady but expects so much out of students. If you are looking for an A it will not happen. She is very intelligent and is very specific in papers. She did offer extra credit my semester which helped. You are graded on 3 exams, 2 papers and a final exam."
3785,46427,4.0,4.0,"Lectures are very engaging and interactive, she is super passionate which can be annoying but also contagious.  She is knowledgeable but sometimes condescending.  Sets it up so that you have to meet with her sometimes.  Tests are 10 short answers and she is a hard grader.  Not an easy A but I learned so much  "
3786,46427,2.5,4.0,"Halpern is a great teacher-- I really enjoyed her lectures and I learned A TON from her class. Tests and papers are extremely difficult and she grades rather harshly, but in my opinion, I really enjoyed taking her class and do not regret my decision whatsoever. "
3787,46427,1.5,4.0,"She's unhelpful, rude and narrow-minded. She talks about herself and her own studies in class as if she's god. You can devote your entire life to this class and still not get an A."
3788,46427,1.5,4.0,"She is rude, unhelpful in office hours, and haughty. She loves talking about conferences she is attending and put priorities on her own studies in class. She made me feel stupid for asking questions during class or office hours. She has extremely high standards and gives harsh criticisms when grading. I would not recommend her at all."
3789,46427,1.5,4.0,"NEVER take a class with this professor. She is rude, condescending, unhelpful in office hours, and haughty. She loves to talk about how she attends so many conferences and the studies she's conducted. She is a very harsh grader. Her exams are all short answer and you rarely have time to finish them. She absolutely ruined the class for me."
3790,46427,2.0,4.0,"Shes very condescending, made me feel small and incompetent when meeting with her outside of the class room.  Self centered, used a number of her own studies in class, but never addressed that they were her own studies.  Very self-confident."
3791,46427,2.0,5.0,"Rough. She is extremely difficult and demanding, and she is very condescending to students. She expects you to know everything, and marked one of my essays harshly because 'I sounded like a student' Well, I AM a student. If you take her, she will push you in every way and make you better. But if you don't put in a lot of work, you will fail."
3792,46427,5.0,5.0,"She made me better in every way. My first class with her was so difficult, I swore that I would never take a class with her again, and ended up taking three more, eventually earning an A from her. It's important to be pushed to achieve. If you are willing to work, she is very willing to work with you, but she has no tolerance for laziness."
3793,46427,1.0,5.0,I've never had a professor that had made me feel so little and stupid.  I was extremely discouraged as a student after the semester.
3794,46427,3.0,5.0,A downright nightmare. Thinks she's fantastic but is condescending and rude.  I've heard some awful things shes said to students.   All she can talk about is her own research.  I was going to be a psych major but now I don't plan on taking another psych class.  Avoid this woman at all costs.
3795,46427,3.5,4.0,"Unbelievably condescending. No matter what you do, it's never good enough. She's a very difficult paper grader, and she lectures about writing style as though you're a child. Exams are fairly difficult, but manageable. I would never take a class from her again."
3796,46427,2.5,5.0,"Although I had my issues with Professor Halpern's class, I don't agree that if she doesn't like you, she won't give you a good grade. I got 2 D's on tests (I've never gotten a bad grade ever) and thought I would have to retake the course--but on the final exam (all essay) she gave me an A+ (only A in the class) and sent me a congrats email. sweet."
3797,46427,1.0,5.0,Halpern is very conceited and obviously enjoys belittling her own students.  She is the only professor I have ever had who I felt was competing with me rather than teaching me.  Even other professors I have spoken with say she is &quot;at best a [    ].&quot;  I agree.  Stay Away.
3798,46427,4.0,2.0,"On the whole, a very good professor. She sometimes kind of tweaks out, though. Also, always talks about her own work, which is not always a bad thing."
3799,46427,3.5,3.0,"Acts friendly, but actually rather condescending and self-flattering.  If she decides she doesn't like you, your grade isn't going to be good."
3800,46427,4.0,4.0,"If you actually get along with her, her capstone is probably the best one for anyone interested in research to take.  She teaches you so much that you don't normally learn until grad school.  It's an incrible course  for those bound for grad school."
3801,46427,3.5,4.0,"Although her reputation is not the greatest, she really does know what she is talking about and is an awesome professor. She is a tough grader, but if you put the time and effort in you can get good grades."
3802,46427,1.0,5.0,No Comments
3803,46427,3.0,3.0,Expects you to favor her class. Brags about her own work CONSTANTLY.
3804,46427,3.0,4.0,"She definitely isn't easy and does play favorites, but if she likes you then she will help you with the material.  Basically, her tests are harder than normal for the Psych department at Bucknell, but they just require you to actually understand the material and not just memorize.  Also, use the Writing Center, you will do better on her papers."
3805,46427,4.5,4.0,"Very tough, not initially approachable, but helpful once asked. Excellent professor"
3806,46427,2.0,5.0,"she is one of the worst if not the worst prof i ever had.  she was no help in office hours and is just a miserable person.  she also constantly references (brags) about her time at stanford even when asking question to visitng guest lecturers in other classes.  she is intolerable.  do not take her class and if its required, pray for a visitng prof."
3807,46427,1.5,4.0,"basically... if you want to have a conversation with the devil... visit her office hours. she uses material in the class to explain why you do poorly on exams: i.e. you don't encode properly, when the question you got wrong was on encoding. avoid taking this class at all costs, usless you worship the devil."
3808,46427,1.0,5.0,"Never take a course with Andrea &quot;Lucifer&quot; Satan. Her tests are impossible and she will screw you over with any grade possible. You may think she is nice at first,but she is not. You may think office hours help, but they don't in the long run. Avoid her at all costs."
3809,46427,4.0,5.0,"Her tests are extremely difficult, but the class itself is not impossible."
3810,46427,3.5,3.0,"She's got hard tests, but she's there to talk to and will help you out.  Just study hard and use the Writing Center for all your papers.  (She's in love with the Writing Center)"
3811,46427,3.0,5.0,very hard...do not take her class unless you have no choice!!

3814,574812,4.5,3.0,"Professor Barker is an articulate, intelligent woman who does a great job of clarifying difficult philosophical ideas, like those found in the writings of Aristotle and Hume. She encourages participation in class, and the readings are integrated into lectures perfectly. Highly recommended, particularly for students transitioning from high school."
3815,574812,4.5,2.0,take it for a humanities requirement. pretty easy if you work hard and study. she's pretty cool too if you pay attention.
3816,574812,5.0,1.0,Really awesome teacher!!  Made everything really enjoyable.  She's really hot too!!  Mucho Caliente!!
3817,574812,4.5,3.0,No Comments
3818,574812,4.5,2.0,I'm in her class now and also took logic with her. I recomend any of her classes she is a great teacher! The work load is really not hard at all. Do the reading or not you'll enjoy the class more if you do. Just a great professor!!
3819,574812,1.5,4.0,"Worst class I have ever taken. She was very boring and very unclear. You basically teach yourself everything from the text book. Though she has a pleasant disposition, I would NOT recommend her to anyone."
3820,574812,5.0,3.0,If there were a higher rating fo clarity she'd deserve it. Talented and articulate. You'll learn a lot!
3821,2184541,4.0,3.0,Dr. Cooney is a great professor; you can tell he has a deep understanding of math and he does a lot to try and get you to understand as well. Sometimes his lectures and homework became difficult to follow but he is so helpful in office hours. Exams and quizzes were pretty easy if you put in the time to study.
3822,2184541,1.0,5.0,"Please, just no"
3823,2184541,1.0,4.0,Possibly the worst teacher and class I have taken. He does not make sense in his lectures and often leaves questions unanswered in class.
3824,2184541,4.0,4.0,"Cooney is a great professor, and he really shows that he cares about his students. He's a great 303 teacher, and I'm excited to finish out the year with him. Make sure to stay on top of the homeworks and readings and you'll do fine."
3825,2184541,4.0,4.0,"Professor Cooney was a very difficult professor but he definitely was available to help at all his office hours sessions. When I made the effort to partictipate and engage with the class, he made the effort to help me understand the material. It is a very difficult class if you don't study or put the time into the course. And yes, lots of homework"
3826,2184541,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Cooney is clearly knowledgeable in mathematics, and has a tendency to forget that others aren't on the same level as him. His lectures tend to be a series of examples rather than teaching, and his exams can be quite tough if you don't spend an extended amount of time preparing. LOTS of homework, too - spent hours each night working on it."
3827,2184541,4.0,3.0,"Professor Cooney is super corky and really nice. If you get to know him he's a really caring teacher. He's a little hard to understand in class, but if you go to his office hours he is super helpful. There is a lot of homework and I spent around 2-3 hours on it every night. His tests are not that hard if you study and go to his office hours."
3828,2184541,4.0,2.0,"He is not that bad, at least better than my expectation"
3829,2184541,1.0,5.0,"Came in as a math major and Dr. Cooney completely ruined that for me. Even though I came in with a pretty strong calc background, he managed to overcomplicate everything and I left class even more confused. By far one of the most worst experiences of my life. GPA was automatically ruined when I stepped into that class."
3830,2184541,2.0,4.0,"Took Dr. Cooney for both Calc 2 and Differential Equations. His class is basically just example problems the entire time on the board, which can be helpful. He tends to overcomplicate things and often does not make clear what is actually happening in the problem or the procedure to solve said problem. He does not keep attendance, but daily hw"
3831,2184541,2.0,4.0,"When is comes to calc, your professor can really make or break the understanding you get for the topic. Prof. Cooney definitely made calc 2 way harder than it needed to be. Examples in class rarely matched homework problems, he overcomplicates problems when he's teaching, and lectures are very boring."
3832,2184541,2.0,3.0,"Working hard is the bare minimum in this class. Lectures are tough to get through and the notes he puts on the board are sometimes useful so taking notes is important. His quizzes are easy and his tests are not bad. However, watch out for the final because he is not the only one writing it."
3833,2184541,2.0,3.0,"Professor Cooney is a pretty average mathematics professor. He is a little bit of a tough grader, but he is overall very fair. His lectures can be a bit boring, but I think the content is to blame. He is not afraid to joke around or share some mathematics history. He is not the best professor I've had, but he is very far from the worst."
3834,46428,5.0,3.0,one of the nicest and most helpful professors ive ever had. such a great man.
3835,46428,1.0,4.0,Class is entirely a lecture based class and he is terrible at lectures. Very difficult to understand what he says and believe it or not some days contradicts what he said the previous class. Unbelievable.
3836,46428,1.5,3.0,Griffith is a nice guy and appears to actually care about his students but is extremely confusing as a teacher. He often rambles on and always presents a number of formulas and materials that are the same as the one you need to know. Tests are very tough. No homework. i wouldn't recommend if you want to really understand the subject
3837,46428,5.0,1.0,Great Professor! Bucknell should be grateful to have him. 
3838,46428,1.0,4.0,"Hard to understand and comprehend the material he teaches, doesnt take much interest in helping students. Makes the test very difficult but then curves them so you will always get a decent grade. I never knew what to study or what would be on the test. Would highly recommend taking someone else for ECON 256."
3839,46428,4.5,1.0,Very helpful; most efficient.
3840,46428,5.0,3.0,"definitely my favorite teacher at bucknell! taught me everything i know about econ and persuaded me to become an econ major. extremely easy to understand and if you pay attention, you will ace his exams."
3841,46428,1.0,4.0,"Prof. Griffith understands what he is teaching; however, he fails to conveigh the material in any understandable capacity to his students. He answers student's questions WRONG, and his tests delve into unneccessary detail that does not match what was taught in the class. I am a 4.0 student, and struggled greatly with this class because of Griffith."
3842,46428,4.0,3.0,I think people  just don't pay attention - tests are hard yes study alot understand EVERYTHING and you may only get a 80% but hw is easy and isn't given often .. nice guy - i got the same grade i did in econ 103 that i did in here and understood this way more than i did with devalan in 103 but that's just me .. i would recommend him
3843,46428,5.0,3.0,Favorite professor at Bucknell!
3844,46428,3.0,2.0,"Often unclear with descriptions of subjects being presented.  Answers to student questions often unclear, sometimes he's unable to answer correctly.  That being said, he's a friendly guy and the class was fairly entertaining.  I would recommend taking his class and paying very close attention, and checking your notes with your textbook after class."
3845,46428,2.5,4.0,"While Griffith seems like a genuinely interesting person, he is one of the most incomprehensible professors I've had at Bucknell. His lectures consist of talking and drawing on chalkboard. Perhaps Powerpoints or other useful organization of lectures would create a more fruitful learning environment. For the tests, you basically teach yourself!"
3846,46428,4.0,1.0,"Teaches exactly to his (easy) tests, simple lecture style, just pay attention in class/take notes and you're solid"
3847,46428,3.5,2.0,"Griffith is awesome. I'm not sure why he is getting a bad rap here, but he is truly an awesome guy.  His tests aren't easy, but if you go to class and pay attention, you can easily do well.  Funny in class, makes jokes and genuinely wants the students to do well."
3848,46428,4.5,3.0,"didn't have him in an actual classroom setting, but did do bucknell in barbados with him and everyone really enjoyed getting to know him.  he did not grade papers hard, and he is such a nice guy. we all had a lot of fun and there was not much work...take this class!"
3849,46428,3.5,2.0,Don't think he is as bad a teacher as being made out to be. first test was hard and the rest were pretty easy. will curve grade if you messed up and then showed improvement
3850,46428,1.0,3.0,Does not have the capacity to field questions because the english language confuses him. He does not explain things well and the test material is often not covered in class. Absolutely no teaching ability whatsoever. I implore anyone who needs to take 256 for a major req. to find another professor. Don't take his class and expect to learn.
3851,46428,1.0,3.0,Awful prof.  Didn't know the subject matter past what was in the book.  Confusing with lectures and tests were very subjective.  Only reason I passed the class is because I read the book and read research online.  Highly suggest that you wait for a better prof that teaches 256.

3854,46428,1.0,3.0,does not know the subject matter...  horrible professor... it was almost laughable
3855,46428,1.0,5.0,"Horrible teacher. This guy wouldn't be able to tell the difference between capitalism and communism. If you want to teach yourself econ, Winston is your boy."
3856,46428,2.5,3.0,Accent is hard to understand.
3857,46428,2.5,2.0,His english is hard to understand. Can't teach. Although he is a really nice guy.
3858,46428,2.5,4.0,Horrible...
3859,46428,3.5,1.0,No Comments
3860,925027,4.0,4.0,"Prof. McNamara teaches a challenging Calc II class. Tests are weighted heavily, lectures move very fast... it's easy to get overwhelmed. However, he is very intelligent and well-respected and explains anything as long as you ask. Spend time figuring out the homework- it helps on exams. Does curve and gives opportunities for bonus points."
3861,925027,5.0,4.0,"Professor McNamara is my favorite professor I've had at Bucknell. For one, he is hilarious. The course is demanding- meets everyday and homework is assigned after every class and due twice a week. He genuinely wants his students to succeed and is very accessible for office hours. He takes the time to give college advice and truly cares for students"
3862,925027,3.0,5.0,"Professor McNamara is a nice guy and at times is funny. However, he does struggle to convey the material in a matter that is easily understood. His accent at times can be a little tricky to tackle as well. Nice guy overall, definitely cares for his students."
3863,925027,5.0,4.0,"I think he is a great professor because he knew how to structure his notes in class, so it is not hard to learn if you pay full attention to his classes every day. Also, his test is totally based on his notes, so TAKING GOOD NOTES is really important to get an A in his class! By the way, go his office hours very often and you will learn a lot!"
3864,925027,4.0,5.0,"Prof. McNamara is a great guy and a good teacher. He really cares about his students. His exams are very hard though, and you really have to work for your grades."
3865,925027,5.0,5.0,"His notes, lecture style, and way he runs the class are similar to that of a drill sergeant. His clear manner of thinking allows for an equally clear lecture. However, he gives you the tools you need to succeed, but you have to use them. I put upwards of 20-30 hours studying for each midterm because they were so difficult and heavily weighted."
3866,925027,4.0,4.0,"Pretty solid professor - however there is a ton of homework and for the class I took, almost all of your grade is from the exams and final."
3867,925027,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors I've had here. Lectures are very clear and organized which makes it easy to learn the material. Really cool guy too.
3868,925027,4.0,4.0,"McNamara is a great guy who really cares about his students. He wants everyone to succeed, but you will have to put the work in for it!"
3869,925027,5.0,4.0,"Professor McNamara is a very good teacher. He gives a good amount of homework and covers a lot of material in class but is a fair grader when it comes to exams. He keeps the class interesting with daily music videos and weekly advice regarding the transition to college. Overall, he cares a lot about his students and is a great professor."
3870,925027,4.0,3.0,"McNamara was the first math professor where I knew exactly what was going on. He  covers a lot material but he makes sure that the class is understanding the content. Keeps the class moving and focused, but is friendly and jokes around when you get to know him. HW twice a week, a few exams, and a final. Does curve. Would highly recommend."
3871,925027,5.0,3.0,Prof. Mcnamara was an excellent teacher. Do the homework and participate. Go to office hours and you will do well
3872,925027,4.0,4.0,"He is really good at explaining the fundamental ideals of calculus and as long as you listen during lecture it is easy to understand. Overall, calculus is hard at Bucknell, however, he is a fair grader who curves tests if the average is below a B-.  I would definitely recommend him.  He's probably not the easiest calc prof but a good teacher."
3873,925027,3.5,3.0,"McNamara is a tough grader, and very strict, but he is also very clear when it comes to teachings the topics that we are covering in class that day. If you need extra help, he's there with his office hours. If you skip class, don't expect to pass, and the tests are fair as long as you do the proper studying. I strongly recommend McNamara."
3874,925027,2.5,4.0,Good professor in general
3875,925027,3.5,5.0,"He's not a bad teacher. He just has a difficult personality. I have a feeling he does a lot of the things he does so that he can challenge his students to learn the most they can about Calculus, which is great and all...for math majors. Grade is based on homework, tests, final, and extra credit."
3876,925027,5.0,4.0,Great professor who was clear and made the material understandable. Always available for help when needed. Tests were very difficult and the class required alot of work.
3877,925027,4.5,2.0,Tremendous teacher! Extremely willing to help students as much as he can outside the classroom. He also likes to make cute little jokes which make his class even more enjoyable. I would absolutely recommend him for any class he offers!
3878,925027,4.0,4.0,"Awesome teacher!! It's a hard class but he teaches it really well and is a very fun, pretty easy going guy.  Do the homework and study for the tests but with his notes it makes it doable."
3879,925027,5.0,3.0,Teaches the material very well. He moves very quickly though. Writes in a way that is easy to take notes. Gives a lot of homework but if you do it well you should do well in the class. Very nice guy and very helpful during office hours. I also thought he was very fair.
3880,925027,4.0,4.0,"He's hard and teaches new things every day and goes very fast. Slow him down and he'll explain it better. He's strictly business unless you bring him off topic. And he will go off topic if you try. Do all of the homework because first, its all graded, and second, its easy to miss something in a section because its not always covered in class."
3881,925027,4.5,3.0,"The class is really not difficult, and he is a clear and helpful teacher. I highly recommend going to office hours for extra help. Easy overall class."
3882,925027,3.0,4.0,"He is a really nice and understanding teacher, but is a very harsh grader. He is very open to taking time out of his day to sit down and help you out. Homework is assigned daily is very difficult and graded. His tests are difficult but usually gives optional practice exams which were very helpful. Overall, he is a good guy but hard teacher."
3883,925027,4.5,3.0,"I would definitely recommend a McNamara class to anyone. Very succinct and thoughtful way of explaining things, plus a very pleasing Irish tenor voice!"
3884,925027,3.0,4.0,"Very good teacher, but quite hard. Homeworks are very important, and you will learn a lot from them. Stuff he teaches is mostly interesting, and class on the most part is enjoyable. He is fair and sets out clear expectations/goals. I highly recommend you go to his office hours."
3885,925027,2.5,3.0,"Final grade is strickly based on test/hw grades. attendence/effort is not calculated into final grade. not very helpful if you don't understand the material. will spend minimal time outside of class on non-engineering students. if not a strong math student, take someone else."
3886,925027,5.0,4.0,"Very interesting professor. Helpful and clear but definitely not easy. Rewards those who work hard. Believes in making students go to office hours. If you are willing to work hard, you will learn alot taking him."
3887,925027,2.5,4.0,"Really difficult tests, but does his best to make things clear and help out of class.  New teacher, prehaps he will improve.  Hard hw too.."
3888,925027,4.0,3.0,McNamera is not bad. If you need help he is available and does a good job of helping you to think through the problem rather than just giving you the answer. My only complaint would be the tests. The last question is always out in left field and uses material from the next lesson.
3889,503140,5.0,2.0,Professor Murthy is the sweetest man. His lectures are very boring but if you do your work and know what you're talking about at least a little he'll give you a pretty decent grade. He's the most understanding professor I've met at WNE thus far.
3890,503140,4.0,1.0,was very nice and tried to be funny but was kind of dull; just read the book and you'll be fine.
3891,503140,4.0,1.0,"Murthy is awesome! His lectures are boring, but the classwork and tests are very straightforward."
3892,503140,5.0,1.0,"class is soo boring, but it's really easy to do well if you pay attention to what he says. he doesn't make tests or take home problem sets any harder than they need to be. everything is straightforward.  he's really nice and will help you with anything!!!"
3893,503140,3.0,1.0,"Tests are half take home and half open book timed. They are still pretty challenging though so dont think it is easy. If you study and do all the work, you will be fine, but if you do not spend much time and try to do it the night before it will be hard. Very nice but class is pretty boring."
3894,503140,3.0,1.0,"EASY, EASY, EASY"
3895,503140,2.5,2.0,"Easy professor, as long as you do the assignments. Tests are easy and home work is straight out of the text book, you wont need to use your brain much. But, I had a hard time being motivated in his class because he was so incredibly boring. I lost my interest in economics thanks to him."
3896,503140,4.5,1.0,"slightly boring, but really easy, definately would recommend taking his section, straitforward tests and hw, helpful outside of class if you need it"
3897,503140,4.0,2.0,"This was a great class.  He printed out all of the important notes for us.  Homework was very straight forward.  Even though he sounds very monotone and is often boring, I did learn a lot and I got a great grade.  I would recommend him."
3898,503140,4.0,1.0,"not necessarily the best teacher but SO EASY, gives practice exams and handouts of the daily notes.  definitly a class and professor worth taking"
3899,503140,3.5,2.0,"Murthy is neat, clear, systematic and easy. however he is uninspiring, kind of boring, and doesnt really get me to love econ. However, I love this little guy and i recommend anyone take Econ 103."
3900,503140,4.5,4.0,"If a textbook could talk, It would be Raganath. If you fall asleep easily, watch out. If you do poorly on a test he is very helpful, talk to him, he raised me from a C to a B once on the second exam :). Boring class, but def. take murthy over O'connor or Schnieder (they grade much harder)."
3901,503140,4.0,1.0,"Pretty boring prof, but easy. Dont take this class if your interest in learnign more than what are the basic structures of economics. If you need any intersting class in order to keep focus, i would recommend stamos or scheinder for this class"
3902,503140,4.0,2.0,"Talks in a monotone which sometimes makes it hard to listen if you're tired, but overall knows his stuff.  He likes what he teaches and is VERY helpful if you need it.  Exams are pretty easy, and his reviews basically are the exam.  Definitely take him if you can. :-D"
3903,503140,4.5,1.0,"He is really easy! very helpful, no readin & exams are very starightfoward. His grading is very simple and doesn`t except too much from you"
3904,503140,4.5,1.0,"Murthy rocks, don't even have to do any of the readings if you go to class and take notes. Tests and grading system are easy."
3905,503140,4.0,2.0,"Follows the book, practice exams are same as exams, easy to do well if you pay attention in class"
3906,959846,5.0,1.0,"Sarah is the sweetest person on this planet. She helped me solidify the idea that I want to be a teacher. This class was very easy to pass, but that did not mean that I was not motivated to learn or do my assignments. I truly learned so much about what it takes to be an educator and I cannot wait to take more classes with Sarah in the future. "
3907,959846,5.0,2.0,"Sarah (she goes by her first name) is the most passionate and loving professor you could have. She genuinely cares for her students and would make any and all adjustments to help you succeed. She does not care about grades, if you do the work then she values it and gives you a 100. The class is fun and interactive."
3908,959846,5.0,1.0,Professor Dawson has been my favorite professor so far. She cares about her students and wants everyone to do well. She always started class with meditating which was so nice for a morning class. Her class was really interesting and taught students about how to love and what love means. Really fun for a foundation seminar.
3909,959846,5.0,1.0,the most amazing women who genuinely cares about her students more than she cares about their grades I had her for my foundation seminar freshman year instead of Edu 101 but I am taking her Edu 256 next semester
3910,959846,4.0,3.0,"Great class, learned a lot and did some really cool projects. This class made me love education."
3911,959846,5.0,2.0,"One of the greatest teachers, and people, I have ever had the pleasure to meet. Respectful, kind, helpful, and genuinely caring. Take anything she teaches."
3912,959846,4.5,3.0,"Nicest lady ever. If you get a chance to take one of her classes do it. Variety of teaching styles and doesn't just lecture. She is my advisor as well and is one of the most helpful professors I have met at this school, if you need help or advice take advantage of having a professor who truly cares about her students!"
3913,959846,5.0,3.0,Great teacher who inspires her students. Respects different learning styles. Highly recommend her for any education class.
3914,2635111,1.0,4.0,Don't take her. She is very judgemental and only thinks what she says is the right answer. Is not very open to what others have to say and constantly gets mad when people do not participate in class. Grades her essays very harshly and asks for a lot of requirements outside of class throughout the semester.
3915,2635111,3.0,3.0,Professor Beamon is super nice and chill but the class is kind of all over the place since there's so much subject matter. She's not an insanely tough grader but unless your work is absolutely outstanding expect to get primarily B-B+. Lecture heavy but she doesn't use powerpoints so if you're a visual learner it's a lot more difficult.
3916,2635111,2.0,3.0,"Worst professor. No one in this class got above a B because she has no grading criteria. Every single person got a 77 or below on the midterm, yet she still thinks it is our fault for not understanding rather than her fault for having no criteria for anything. Avoid this prof at all costs"
3917,814448,1.0,3.0,"You need to already know MATLAB before you can take this MATLAB course because you won't be learning anything. Pretty sure he just recently started using computers. Better hope you can copy the script that he has writen really quickly because he doesn't teach you enough to figure it out yourself. Nice guy, but best of luck to you!"
3918,814448,1.5,4.0,I really disliked him as a teacher.
3919,814448,2.5,3.0,"If you go to his office, he will pretty much give you the solutions to the homework.  But his lectures aren't helpful at all.  You can do okay in the class if you copy all of the notes onto the sheet of paper he lets you have for the quizzes."
3920,814448,1.5,4.0,"One Word: Terrible. He doesn't help you, assumes that you already know how to use Matlab even though it's his job to teach you. And the gum chewing is so annoying!"
3921,814448,1.5,4.0,"I had him for MatLab. He is horible at teaching. He probably should not be allowed to teach. If you can memorize all of the labs and homework problems, you can do ok on his tests."
3922,814448,1.0,4.0,"Lectures are based on equation derivations and are not helpful.  Tests measure your ability to memorize the material.  Never go to see him, admitting you need help is asking for lower partial credit scores.  Worst Prof I have ever had at PSU or Bucknell."
3923,814448,4.5,2.0,Boring
3924,2061681,1.0,1.0,"LUC ENGL 271 Kat doesn't use a syllabus, so grading is extremely unclear. She cusses in almost every sentence and lacks professionalism. She shades her ""former"" husband and has a huge ego about teaching at Bucknell, among other unis. She opened the class one day by saying, ""Not all white men are bad, but..."" Don't waste your time, you don't learn."
3925,2061681,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Lecky is a truly amazing professor and an amazing person. She is super invested in her course material and in the successes of her students. I went through some hard times this semester and she was very accommodating of my needs and always checked in to make sure that I was doing okay. Lots of reading, but nothing too extreme."
3926,2061681,5.0,2.0,You HAVE to take a class with Kat before you graduate Bucknell. She is a hilarious upbeat woman who never fails to make you laugh. It is a guarantee that every class session is an adventure. If you stick with her and show up I promise you will get an A.
3927,2061681,5.0,2.0,THE BEST PROFESSOR AT BUCKNELL!! Take as much classes as you can with her! Her teaching style is &quot;having a conversation with your homeslice&quot; . she is so chill and is such a nice grader and she actually genuinely cares for you. I took one class with her and we still talk and she always checks in . Guarantee you will get an A as long as you try.
3928,2061681,5.0,3.0,Professor Lecky is amazing! She made her class extremely interesting and I found myself always looking forward to it! You can tell she loves what she teaches and makes her students interested in it as well. She is also very accessible outside of class time and encourages that students come and work with her. Highly recommend!!
3929,2061681,5.0,2.0,"She is awesome. One of the best professors I have this year. If you participate in class and show up you will do fine. The class is relatively easy as long as you do the work. Also, She is hilarious and make you want to go to class everyday, even if it is at 8 am."
3930,2061681,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor. So hysterical and VERY creative! Integrates a wide variety of assignments and loves different viewpoints. We had English majors, creative writers, social science students, engineers, etc. in class and she really emphasized how each unique perspective added something. Really brought the texts to life."
3931,2563441,4.0,3.0,"We had many many papers for this class. That being said, as long as you did them and showed some interest in class this course is a pretty easy A. We also had to lead class discussion in groups 4x throughout the semester which was stressful. Definitely more work than other WMST 100 level courses but I did learn a lot and really like Prof. Wood."
3932,1375604,4.0,4.0,"He's a good guy and very smart. Goes through power points fast but does teach in depth. I wish there were more opportunities to receive credit for class since there are really only three tests over the entire semester which determine your grade. Even with the 15% homework boost, it still would be nice to have other opportunities to boost your grade"
3933,1375604,1.0,4.0,Wish I could put 0 stars. 
3934,1375604,2.0,3.0,"The entire class grade is based off of 3 tests. He gives as study guide but it doesn't have practice questions, more like a list of topics. You have to put in a lot of extra effort outside of class to do well on the tests. The class is huge about 60 people so its hard to ask questions. Be prepared to put in lots of work outside of class. "
3935,1375604,5.0,3.0,"So it's a big class, when everyone's there, but somehow still felt comfortable.  Slater is very approachable and good about answering questions.  Class grade based entirely on three exams, but they aren't hard if you just keep up.  Not your typical logic class.  "
3936,1375604,2.0,5.0,Just not an approachable guy. Graded all assignments very tough. Dull teacher. Very smart. 
3937,1375604,2.0,4.0,"Slater is a decent guy who brings an ok discussion to class. He is extremely monotone professor. Slater also is an extremely tough grader. He teaches my IP course and every assignment he has graded for me I have gotten a check minus. To put this into perspective, the other professors that teach the course consistently give me a check to check plus."
3938,1375604,3.0,4.0,"Professor Slater is an awesome professor overall, but if you plan on taking this course or were put in this course you have to actually be engaged with the content provided. Expect weekly lessons along with a quiz, and about 2-3 papers which he grades harshly. He curves the tests which is awesome, but work hard if you want to finish with an A."
3939,1375604,5.0,4.0,"Slater was really awesome for the philosophy of science. The class really opened my mind. You will read A LOT and learn A LOT, as long as you work hard, I wouldn't worry about grade. This is not an easy-A class, but it is SO worth it for the eye opening stuff you learn."
3940,1375604,4.0,3.0,"Prof Slater was one of my favorites. His class was discussion based, which I enjoyed. This class was a lot of work though. Not really with homework, but to stay on top of it, you need to listen and do the readings. Tests were hard, but he leaves lots of room for intrepretation. If you are willing to study a normal amount outside of class, its easy."
3941,1375604,5.0,3.0,"Loved logic. Flemming is supposed to be easy, but Slater wasn't too bad and I learned a lot."
3942,1375604,5.0,2.0,"Absolute bro. Funny low-key humor. So much chill. Kinda have to study for the tests, decent amount of online homework, but you'll likely pass with flying colors."
3943,1375604,5.0,4.0,"This was my first philosophy course and you need to change your mindset to get it, but when you do it's so worth it. Professor Slater made really tough concepts and theories interesting. He has high expectations but will bend over backwards to help you meet them if you come to office hours. Don't miss."
3944,1375604,5.0,5.0,Really amazing lectures/discussions and often challenging (in the best way) material/readings. Slater is the kind of professor who loves learning and critical thinking and tries to encourage that type of thinking in his students. He will challenge you and call you out if you try to offer up some pseudo philosophical thoughts.
3945,1375604,5.0,4.0,Awesome course. Slater links philosophy to everyday life in the most interesting ways. Strange to want a three hour class to be longer.
3946,1375604,5.0,4.0,"Matthew is a great prof, I really enjoyed going to class and even though there was a substantial amount of reading and writing necessary, I never felt too burdened with work. I learned so much and I felt really engaged with the whole class throughout the semester. Highly recommend taking this courseany offered by Prof Slater."
3947,1375604,4.0,3.0,"Easily one of my favorite profs ever.  He is very smart, very funny, and just a genuine good (and goofy) guy.  I had him for paradoxes and he even invited us to his house for homemade dinner and a movie.  He is very smart and is great at fostering thought-provoking discussion.  Not the easiest, but definitely one of the best."
3948,1375604,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic course. We were mostly biology majors, but Matthew (he asked us to call by his first name-honest!) was able to break down the needed concepts. He's also really knowledgeable about biology, which was a bonus. The long meetings were actually perfect for this type of class. If you're a bio major, take this class. But maybe as a senior."
3949,1375604,5.0,4.0,Probably one of the most interesting professors that I have ever had. He's a really cool guy and I would recommend his courses to anyone interested in philosophy and science.
3950,1375604,1.0,4.0,"You're probably thinking, oh philosophy sounds cool and thoughtful and inspiring, right? Well it IS cool, just not PHIL 220. It's boring. The material is dry and the professor makes no attempt to weave in interesting societal implications. It's too focused on 1 or 2 philosophers, which is disappointing. This class HAD potential. Do not take."
3951,1375604,5.0,4.0,"Awesome, eye-opening class. Take it."
3952,1375604,5.0,1.0,"Slater is hilarious. He's a really cool guy, totally understanding and makes class interesting/worth attending. Not tons of work, and as long as you pay attention in class, quizzes and tests are super easy. I really recommend his Logic course. I loved it!"
3953,1375604,4.5,4.0,"Challenging, but rewarding. Slater manages a reasonable balance between difficulty and ease of understanding. Expect daily homework assignments and a B+ to A- at best. If you want an easy A, don't take Slater. If you love the subject and want to be pushed to delve deeper, he's your guy."
3954,1375604,4.5,4.0,"I really liked this class, actually. I agree that the material was hard, and he's a tough grader, but it was also interesting (for the most part) and I learned a lot. I didn't think the discussions were that hard to follow. Not that it was always clear what the right thing to think was... but that's philosophy."
3955,1375604,3.0,5.0,"Readings were incredibly dense, and class discussions did nothing to clarify. Even going to office hours didn't make much of a difference in my understanding of the material. He grades papers brutally, with the class average being anywhere from a 5-10 out of 30 points. Difficult material."
3956,1375604,4.5,3.0,"You have to work every day - there's homework pretty much every class - but it's pretty straightforward, graded for completion, and actually makes the tests easier to manage as well as making the concepts clearer. Not cake, but very doable if you keep up. Practical, real world philosophy."
3957,1375604,5.0,4.0,"Hard but rewarding class. You walk away with a solid grasp of science. I'm a biology major, but I learned a ton about how science works. Yeah the reading was tough at times, but he helps you understand it. Go to his office hours if you're not getting something!"
3958,1375604,4.0,2.0,"You have to read all the material. Not just some, but all of it. Do this and you'll be fine. The book material is hard to understand by its nature and his lectures don't clarify it much but good notes go a long way. Quizzes and tests aren't bad at all if you've done the work. He's a cool and nice guy otherwise. I hate the subject but i liked him."
3959,1375604,1.5,4.0,"He was nice enough, but the class was impossible and he ran it poorly. A few kids would get the material but everyone else would be so confused and never catch up. Dont take PHIL 220"
3960,2139509,5.0,2.0,Hated all my high school art classes and I really liked this one. I am decent at art and truly feel like there was a lot of improvement after this class. She was very into it and you could tell she loved her job. The materials were expensive but the projects were mostly pretty cool and she was awesome.  
3961,2139509,5.0,3.0,"Anna Kell was my professor for painting &amp; various other art based elective classes. She is kind, understanding, and a fabulous teacher in the arts. I look back on my time in college now with gratitude because I was lucky enough to have such an amazing teacher. Thank you for expanding my view on the art world as well as being a caring mentor."
3962,1910136,5.0,4.0,"I have literally never heard a smarter person speak in my life. I could sit and listen to him talk literally for the rest of my life and never get bored. I love going to Econ every class and I know it is not because I love Econ, it's all about the way he teaches the material. He has already impacted my life so much, couldn't recommend more."
3963,1910136,5.0,4.0,"I had Prof Andrews for my senior seminar class in 16. The impact this man has had on my life is immeasurable. Prof Andrews is a BRILLIANT man and I learned more from his blunt discussion of economics in relation to US politics than from any other class at Bucknell. TAKE HIS COURSES - be open, learn and grow. You will be a better person for it."
3964,1910136,2.0,4.0,"not recommended. completely lecture based with zero involvement of students; None of the reading assignments are clear, the lectures bounce around and don't always go along w readings, unorganized, unclear about grading, etc. One sec he says his course is easy, the next its the hardest thing we'll ever take. he makes rude and uncomfortable comments"
3965,1910136,1.0,3.0,Did not like the class .
3966,1910136,1.0,5.0,Horrible teacher I don't recommend taking his him
3967,1910136,4.0,3.0,"Great professor!! He really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Also, he tells great stories."
3968,1910136,5.0,4.0,"One of the most amazing men I have ever met.   I have him for Game Theory and he really understands his stuff.   He relates all material to real world situations and makes me really want to attend class.  He doesn't play to the Bucknell bubble, he challenges students to think about their lives outside of school and treats us as adults."
3969,1910136,4.0,4.0,"Very tough if you don't pay attention, he can make the material seem more complicated than it actually is, but was an awesome teacher who is way over qualified for the job, he's insanely smart"
3970,1910136,4.5,4.0,"Marcellus is clearly an incredibly smart and accomplished guy, even though he can be a bit disorganized.  Hope to take more of his classes in the future."
3971,1703291,1.0,4.0,She can't explain things clearly and doesn't allow us to explain to each other. Every time we ask something she can't answer she'll tell us to just google it. If we ask a question that she thinks is dumb she'll mock at us and question our academic skills and ability. The final project takes up way more time than a half-credit course should.
3972,1703291,1.0,5.0,"I have never been more dissatisfied with the quality of a professor. She is incredibly rude and genuinely enjoys when people fail her exams. Make one mistake on a quiz and you will lose 10 points. She does not care about how you are doing and is unwilling to help, does not even have office hours. No extra credit, doesn't deserve tenure."
3973,1703291,1.0,4.0,"Sarah Manoogian does not teach. She gets to class writes the week's objective on the board and hands out a 2 page piece of paper with minimal notes on Monday. Then for the rest of the week, you work on assignments she did not teach the material for and get quizzed on it. If you get anything wrong on a quiz its automatically minus at least 10 points"
3974,1703291,2.0,3.0,"Does not lecture very well, gives easy exams but takes off so many points for calculation errors and small mistakes. Gives pop quizzes and one hw problem every class. Had the attitude that the class was not important, but was very helpful in appointment office hours."
3975,1703291,1.0,4.0,"Awful. I literally didnt pass a single exam and neither did the rest of the class. Said multiple times ""I have no problem failing all of you"""
3976,1703291,5.0,3.0,"Manoogian does not always have the answer to everyone's question and she has much less knowledge about thermo than Knisely. However, when it comes down to it she is a crystal clear teacher who teaches to the test and wants to help everyone in her class.  Hey dry humor can also be amusing every now and then."
3977,1703291,2.5,4.0,"She is definitely not one of Bucknell's top professors. Not really helpful in the classroom and office hours weren't very helpful either. We had to refer to the textbook constantly because she often gave us wrong information. Overall, my least favorite professor here."
3978,1703291,4.0,2.0,"She is pretty clear and straight forward. She is a fair grader, and i feel like as long as you pay attention in class and to the homework you are pretty much guaranteed an A."
3979,693634,3.5,3.0,"Good guy, passionate about the subject he teaches. After several classes, the subject and argument began to seem redundant. Not a bad class, just not great."
3980,693634,4.0,2.0,"Not a difficult professor, as long as you show up to class and participate regularly you should be fine.  Make sure to back up any arguments with solid evidence though, I disagree that he is biased, but he will definitely press those who disagree with him more than those who parrot his beliefs."
3981,693634,1.5,4.0,"Although he is hot, his class is not very good.  He is biased, and an absurdly difficult grader. I would never take class with him unless you are really interested in religion."
3982,693634,4.0,2.0,"Good teacher, got discussions going in a big class, a little biased in presentation of ideas, but nothing bad, or unnatural. Take a course, you'll learn and enjoy."
3983,693634,3.0,5.0,I don't know what the other reviewers were thinking but MacDonald is the worst professor I have had at Bucknell. He lectures the entire time and does nothing to facilitate class discussion. Out-of-class help on papers was a waste of time and for a 100-level class he graded response papers ridiculously hard. Avoid his classes at all costs.
3984,693634,4.5,3.0,MacDonald is the man.  He taught a very unbiased class and was very straighfoward.  I definitely plan on taking more of his courses and would recommend him to anyone who is interested in religion or needs to take a humanities course.  His tests are fair and he's a good guy
3985,693634,5.0,2.0,Everyone must take one of his classes before graduating. His class is such a good time and he's so
3986,693634,5.0,2.0,basically pmac is way hot and the class is really interesting and i would highly reccomend taking any of his classes!
3987,693634,5.0,2.0,"He was a great teacher.  Makes discussions fun and interesting.  The reading is hard to understand, but he does a great job explaining it.  He welcomes comments, questions and discussions!"
3988,2338183,5.0,4.0,"Had him for my semester 1 seminar. Really nice guy that clearly wants his students to succeed. The homework was tricky at times, but he was understanding and gave points back and weighted things accordingly. The test reflected the lectures so if you pay attention and take notes your good."
3989,2338183,5.0,5.0,"Mineart is really great tbh, really funny, filling this out on the last lab, hes treating to give me an F if I fill this out, What a prankster! Enjoyed his introduction to chemical engineering seminar a ton, chill dude, and has a good *chemistry* with the students!"
3990,2338183,5.0,4.0,Amazing prof who made a hard class bearable
3991,2338183,1.0,3.0,"Ask him a question.... be ready for a confused glare. Ask him to explain.... be ready to have your classmates explain. Overall, a really nice dude, teaches pretty well."
3992,1066380,5.0,2.0,"She is the best professor I've ever had! She genuinely cares about her students and really wants you to succeed. She just gets it. I feel as though some professors place teaching secondary to their research, but she is the exact opposite. She is so dedicated to her students that I am taking another class with her even though I'm not a bio major!"
3993,1066380,5.0,4.0,"She wants everyone to do well. First test is by far the hardest because she puts this one super weird question on it every year, but after that the class is fair. Your homework will boost your grade so much. She insists on doing the textbook programs. Didn't really help much. Just use her and go to a study group. Paliulis is the best genetics prof"
3994,1066380,4.0,3.0,"She really wants you to succeed, gets frustrated if you don't understand right away when she tries to teach you something but overall very geeky and funny. Read the textbook and do the post chapter questions they really help with the tests."
3995,1066380,5.0,3.0,"Extremely fair test giver, and a good lecturer.  Homework helps you understand the material, as well as improve your grade (by a lot).  If you do the work, and look at the textbook problems when studying for an exam, you will get an A."
3996,1066380,5.0,1.0,"Fantastic professor.  Does a great job making sure you know the material.  Easily doable amount of work. Amazingly fair grader, I never got a bad grade I didn't think I deserved, and most times I got a better grade than I thought I would."
3997,1066380,5.0,4.0,"Loved Paliulis! She's hilarious and really cares about students who show effort and ask questions. I found her tests to be difficult, and she insisted on doing a million book problems that were not always helpful. She sometimes would get frustrated if you didn't understand something right away. But overall I think she's a good prof!"
3998,1066380,5.0,3.0,She is my favorite professor at this school
3999,1066380,4.5,3.0,"Awesome professor! I had her for genetics last fall, and she's very upbeat and well, quirky. There's no better way to describe her. She truly wants everyone to do well, and her tests aren't that hard if you study the recitation worksheets. You'll love her!"
4000,1066380,5.0,4.0,"Loved her, very quirky, and keeps class interesting. Helpful if you have questions, so approachable, all around great professor. As long as you do the practice problems, exams are pretty straightforward."
4001,1066380,4.5,3.0,"Paliulis is awesome.  She has a great personality, although at times is rather quirky.  Her exams are a little bit tough, but fair.  The work she does with you in problem session really helps to prepare you for her exams and gives you a great understanding of the material.  I really hope to take her for  cytogenetics."
4002,480658,1.0,4.0,Prof. Marsh might be one of the worst professors of all time. My kindergarten teacher was more organized then this guy. He is smart and really does know a lot about the subject matter but makes it seem like he does not want his students to succeed. His lectures and slides are dated and a lot of his information is from the 2000s. Nice guy sometimes.
4003,480658,2.0,4.0,"Marsh is a really smart guy, but has no idea how to teach. The quizzes have trick questions, so the entire class fails them, and then he won't accept responsibility that if we all failed its an issue on his end. There are no units, he just chooses what he wants to teach about that day and there's no organization. Terrible at lectures"
4004,480658,4.0,4.0,"I enjoyed taking Marsh's Human Ecology course. He seems unpopular bc he can be abrasive, but he knows his stuff SO well. I learned so much in his class, and really enjoyed it, but it's also a big undertaking! Be prepared to work hard, and if you do, your mind will be blown with what you learn from this guy!"
4005,480658,3.0,4.0,"The class was ok for me, but that's because I had an excess of knowledge in the subjects we were studying. If I didn't I really would've gotten lost. On top of that he really dropped the ball at the end of the semester and put an immense time crunch on us in an unfair way. Also, his final should've absolutely been a take-home exam."
4006,480658,5.0,4.0,Professor Marsh was a great teacher. Had a great semester taking GEOG 265. He teaches in a different way that is focused on visual learning which was fantastic.
4007,480658,5.0,4.0,Professor Marsh is incredibly inspiring. I wish I took a class from him sooner. He is extremely intelligent and passionate about the work that he does/ the topics he is teaching. His lectures/slides are really helpful for exams. This is one of few classes at Bucknell that I feel I learned about things that really matter.
4008,480658,3.0,5.0,"Professor Marsh is an amazing man, he is dedicated to social justice and has a big heart. He is very inspirational as an activist and all around man; however, I'm not sure if teaching is his strong suit. Our syllabus was very unclear, the labs were not guided very well, and there was an overall tone of chaos for most of the non-majors."
4009,480658,4.0,3.0,"Marsh is a good professor who knows a ton and is well respected. He gives a regular level of homework and can be stingy about giving A's or even B's on paper, but he curves super hard, he averages a B+ on everything. Recommend him if you like a professor who is direct."
4010,480658,2.5,4.0,"A very boring lecturer Ben Marsh is.  However, he is also a genius.  I wouldn't recommend the class if you have other options, but f you don't it's not that hard of a course to take that is (or at least used to be) an upper level science credit.  No idea why though."
4011,480658,3.0,3.0,Prof Marsh was one of the weirdest people I had ever met. He is very smart and knows what he is talking about. I really liked him... SOIL
4012,480658,1.5,5.0,"Terrible professor. He mumbles constantly and is unclear about his expectations. Lectures are super boring, and they only cover what's in the outline. Dark sense of humor and insulting to students who answer incorrectly. If you can, do not take any of his classes. Really tough grader on quizzes and tests, but he curves everything."
4013,480658,1.0,4.0,"Lowest grade at Bucknell. Thinks you dont want to be in capstone if you have a job after grad. Very smart, except somewhere in his meta-meta-cognition he forgot how to instruct. Not a student in class didnt complain about his insane expectations, rambling whispers, and NEGATIVE criticism (here's what you did wrong but idk how to fix it). DONT DO IT"
4014,480658,5.0,4.0,"In life there are things, and there is stuff.  Professor Marsh teaches you to discern the two.  Then a lifetime of learning begins."
4015,480658,1.0,5.0,"Ben Marsh is simply put the worst professor I have ever had. He is unorganized, unclear in what he teaches, and downright rude throughout the entire semester. From the beginning, he labels you as a student that he likes or dislikes and that's where you'll remain for the entire semester. Do not take any courses with this professor."
4016,480658,3.0,2.0,"You will inevitably struggle until you figure out what he wants.  After that, however, the class is a breeze.  No reading.  Just study the outline of the entire course he gives you at the beginning and you're solid.  Tests are all of the short-answer variety. All labs finished in class.  Learned A LOT and glad I took the class."
4017,480658,4.5,3.0,"Probably the smartest man in the world, and the best professor I've ever had.  His classes are tough and require a lot of thinking, but he curves the grades and even lets you rewrite papers if you do bad enough.  You'll walk away from any of his classes feeling a lot more enlightened about the world."
4018,480658,3.5,2.0,"He is much better than he is made out to be.  He is very particular about how he wants you to write in your assignmetnts so at first the homework and tests and challenging but once you get the hang of his style you'll do much better. He is helpful and always responds to emails quickly. He has kind of a twisted, dark sense of humor if you like that."
4019,480658,3.5,3.0,Not as bad as people are saying. He is helpful if you dont understand an assignment and is pretty nice when asking for help. Does not take attendance so a lot of people skip regularly. Grades are curved a lot and tests are pretty easy if you study.
4020,480658,1.5,5.0,The absolute worst teacher  I have ever had. He does not help you outside of class and he never explains the assignments. He is an extremely hard grader on everything. DO NOT take a course with this teacher
4021,480658,1.5,4.0,"This man is a crackhead. His countless PowerPoints are riddled with personal photos of his children and he mumbles too softly for even those in the front row to understand. I could sense that he meant well but class attendance was low and he didn't seem to care. Quizzes graded harshly, tests a little more leniently, and papers assigned unclearly."
4022,480658,2.0,4.0,"Worst teacher I have ever had. Reluctant to give help outside of class, and every class is a powerpoint slide show that doesnt help when studying for a test. Do not take this class."
4023,480658,2.0,5.0,"makes  what could be a really interesting and valuable class into something you dread. Tells students flat out that he will not spend time teaching you how to use the programs (like GIS)but that you will 'learn as you go.' This approach fails and makes you play catch up. Claims to be, but isn't helpful outside of class. Unclear, disorganized- avoid"
4024,480658,1.5,4.0,He stutters a lot and has little to no interest in helping you if you have questions outside of class.  He also holds grudges.  Not the best prof if you intend to enjoy personal communication with the instructor.  The class can still be fun sometimes...
4025,480658,1.0,5.0,THE ABSOLUTE WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE
4026,480658,2.0,5.0,"His lectures are completely unorganized and have nothing to do with the tests. No syllabus of due dates for projects, and bad about telling when they are due.  It makes what should be an easy class really hard to get a decent grade in."
4027,480658,2.0,4.0,"HORRIBLE MISERABLE MAN...the worst teacher i've had at bucknell, and i'd go even as far as to say he's the worst teacher i've ever had in my whole life. ew he sucks ass."
4028,480658,4.0,3.0,He uses powerpoint a lot and gives an outline with the important concepts to know.  The class consisted of 2 midterms 1 final and 2 short papers.  If you understand what he expects from you and put in the effort then you can get a good grade.
4029,480658,3.5,3.0,"he is very funny. hard tests that expect you to go beyond just knowing the material. likes using power points. you will learn, but again, his tests are tricky. does not let you have a lot of time for the tests either."
4030,480658,1.0,5.0,This man may be the devil incarnate- but not in a cool way like blackbeard. He would get real pissed at me when i went to get extra help.  Unless you like having mean professors and getting stressed out i probably wouldnt take him.
4031,480658,3.0,1.0,No Comments
4032,480658,3.5,4.0,"funny guy, tests are pretty hard - all short answer questions... expects you to know more than deffinitions, be able to explain WHY and HOW things happen/are formed/etc... good to fill a lab requirement"
4033,480658,3.5,3.0,No Comments
4034,1097107,5.0,4.0,"Amazing person and personality, if you respect her she respects you right back. A little tough on grading but tells you exactly what shes grading for"
4035,1097107,5.0,4.0,"Professor Salyards was my favorite professor I've had thus far at Bucknell and I'm sure nearly everyone that takes her course would agree. The course was a lot of work, and difficult at that, but she lectures very well and it is clear by the end of the semester how much you learn if you take good notes and put some effort in."
4036,1097107,2.0,4.0,"This was a half credit class that she taught for the first time. Even so, she gave more homework than all my other classes combined. Also she was not helpful with the homeworks and at some points took almost 8 hours to do. She is probably a good teacher just not for this course"
4037,1097107,4.5,3.0,Professor Salyards is the most helpful professor I've had.  Works very hard to help all students understand the material. She's also always available for outside of class help.
4038,1097107,4.0,4.0,Very informed and structured in teaching the material. Takes the initiative to call on every body at least once a day. Intimidating but friendly at the same time. Highly recommended if you're willing to do the work
4039,1097107,4.0,4.0,"Professor Salyards is a great professor. She expects a lot from each of her students when it comes to attendance, homework, etc. Exams are extremely difficult, but you definitely learn quite a bit."
4040,1097107,4.5,5.0,"She is very fair, organized, and explains things well. She is extremely smart and can answer any questions you may have. The material is very difficult and it is a time consuming class."
4041,1097107,4.5,4.0,Hard but good
4042,1097107,4.5,3.0,She is very neat and organized. Classes went by quickly as she made the material very interesting. The homework is really important! She is pretty clear until the end of the semester... she kind of assumes you know the dynamics part already and it gets a bit confusing.
4043,1097107,5.0,3.0,Great teacher very orginized uses different color markers to make notes very easy to read and orginized. Homework is very helpful if you dnt wait till the last min. to do them. She is also very helpful in office hours. Her test are difficult to read but she's gives alot of partial credit
4044,1097107,4.0,2.0,"The class is like drilling your head into a wall if you're actually smart, get used to it. She assigns homework which isn't too long, but the intro. to engineering paper and neatness makes it take longer to do at first."
4045,1097107,4.0,5.0,"she doesn't really tell you anything. If you can learn everything by yourself, then take her class"
4046,1097107,5.0,4.0,she is fabulously organized and keeps me very attentive during class. Her class always seems to fly by because she makes it interesting. Her classes are also very planned out and you learn a lot. She doesn't believe in curves and her tests are hard but she is really helpful in office hours

4048,1097107,2.5,4.0,Salyards is a great teacher.  She is VERY organized which is nice.  Her class is hard but fair.  you defs will learn a lot.  she is really helpful in office hours.  i would highly suggest taking mechanics with her
4049,974229,4.5,2.0,"No exams--just quizzes.  Do the reading every day, and be ready to participate in class.  D. Allen is probably one of the single best professors I have had in my four years at Bucknell.  The manner in which he communicates and the applicability of the material he teaches are both excellent."
4050,974229,4.5,4.0,Great professor!
4051,974229,3.5,4.0,The class was not nearly as interesting as expected. We had to write two VERY long research papers in pairs.
4052,974229,5.0,4.0,"Awesome professor!! One of the most interesting classes I have taken at Bucknell. Assigns only minimal reading and homeworks. The exams are fair, you need to study dont get me wrong but they are mostly multiple choice with essays that are STRAIGHT from class discussions. Most of grade based on comprehensive company based group project."
4053,2735519,2.0,1.0,"The class is super easy, but the fact it was a 2 hour 50 class sucked. We could all tell when she was just trying to fill time. I never read the textbook and was fine, however peer grading is a LOT. Everything is writing, which is fine and its an easy A, just such a boring class. "
4054,417186,2.0,3.0,"You will spend an hour talking about a basic formula because he thinks you don't know it despite it having been on every lab and every prelab quiz so far. He also will stand really close to you when explaining things. Hip to hip, shoulder to shoulder. It is rather uncomfortable. Also, his TA did most of the work, the poor kid."
4055,417186,3.5,4.0,"He is such a sweet professor and is always willing to meet to help you outside of class.  His lectures can sometimes be confusing but if you study, his tests are not bad. "
4056,417186,3.0,4.0,Nice guy but his lectures were pretty useless. Doesn't seem to mind late hw/labs which is a good thing since the hand in sets usually took a ridiculously long time to do.
4057,417186,2.0,4.0,No Comments
4058,417186,3.0,3.0,"not that terrible.. kind of annoying and his expressions make me laugh, and if no one answers his questions he gets upset, but he does a fair job explaining and is good in recitation or for specific questions if you ask him"
4059,417186,2.5,3.0,Teaches more for the engineers and not the chemsits.
4060,417186,1.0,5.0,Who gave him tenure&#63;
4061,417186,3.0,3.0,not as bad as these guys make him out to be... not the best professor but hes always around to give help. hes also easy for lab.
4062,417186,1.0,5.0,No Comments
4063,417186,1.0,5.0,avoid him at all costs
4064,2403748,1.0,5.0,"Pearson is a bit arrogant and provided minimal help to struggling students. I did well in his class out of hatred. Be prepared to work your butt off and if you can switch out of it, please do. Have avoided classes that seemed interesting since then because they were taught by him."
4065,2403748,1.0,3.0,"Prof Pearson goes on random tangents and it confuses everyone. Other sections/profs for 201 had better experiences. I did not know what topic we were talking about most of the time, and not from lack of trying. He graded only one thing before the last week of the semester and tests were barely related to class content (based on research papers)."
4066,2403748,1.0,3.0,"Probably the worst teacher/professor I have ever had. I have learned very little (aside from what I have researched individually), as his lectures have nothing to do with his assignments. He has graded nothing, despite there being only a few weeks left of the semester, and provides little feedback. I would avoid him at all costs."
4067,2403748,1.0,3.0,"Worst professor I've ever had. This is a 300-level course that should be interesting, but it is almost the end of the semester and I haven't learned a thing. He hasn't graded anything, and the very few assignments that we do have, are a ridiculous amount of work for what the class is. He is not knowledgeable about the material &amp; can't answer Q's."
4068,2403748,3.0,4.0,"BIOL205 is a difficult class because it's a pre-med weed out, but Pearson provides you with all the resources you need to succeed (the homework is helpful) and he is accessible outside of class + willing to help you if you need it. However, he lectures quickly which can be difficult to follow. Study hard and you will learn a lot from his class."
4069,2403748,1.0,4.0,"If you can, avoid Pearson at all costs. He may seem nice at first glance, but in reality, he's incredibly condescending and not very willing to help students understand concepts. Test questions were poorly generated and graded in a practically draconian manner. It was also not clear how participation was graded, which lowered many students' grades."
4070,2403748,1.0,5.0,"Our class average was a D after about 1/4 of the class had to drop bc they were failing. We were consistently doing at least 10% worse on every exam then the other sections. He is unhelpful and a terrible teacher. His lectures are pointless and have nothing to do with exams. If you want to do well, drop the class and take it with another professor."
4071,2403748,1.0,4.0,"Avoid Pearson at ALL costs. Probably the worst professor that I have ever had. I took BIOL 206 and passed with flying colors, and once I took BIOL 205 with Pearson I contemplated switching majors. Our exam averages are usually 10 points below the other sections; he does not know how to teach and expects you to know all the material during class."
4072,2403748,2.0,4.0,"Don't be fooled by his quirky get-up and puns - James Pearson will become a very frustrating professor to work with. He is a nice guy; however, his lectures can be confusing, and he is not very good at answering questions. I recommend avoiding him if you can, but if not, it's not the end of the world. If you put in a lot of effort, you'll be fine."
4073,2403748,1.0,5.0,"Pearson was an extremely confusing professor and coming out of high school Bio was my favorite subject, but now I feel like I don't understand anything and I failed the class. So disheartening."
4074,2403748,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Pearson is a very new professor, so he doesn't quite know what is most helpful for students as far as teaching style, so his lectures are very unclear, and office hours are crucial to do well on his difficult tests. However he is very caring and enthusiastic about biology/very approachable. He just needs experience to hone teaching skills."
4075,1267111,5.0,3.0,He started every class asking about us and our weekends/weeks so far and I honestly never minded going to class. We had homework every class but it was the same rigor as I had in high school so I felt prepared for everything and I've heard he's helpful in office hours if you don't feel the same way.
4076,1267111,5.0,3.0,"Had a great time in class. He tells you what to read in advanced so no one should be surprised if you put in the work. However, many people just read the material and don't put any effort in understanding it, which is needed as the language courses are only offered a 50 min time period."
4077,1267111,5.0,3.0,"Funniest, weirdest man but you can't not laugh and love him. Easy vocab quizzes and will spend so much time explaining something you do not understand but exams are a little hard. Also extremely easy to get him off topic."
4078,1267111,1.0,4.0,"Professor McCloskey seemed to be a caring man, who was eager to advance our Spanish speaking skills. I was wrong. The grade you get in the course was based on three midterms, a final, and about 7 quiz that were vocal quizzes in which he expects you to memorize 70 words and only quizzes you 10 of them. HW is never collected so, is not a grade."
4079,1267111,1.0,4.0,"For a Spanish 105 class, its ridiculously difficult. I'm not learning Spanish, I'm just learning grammar. Also, there's only about 4 exams and a final, and majority of people virtually fail each and every one. Seems almost impossible to get an A unless you dedicate your life to studying for a 105 class."
4080,1267111,3.0,4.0,"Prof McCloskey is a caring professor and helped me improve my Spanish this semester. However, he gave a lot of exams (even one 5 days before the final) and was not super organized. Because of this, sometimes it was hard to know what the homework was because he posts it in dif places but you had to figure it out since he won't accept late work."
4081,1267111,5.0,3.0,He truly is a great professor. He provides you with the opportunity to get a good grade as long as you are willing to work for it. Passionate about spanish and this class
4082,1267111,5.0,3.0,Hands down the best professor I've had at Bucknell. He genuinely wants you to learn and do well> Such a funny guy.
4083,1267111,5.0,1.0,"AMAZING Spanish professor.  Probably the best I've ever had. He speaks almost entirely in Spanish, which I thought was going to be a problem at first, but he understands we're not fluent and knows when to switch into English. Always available outside of class, very lenient, and just wants to see his students succeed. ¡Formidable!"
4084,1267111,5.0,3.0,"Really great, one of my favorite teachers at Bucknell. There is a good amount of work and you do have to put in effort, but he's super helpful and is interested in his students and their success in the class. He inspired me to stick with Spanish and made class fun!"
4085,1267111,5.0,3.0,"McCloskey really wants his students to succeed. He gives a good amount of work, but it's only because he truly wants you to understand the topic and actually learn something. He encourages students to approach him for help, and keeps the class lively. He has a great personality-- definitely recommend."
4086,1267111,5.0,3.0,"He's great! I had him for my 105 section last year first semester, and I was ecstatic when I saw that he was teaching 208-- he wants you to do well, is always available for help, and tries really hard to make sure everyone understands. I am not the best speaker or the most fluent, but I enjoy participating because he makes it interesting. TAKE HIM!"
4087,1267111,5.0,3.0,"He is an absolutely incredible teacher! He loves what he does and he is completely willing to help if you need it! If you are interested in Spanish but are a little rusty and are afraid to get back in or attempt the class, he is the professor for you!! First day of class I cried because I felt so unprepared but after his class, i got back into it!"
4088,1308075,5.0,3.0,"Knows her material extremely well and was always willing to listen to suggestions about activities. Responds to class dialogue in a neutral way and encourages discussion among students. Really enjoyed Milton with Block! I was really schooled in her office, time with which she was super generous."
4089,1308075,2.5,1.0,"NO!!! Worst class I have ever taken, probably because of the professor. She was absolutely terrible. The harder I tried in my writing, the worse grade I received. If I wrote a paper for class in 20 minutes, I'd get a good grade. If I put any thought into it, I'd get a bad grade. She thought that her intellect was superior to everyone else's."
4090,1308075,4.5,2.0,Really fun class. Some of the discussions could have been better/more challenging but the books were great and she was a fair grader on the long essays. Lots of short writing assignments but they weren't hard. Lots of reading. She's great outside class too and I thought she was very funny. This was my 2nd class with her and I liked them both.
4091,1308075,4.0,2.0,Loved her course. Gave extremely helpful feedback on all written assignments. Was always available outside of class if help was needed.
4092,1308075,3.5,2.0,"She's pretty good. Relatively easy class, not too much work, very approachable. If you need a freshman/soph english class, her classes are good to take."
4093,1308075,2.0,2.0,"Overall, Professor Block is very nice and easy to approach. I went to her office hours several times for advice on papers and she always told me exactly what she would change about it. However, at times I felt that she relied too heavily on the students during discussion, and never really contributed any opinions or knowledge of her own."
4094,1267116,4.5,1.0,"This professor is really great.  Although I marked attendance as mandatory (it is) she is the most forgiving teacher I ever had and, having missed a few classes and been late on a few assignments, you genuinely feel bad for doing so.  She often compares art to the novels you read so if you are particularly artistic and love English all the better."
4095,1267116,5.0,4.0,"Clear, concise, thoughtful and dynamic. Hope to take more classes taught by this professor!"
4096,1267116,5.0,3.0,Lovely person and fantastic professor.
4097,1267116,5.0,3.0,Definitely suggest taking a course with her. Great prof and very helpful in office hours
4098,1267116,5.0,3.0,Mara is a wonderful teacher: she has a great knowledge of the field; is clear without over simplifying complex topics; treats students as intellectual equals; cultivates discussions that are inclusive of various viewpoints; and provides detailed and helpful feedback on writing. Highly recommended!
4099,1267116,5.0,2.0,Very interesting and knowledgeable!
4100,1267116,4.0,2.0,"Passionate, knowledgeable, fair, and kind. She wants class to be more discussion-based than lecture-based, so your classroom experience will depend on the types of students in your class. Also, because you have more independence than instruction, you'll probably only enjoy her class if you love English."
4101,1267116,4.5,4.0,Solid
4102,1267116,5.0,4.0,"Great professor! Interesting class. Passionate about what she is teaching, which is a plus."
4103,1267116,2.0,4.0,"Class is very boring, she does not know how to explain things well. I do not feel like class expectations were explained well, nor like she is challenging my intellect at all."
4104,1267116,2.0,2.0,very picky

4106,2297264,4.0,3.0,"The hardest out of all soc100 professors, yet still not a very hard class. Pop quizzes on reading homework 1-2 weeks. About 60 pages of reading homework a week. Few papers due throughout the semester. "
4107,2297264,5.0,3.0,"Best Professor. Got A+ in class, if you're good at history and logic its not rlly a hard class"
4108,2297264,5.0,2.0,Professor Baltz is amazing!! his class is super interesting and he really cares about helping his students do well. the participation process he has in class works really well and his tests were incredibly straight forward and easy if you are prepared. some of the readings are a bit long but easy to get the gist if you skim. loved him!!
4109,2297264,5.0,2.0,"Professor Baltz is intelligent, laid back, and passionate about what he teaches. He really shows the breadth of sociology and why it is such a cool discipline."
4110,2297264,4.0,3.0,"Most of the readings and lectures are pretty interesting though readings can be long and sometimes difficult. There are frequent reading quizzes, but they are not too hard as long as you skimmed the readings. Class is mainly lecture based but good. Baltz is helpful and as long as you study and do the work you'll do well for sure."
4111,1451443,4.0,2.0,"Meyer is a really sweet woman. You can tell she loves what shes doing and has a lot of experience in the field. Shes very reasonable and will push back deadlines or give back confusing questions on test. Gets off topic sometimes, but always brings it back to the topic. Would recommend"
4112,1451443,5.0,1.0,Best professor at Bucknell!  She's awesome.  We often had days where we convinced her that we should watch youtube videos instead of doing work.  After every test we got to argue over questions we think were unfair.  Ended up getting at least 2 points back on every test.  She's also the nicest person ever.
4113,1451443,4.5,2.0,Very engaging...sincere interest in her students.
4114,1451443,4.5,1.0,"Easiest class you will ever take at Bucknell. Class may not always be fun, but it is easy to day dream and still come out with an A. She is not shy in bringing her personal life to the table and you will hear a lot about her 5 year old daughter, who is basically a prodigy. All in all, take this class and give yourself a break!"
4115,1451443,5.0,1.0,Great professor! Extremely fun and realistic.  Never a boring class.  Just pay attention to the powerpoints and you'll do great on the quizes and tests.  Plus she likes to get the class involved for extra credit
4116,1451443,5.0,1.0,"Absolutely wonderful. Easy A class, but she actually makes everything interesting and is just hilarious herself. Worth going to class just to hear her story of the day. Really cares about her students-- extremely helpeful!"
4117,349620,5.0,3.0,Such a great prof - learned so much in this class.  Took full advantage of office hours and it really paid off - she was always willing to meet outside of class and made sure that I understood the material even if it meant doing multiple problems   Highly recommended.
4118,349620,5.0,4.0,This class was a ton of work but she was always willing to meet outside of class time to help. Examples were good too and showed how this class was applicable to other disciplines. Enjoyed coming to class.
4119,349620,5.0,3.0,"Professor Donner is amazing. She genuinely cares about her students, and she is so understanding. We get a decent number or homework extensions or project extensions if she feels we havent had enough time. For once in my life, I actually enjoy a math class. She explains everything so thoroughly. Also, she loves the Steelers!!!"
4120,349620,1.0,2.0,She was vague and confusing about assignments due dates and what was to be expected on tests. Her tests were impossibly difficult and were not at all what we covered in class. It felt super unfair when she would tell you one thing is on a test and then it was another. Class is incredibly boring. I do not recommend taking her
4121,349620,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, made coming to class enjoyable and fun. Tests were hard and nothing like review sheets though."
4122,349620,3.0,4.0,"Professor Donner is extremely kind and smart. The homework is reasonable but her tests were often harder than what we had learned and she promised to curve our final grades and then didn't. She's not very accessible with only one office hour early in the morning during other classes. However, a good professor lecture wise and is very approachable."
4123,349620,5.0,4.0,Really amazing prof. Gave really good examples and real world data sets to make material more relatable. I visited her office several times a week and she always took time to help. Highly recommend.
4124,349620,3.0,3.0,"Donner is a double edged sword. Take her if you have to take stats, but dont otherwise. She's relaxed but almost too much so. Lets you out of class early, a little late everyday, late on handing stuff back. She teaches clearly, but those multiple choice will ruin you. Final was the hardest exam of the year. Also, no one does well on the project."
4125,349620,5.0,3.0,LOVE HER!!!!
4126,349620,5.0,3.0,Great and clear teacher.  I did all of the practice problems and it paid off.  She made everything so digestible and spot on. I now teach stats at a HS and use my notes from her class.  I'll never be as good as her  :( 
4127,349620,5.0,3.0,"Donner is the sweetest lady ever known to man... possibly even the universe. People say her tests are hard but she is the best stats teacher to take. Very fair and did I mention that she is a sweetheart? I did? Oh sorry, but I think you get the picture."
4128,349620,4.0,4.0,She is the sweetest woman and takes the time to ensure everyone understands the concepts and ideas. Exams can be difficult so definitely spend time studying. Her project is the easiest out of all of the other stats profs so I definitely recommend choosing her over others. Approachable and understandable!
4129,349620,4.5,3.0,"Professor Donnor was very helpful and put in every effort possible to help students in need. Calculus is not easy for everyone, and she realizes this. On exams of quizzes where students obviously struggled, she offered chances to raise scores. Very fair and helpful."
4130,349620,5.0,2.0,"I like her class very much. She is really straight forward for all the material. I can easily get the point from what she says in class and I don't need to read the textbook myself at all. Some students complain her tests are hard, but she gives curve sometimes. So I guess it's okay."
4131,349620,1.5,5.0,"Professor Donner is fun to have during the actual class periods, but her tests are intentionally so difficult that no one does well. Her final was the hardest test and she was highly misleading about the material which would be on it. There was no way to do well. She is also incredibly hard to track down and very unreliable. Very poor, overall."
4132,349620,4.5,5.0,Learned so much in this class - really prepared me for Calc 2.  Always willing to help and genuinely cares about her students.  Strongly recommend taking her for any math class.
4133,349620,1.0,5.0,"You must play up to her if your going to get a good grade, very judgmental in the grading, not consistent."
4134,349620,4.5,3.0,Alot of work but the tests are not terribly hard and she is a very fair grader. The final was very difficult and very long.
4135,349620,4.5,2.0,Professor Donner is really great. She is so straight forward with her lectures. She does not bore you with the stuff you don't need to know. She is THE most helpful professor I have had. Her tests are fair and she is not afraid to admit when there hard and correct it with a curve. I would highly recommend her!
4136,349620,4.5,4.0,"I would highly recommend this teacher. She is really accessible and very fair in grading. In addition, she will clarify any questions pertaining to the content of what we are studying. Do your homework and study hard for the exams and you'll be fine!"
4137,349620,5.0,4.0,"VERY Organized - loved the daily calendar and having the notes online was awesome.  The tests were very hard though, but if you go see her for help, it really helps."
4138,349620,2.5,3.0,Just teaches from the book and doesnt use her personal insight enough to help the students understand. Needs to do a better job preparing students for exams. Much organization is needed.
4139,349620,2.0,3.0,"she is a horrible professor. She teaches straight from the book and is a completely unfair grader. she marked something wrong on my test and admitted it was a mistake yet refused to give me the credit back. easy if you have already taken stats in highschool, otherwise, do not take this class"
4140,349620,4.5,2.0,Prof. Donner is awesome. I never understood calculus in high school and I now I have an A in her class. She's the best!
4141,349620,2.5,4.0,"Least favorite subject, but favorite class to go to. You kind of have to teach the material to yourself because she doesn't really teach stuff that well (she assumes everyone knows what she's talking about most of the time), but class is never boring and she gives lots of partial credit on tests."
4142,349620,5.0,5.0,"Great prof - lots of work, but she's always willing to meet with students - even outside of office hours.  Tests are challenging.  Overall, you'll learn a lot."
4143,349620,4.5,2.0,"Very good at teaching the material, but kind of spacey about certain easy math topics"
4144,349620,5.0,3.0,"Tests are kinda hard, but she goes out of her way to help you prepare.  Always willing to help - and very organized too.  Friendly and easy-going."
4145,349620,5.0,3.0,Great teacher - goes out of her way to help students.  Really knows her stuff too.  Thumbs up!
4146,349620,5.0,3.0,"Very good teacher...easy to understand, clear in lecutre...understanding of students needs...favorite class of the semester, highly recommended"
4147,349620,5.0,2.0,"She is an EXCELLENT statistics teacher. Great class, not very difficult."
4148,2127286,4.0,3.0,"Professor Haynes is tough but she's a really good teacher.  Speeds through lectures and you often have to call out because she won't see your hand, but if you ask a question she will answer it.  Personally, I struggled in latin but if you go to office hours and let her know that you're really trying she will help you out."
4149,2127286,1.0,5.0,Worst prof in the history of profs. She speeds through her lectures and just expects everyone in the class to have an eidetic memory like her doesn't give you time to take notes at all. If you have a question forget it. Even though your class is 22 kids she will not see your hand. Expects you to have an inate knowledge of analyzing ancient sources
4150,2127286,3.5,2.0,"Nice and funny prof. Had her for Roman History. Doesn't expect you to have background knowledge but it definitely helps. Integrates humor to keep stuff from being stale and to help you remember things. Daily quizzes on readings can screw you, so reading is absolutely necessary. If you study and attend class you'll do fine on the tests; they're easy"
4151,908732,5.0,3.0,would reccomend any of her classes 
4152,908732,5.0,2.0,Super nice and genuinely cares about students. She was like 75% of why I actually enjoyed my first year here. 
4153,908732,5.0,2.0,"Professor Larson is great! Shes funny, easygoing, and understanding. She gives a quiz almost everyday for Ancient Greek, but theyre small and easy. She just gives them to make sure we study. She drops a lot of the quizzes too, so its not a very stressful class. Theres a lot of homework, but if you dont do it its not the end of the world."
4154,908732,5.0,2.0,"Professor Larson is an amazing professor, and that is probably an understatement. The class is structured as more of a discussion than a lecture. She is very knowledgeable in her field, and very helpful in improving her student's writing and critical thinking. Take her class if you get the opportunity."
4155,908732,5.0,3.0,Professor Larson is the ideal professor. Her classes are not so much composed of lectures as discussions. She gives every student the opportunity to share their ideas and personally engage with the material they learn.
4156,908732,5.0,2.0,If you have the chance to take a class with Professor Larson do it!!! Shes by far the best professor Ive had at Bucknell and she truly cares about her students. If you are struggling she is more than willing to help you and do whatever it takes to ensure that you will do well in the class. Such an incredible Professor!!!
4157,908732,5.0,2.0,She made class so interesting and made you want to learn more about Greek than only the language. I never dreaded going to class and learned so much. She also grades on how much you try so make sure to show effort because it won't go unnoticed. Great class and even better professor!!
4158,908732,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor at Bucknell, basically my go to for anything. She is the nicest person and a great teacher. He knowledge of Classics is extensive and very interesting! I love learning from her."
4159,908732,5.0,3.0,"the best, can talk to you about anything and everything especially as an advisor"
4160,908732,5.0,2.0,"Wonderful Teacher all around. I throughly enjoyed showing up to class, could have achieved a better grade if I personally gave more effort."
4161,908732,5.0,1.0,Awesome
4162,908732,5.0,1.0,"Best professor of classics at Bucknell. If you love learning dead languages, she is the best here. Super passionate and will talk about it with you until she is blue in the face. She is really unique but has to be one of the more engaging and better teachers at Bucknell."
4163,908732,5.0,2.0,awesome.
4164,908732,5.0,3.0,"P-Lar is amazing.  The discussions our seminar had will stay with me for ages.  She is the best grader that I have ever encountered--her comments on my papers helped me transform my writing, and I am now acing nearly every writing assignment I am given.  She is a professor that everyone should take before leaving Bucknell."
4165,908732,4.5,1.0,"She is great! You dont really need to do the reads because she is so clear and goes over everything really well. Her lectures aren't usually boring, so it's easy to pay attention and do well. If you show up and listen you can easily get an A. I would definitely recommend the class and her for anyone."
4166,908732,5.0,3.0,"Definitely my favorite prof. Fortunate to have her as my adviser, too.  A great person--passionate, helpful, caring, funny, sweet, wonderful! If you do your work (aka READ all the material closely) and participate in class, then she'll love you.  She's always willing to give time to help--whether in a meeting, a quick talk after class, or an email."
4167,908732,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher.  If you do the reading or attend class, you're set.  If you pay attention, you're golden.  If you do all of the above, you're walking on sunshine.  As an added bonus, she is very nice, willing to listen, funny, and highly knowledgable.  Encouraging and friendly so there is no reason not to take her."
4168,908732,5.0,1.0,so entertaining in class and really easy to follow her lectures. if you keep up with the readings and take notes in class the tests are no problem.. I definitly recommend her to anyone really interested in mythology
4169,908732,5.0,3.0,Great instructor. Really interesting and enthusiastic.
4170,1195452,1.5,2.0,This professor was one of the worst that I have ever had. He is a nice guy but he looks like he should be a student in the class. He might be very smart but he doesnt understand why no one understands what he talks about because he doesnt know. He teaches the easy stuff and tests on things way over your head. Terriable teacher
4171,1195452,1.5,4.0,He is not very helpful which is very annoying when you are confused. His lectures are very disorganized and he doesnt like answering questions.
4172,1195452,3.0,2.0,"He's a nice guy but it seems that he's not good at teaching basic calculus. However, he's not strict and allow you much free time to study yourself. In addition, he doesn't call names in class. If you like this kind of teaching style, don't hesitate to choose his class. If you don't like reading textbook, I absolutely don't recommend him."
4173,1195452,2.0,5.0,He cannot teach Calculus 1. He rarely finishes examples b/c he gets sidetracked easily. His tests are difficult and time is an issue on every test. Many people drop this class after 10 weeks. Those who do well in the class are either NATURALLY good at math or have had a good background with pre-calculus/calculus. DO NOT TAKE CALC W/HIM!!
4174,1195452,1.0,5.0,"The professor is nice but cannot teach. His expectations are way above college level and he can't explain anything. His tests are very difficult but there is a generous curve. If you want to do well in one of his classes you must read the book and be prepared to teach yourself all the material. Still, you probably will not do well. DO NOT TAKE HIM!"
4175,1195452,1.0,5.0,"He is a nice guy but a terrible teacher. I haven't learned anything in his class and the things he talks about have nothing to do with helping what is on the homework, on tests and on quizzes. It doesn't seem like he is there for you to get the most out of understanding everything, instead he tries to cram everything in and disregards all else."
4176,1195452,1.0,3.0,"Matt is a cool guy but don't let that fool you.  Unless you love reading text books, you will have a terrible time.  Don't bother going to class."
4177,1195452,2.5,1.0,He's not a very good teacher but he's a really nice guy.
4178,2311615,4.0,3.0,Great Professor! World War history class is very interesting.
4179,99776,4.5,1.0,What a wonderful guy. A joy to be in his class.
4180,99776,4.5,1.0,"reminds me of santa clause, love this class!"
4181,99776,4.5,2.0,best teacher i've had at bucknell. very passionate about subject and there for help at any time. nicest man ever
4182,99776,5.0,2.0,"best teacher i have ever had.  he made me love spanish again, has a great personality and really wants everyone to succeed in his class"
4183,99776,5.0,2.0,"GREAT TEACHER, Great Person."
4184,99776,4.5,2.0,"Love this guy. If you ever have a chance to take a class of his do it. He's great in class because he's passionate about teaching and he's hilarious. He's a pretty easy grader too, gives you plenty of second chances on late assignments, etc."
4185,99776,5.0,3.0,No Comments
4186,99776,5.0,1.0,He is a great teacher who is interested and invested!
4187,99776,5.0,2.0,Delgado is great.
4188,99776,5.0,4.0,"I had never taken spanish before when I had him and I got frustrated easliy, but he was such an awesome teacher and was always willing to help me when i went to his office hours EVERYDAY!  If you have the chance to have him as a teacher, dont pass it up."
4189,99776,5.0,1.0,"This guy's great, truly loves teaching and it shows. Classes are actually fun to attend. Take his class, you won't regret it."
4190,99776,5.0,2.0,One of the best teachers I've ever had.
4191,99776,5.0,2.0,very awesome teacher
4192,99774,5.0,4.0,Tom is an amazing professor and will keep you entertained during every lecture. He does a great job of explaining all of the material fully and always keeps the class engaged.
4193,99774,4.0,4.0,Greatest physics professor
4194,99774,5.0,3.0,I love this man with all my heart. Such a caring and passionate professor. Please try to take his problem session or go to his office hours. Hes hands down the best prof at Bucknell
4195,99774,5.0,3.0,"Tom is an amazing professor. He explains things so well with both examples and demonstrations. While physics has a lot of homework, the tests are very similar to the homework problems and Tom explicitly tells you how to approach the problems. The best thing about Tom is his passion and love for teaching. He is sure to put a smile on your face."
4196,99774,4.0,3.0,his lectures were so clear and made the material so much easier. he was very enthusiastic which made a morning lecture much more bearable. very timely and made sure everything was covered and gave relevant examples. tests aren't too bad if you study. do ALL the homework if you want to pass.
4197,99774,5.0,4.0,Going to lectures and doing the assigned problems are really important to help learn the stuff and to get good grades. Really interesting lectures.
4198,99774,5.0,4.0,Tom is so passionate about physics and just his energy itself is enough to motivate me to show up to lecture. He genuinely cares about his students and will appreciate any and all questions asked.
4199,99774,5.0,3.0,Such a great guy and really cares about his student's success. Also super passionate and makes lectures interesting! Very clear explanations and taking notes during lectures is a must but is happy to clarify anything in problem session with mini lectures.
4200,99774,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely electric lectures, on the few occasions when he wasn't able to show up to class the fill in would do a good job but it just couldn't compare to the level of energy that he brings to the room. Physics 211 isn't too challenging but he keeps you engaged and while the lectures aren't mandatory, if you don't go you missed out."
4201,99774,5.0,2.0,Best prof I've had
4202,99774,5.0,3.0,Tom is a fantastic professor and person. He absolutely loves physics and this reflects in his teaching. He is so energetic during lectures and makes the hardest topics interesting and approachable. I have him for problem session as well and he does a superb job at clearly answering my questions. I wish he taught all of my classes.
4203,99774,5.0,3.0,"Phys211 can be scary at times, but tom Solomon makes it all worth it. Truly the best lecturer on earth. He makes lectures exciting and does a really good job emphasizing important points. I don't think I would appreciate physics as much as I do now without having tom as my professor. I wish I had him for every class!"
4204,99774,5.0,4.0,Tom is one of the best professors I've ever had. You can tell he really cares about his students. He is very accessible outside of class. I looked forward to his lecture because he is hilarious and makes them very entertaining with cool demos. You can tell that he is super passionate he is about his job too. 10/10 would retake the class.
4205,99774,5.0,4.0,Tom was the lecturer for PHYS211. He made lecture very engaging and explained the content very well. Always available for office hours. Very energetic and loves what he's teaching
4206,99774,5.0,3.0,Made lectures one of the things I looked forward to.  He's really interested in the topic and you can only help but admire his love for the subject.  You'll find yourself absorbed with lectures and actually enjoying yourself.  Brings a good amount of examples to class and goes over everything you need to know in lecture.  Great teacher-great person
4207,99774,5.0,3.0,He explains course material in a way that makes even extremely erudite abstract seem approachable. I have never had a professor make such a large lecture class so interesting. Every member feels involved and everything Professor Solomon does is purposeful. Learned the material as well as how to appreciate the material.
4208,99774,5.0,4.0,So far the best teacher I've had here at Bucknell. He makes the lectures very interesting and always cracks some good jokes - I would definitely recommend him.
4209,99774,5.0,3.0,"I had him as a lecturer for 211 and he was great!! Super cool guy, really into physics/the material and his enthusiasm is awesome-definitely recommend his class."
4210,99774,4.0,3.0,Tom is insanely enthusiastic and inspirational. Definitely keeps you awake during class. It is lecture heavy but he is very available for office hours which can help if you are struggling. Made learning physics basics a positive experience.
4211,99774,5.0,2.0,"Tom is THE BEST! He's a father, a friend, an amazing teacher, and an inspirational figure. Because of this course, I decided that I am going to minor in physics. Although the lecture has more than a hundred students, he ALWAYS asks us to ask more questions and he loves it. I have never seen such passion at teaching in my life!"
4212,99774,4.5,3.0,"Tom is the man. With such passion that literally radiates from him, it's impossible to not appreciate physics, even at the slightest bit. I honestly love the entire physics department and am so glad I chose to take this course this semester."
4213,99774,4.5,3.0,"You want him for problem session, and you want him for lab. Great professor, loves his subject and is happy to work with students whenever he doesn't have a commitment.   ""Shortcuts are for losers!"" - Tom Solomon"
4214,99774,5.0,3.0,Best Professor ever! Super enthusiastic. I never thought I would like physics but he has made me love it! Always gives out fun physics toys in lecture
4215,99774,5.0,2.0,The best teacher in the physics department. Loves teaching physics to students who aren't even in his class. Very clear and concise with the course material and makes it look doable. No wonder his office hours are always crowded. Do anything to have him as a problem session instructor.
4216,99774,5.0,3.0,He is one of the most outgoing professors I have ever met.  He cares so much about the students and is extremely nice.  PHYS 212 is a very hard class but he makes it much more bearable.  You would be lucky to have him as a professor.
4217,99774,3.5,4.0,"His lectures are extremely interesting, but he moves from topic to topic really quickly making it difficult to follow."
4218,99774,4.5,2.0,Tom is the man. I look forward to his lectures every week and they are nothing but helpful. Great teacher who will review with you until you understand
4219,99774,5.0,2.0,Don't skip steps!
4220,99774,5.0,3.0,Great professor.  Shows a true passion for the field and loves his job.  He's that stereotypical college physics prof.  Effective demos and clearly conveys information.  Medium workload.
4221,99774,5.0,3.0,Outstanding professor who made the material easy to understand. Average test difficulty but was always willing to give extra help.
4222,99774,5.0,5.0,"Best professor I've had at Bucknell, period. As a bio major in his 211 course, I only wish I had taken him sooner. Will make you love physics, and challenge you as a student in all areas. great course, great prof. Just be prepared for the demanding course load and it's worth it."
4223,99774,5.0,4.0,"Easily the best professor at Bucknell, hands down. So animated that you want to come to class, so clear that you will do well if you try, and so helpful that if you don't understand he'll do everything he can to help you. Take physics with Tom"
4224,99774,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely love Tom. He's always willing to help, and very very enthusiastic about the subject matter. Just going to office hours really help too. He uses all the toys in his office to explain certain physics concepts. i highly recommend this professor!"
4225,99774,4.5,3.0,"Really really awesome professor!  I don't think I've ever had a more enthusiastic professor.  Really knows the material and is very willing to help outside of class.  Tests are a bit hard, but manageable if you do the work.  Makes class really fun- especially with microwave day!"
4226,99774,4.5,2.0,"Tom is a great teacher.  He knows what he's doing, and he helps you learn physics better than almost anybody else I've met.  He is extremely energetic, and loves to do demonstrations, which are pretty cool.  His notes on the board during lecture are the only problem I've seen with him."
4227,99774,5.0,5.0,Best Prof so far at Bucknell. Tom is incredibly energetic and enthusiastic. Take physics just to have Tom.
4228,99774,5.0,3.0,"Tom is a great professor and a great person.  He is extremely energetic.  the man is in love with physics, which makes for a great learning atmosphere"
4229,99774,5.0,2.0,"Tom Solomon is the man.  He is one of the main reasons that Bucknell's physics department is ranked nationally.  He is extremely helpful and has a genuine intereset in making sure that you understand the material.  While sometimes difficult, you will be seriously missing out if you do not have him as a professor."
4230,99774,5.0,3.0,"Had him as my problem session teacher. Amazing guy. His enthusiasm rubs off on you. VERY clear, and very helpful. One of the best physics teachers you can get."
4231,99774,5.0,2.0,No Comments
4232,99774,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I've ever had.  He's excited by what he teaches and it rubs off on his students.  Very inspiring.
4233,99774,5.0,2.0,"WHen you think nerdy physics prof, you get Tom!  He's awesome, has the most toys per capita in his office (including the non-stop top, various objects a hippie could stare at for hours, and a home-made chaos illustrator).  Let us watch the wizard of oz with the dark side of the moon in our video session!  ROCK!"
4234,99774,5.0,3.0,I had Tom for problem session.  He's everything a physics professor should be.  He loves his field and that carries over to an awesome classroom experience.  If I didn't understand something the day before from lecture I could always count on Tom to explain it. Take a class with him.
4235,99774,5.0,2.0,Great Professor.  Had for problem session.  Loves his job and helping students.  Can't say enough good things.
4236,99774,5.0,3.0,"Lots of energy, and he wants YOU to learn physics."

4239,99774,5.0,2.0,Most energetic person in the world.
4240,99774,5.0,3.0,"Very energetic, always willing to help, and creative.  Good prof."
4241,99774,4.5,4.0,very energetic
4242,789950,3.0,4.0,"Never ever take her class! Her dry voice literally is a lullaby and puts you into sleep in any minute. It's hard to take notes in her lecture as she writes everywhere on the board, totally unorganized! And for Math226, you have to spend hours using software doing homework even though it's just a half-credit class.  Ridiculously hard final!"
4243,789950,5.0,2.0,"Ziemian is the best math prof I've ever had. Her notes are insanely neat and it made everything really clear and simple to follow. She gives great in-class examples that prepare you for the test.  Doesnt take attendance but trust me you should always go to class. If u do and do the homeworks, you should be fine. Shes always willing to help, too."
4244,789950,5.0,4.0,Spends the first part of every class giving overview of the topic with graphs and figures before getting to the math. I really like this teaching style because if I have trouble later I go back to the concept overview in my notes. Great teacher! Tough but very helpful. Really cares and makes it interesting. Encourages questions & indvidual help. 
4245,789950,5.0,4.0,"Clear, concise and organized. Very thorough and knowledgeable teacher. Great at answering questions and figuring out what exactly is confusing students. She really seems to care if we're understanding the material and wants us to appreciate the details to help us apply what we learn.  Good teacher and nice person."
4246,789950,5.0,4.0,"Excellent prof! She's tough and she covers much more   material and complicated concepts than other profs, but she makes herself available to help you learn it all. Very clear and detailed in class and great at answering Qs and presenting things in different ways if we're not getting it. One of the best. You'll work but you'll learn a lot."
4247,789950,3.5,4.0,"Copies and pastes notes onto board with extreme precision which shows she knows her stuff, without a doubt. However, a teacher should be more than that. Calculus is not the most engaging subject to many people, granted. Overall, she really steps it up in office hours when you really need the help!"
4248,789950,2.5,4.0,Just copies her notes on to the board during Lecture and expects you to pick up on things without actually working out the problems together. Usually is more helpful in office hours yet is extremely dry during lecture. Tests are hard and she doesn't prepare you for them. Feels more like a high school teacher if anything.
4249,789950,4.0,3.0,She is so helpful and does whatever she can to help you do well on your homework. I can tell that she really wants her students to succeed...but her classes are sooo boring.
4250,789950,3.0,3.0,"She's nothing special for this course. She's an engineer teaching a basic, BASIC, calc course. While she does a good job and will help you succeed, this class isn't her main concern. You will learn from her but you're not going to have the time of your life here. Not an amazing experience but nothing to complain about. She's nice..."
4251,789950,3.5,2.0,"Had her for Mechanics as well (ENGR220). She was good for that class, but she should not be teaching statistics. Relatively easy professor, just do the homeworks to the best of your ability."
4252,789950,1.0,5.0,"This professor is BY FAR the worst Professor I have had at Bucknell University so far. (I'm a Sophomore now)  Steer clear from her classes.  She does not care about her student's learning; she never stops to see if you understand anything.  Worst of all, she is NEVER available after class.  She also never fully explains anything in her examples."
4253,789950,4.5,3.0,"A very helpful and clear teacher, will actually cover all the material needed for Mechanics of Materials in the following semester, most professor don't get to all the materials and you would be learning twice as much in the next semester."
4254,789950,5.0,2.0,No Comments
4255,789950,4.0,3.0,"She is really strict with work and a little dry.  Nonetheless, she does a really good job at conveying the information.  She is easy to talk to and usually willing to meet with you.  She takes some getting used to, but I liked having her as a Professor."
4256,2311620,1.0,4.0,"Okay so Professor Barba is obviously very smart, I will give him that. Regardless, he lectures for the full period and his slides have little to nothing important on them so it's really hard to follow. He grades harshly, SO MUCH READING. It doesn't feel like a 100 level course. He expects a lot, the final is killer. "
4257,2311620,4.0,4.0,"You can tell he's super passionate about what he's teaching and the course material is super interesting. I would definitely take another class with him if it wasn't for the amount of reading. If you don't mind hours of reading, you'll love it."
4258,2311620,5.0,4.0,Has a lot of energy. Really passionate about what he teaches. We read interesting books. Would recommend if you are willing to put in the effort.
4259,2311620,3.0,4.0,"Decent Professor! Demands a lot of reading from his students. Class demands a lot of work, but nothing too difficult, just takes time."
4260,1334726,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, great class. Classes were fun and she was very helpful."
4261,1334726,4.5,2.0,Amazing professor.  She made my time at Bucknell tolerable.  Shes also an incredible writer.
4262,1334726,5.0,4.0,"Absolutely amazing professor. I took this class on a whim but she ultimately made me want to change my major to Creative Writing. She was truly inspiring. There is a lot of work involved but she makes it worthwhile and you'll enjoy having done it at the end of the day. She is fun, encouraging, helpful & has realistic expectations for her students."
4263,1334726,4.5,4.0,"I love Porochista! She's a NYTimes Best-selling author, for one, so she knows how to write awesome fiction. Amazingly helpful and inspiring, not to mention hilarious."
4264,1334726,4.5,3.0,Awesome teacher.  Great classes.
4265,1334726,4.5,3.0,Awesome teacher! really funny and witty. wears the cutest clothes. very helpful and knows her stuff.
4266,1334726,4.5,3.0,Such a great teacher! Passionate and fun! She has the cutest clothes and is really laid back about formality. She is an awesome writer herself and really knows her stuff. Keeps things interesting!
4267,1523143,3.0,5.0,Very difficult for a baby bio class. Whole class was failing so they had to change the grading system. In class was chill lectures to take notes. Tests were extremely difficult. Lab was fine. Easy assignment due every friday. 
4268,1523143,5.0,3.0,"Had her for Bio122 this semester. I really liked her lecture style, felt it was very easy to learn the information. I feel she is not an easy A but she is very fair. 10/10 would take her again."
4269,1523143,5.0,4.0,I had Professor Stevenson for lab for BIOL205 and BIOL206. Her taste in music is Fantastic and the hours of lab go by quickly. The labs are long but her grading is very fair and takes off tenths of points for mistakes if they're small. Her feedback is very helpful and she is more than willing to help you during lab if you're confused.
4270,1523143,4.0,4.0,"Very funny and relaxed demeanor, amazing taste in music, however expects you to work hard and is a pretty difficult grader.  Very serious about plagiarism.  Very knowledgable"
4271,1523143,4.5,2.0,"Professor Stevenson is a great lab instructor.  She was clear about the assignments, and her quizzes were straightforward as long as you prepared.  She doesn't assign work that isn't necessary, and she tells you exactly what to change if you show her a rough draft of a lab report.  She's super laid-back too, I would highly recommend her."
4272,1523143,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Stevenson is awesome for 300 level seminars! Instead of lecture and memorization, her classes focus on a lot of primary lit reading and presentations. Fair warning, it does take a lot of time to read and annotate articles"
4273,1523143,5.0,1.0,"Very enthusiastic about biology. She makes biology interesting for non-bio majors. Take a class from her, the energy she provides makes the class interesting. She is also a fair grader."
4274,1523143,4.0,2.0,"READ THE TEXTBOOK. Most of her quizzes come from the back sections. Stevenson is a decent teacher, knows her materials and how to explain them...she's kind of a dorky version of Justin Bieber. Make sure you always do the busy work and are prepared WITH your clicker to answer in class questions...they happen every class. Take notes by hand"
4275,1523143,5.0,2.0,"Very solid professor -- she knows her stuff inside and out and can communicate it well. She expects you to know what is important but wants her students to do well. Excellent dry sense of humor. Will take her again, and I recommend her."
4276,1523143,4.5,3.0,"Loved her! Such a laid back personality and hilarious as well. She presented the material quite clearly, and also made an effort to make it interesting. Study the powerpoints very well, read the book, and you'll do fine."
4277,1523143,4.5,3.0,"She was great. She was very helpful, I had her for both lecture and lab and i loved her. Her sense of humor is great, and she has a good way of explaining things, so that they are easily understood. I definitely recommend to take her for 205"
4278,1523143,5.0,3.0,She was usually very clear in class and is always welcome to meet independently with students. She has a great sense of humor and likes to joke around. Her tests are reasonable if you pay attention in class and take notes. I wasn't very interested in the class material but she made it enjoyable.
4279,2420170,5.0,4.0,Professor Waddell is simply the best professor in the Mathematics department. He is so kind and truly cares about his students. He will help you with whatever you need and will try his best to accommodate his students. Professor Waddell gives me hope at Bucknell. He always encourages his students and makes himself available to them for help.  
4280,2420170,5.0,4.0,"Professor Waddell is the man. He always radiates energy, and really cares about the well being of his students. His class was challenging, but he is the type of professor that wants to see you do well, and one that you want to do well for."
4281,2420170,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Waddell is the most down to earth, hilarious, smart and caring professor I have ever had. He is a straightforward grader and wants everyone to do well. If he feels that we aren't understanding something he will go over it again. Overall, best professor I have ever had at Bucknell and someone I aspire to be like in my professional career."
4282,2420170,5.0,4.0,"His notes packets were really helpful. The weekly quizzes and nearly daily homework got a bit tedious, but it does help prepare for the exams. A nice and approachable guy that is always willing to meet students for questions."
4283,2420170,5.0,3.0,Great guy and math teacher. Always available for extra help. Genuinely cares about his students understanding of the content. His exams are straightforward as long as you do the homework and study.
4284,2420170,5.0,3.0,Hands down this is the best math class I have taken. I thought it would be a difficult subject but the professor somehow made the learning enjoyable and on point. I'll think back to the fond memories of Professor Waddell's class as I embark on my journey through the world of mathematics!
4285,2420170,5.0,4.0,Lectures are really concise and easy to understand. Attend all lectures and you should get a B or above
4286,2573776,2.0,3.0,Not qualified to teach. Has no feel for the classroom. She loves the textbook. Chose favorites in the class. Unnecessarily tough grader. The tests were very easy if you paid attention. I would have done better if she liked me more. 
4287,2573776,3.0,2.0,"Professor Kumar is honestly ridiculous. She made students pay money to access an article we needed for homework. She released an exam on Friday night 10/29 and had it due the night of Halloween. She also made two assignments due over Thanksgiving break. The class itself is pretty easy she can just be super unreasonable and annoying, goes over time"
4288,2573776,2.0,3.0,"she's a very kind person but will snap at you in class if she thinks you're not paying attention. class basically consists of her presenting slideshows of the material we read for homework, very redundant instead of actually applying the concepts we're learning. makes class extremely tedious and hard to stay awake. also beware of group projects."
4289,2573776,5.0,2.0,Prof Kumar is super nice and very knowledgable in Marketing. Most of the assignments are done within your teams and there are few exams. She gives really good lectures that help a ton!
4290,2573776,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Kumar is really nice and cares about students' mental health throughout her course. Most of the class is discussion-based, but if you participate just a few times per class, you're good to go. Most of the class is based on personal experience too, so the material you're talking about isn't academically difficult."
4291,1697236,5.0,1.0,hooottt
4292,1697236,4.0,2.0,"Great guy!! He is funny and the class is actually enjoyable at times. He always tries to play matchmaker, its a little weird but really funny."
4293,2280918,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Gorey not only is an outstanding professor, but wonderful human. A year after I took his course, he remembered my name and we chatted for a bit. In class, hes a clear grader, expectations are achievable, tests are hard yet straight forward. He made an introductory course what it should be, difficult but manageable if you do the work. 100% rec"
4294,2280918,4.0,3.0,"He really loves those converse lemme tell ya he rocks them. It was a pretty good class, I felt like sometimes he was too heavy on reviewing the homework and tests without actually taking time to teach us the new material but that got better as time went on."
4295,2280918,5.0,3.0,Great teacher with a much better personality than what you would expect from a classics teacher. Fair grader and fair in assigning homework. Knows what he is teaching and helps you learn the language very well. I would absolutely take another class of his.
4296,2184668,5.0,4.0,Amazing professor. Lectures are exciting and will make you think. Prof. Lee gives thoughtful feedback on assignments and you will get out of this class what you put into it.
4297,2184668,5.0,2.0,Professor Lee is my favorite professor at Bucknell. His lectures are amazing and he is hilarious in class. Definitely take this class with him if you have the opportunity to.
4298,2184668,1.0,4.0,"Grading was ridiculous. I don't know anyone who got an A on any paper and almost everyone I spoke to got a B. All he does is lecture for 80 minutes, students play on their laptop and dont pay attention. You can go to him for help on papers, but he'll just talk himself into a circle and you leave with wasted time. Lowest grade of my semester :("
4299,2184668,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, approachable, made me excited about the subject. Take notes during class and use them in your essays. Assigns readings for every class, but he explains all the tough concepts from them."
4300,2184668,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor. Super cool and chill. He's a pretty lenient grader and gives great feedback. He truly cares about his students and is passionate about the subject. Love him. 10/10
4301,2590182,2.0,4.0,I had her for an IP and I would never take a class with her again. She graded 10x harder than the other professor which made it unfair because your grade depended on who graded your blog post. She gave criteria for blog posts that she would not stick to (ex. it said focus on one theme but then would say you didn't cover all of the important themes)
4302,1963497,5.0,3.0,Prof is so knowledgeable and the best ANOP professor to have. 1 homework assignment per week which is manageable. Midterms and Finals are difficult (for me) but his resources (video tutorials) are your key to success. Definitely take notes in the class and I do not recommend skipping bc of content. He cares about students and tries to add humor :)
4303,1963497,5.0,3.0,"Prof Chen is a great professor who truly cares about his students. Because of COVID, he was very flexible with assignments, the midterm, and the final. He's always willing to help and he's all about being fair. He didn't take attendance this semester, (because of the unpredictable year with COVID, but I recommend going to the lectures."
4304,1963497,5.0,1.0,100% take this class. Professor Chen is hilarious and teaches great material! Always helpful and a real gem.
4305,1963497,5.0,3.0,"I can't stress this enough. Take this professor. He's hilarious, teaches super helpful material, and really helps the class get engaged. 100% would take again!"
4306,1963497,5.0,2.0,professor Chen is the best Mgmt 102 teacher! he makes sure to go over details in class and he is always available and willing to meet with students out side of class. His course has take-home (open book) Moodle quizzes every time a chapter is finished and there are 2 mid term exams and a final project - no final exam. Really love Chen!!
4307,1963497,4.5,2.0,"Professor Chen definitely wants his students to succeed and he makes Management 102 an enjoyable class. He stresses the importance of teamwork, like most of the management professors. He is always willing to help so don't afraid to go to office hours for help on homework or studying for tests."
4308,1963497,4.0,3.0,"Really wants you to succeed really nice, funny guy. 102 gets a little dry sometimes but he wants you to succeed. He gives manageable homework and you get a partner so its solid. Made 102 as good as it could've been"
4309,1963497,4.5,3.0,He is really helpful always wants you to succeed. Homework is manageable with a competent partner. Really funny guy makes class bearable. Exams are a little tough under the time constraint but with some studying and paying attention in class you can do well. Highly recommend. 
4310,1963497,4.5,3.0,"He is a great professor! Helps students when they need help. We have homework assignments with partners and if you need help you can go to him or email him. He will answer emails in less than an hour and will keep answering them until you understand. Tests aren't that bad if you study, basically just like the homeworks and practice tests."
4311,1963497,3.5,3.0,"Professor Chen's class was pretty easy. He gives you many opportunities to do well in his class. Expect homework, weekly quizzes, and tests (but it is definitely not overbearing if you pay attention and keep up with the work)"
4312,1963497,2.0,3.0,"Jimmy is hilarious, but he is really difficult to understand. Having a background in statistics really helped me in his class, otherwise I wouldn't have known what he was talking about. Nice guy and his tests are not too bad if you study."
4313,746986,1.0,5.0,"literally terrible. so boring, tough grader and one of the hardest FOUND classes there are. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AWFUL!!!!"
4314,746986,2.0,4.0,"TBH, he was not my favorite. He didn't seem willing to help his students outside class. Classes are quite boring and confusing. Gives weekly quizzes that are super specific to the readings. "
4315,746986,1.0,4.0,definitely don't recommend- insane amounts of reading and tough grader. a very unsupportive professor. I've emailed him numerous times throughout the semester and he has never answered one of my emails. it also could not have been more of a boring class- if you looked around there were always at least 2 people sleeping.
4316,746986,4.0,4.0,"would not recommend 250 unless you're a COMMITTED IREL major, otherwise, it is a lot of work. Very lecture heavy, although lectures are well structured and clear (no powerpoints), you need to take notes. Come away with a great understanding of theory but it is VERY reading and writing-intensive. Also is great in office hours and with questions."
4317,746986,1.0,5.0,"WORST professor I have ever taken, extremely condescending to students in class and out of class. Very condescending during lectures, POP QUIZZES which are based on hundreds of pages of reading and incredibly specific, and very tough grader."
4318,746986,4.0,3.0,"If you're interested in the subject, Mitchell is one of the better profs in the Political Science Department. He's incredibly knowledgable and goes in depth to answer questions in ways that offer interesting insight (although that does mean some tangents). Fair bit of reading but not unreasonable. Would recommend him overall, especially for majors."
4319,746986,2.0,4.0,"Mitchell is an extremely bright man, but that can make him extremely hard to relate to in class. He is an extremely tough grader and can be very hard to get a read on. He is very nice, but can be go on very long-winded answers to questions that end with you being more confused than when you asked the initial question."
4320,746986,1.0,3.0,"Prof. Mitchell is definitely knowledgeable and smart, yet he lacks the more human side of being a professor in that he is very impersonal. If you are deeply invested in IR topics and political science, he may be your go-to guy but for anyone else looking to fulfill requirements/credits such as a foundation seminar, steer clear."
4321,746986,4.0,3.0,"Professor Mitchell is awesome! He knows what he is talking about and presents it in a very unbiased clear way. There are a lot of readings but, you'll learn a lot about what's going on in the world. Yes, he is a tougher professor, but put in the work and you'll do fine."
4322,746986,3.0,3.0,very nice guy.  a hard ass about doing homework...gives pop quizzes.  Very smart and a good professor.
4323,746986,4.5,3.0,"Mitchell is kind of a tough guy in that he really makes the class college level. (I had him for 170 tho and he keeps in at a 100 level of difficulty). The thing is, HE IS THE MAN. He knows EVERYTHING about everything and is of the highest quality. I'm definitely glad he teaches at Bucknell and if you keep up with the reading its easy to do well."
4324,746986,4.0,3.0,Prof Mitchell gets a bad rep for no reason. He is extremely well educated. He knows so much and is able to offer real life examples that make what he has to say that much more useful. He isn't as difficult as he is often thought to be. His exams are straight forward. The pop quizzes suck but don't really count for much. Great prof! I recommend!
4325,746986,3.0,3.0,"Professor Mitchell knows international politics but does not do a great job getting it across. Exam expectations were borderline absurd. Demanded knowledge of the authors, summary, and content of 30+ readings. Useless memorization that drove everyone crazy. Definitely will not take again."
4326,746986,2.5,5.0,Professor Mitchell is smart and clearly knows alot about international politics but his emphasis on lectures and unfairly difficult tests far outweigh his strengths as a professor. He has unrealistic expectations for his students. Memorizing 32 scholarly articles and the authors underlying theory of each&#63; thats ridiculous and he doesnt realize that
4327,746986,4.0,4.0,"Had him for 170 and 250. He assigns a huge amount of reading but if you do it you'll be fine, like in most any other class. When you write papers USE CITATIONS, he loves when you reference the books. He talks the whole time but he's a really smart guy and gives good examples. I liked him a lot. The simulation in 250 is indeed awesome."
4328,746986,4.0,5.0,"His exams cover a huge amount of information, and will really test how well you can apply the theories he teaches.  He does assign a massive amount of reading...Form study groups near exams...trust me.  The simulation near the end is a blast, and you will leave the class knowing much more about the world--a great, difficult class."
4329,746986,1.0,4.0,"Prof Mitchell talks all 52 minutes and is extremely boring and not helpful in office hours. Unless international politics is what you're really interested in, I suggest staying away. He is generally nice, but has NO sense of humor."
4330,746986,3.0,3.0,"Stimulates great class discussions.  As for his lectures, he speaks eloquently but the content unimpressive.  He assigns an unmanageable amount of reading.  I took nothing away from IR250 except the feeling that my major (IR) was useless."
4331,746986,5.0,4.0,"Brilliant professor. Yes, he lectures a lot. But ask a question in the middle of class relating to the topic, and he can set the class up for terrific discussions, while answering questions so well and showing he really knows his stuff. He also shows no political bias - very impressive compared to other profs."
4332,746986,2.5,3.0,"If I had to rate his lectures on a scale from 1 to 10 in terms of how boring they are, he would be an 11.  He is sooooo boring.  He literally talks for 52 minutes straight.  I learned very little.  Apparently taking notes was important, but I would get so bored that my notes mostly consisted of doodles."
4333,746986,4.0,2.0,"Lectures can get kind of boring and long, but take really good notes and you'll do well on the papers.  Exams are pretty easy as long as you pay attention.  Attendance is important to him as he has you sign in for class. You learn a lot about politics in both past and present. Simulation is by far one of my favorite activities in any class."
4334,746986,4.5,3.0,I think that professor mitchell is a great teacher and you will defi learn something in his class.  His classes are very intresting because he lets you argue your point.  The class is a lot of work but if you stick through it you will realize that it was all worth it.  Make good use of his office hours that really helps.
4335,746986,4.0,2.0,"somewhat boring lectures, he tends to stare at the wall when he talks, but take good notes and you'll do fine"
4336,198128,4.0,1.0,"Dr. Kenny is super funny and entertaining! He is a good teacher, and he is really understanding towards his students. So much so that I wish he was actually a little less tolerant of kids skipping band, not practicing, etc... I wish he would do more in terms of outreach i.e. promoting the ensembles, but my perspective may be skewed bc of COVID."
4337,198128,5.0,2.0,"I love Dr. Kenny so much, he is one of the sweetest and most caring people you will ever meet. I had him as my foundations seminar professor so I don't know what else he teaches, but he is always ready to adapt the class to the needs of the students and he just overall brightens up my every day so 10000% recommend."
4338,198128,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher. He knows his stuff, can explain things well, and is a pretty cool guy. Definitely recommend."
4339,198128,5.0,2.0,"Really cool guy. Really nice, understanding when you need to miss practice- but not a pushover. Good conductor. And a little on the cute side, i'm not gonna lie..."
4340,198128,5.0,3.0,"I adore Dr. Kenny. He is a great conductor and makes band a ton of fun. He is very accessible to the students, and even hosts a barbeque at his house each semester."
4341,198128,1.0,3.0,Horrible.  Boring.  Anal.

4344,361972,4.0,2.0,"Class material is very difficult and hard to grasp, but he is a great professor. People dislike him, but those are people who don't do the reading. He expects you do the reading before class, so he does not spoon feed general concepts and instead only answers more detailed questions."
4345,361972,4.5,1.0,__open book midterms AND final__. Awesome guy and gives students helpful advice. Learned something useful.
4346,361972,5.0,4.0,Awesome guy. Liked it very much.
4347,361972,5.0,5.0,"On one hand, he was very good at teaching C. I started the course with no knowledge of C and at the end of the courseI I had a solid understanding about C. On the other hand, his exams are really hard: during one of the midterms we had a girl burst into tears and leave the exam."
4348,361972,5.0,1.0,Very easygoing and fun. Knows what he is talking about and is very easy to understand. I went in knowing nothing of computers and came out a CSCI major. A great Prof.
4349,361972,4.0,2.0,He is a really nice guy who is a fair grader and doesn't give a lot of homework or tests.  You don't feel a lot of pressure being in his class.  Its comfortable.
4350,361972,5.0,2.0,"Great Prof.  One of the Best I've had at Bucknell.  Very Clear in explanations and goes at a good pace.  Grading is not to bad, but grades accordingly."

4353,1203702,5.0,1.0,I took gamelan: ensemble. I have very little magic background and the class was still a blast. I learnt a lot and she was very patient when I was clearly struggling. The class is entirely graded on participation and effor. At the end of the semester there is a mandatory performance. Also gamelan doesn't use sheet music! And she brings snacks!!
4354,1203702,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Collier's class taught me how to look at music and culture in a whole new way, and while it took me out of my comfort zone (lots of critical discussion and group work), I feel like a better person for it.  Dr. Collier is extremely patient and willing to explain things . Plus, she speaks fluent Indonesian, which is really cool!"
4355,1203702,5.0,2.0,One of the most understand and passionate professors I know. I aspire to be like her once I join the educational field. She is on your side.
4356,1203702,4.5,3.0,"She's a great professor, if you are struggling in her class, it's because you didn't do the readings. She gives a lot of work, but is always willing to discuss it, and always willing to help. Professor Collier is great, and I would strongly recommend her to anyone"
4357,1203702,3.5,3.0,"All around a fairly neutral professor.  Not easy or hard, usually nice, sometimes grumpy, teaches very specialized topics, so don't take the class unless you are really interested or need to.  Uses the book a lot, so worth buying.  As long as you make an effort, you will do just fine."
4358,1203702,1.0,4.0,"Terrible. The class was easy, but I learned nothing. She has extreme bias towards certain students and she always seemed to be in a bad mood. Dont take this class if you dont have to..."
4359,1203702,4.0,1.0,"...If you knew anything about music or just paid attention and didn't go into it thinking it was a blowoff class, you would do just fine. Don't avoid her like the plague, these reviews do not reflect her teaching ability whatsoever"
4360,1203702,4.0,5.0,Great class and music!
4361,1203702,1.5,4.0,BOOO.  Avoid this professor at all costs.  Way too much work and the material was useless and boring.
4362,1203702,2.0,5.0,"Workload is impossible, tons of reading, boring and unclear topic. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!"
4363,1203702,2.5,4.0,"Awful class.  She assigns  way too much work, significantly more than other teachers, and the subject matter was just plain boring."
4364,1275385,5.0,2.0,One of my fav. professors at BU. Usually discuss current events for the first 30-45 minutes in class- then lecture in which he actually involves the students. Super nice and helpful and really wants you to learn. Not too much work and tests are pretty fair.
4365,1275385,5.0,2.0,One of my fav. professors at BU. Usually discuss current events for the first 30-45 minutes in class- then lecture in which he actually involves the students. Super nice and helpful and really wants you to learn. Not too much work and tests are pretty fair.
4366,1275385,5.0,3.0,I took two courses with him.  Loved him.  Great professor.  Very helpful and understanding.  He really knows the stuff he is teaching.
4367,1275385,4.5,4.0,Very knowledgable. Class offers a good incorporation of current events with historical perspective. Tests can be easy if you pay attention to things that he repeats.
4368,1275385,3.0,2.0,I had him for Chinese Politics. Rather boring but its an easy class as long as you take notes and speak up a little when he asks about the news. But tests are easy as long as you pay attention and get the gist of his lectures.
4369,1275385,4.5,1.0,Great professor. Very approachable. Tests are easy as long as you take good notes during lectures.
4370,1275385,4.0,4.0,"He expects a lot out of you but he is a fair grader. He's easy to talk to out of class and really helpful. Overall, I really liked the class"
4371,503290,5.0,3.0,"Professor Westbrook does an excellent job keeping students engaged during class. He works to make sure that students really care about their work in French class. He is always available to discuss questions or concerns, and if you visit him, he does take the time to help you and make sure that you're understanding the material. Tests were not bad."
4372,503290,4.0,3.0,One of my fav profs in Bucknell! His 101 may be hard for one without any background and he moves at a fairly quick pace. But I highly recommend his 101 as long as u have at least 1 or 2 months experience with French and passionate about the French culture. Simple tests and quizzes. HW is like 30min-1hr everyday and an ideal way to up your grade!
4373,503290,2.0,4.0,"Westbrook is a little odd but really loves French. French 101 is a lot more difficult than I expected, but he tries to make it so that everybody will get better than a C. I did not enjoy French very much, but for the most-part, he was pretty good. Unfortunately, he takes a long time getting test grades back and makes his TA do all other grading."
4374,503290,4.0,4.0,"Taking a course with Professor Westbrook was a mostly positive experience. He helped me develop my writing skills significantly, and taught me about many differences between American and French culture. However, he is not too clear in his expectations at the beginning of the semester and assigns a lot of busy work. I still recommend him though."
4375,503290,3.0,4.0,"Very nice guy with a good sense of humor, and easy to talk to as well. In his foundation class, however, he kind of beat the subject to death. At the beginning of the semester I went into class very interested and eager to learn, but by the end of the year I (along with everyone else) found class meetings unbearably boring and repetitive."
4376,503290,1.0,5.0,"Didn't want to put a comment, but his class is ridiculous. More work than I get for any other classes combined, doesn't matter if you do the reading as long as you write what he wants to hear, boring and impersonal, and I cannot stress the amount of useless work he assigns."
4377,503290,3.0,3.0,"Good professor- did keep my love of french alive. However, classes a bit too rushed from one thing to the next. Also lacked the ability to connect with his students- didn't really take an interest in strengths/weaknesses of the class. Still, usually an enjoyable class."
4378,503290,5.0,3.0,Professor Westbrook is without hesitation the best professor/advisor I had at bucknell. What made him stand out in my mind was his work ethic. His classes are engaging and his office is open for extra help every moment he's not teaching a class. Finally he goes out of his way to help people who've taken his class apply to grad school/jobs.
4379,503290,5.0,1.0,"While he is sometimes a very odd man, the class is overall good and very easy.  He is good about office hours and giving you extra help with the essays when needed.  His accent isn't very good, but hey he's American.  I would recommend the class because the material is pretty interesting and he offers extra credit."
4380,503290,5.0,3.0,"one of my two favorite profs during four years at bucknell.  extremely knowledgeable, very approachable, and very, very interested in his material.  puts his students first-- writes long and engaging comments on every assignment, long office hours, and he even held an extra weekly session in one course so that he could facilitate discussion."
4381,503290,4.5,3.0,"I liked him, he's a good teacher that knows his stuff but he can be a little bit boring at times. It's easy to do well in his class as long as you participate."
4382,503290,5.0,4.0,"I learned so much in that class! He is always very energetic... Lots of work, but it's worth it."
4383,1203709,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Preiss is a good guy and a good teacher. He comes across as a bit arrogant, but overall wants students to learn the material. Show you're interested and you'll do well."
4384,1203709,2.5,2.0,"The class was easy but it felt like a complete waste of time.  You don't need to buy any textbooks, just take notes/use wikipedia.  Tests consist of questions he has given to you on questionnaires in class throughout the term and those who excel at papers will do well.  Any enthusiasm for the subject matter will be tested (figuratively speaking.)"
4385,1203709,2.5,3.0,"Whoever wrote the first rating has no clue what they're talking about. Preiss is one of the worst teachers I've had at Bucknell. He talks down to students when they're wrong in class, but on the same note expects people to participate. He even walked out of class one day when people weren't answering. Take this as a warning, his class is terrible."
4386,1203709,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed him.  While his class is pure lecture the majority of the time, i didnt find the lectures overly boring.  He is very approachable and i would definitely take a another class with him.  His class was the only one i didnt find myself staring at the clock"
4387,830980,5.0,2.0,One of the sweetest professors on campus! She is very open minded when it comes to students' writing and she is always there to help. I highly suggest talking to this professor because she can really expose you to great oppurtunities. She really inspired me and changed the way I looked at writing and life in general. TAKE THIS CLASS!
4388,830980,3.5,3.0,"Engaging at first but does not take initiative later on when course becomes repetitive. Took out a chunk of fun syllabus material because she thought we were not interested when in fact, it was just very straightforward and not as abstract as other material. Grades relatively fairly but every portfolio counts for a chunk of grade!"
4389,830980,5.0,2.0,"Professor Hays is great! She is super caring and a great analyzer of the short stories that we read in class. It may seem like she babies you a little, but she is a tough but fair grader. Work hard and be nice, that's the key to success in her class. Overall, she is fabulous AND HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!"
4390,830980,5.0,2.0,"Katie is a wonderful teacher and person. I've never met someone who didn't like her. You have to work in her class, but as long as you show interest in taking feedback from her and other students in workshop and do your work on time you'll do fine. She genuinely cares about all of her students, and she'll make sure you understand every assignment."
4391,830980,5.0,2.0,"Katie Hays really loves what she does, and this shows through her teaching style. The class discussions are interesting, and the workshops really help with writing. Class is mandatory, and she doesn't give you &quot;busy work&quot;; if you're done the discussion for the day, she'll let the class go early. Overall, an awesome class and professor."
4392,830980,5.0,1.0,"She's really nice and very easy. If you seem interested in class, you will get a good grade even without speaking. The homework is really easy and quick and she's very reasonable about things if you just e-mail her. Just do all she assigns which isn't much and you'll do fine"
4393,830980,4.5,1.0,"Fantastic professor -- sweet, funny, and really knows what she is teaching. Extremely helpful with feedback on your writing for both short stories and poems. Favorite class this semester."
4394,830980,5.0,2.0,"I absolutely love Professor Hays! She is such a sweet person, her baby is adorable, and she always has a smile on her face. I can be super tired and fall asleep in all my classes but when I get to hers, I'm wide awake! She truly helped me expand my creativity in poetry and fiction! She truly helped me my freshman year!"
4395,830980,4.0,3.0,Professor Hays is AWESOME! Her class is my favorite. She gives us so much freedom and is really helpful and fun!
4396,830980,5.0,3.0,"I loved Professor Hays.  She made my introductory short fiction class amazing.  She opened the class up for discussion and helped us to take our ideas from discussion and short journal responses and turn them into full-length papers.  She used a writers' workshop setting to help us improve our writing, editing and revising skills."
4397,830980,5.0,3.0,"Katie is a great prof, very interested in helping students develop their writing abilities and very fun to work with"
4398,830980,5.0,3.0,Hayes does a great job in assisting her students when you ask for help.  She's real down to earth and is actually Bucknell Alumn
4399,830980,5.0,2.0,Katie is my favorite professor I've ever had!  I don't like poetry but she made the class interesting every day.
4400,830980,5.0,2.0,"Katie is a great teacher and a really sweet person.  I hated poetry but she made me like it so much that I may consider minoring in english.  If you work hard, she notices and it certainly pays off in the end when she does grades.  Attendance is important, too."
4401,830980,5.0,3.0,"Katie's an incredibly gifted writer, and it is even more incredible that she is able to convey her expertise to her students. She is critical, but not brutal, about students' work. She's so easy to talk to: she sometimes feels more like a fellow student than a professor. Extremely helpful during class and office hours. Her guidance is invaluable!"
4402,830980,5.0,3.0,"She was my favorite professor in my 1st semester. She can give a lot of suggestions but I think her suggestions helped. I don't usually like poetry but she made the poetry half fun, and I looked forward to class even on a Friday afternoon. If you have a good attitude and EDIT A LOT and are able to take constructive criticisms you'll love her."
4403,830980,3.0,1.0,"She is very friendly, sometimes funny, and very easy, provided you come to class, speak in class and do the work. She often doesn't know what she is talking about, though. She lets students control the class, and does things differently (we all sit in a circle, and sometimes go outside or to 7th street, etc.) Good professor."
4404,52744,1.0,3.0,"Provides no materials, everything is self-taught and gives broad feedback when you try to correct any mistakes. I felt like I never understood what he actually wanted and felt like I wasted my time with this class and professor."
4405,52744,1.0,1.0,"Skip is a nice person, but he's by far the worst professor I've ever had. He is a poor communicator. This extended to both his expectations of the class and his delivery of the subject material. I learned very little in the way of finance; must of what I did learn was self taught. Lastly, Skip is subjective--there is no objectivity in grading."
4406,52744,3.5,3.0,"You pick a company and analyze it in group presentations throughout the semester so choose your group wisely. You will do better if you go to office hours so go often. He's quirky, but so sweet and will help you if you put in effort. Gives quizzes every few weeks that I always got 2/3 on, but won't affect your grade that much."
4407,52744,4.0,3.0,"Skip is the best!! I had him for Managerial Finance as well. A little unclear about expectations but visit him for help and he will explain everything. Great for life advice, has traveled everywhere"
4408,52744,5.0,2.0,"I had Professor McGoun for two classes. The way he teaches is unconvential, but interesting. He really wants his students to think critically and develop skills needed once they graduate and this is reflected in how he grades. He is incredibly passionate and wants to meet with students to help them or just converse. He is very fair and approachable"
4409,52744,3.0,3.0,"Skip for Corp Finance (MGMT 370) is highly subjective, a bit creative and unexpected.  Lots of slides that broadly review topics.  You will learn how to make a good ppt (at least to his standards).  Be ready for anything in class and he rarely gives out anything < B, which is a plus."
4410,52744,3.5,3.0,"McGoun is my second favorite Bucknell Professor (Bettner is #1). Yes, he's insane, and yes, you'll probably get a B+. But don't write this guy off. He's got the right idea about teaching finance, and he explains why he does the crazy things he does. He's creative, which is unique. I'm an accounting major, but I'm 100% glad I didn't take Jenson."
4411,52744,1.5,3.0,"McGoun is a lunatic.  Absolutely insane.  Pretty friendly, but absolutely worthless as a finance prof.  If you actually want to learn finance, take Jenson.  If you actually want anything other than a B or B+, take Jenson.  However, I DO like McGoun's philosophy on life.  He's just been tenured for too long."
4412,52744,1.0,1.0,Skip is an embarrassment for Bucknell.
4413,52744,1.5,3.0,"Definitely unconventional, which I thought I would enjoy.  But the class has little relevancy to finance and more towards his interests and current events.  Knowing city skylines will help tremendously.  I would advise against his class, but then again you don't have that much work to do ever."
4414,52744,2.0,3.0,"Ridiculous grading system, spend all semester making useless presentations, doesn't teach material but expects you to know what you're talking about on quizzes and presentations"
4415,52744,1.0,3.0,"If you wanna waste time and money, he is the man. You learn nothing in the class other than how to make powerpoint presentations. Basically google images and investopedia are your professors! For him, Corporate Finance = creative writing and storytelling. No joke.Grades are based on how much he likes you, so be friendly with him."
4416,52744,3.0,1.0,McGoun should not be teaching at Bucknell University.  The only reason he is here is because he can get away with BS at a liberal arts school where no one is watching him to witness his arbitrary and useless &quot;teaching&quot;
4417,52744,4.0,2.0,"He is very unconventional. He doesn't even use a textbook, but he presents the material in a way that, what little you do learn, you won't forget. He is ALWAYS willing to help you understand things if you reach out to him. Great guy."
4418,52744,2.5,2.0,"He's a funny and interesting guy, but you learn absolutely nothing other than how to make a powerpoint presentation (which are SO time-consuming). You get crappy grades all semester and then probably end up with a B+ or A-. Expect to spend tons of time formatting presentations and end up knowing nothing.. really frustrating."
4419,52744,4.5,3.0,"mcgoun is awesome.  extremely interesting classes, you never know whats goin to come out of his mouth, very helpful.  Teaching style either works for you, or is impossible.  this class tests how good you are at bs, if you have issues being creative and free thinking, don't bother taking his classes...my favorite professor at bucknell"
4420,52744,1.5,4.0,"This man is incredibly frustrating. whole semester you get stuck with the same group for  project. nitpicks presentations, yet his suck. he needs to TEACH FINANCE, but all he cares about is presentations (meanwhile his powerpoints are crap). he is too unconventional, which is not always a good thing, as this class has shown me. just so irritating."
4421,52744,4.5,2.0,You'll learn nothing and be frustrated but you'll do well. The grades you get during the semester have no correlation to your final grade.
4422,52744,5.0,2.0,"I love Skip!  He is hands down one of the best profs here.  He uses a real-life appraoch rather than textbooks which is cool. Very fair with grades.  Try hard, get to know him, and you will do well.  I look forward to his class cause he's funny, engaging, and I love to hear his amazing stories.  Here is one prof you have to try!"
4423,52744,3.0,1.0,take him if you want a good grade. don't take him if you want to learn something. participate in class and you will do well.
4424,52744,5.0,2.0,"very smart, funny, understanding, and easy!  take him b/c you will learn a lot as well as get a good grade!"
4425,52744,4.0,4.0,"Interesting personality and class. No text book, so if you like being able to learn from a book don't take his class."
4426,52744,1.0,1.0,He is the worst prof I have had.  Fire his ass!
4427,52744,2.0,2.0,"He is a funny guy, but he doesn't teach. Very untraditional, and to me it makes introductory things hard when they shouldn't be, just because there is no basis for what he does. I like him, but don't want to take a class from him again"
4428,52744,5.0,4.0,awesome
4429,52744,1.5,1.0,No Comments
4430,52744,2.0,1.0,"The class is a joke, he is funny. I would never take a class from him again. He is very unprofessional."
4431,52744,5.0,3.0,"Very funny, makes class so interesting, explains everything so it's easy to understand and keeps everyone on their toes."
4432,52744,4.0,4.0,"He's a very funny man...he makes up his own cases and they are very amusing.  He knows his stuff, but his grading especially on projects remains to be questionable."
4433,2588176,5.0,3.0,"Good ECON 101 for management major who just want to get through the requirements. It's hard to give a binary comment on professor Ngo, but overall she works very hard to make this class easy and wants to take care of you. Grading is very hard, I'd never know how to get full points. But it's also hard to get bad grades because she curve grades up."
4434,2588176,4.0,3.0,"Professor Ngo gave clear lectures, and did a great job of preparing us for tests. She gave us study guides and practice tests, so even though her tests were somewhat tricky, I felt very prepared. It's also really easy to get your grade up with the writing assignments, and as long as you use analysis and don't just summarize, you'll do well."
4435,828947,4.0,4.0,"hard tests, gives half the test before the test, but you won't do well on the rest, hard quizzes"
4436,828947,4.5,1.0,Super easy and nice. Homework every night but it's always the same assignment and takes 30 mins top. Quizzes don't count for much. Definitely take his class.
4437,828947,3.5,5.0,"He teaches the material pretty well, or so it seems until you take the test and realize you don't know the material at the level of detail that the exam questions require.  He gives pop quiz's that are 4 pages long of really tough questions, and after you finish you have little confidence in your answers unless you memorized the text book."
4438,167447,5.0,4.0,The best professor at Bucknell. A true genius
4439,167447,5.0,4.0,The greatest professor I have ever had at Bucknell. Take a class with Schweizer to better yourself. You won't regret it
4440,167447,5.0,4.0,he is amazing!!!!
4441,167447,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, really cares deeply about the student and the subject. Lots of reading and writing, but worth it."
4442,167447,5.0,4.0,"Schweizer was FANTASTIC. Like everyone else is saying, the man is a GENIUS and will blow your mind. Ask him about the meaning of a blade of grass, for instance, and he'll describe to you the very concept of existence and the pointlessness yet beauty of the world. You NEED to go to class and you NEED to read his assignments. He knows what's best."
4443,167447,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors at Bucknell. A true genius.
4444,167447,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors I have had at Bucknell. Take his class to better yourself.
4445,167447,4.0,4.0,"He is amazing. One of the best professors I've ever had. His class really gave me a new perspective on many things and helped me grow as a person. Take his class if you are ready to challenge your brain, and you won't regret."
4446,167447,4.0,2.0,"Fun, intelligent. Come to class and you'll enjoy youself. Loves his cat. Grades papers harshly, but fairly. He is really good about meeting and talking about grades/class material."
4447,167447,4.0,3.0,Great prof. He has a fantastic sense of humor and never gets mad at his class. He helps people think in ways they never have before. Do the readings and show up for class and you should have a good time
4448,167447,4.5,4.0,"Probably one of the best classes ive ever taken, def one of the smartest and most insightful people ive ever met. I leave almost every class amazed by the inferences he makes. Its a lot of work and hes a tough grader but i can't recommend the class enough.  Take it!"
4449,167447,4.5,5.0,"His sense of humor is so dry and he is just hilarious. Very helpful. I liked poetry going in, but now I look for American poets to read. Schweizer is amazing!!"
4450,167447,5.0,4.0,"This man is totally crazy and an amazing professor...attendance is pretty important, but any class of his is so interesting and enjoyable that you will want to go anyway.  Also, he is pretty understanding so just talk to him.  I would consider him a genius when it comes to literature and a real entertainer in front of the class. Loved him!"
4451,167447,5.0,1.0,"I went into this class barely knowing my abc's, but Professor Schweizer took me under his wing, helped me learn how to read and by the end I was able to write comparative analytical papers relating Shakespeare's works to the state of comtemporary patriarchal fallacies in the psuedo-lesbian political economy."
4452,167447,4.5,3.0,SCHWEIZER IS THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER. I am not an english major and he single-handedly made me love poetry. Each class with him feels like you're sitting at a Parisian cafe discussing the true meaning of life as expressed through poetry with a genius.  He is awesome and hilarious.
4453,167447,1.0,5.0,sucks when it comes to attendanc
4454,167447,4.5,5.0,"Insightful man.  Although it may be challenging to finish his class with a good grade, if you work hard you will be much better for it."
4455,167447,4.0,3.0,He loves his students. that's all i'll say.
4456,167447,3.5,5.0,"Expects a great deal, but is very insightful as well.  A worthwhile professor if you're willing to put in the time and effort, which is a requirement in his classes."
4457,167447,1.0,5.0,"Don't take him if you are a non-English major.    The guy does not know what constructive criticism is, and when you are paying 35k a year you want to learn and this man does not make it possible.  He accused me of cheating without having any evidence."
4458,167447,1.0,5.0,No Comments
4459,1349145,3.5,1.0,"Took her for political geography. Easy class, smart lady, just doesn't know how to teach yet. She'd pretty unorganized, it took her three quarters of a year to write me a recommendation. She get's a bad rep but she's new at teaching and will be good once she gets a structure for the class down. I liked her and liked the class. office hours helped."
4460,1349145,3.5,1.0,So easy it is almost unbelievable. You don't need to read or do any work. She also is not very smart and does not know alot about what she is teaching. Very feminist but it is easy to look past her bias once you realize how easy her class is.
4461,828955,4.0,2.0,"Shes a lawyer from the area who you can tell just likes to teach. I appreciated how straightforward her lectures were. As long as you do all the problems she assigns to study for the tests, you'll be fine. There are no tricks, really. She also gives you a chance to get at least 2-3 extra credit points on each test. She's pretty funny sometimes too"
4462,828955,4.0,2.0,"Had her for 220 & 221 .. Great class! She communicates in very clear lectures which she gives you copies of. Uses real world examples. Frequently talks about her personal life. As long as you listen to lectures, ask the right questions, very easy tests. Many people skip a few classes with no problems. Not very available for questions outside class."
4463,828955,4.5,4.0,"Very clear in lectures.  Can be boring at times, but it's law.  Very friendly!  Gives a ton of bonus points.  Pretty easy grader."
4464,828955,4.5,1.0,"She manages to explain otherwise convoluted legal theories clearly and plainly. She goes over the case questions pretty thoroughly in class, and also sends out helpful study guides for her tests. She even gives out extra credit points to people who answer questions correctly. The tests are long and involved, but not very difficult or challenging."
4465,1924638,5.0,2.0,Professor Beasley is seriously one of the funniest and best professors that I have ever had at Bucknell. He makes even dry material easy to understand and very fun too! Taking his class helped me decide to add a minor in classics. 10/10 would recommend him to anyone.
4466,1924638,5.0,2.0,"He is a great teacher, definitely easy A, the course is so interesting and he is hilarious. Best teacher"
4467,1924638,5.0,2.0,"Loved taking Classical Myth! There was a decent amount of HW every due class day (MWF), but it was mostly answering questions based off readings. No tests/quizzes and the lectures were always fun. There's a couple of big projects, some of which are group work. Final project was a blast! Definitely recommend (easy A) and he's the nicest man ever."
4468,1924638,3.0,2.0,"Great Prof. Funny guy + is genuinely interested in what he teaches. The course is dry at times and there is a lot of reading, but there are no tests or quizzes. "
4469,1924638,3.0,1.0,"Great professor. Told us from day 1 that there would be no tests or quizzes in this course, only group projects and small writing assignments, mostly Moodle blog posts. Kind of a boring class but it was definitely an easy A!"
4470,1924638,5.0,3.0,Funny and passionate prof. Gets students involved. 
4471,1924638,5.0,3.0,"Tom Beasley is the best professor I have had yet. He is helpful, friendly and clearly very passionate about his classes. His interest in the subject he teaches is very apparent and in turn creates a fun and exciting learning environment. I would definitely recommend taking his classes, he is great! "
4472,1924638,5.0,3.0,Professor Beasley is one of the most passionate professors I've had and it is clear that he loves interacting with students. He is hilarious and makes reading classical myths fun and easy to understand. DEFINITELY take one of his classes!!!!
4473,99877,5.0,2.0,"Professor Castle is one of the nicest teachers I've ever had. You can tell she genuinely cares about her students. She sets flexible homework due dates and will reset questions you get wrong to get more credit. Though this class was easy for me after AP Chem, I can see how her explanations may be insufficient for people with less chem experience."
4474,99877,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Kastle is such a great person. I did research with her, so I don't know too much about her grading/HW habits. However, I do know she's always super helpful and understanding!"
4475,99877,5.0,3.0,"Was not looking forward to taking gen chem, but she made my experience so much better. Extremely willing to help you in anyway possible. Lenient on deadlines and willing to work with you and give you anything you need to succeed. Genuinely cares about her students, I personally would recommend her to anyone! "
4476,99877,4.5,4.0,Great teacher. She really cares about her students actually learning the material. Extremely helpful outside of class
4477,99877,5.0,4.0,"She is a great professor and a great person.  She is really helpful in and out of class.  She knows her material really well and teaches really well.  However, the tests can be tricky sometimes but overall I was glad I took her."
4478,99877,4.0,3.0,Ok teacher but makes long tricky tests

4480,675366,5.0,3.0,"he is a great guy and a great professor. cares about his students and if you listen to what he says, you will learn a lot and do well in the class. HIGHLY REC"
4481,742951,5.0,2.0,The man.  Explains things well and tests you on exactly what he teaches.
4482,742951,2.0,5.0,Don't need to come to class unless there's an exam.  Hard to learn from if you've never had comp sci before because he doesn't really get into the basics.  Not helpful outside the classroom either.  Quite nerdy.
4483,742951,4.5,4.0,"He is an amazing prof. I've had a few CS classes with him, and he is very helpful and entertaining.  You learn a lot through him, and you can tell he loves his job and loves his students. Take him if you can!"
4484,742951,4.5,2.0,"guattery is the goofiest man you will EVER meet. he is very organized in his lectures and was very entertaining. i thoroughly enjoyed his class and still learned alot, so take him if you can."
4485,742951,5.0,1.0,"I had Steve for a few classes. He is a huge nerd but hes the man. I love going to his classes. He knows what hes talking about, explains things well, and gives just the right amount of work so that you learn things but don't have to spend all your time doing work."

4487,2051634,5.0,3.0,"Very enthusiastic about what he teaches and helps make everyone else enthusiastic too. Helps make sure that everyone can get involved in a way they are comfortable in. Show up, do the reading, and follow the guidelines for participation and you'll be fine."
4488,2051634,4.0,2.0,He's a hilarious professor (once quoted Mean Girls during class). He's a fair grader and always gives adequate and timely feedback. He is easily mistaken for a student but it is obvious how intelligent he is. The course is reading and discussion intensive but the reading is interesting and the discussions are fun and class is always enjoyable.
4489,2051634,3.5,3.0,"The class is broken up into two parts, the first part will be spent doing a lot of reading and looking at text. The second part is a role playing game in which you have to participate to get a good grade. I would not recommend taking it if you don't like reading or participating. Parks is a very energetic professor so it is easy to pay attention."
4490,2051634,4.5,3.0,He's incredibly intelligent and very engaging. He is always available to help and is one of my favorite professors!
4491,2051634,4.5,4.0,"Professor Parks is without a doubt one of my FAVORITE teachers here at Bucknell. I know he's a visiting professor which makes me incredibly sad because I want to take so many more classes with him. He's pretty young, but so passionate about what he teaches, and he's really down to earth as well. I always looked forward to myth with him. "
4492,2051634,4.5,2.0,"He is the nicest, most funny guy. Looks like he's about 25, but it becomes obvious early on how intelligent he is. Is always encouraging of people in class, and while there is a large amount of reading and writing assignments, he is not a harsh grader."
4493,1431090,4.0,3.0,Can be a little dry at times however he knows his material very well and is able to communicate and teach it effectively as well.
4494,1431090,5.0,3.0,"This man is incredible.  His course was incredibly organized and he was a fair and impartial grader.  He is essentially a ""Renaissance Man"" with interests in history (clearly), art, literature, film, poetry, music and more that he seamlessly incorporates into the course.  Very nice in office hours.  But he does have rather long tests."
4495,1431090,5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors at this school. Fair grader, very helpful, and excellent to talk to in his office hours. I've taken numerous classes with him and truly think he's one of the best at the school (and undoubtedly in the history department.) Highly recommend him."
4496,1431090,5.0,2.0,Very helpful and clear professor. Highly recommended.
4497,1431090,4.0,3.0,This Professor is awesome! Facilitates really nice discussions
4498,77366,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors I had in Bucknell. Classes were fine as long as you put in some effort.
4499,77366,5.0,4.0,"Professor Armstrong is amazing!! She really cares about her students and puts a lot of work to make sure that we were having fun while learning Japanese. However, don't take the class if you want an easy A -- participation matters A LOT!! Work hard and show up to the office hour from time to time, and you will get a good grade."
4500,77366,5.0,3.0,"Armstrong sensei is definitely the best language teacher ever! Her class is always a lot of fun and you'll get all kind of interesting cultural facts beside learning Japanese. Tests and quizzes are not hard if you study, but the course does require a fair amount of effort."
4501,77366,5.0,3.0,Professor Armstrong is one of the best professors I have ever had at Bucknell. She really wants her students to succeed and her exams are very reasonable if you go and participate at every class. She is a very caring and easy to understand professor. 
4502,77366,5.0,3.0,"She is the best professor I've ever had. She is very funny and clear during class, and she knows how to get everybody involved. Very willing to help outside class. The class is kind of hard but it really worth all the fun. I've decided a minor after taking one class with her and I will continue to take her class!"
4503,77366,5.0,3.0,She's the most helpful professor I've met in Bucknell.
4504,77366,5.0,4.0,"Armstrong-sensei is the most engaging professor I have had yet. I am always paying close attention during class, which I can't say for the rest of my courses. Tough, but she knows her Japanese very well and you learn so much from her. Definitely makes majoring in East Asian Studies worth the effort."
4505,77366,5.0,3.0,"Professor Armstrong is AMAZING! She is really interesting, very good at getting people invovled and at knowing where her students need extra studying or help."
4506,77366,5.0,3.0,"One of the best teachers I've had so far. Expects a lot of studying, but very helpful and interesting classes. If you want to learn Japanese, definitely take her class!"
4507,77366,5.0,5.0,"A woman who was successful in the japanese corporate environment decades ago, when it was even *more* patriarchal. She is awesome, and she will make you learn. Just don't expect her to go easy on you."
4508,77366,5.0,3.0,"She is a wonderful teacher.  i had her for japanese 101, i did very poorly (was my fault) however she tried her best to help me study and perform better in class."
4509,77366,4.5,4.0,She is awesome.  Sarcastic and intelligent.  Even if I didn't like Japanese I'd still take the class to have her as a professor.
4510,77366,5.0,4.0,One of 3 excellent professors I had during 4 years of college.

4513,2639414,5.0,2.0,Professor Dalleo gave really interesting lectures and I enjoyed the IP class he offered this past semester. You can get a good grade by having a general understanding of the readings and going to the lectures. He's also very accommodating and is available for help outside of class.
4514,2639414,5.0,4.0,"Professor Dalleo's class was engaging and interesting. He gives great feedback and is helpful. Lots of reading, but material is not difficult."
4515,2639414,5.0,1.0,"Awesome professor! I really enjoyed his class and thought it was really well taught. Although the course was online, Prof. Dalleo did a nice job of presenting the course material, and I would definitely recommend taking his class."
4516,2528822,4.0,4.0,"Hessler is always available to meet, and is very clear what she wants on the midterm and final- she gives you all of the questions beforehand. The papers are tough because she is a hard grader, but if you meet with her before you turn it in, she will tell you exactly what to fix and you will get a good grade. Participation is also pretty important."
4517,2528822,4.0,3.0,"Jennifer is so helpful in office hours. I was not strong in writing prior to this class. I met with her to read over drafts of my responses and papers a lot, and it improved my ideas and writing a lot. The class was fun, though kind of a lot of work and not an easy A. But I still recommend."
4518,2528822,5.0,3.0,"I love this class! I'm not a film major, but it's still useful to me to learn about TV industry and how they target different audiences through representations. Great screenings that are interesting and helpful for understanding the material. Professor is very approachable, relatable, and always available to meet"
4519,2528822,1.0,3.0,"She is one of the worst professors I have ever had. Sounds illiterate when she speaks, not comfortable in front of a class and or anyone, and so awkward during office hours. Her lectures consist of reading off of PowerPoints. Gives no constructive criticism or how to improve your writing - it's always wrong in her eyes. She's awful."
4520,2209340,4.0,3.0,"Smart.  Very willing to help.  If you follow his homework, practices, and study guides the exams are easy.  However, requires a lot of time out of class for review.  He goes over everything in class, but  very time consuming.  He really really wants you to learn everything to its fullest!"
4521,2209340,2.0,2.0,"Lectures were very monotone and boring... It was rather difficult to learn during lectures, so a lot of the learning was done on my own outside of class. However, his exams are extremely easy if you are willing to go through all of his practice problems."
4522,2209340,2.0,3.0,"Hard to earn in the classroom because he doesn't go over things in much detail that's clear and easy to understand. You need to go to office hours to understand the material which takes a lot of time out of your day. Super qualified for the position and very intelligent,  but he should maybe put his smarts to use outside of the classroom."
4523,2209340,5.0,4.0,"Nice guy.  He used a lot of lectures and group work which I liked.  He answered emails  and was good in office hours.  The homeworks are rough and the project is very long.  Wish the project was better defined, but was my first large project over the whole course.  Tests are easy if your do the reviews he posts."
4524,489021,5.0,3.0,"I loved my class with Prof Susman! The material was so interesting and although some of his lecture style is unique, he made the class very interactive. He incorporated historical material with current news and it was really cool to see those connections. Definitely have to work but go see him in office hours and you'll be good!"
4525,489021,3.0,4.0,"Hes an okay teacher, but he grades based on his interpretation of your work. He also makes you depend other people as apart of your grade (peer review)."
4526,489021,2.0,2.0,Not a bad professor just don't like how he runs the class
4527,489021,5.0,3.0,Brilliant professor.
4528,489021,5.0,1.0,The best professor i have had in my ENTIRE life. 
4529,489021,4.5,2.0,"Amazing! One of the most interesting professors I've had at Bucknell. Truly invested in the subject matter and his students. The class had a significant amount of readings, but the class only met once a week -- making it manageable. I would take ANY class his is teaching. SO WORTH IT."
4530,489021,5.0,2.0,Paul Susman is a gem.  Perhaps the most inspirational prof at Bucknell.  He really challenges your preconceived notions and encourages you to think critically and engage in the world around you.  His passion is contagious and his involvement with the Bucknell Brigade is exemplary.  Take anything this man teaches.
4531,489021,4.5,2.0,One of the brightest and most cheerful professors I have ever had at Bucknell. Makes you want to go out and change the world. Always available and willing to help his students. Take any and all of his geography classes if you can.
4532,489021,5.0,4.0,"You cannot learn to be a revolutionary in a classroom at Bucknell.  But, thanks to Paul, you can learn why you should aspire to be a revolutionary."
4533,489021,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor that has inspired me to continue my education even further and take a good look at the inequalities in the world.
4534,489021,3.5,3.0,"dr susman is very enthusiastic. hes also very kind and concerned with students' wellbeing. his assignments are a bit ambiguous though, and he tends to not be able to clearly explain what he would like. classes consisted of lecture and lots of discussion. spending a lot of time with the material is the best you can do."
4535,489021,5.0,3.0,I took several courses with this guy and he is great.  He gets students to think without pushing his own agenda.  Focuses on bringing out new learning to the students. Highly recommended.
4536,489021,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor. Really funny and always very helpful outside of class. Take him if you can!
4537,1764930,5.0,3.0,"Really cool guy. Had his class in 2014. He talks a lot, but actually lets students have opinions that don't mirror his, and won't tell you that your thoughts are wrong. One 2-page paper every two weeks and a longer one at the end of the semester. If you don't participate, you won't pass. Cool guy, even if he is a giant nerd."
4538,1764930,4.5,1.0,"Literally the best teacher I've had so far here. The work is very minimal, and as long as you participate you will know the material. Just show up to class and do the bi-weekly journals and you'll get an A."
4539,1764930,4.0,2.0,"Great professor for my foundation seminar Storming the Reality Studio. Loves sci-fi and is really into the material we cover. Super easy class; the weekly papers are opinions and the long papers are no problem. He loves when people participate, but you don't necessarily need to. Interesting class, definitely take it."
4540,1764930,4.0,2.0,"Professor Lyons is awesome! I had him for Storming the Reality Studio, and it was clear he knew what he was talking about and was very involved with all the subjects. There's an easy 2 page paper every week and a couple longer papers, but other than that it's not too much work. Coolest class I've ever taken!"
4541,1764930,3.5,1.0,He can be kind of rude towards some students. Has the most totally ridiculous ideas about the world and the future.  Huge sci fi nerd and proud of it.  Class is pretty interesting. You don't need to participate but it's a smart idea to if you want him to like you.  Two page papers every week and long papers about once a month. Overall not bad class
4542,77379,2.0,3.0,"Professor Knoedler is a nice lady, but I would definitely not recommend taking IPE with her if you do not have to. Classes are always lectures which are brutal because she talks very quietly, is not very engaging, and the slides are typically only text - no pictures. Tons of reading but you don't have to do all of it to do well in her class."
4543,77379,4.0,3.0,"She recently changed to having only one essay due per week instead of daily essays (one due Tuesday and Thursday), which was nice. She is a super super sweet woman. She cares a lot about her student's success and really wants you to understand and appreciate the material. Her lectures are pretty boring though, lots of graphs and stats"
4544,77379,4.0,3.0,"Jan is a bae. She lets you know exactly what she will expect you to know on the exams, and even if you tend to zone out in class sometimes, you can still get an A. If you need help, she is always willing to explain things again to you. By far my favorite Econ professor."
4545,77379,4.5,2.0,Do the readings and there's no way you won't get an A. She tells you exactly what she expects and is not a hard grader when it comes to the weekly essays.
4546,77379,1.0,1.0,"She is incredibly quiet to the point that you physically can't make out most of what she says in class. Class moves too slow because of her and she doesn't take it to other interests for students. However, she's very accepting of late work."
4547,77379,1.0,2.0,"Most absurdly boring teacher I've ever had. The fact that I'm paying tuition to watch Prof Knoedler crawl through powerpoints of collected data all while fully whispering non-sequential side notes is a joke. If you can look busy for 3 hours each week, give it a go, but if you have any interest in the subject of having a good teacher, stay away"
4548,77379,4.5,4.0,Class was taught using PPT presentations and looking at cases. There are no exams or quizzes so you don't have to memorize anything. Prof. Knoedler is very nice and knows a -ton- about this topic. She is very willing to help with papers or presentations. Definitely recommend!
4549,77379,5.0,2.0,"Attendance is &quot;mandatory&quot; yet the class is one in which you could miss a month of and not be too far behind.   There are no tests or quizzes, only writings on the books which you could browse through.  She's a super nice professor and will go out of her way to help you.  Your grade in this class is determined by your skill as a writer"
4550,77379,5.0,3.0,"discussion style mostly, very interesting readings and topics, very clear teaching"
4551,77379,4.0,3.0,great
4552,77379,4.5,1.0,Easy class and quite interesting (if you are into technology and the world). Very very nice + generous teacher. She will help you out in any way she can.
4553,77379,3.5,1.0,Very very easy for foundation seminars but assigns a lot of written work.
4554,77379,5.0,2.0,Shes very nice and helpful. She will give you help even with stuff not related to the class. Shes a very good resource for freshmen.
4555,77379,5.0,2.0,she's really nice and helpful
4556,77379,1.5,2.0,No Comments
4557,1201734,5.0,4.0,The best.
4558,1201734,5.0,4.0,"He did a great job of slowly easing us into proofs. The exams were difficult, but the material was all in lecture and notes so they were doable. I loved this class is Piggot was very accessable and supportive. I enjoyed his lectures, although I didn't love the times he asked us to do work with other students in class."
4559,1201734,4.0,2.0,Not group projects but for this elective you have to write a reflection with a peer or two which is really easy to get a decent grade on (not a perfect one). Can't base actual teaching skills but it is an easy elective I would recommend to anyone if you have Piggott. Also has an australian accent.
4560,1201734,1.0,5.0,He makes me hate Math and I am a science major. LOL.
4561,1201734,1.0,5.0,Adam's true teaching effectiveness is not effective at all.
4562,1201734,1.0,4.0,"The worst part of this teacher is that he knows that he does awful but he doesn't even try to improve, such as hard tests with an average of 50 or lower and tons of homework per week."
4563,1201734,1.0,5.0,"You can never feel so helpless and depressed unless you take his class. His voice puts you into sleep in any minute and his handwriting is so terrible that he has to upload notes on moodle every time, which takes you extra time to retake the notes on your own. His homework is tedious and doesn't help at all, you have no choice but copy the answer"
4564,1201734,2.0,4.0,He spends 80% of class just talking about how mathematicians came up with calculus rather than actually teaching the material
4565,1201734,3.0,4.0,"Professor Piggott is a great guy; he genuinely cares about each student and is willing to work tirelessly with the individual if need be. The tests are quite difficult and the homework will take a solid chunk of your time if you do not break it up amongst your group members. Lectures can be extremely boring at times, but each one is important."
4566,1201734,5.0,2.0,"Most helpful professor ever, guy loves his job. He explains material really well, and made me want to be in class every single day. Homework is tasking, but he is always around to help out. Great sense of humor. ver passionate about what he does. Best prof in my Math dept experience."
4567,1201734,4.0,4.0,"I'll start of by saying he's a ridiculously hard grader. Our final was worth 45% of our grade, and it consisted of 45 points, so each point off on the exam was a point off our final grade - completely unreasonable. Other than that, he's a good teacher, but I will never take him again if I can help it, he weighs the tests way too heavily."
4568,1201734,4.5,3.0,"Such a fantastic guy! His cute sense of humor and adorable accent help out. I'm not a math person, but he really gets you to learn the material WELL. Do your homework and study and you won't have a hard time. I totally recommend him."
4569,1201734,5.0,2.0,"Great professor~!! my favorite at Bucknell. He has got a good humor, but you need to be smart to get the fun out of it. Do your HW and you will be on your path a an A"
4570,1201734,4.5,2.0,Awesome guy. Would recommend irregardless of whether you really like math or not. If you don't get math he's real good at taking your questions/problems and seeing what you don't get. If you do like math he's really willing to teach/help you with stuff outside of the course.
4571,1201734,2.5,3.0,"He's a great guy. Awesome accent!... a bit hard to follow, though. He talks really fast and writes really messy and is sometimes hard to understand. He is very willing to help if youre stuggling!"
4572,1201734,5.0,3.0,Nice guy with a good sense of humor. Explains things very well. One of the best teachers the math department has to offer. He tends to write hard exams but he wants you to do well and gives a slight curve at the years end.
4573,1201734,3.5,4.0,"Nice guy, great accent, the class is hard if math does not come naturally to you."

4575,740935,5.0,3.0,"Professor Higgins is my favorite professor at Bucknell. He cares a lot about the success of his students, is very approachable, and his quirky jokes keep lectures interesting/exciting."
4576,740935,4.0,1.0,"Only had him for a three week seminar, but he presented the material in a clear and concise way. Sometimes the material got a little boring because he was going slow in his explanations."
4577,740935,4.0,2.0,"great guy, material can be a tad boring, but he always makes class somewhat fun.  his tests are fair and you can usually do well on them.  feel like i didn't learn much tho"
4578,740935,3.0,2.0,Prof Higgins has a great personality in lecture and acts very funny in class. He can be helpful in labs but sometimes he assumes you know more than you do which doesn't help. Class is mostly easy though
4579,2238024,2.0,5.0,Extremely tough grader and tons of work
4580,2238024,5.0,4.0,I learned so much and truly made the material interesting and fun.
4581,773705,5.0,3.0,Incredible professor and respected mentor.
4582,773705,5.0,5.0,"He is amazing, really smart and cares a lot about his students. He pushes you to think further and prepares you for real life with physics. He reinforces the importance of everything taught in terms of applications. In PHYS212E, you better do the reading before you go if you do not want to get lost. Do not leave without a friendship with him."
4583,773705,5.0,3.0,He goes out of his way to make help students. He will make appointments outside of his office hours.
4584,773705,5.0,1.0,awesome
4585,773705,5.0,3.0,Very clear and precise by engaging students and really guiding them to comprehend the material.
4586,773705,5.0,3.0,"Willing to go out of his way to help students. Office hours are really helpful. Really nice guy - he's the kind of professor that still says hi and asks how you're doing when he sees you, even a few years after taking his class. If you need to take physics, I highly recommend him."
4587,773705,4.5,4.0,I had him for 211 and 212.Its a hard class.I think he is the best professor at Bucknell.He is smart but can explain everything at an intro level.Go to his office hours even if you are not in his class.He helped me so much I would not have passed without him.He really takes interest in his students and our life outside the classroom.Great professor!
4588,773705,5.0,3.0,"Very helpful, glad I had him as a teacher. He helps out a lot. Lots of students seem to be interested in physics and current physics research after taking his class or talking to him."
4589,773705,5.0,2.0,"Professor Ligare is a great person.  He is extremely intelligent, and truly wishes all his students the best.  Really a great problem session teacher.  I cannot say enough nice about him."
4590,773705,5.0,3.0,"This course is hard, but he realizes that and will do absolutely everything to help. Best professor I've had."
4591,773705,4.5,3.0,Cares about how well his students are doing not only in his own class but in all classes.
4592,773705,4.5,4.0,where's marty&#63;
4593,773705,5.0,3.0,"Most helpful professor I've ever had.  Grades your homework himself.  Even if you've done a homework problem right, he may write on you homework  an easier, more efficient way to do the problem.  Doesn't sleep."
4594,773705,5.0,3.0,"most patient prof ive ever met- will explain things a billion ways if he has to to help you understand. a very sweet dude, awesome for problem session"
4595,773705,5.0,2.0,Very good lab teacher. He is awesome at explaining things and making sure you understand what is going on.
4596,2557520,5.0,3.0,Professor OConnor is a fantastic teacher. If you have the chance to take principles of real estate with him you wont regret it.
4597,2557520,2.0,4.0,"Professor O'Connor moves through material very quickly. If you are not finance major, it is very difficult to follow. His tests are all multiple choice but do not test your knowledge as the questions are worded in a odd way. Additionally, there was 6 chapters of material on the final that were not covered in class. Would not recommend this class"
4598,740945,1.0,4.0,"Simply the worst professor I've had at Bucknell. I seriously question what the department of engineering is doing keeping her around. She is disorganized, unclear, pushover, insincere, condescending at times, and all around a terrible teacher. She does her best but it's obviously not enough."
4599,740945,1.0,4.0,"Professor Buffinton taught the intro matlab ENGR 214 class and it was awful. She glossed over pretty much all of the material, relying on the labs for you to teach yourself the material. I feel bad for the TAs who had to basically teach us everything. She barely used the textbook. She was easily accessible for help, but couldn't help anyways..."
4600,740945,1.0,3.0,.
4601,740945,2.5,3.0,"Always happy, but pretty poor teacher. Tests can be pretty tough, especially since she tests you on material that was never taught"

4604,2225746,5.0,4.0,"I loved Abnormal w/ Prof Baker. She is very intelligent, funny, down to earth, caring and really wants her students to both learn and succeed. Her lectures may have been a little disorganized at times, but I still enjoyed them thoroughly! She keeps the class engaged, and tells relevant, interesting stories from her experiences as a psychologist."
4605,46674,5.0,3.0,"He gives good feedback for our assignments. The textbook is written by the professor himself, very well written and interesting, contents are heavy."
4606,46674,5.0,4.0,"This professor is an really nice one that you all should have. He gives you practical knowledge that won't waste your time. The homework is a lot but if you go to office hour, listen to lecture and see TAs, you will be fine."
4607,46674,5.0,3.0,"One of my fave profs at Bucknell for sure. His senior seminar class was so interesting! He is so knowledgeable and every time he speaks I'm in awe - such an amazing lecturer. If you are an Econ major, you have to take a class with him. Made me remember why I love Econ so much! Workload wasn't terrible. Not an easy A, but doable and worth it."
4608,46674,5.0,3.0,"Great person, great professor.  Will help you grow a lot as a student.  Lots of reading is the only downside, but as long as you do it class shouldn't be too difficult.  Also an amazing adviser so especially if you are thinking about econ as a major his Foundation is worth taking even if you're not that interested in South Africa."
4609,46674,5.0,4.0,he is the most amazing professor at bucknell. second time taking him and i LOVE his class! hes so smart and provides real world examples that help you learn the material and find it interesting. i have no idea how much he reads but he basically knows everything. also the friendliest guy ever. reminds me of santa
4610,46674,4.0,3.0,"Great class for intro to econ. A lot of homework, but schneider is a great guy and professor. Tests can be hard, requires studying but B+ to A range is attainable. Definitely would recommend."
4611,46674,5.0,4.0,Amazing lectures! Professor Schneider always connects our ECON class material to the reality.
4612,46674,5.0,3.0,"Best teacher so far!!! I had him for my foundation seminar class and so we do 3-4 papers the entire semester. Most of the class is part lecture part small group work. He encourages students to use office hours and had us over to his house for a class dinner one night! No tests too. However, participation is 20% of your grade so that's a must!!"
4613,46674,5.0,4.0,I love love love schneider!! such an amazing professor. i learned so much in this course and even though its a lot of homework and readings you get so much out of all the hard work you put in. definitely going to take him again if i ever get the chance!!
4614,46674,5.0,4.0,"There is a lot of preparation and work required for the class; however, it is all worth while. His lectures are engaging and he is very passionate and invested in his student's learning. The tests are tough, but I recommend this course to everyone."
4615,46674,4.5,4.0,"There's so much work for this class. You'll be so busy with readings and hw. But don't let that deter you from his class because he's so engaging and he's so helpful!! The work really prepares you for the tests and it doesn't even feel like you're learning when you're in class. If you put effort in, you'll get so much out of it!"
4616,46674,5.0,3.0,Lots of work.  Homework is assigned for every class.  Tests are intense but if you spend time doing the work you will be prepared.  Spent 1-2 hours on each assignment.  
4617,46674,4.5,3.0,"awesome professor, very clear and understanding. He clearly knows hte material an can present it n many different ways to so everyone understands. Prepares you well for the tests"
4618,46674,4.5,4.0,"Professor Schneider is THE coolest professor I've had at Bucknell. His class is a little reading-intensive, but he's genuinely interested in the material and does a great job engaging his students. If you're having any trouble, he's extremely approachable and willing to help you outside of class."
4619,46674,3.0,4.0,"Its not that he's a bad professor, just be prepared to do a lot of homework."
4620,46674,4.5,3.0,"I was in South Africa Apartheid and After and now Professor Schneider is my academic advisor. He is a great man and though the subject of my foundation seminar was not my favorite I ended up learning a lot. There was a lot of required reading and work to do in that course, but having him as a teacher was worth it."
4621,46674,5.0,3.0,"Maybe the best teacher I've ever had. I've never seen a teacher/professor so interested in what he's talking about. It makes you interested. Lots of work, but you end up learning so much. Do the practice tests+hw and you'll do well. I'm going to take as many classes with him as I can. He's awesome."
4622,46674,5.0,3.0,"Professor Schneider knows exactly what he is doing and can explain almost everything with perfect clarity. His econ 103 class is demanding, but well worth it because it gives a great base in overall economics. If you are willing to work, you will do well in his class."
4623,46674,5.0,5.0,"Genius. Prof Schneider is amazing. His class is a lot of work and takes a lot of time out of your life, but if you're at all remotely interested in economics, he will be one of the most influential professors ever."
4624,46674,5.0,3.0,"Homework assignments due everyday, which become annoying, but he makes studying for tests very easy by providing about 10 old exams to study from. Tests are straight forward. He knows economics extremely well and teaches in a way that is very intereting and easy to understand. I would definitely suggest taking his course if youre interested in econ"
4625,46674,4.5,4.0,"the amount of material he provides is excellent for test prep (old tests/homework solutions). the workload is higher than other econ 103 classes, but you learn much more. geoff is also a cool guy and leads a secret life as a rock and roll star."
4626,46674,5.0,4.0,Hey is the greatest professor I've ever had!
4627,46674,5.0,4.0,Straigh up Baller. No Joke. Geoff is an awesome professor who knows his stuff. Take a class with Geoff and he will change your life. If my kids turned out 1/2 as baller as Geoff I would be greatful.
4628,46674,5.0,3.0,he was the best teacher i had at bucknell hands down. he makes you work but you'll learn a ton and enjoy yourself while you are doing it.
4629,46674,4.5,4.0,"Take him, and you will love Economics ! He is one of the greatest professors! Very nice..."
4630,46674,4.5,4.0,"class was tough w/ all the work that was done, as he expects a lot of reading and writing done. TERRIFIC adviser. i was able to talk to him for a good amount of time regarding careers in the econ field, and he genuinely cares about your success."
4631,46674,5.0,3.0,One of the best teachers that I've ever had
4632,46674,4.5,4.0,"A lot of homework and reading, exams are hard. He wrote the books though and knows his stuff. He is a really good teacher and will help you if you need it. Great professor, esp if youre a mgmt or econ major."
4633,46674,4.5,3.0,definately gives out a lot of hw- one due every class (3x a week) but one of the best professors ive ever had. He isn't boring and really makes you want to learn more about economics. He does so much to prepare you for the exams and it really depends on how much you put into it.
4634,46674,3.0,5.0,Tons of homework
4635,46674,5.0,4.0,Very hard but extremely good teacher and very helpfull.
4636,46674,5.0,4.0,"Best professor I ever had.  May be considered biased, but he is actually presenting a new viewpoint to many of Bucknell's wealthy suburban white students, which I was.  Helped me see other perspectives and made me a more well rounded student.  Bucknell should have more like him.  Underappreciated."
4637,46674,5.0,3.0,"great teachers, gives great notes, great guy, has a very good teaching style, he gives a lot of homework, but if you do them you are more than prepared for the test, however, test can be difficult... but the time into the class and you get a lot out of it .. you learn more than you could immagine"
4638,46674,5.0,3.0,"It wasn't easy, but damn did i learn it"
4639,46674,4.0,3.0,Good teaching style
4640,46674,5.0,3.0,One of the better Humanities teachers I've had as an engineer.
4641,46674,5.0,3.0,great prof
4642,46674,5.0,2.0,"Very very biased, but teaches well"
4643,46674,5.0,4.0,highly recommended
4644,46674,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, terrific!"

4647,2557526,5.0,1.0,"Easy class. Easy to get an A if you just do the work, which is minimal. Not punished if you don't go but he really cares about you/ the class so it is sad to skip"
4648,2557526,4.0,2.0,"Class attendance is necessary. It is a lot of reading, not textbooks, but actual books. However, he does not give any exams. Your grade is based off of participation and off of synthesis papers you have to write based off the readings he assigns. There is no final exam either. The final is a self evaluation of what grade you think you deserve."
4649,2557526,5.0,2.0,Professor McCloud is one of the best professors I have had. He is very passionate about what he is teaching and is able to engage all students. His class is discussion-based and participation so be prepared for that. He also makes an effort to know each student personally. By far my favorite class I've taken
4650,2315864,5.0,3.0,Overall a good man
4651,904793,5.0,3.0,Dr. E is a great professor and an amazing person. She puts in the time to get to know each of her students and is very willing to help anyone who needs it. The homework is not too bad and helps you understand the material better.
4652,904793,5.0,3.0,"Dr. E is wonderful. She takes the time to get to know you and teaches her material really well. Sometimes she goes on and on, but it helps you in the long run. Homeworks aren't too bad and she helps a lot if you are stuck on anything!"
4653,904793,5.0,2.0,"Dr. E is a great professor and cares about her students. The class only required a couple reading books, but they were used pretty heavily. There were only two essays for the class, but a lot of &quot;blog post&quot; style homework. Nothing was too difficult, but I thought it was really interesting, also she had some fun experiments with materials."
4654,904793,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic lecturer, very clear with her expectations of you. ALWAYS go to recitation even if you don't have questions to show her you are dedicated to learning the material. Realize you are blessed to take this class instead of MATH 216 (regular stats), so don't complain and give the material the time it needs to be understood, which isn't too much"
4655,2639449,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Horton is the MOST AMAZING PROFESSOR I have had in my 3 years at Bucknell. His lectures were amazing. He really cared about his students. I took his class last spring semester and I still to this day remember all the brain structure he taught us in lab. If you ever see this, please know how amazing you are. Bucknell really missed out :'("
4656,2639449,5.0,3.0,"Spring 2020 semester (remote learning at the end). Hands down one of the best professor's I've had. Really cares about your wellbeing, understanding of material, and what you get out of his class. Assignments were either reading notes or questions. Put the work in and you won't regret it. Visiting prof., but 100% take him if he returns!"
4657,740953,2.5,3.0,"His lectures are really boring, slow, and pretty difficult to get through. He's also not great at answering questions. The warm-ups are pretty easy though, and the tests aren't terrible."
4658,740953,2.5,3.0,"Dan has a rough lecture, he's so boring no matter how hard he tries to be funny, its not enough to keep you awake. Easy to get off topic, but really knowledgable. He's a little slow, so if you need straight answers, you might be better off asking another CS professor."
4659,740953,4.5,3.0,"The class is tough, but he knows that and tries to help you. If you actually want to succeed, you will."
4660,740953,2.5,2.0,"Good nice guy, kinda slow and can go off on tangents where you'll have no idea whats going on. the class is somewhat easy but you still have to study. he can be a very confusing teacher, i would definetly reccomend reading the textbook because its hard to know what he's doing in class without reading ahead of time"
4661,740953,1.0,1.0,The worst professor I've ever had at Bucknell. Avoid him at all costs. I wish Bucknell would pay me back for every hour I had to spend with this professor. He does not know anything that he is teaching and he is useless when you need some help with your homework.
4662,740953,2.5,1.0,Too easy. I took his foundation seminar class and it was a Joke. Just stay on his good side and you'll get an A. Otherwise hes quite boring
4663,740953,1.5,3.0,"He is old, boring, and not helpful. And I'm pretty sure he isn't a big fan of girls... Every body slept in his class. He isn't any better in office hours."
4664,740953,2.0,1.0,"Nice guy, has lots of knowledge, but doesn't seem too eager to dispel it.  Likes to hear himself talk, and often ignores questions or seems to withhold information purposefully.  Not a hard grader, but can be ambiguous."
4665,740953,4.5,3.0,No Comments
4666,740953,3.0,3.0,Does he still have that heinous mustache&#63;
4667,2588249,4.0,3.0,Professor Jones is really great at teaching but makes you work for an A. You have homework daily and group video projects. The class is easy to do well in if you pay attention and get help when you need it.
4668,2727516,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely insane grader of all assignments, spent 12 hours on every homework assignment and still got an average of 60s on them. Makes the entire class miserable, I've never seen a professor who can make what could be an exciting topic so boring and miserable."
4669,740956,1.5,2.0,He isn't clear about expectations and gets confused with questions. Was looking forward to the course but topics were really basic and disappointing for seniors.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Busy work.
4670,740956,2.0,4.0,Construction Management sounded like an interesting class but Professor Toole does a bad job at teaching the class. He was very unorganized. It was difficult to know what to study when it came time for the exams and he was very vague and unclear on most of the material.
4671,740956,4.0,2.0,"Good professor, nice guy. Material was very detailed and our class was co-taught so it made things extremely confusing and difficult to do well."
4672,740956,5.0,1.0,Prof Toole is the man!!! He is super helpful and cooks a mean avocado burger.
4673,740956,4.5,4.0,Professor Toole is a great professor! He is very helpful and he is eager to help students who seek him out in office hours.  I can't wait to have him for more ENR classes in the future!

4675,740959,1.0,4.0,Not good
4676,740959,5.0,2.0,"I took her CSCI 103 class during the BCCSP program, Prof Baish is the best CS professor I've had so far. She's caring and is willing to invest time in her students to make sure they succede."
4677,740959,5.0,2.0,Baish is a great teacher if you have no experience in CS. She goes fairly slow in her lectures and is always willing to slow down and answer questions. Homeworks and exams are easy if you try at all. 
4678,740959,1.0,4.0,"If you skip this class, you simply will not pass. if you have never taken a computer science class before this class, do NOT take this class. she says that she wants people who know nothing about comp sci, but the only people who did decent in this class were people who had an outside background with comp sci. do not take her, don't."
4679,740959,5.0,3.0,She's amazing. If you have never taken Comp Sci before she is definitely the professor you want. Comp Sci is a difficult course and she helps you with any problems and ensure you understand what you're doing as well. She helps you inside and outside of class! She's the best!
4680,740959,1.0,5.0,She is horrible at teaching. I don't recommend taking this class unless for a major requirement or u have coding experience. Its a very time-consuming &amp; MENTALLY STRAINING class. would have dropped the class if I knew how hard it was going to be after2nd week New topics are just bombarded every week and there is no effort for material understanding
4681,740959,2.0,4.0,"No matter what the previous comment mention, she may be a nice person, but most take this class for the first time doing anything computer science related ever in life. Shes an awful teacher her teaching methods are probably one of the worst Ive ever seen in my lifeHalf the class leaves more confused than they did when they entered the room Awful"
4682,740959,5.0,2.0,"I had never taken a computer science course, and so I had no idea what to expect from this class. Although her lectures can be a bit dry, Professor Baish is extremely caring and does want her students to succeed! She is always available to help you with your code and makes you her top priority."
4683,740959,4.0,3.0,"Professor Baish is really the sweetest lady I've ever known. She is always accessible outside of class, and she really tries to keep her class upbeat and not drone on. She provides you with tips/code for lab before you go to lab, which really helps. I'm very glad I had her for my first CSCI class."
4684,740959,2.0,3.0,"I know she is a nice person, but to be honest she cannot teach very well."
4685,740959,4.0,4.0,"CSCI 203 is very difficult in general, especially if you are not a compsci major. Baish really cares about her students and spends hours trying to help them. If confused, the best thing would be to go in for office hours or TA hours. Odds are you can't figure anything out on your own...."
4686,740959,2.0,5.0,"Prof. Baish is very nice yet she has a hard time conveying information usefully so that it is applicable to what this class will be doing in the lab. Also, in general compsci 203 is impossible and I highly suggest not taking this class if it isn't necessary for your major or credit. The labs are impossible and take up to 10 hours to complete"
4687,740959,3.0,4.0,"Biash is a nice person but cannot teach very well. Her classes are hugely theoretical and her lectures almost always leave people puzzled. Her method of teaching does not work. Be prepared for a self-taught course. If someone asks a question, her explanation will leave the rest of the class suddenly confused. The class is hugely theoretical."
4688,740959,3.0,4.0,"Offered help, but could not explain concepts in a clear way. Her class was too theoretical."
4689,740959,4.5,3.0,"She is really approachable during office hours. She can help you through any problem, step by step, and eventually anyone can figure out how to solve the problems. She explains it pretty well in class, but she is definitely the epitome of a good one-on-one professor."
4690,740959,4.0,4.0,"OFFICE HOURS. That is where the real learning happens. The textbooks are AWESOME. Do the examples, go to office hours, do homework, and study. You will do fine. You can learn a lot of the material by just reading the book and doing examples. Their are loads of examples online too. Do them. If office hours are crowded, schedule an appointment."
4691,740959,1.5,2.0,"Baish would make a great kindergarten teacher- she treats all of us like we're five so when she asks questions no one answers because it's too demeaning.  Overall, she fails."
4692,740959,1.5,3.0,"wow... the whole class was totally lost. She wanted to help us, but she obscured everything. There was no motivation for her derivations, she couldn't write on the board worth crap, and her use of powerpoint was awful. If you have to take a class that requires theoretical explanation, don't take it with baish."
4693,740959,4.5,3.0,"never had advanced calc so class was somewhat challenging....very very helpful in office hours, tests were a little hard, but an entire day of studying got me around an 80"
4694,740959,4.5,3.0,She is the best teacher ever!  She makes the material a lot easier to understand.  The class is very interactive and passes by very quickly.  She is so helpful in office hours and is willing to take time out of her day to help her students.  She takes an interest in her students' personal lives as well.
4695,740959,4.5,3.0,"Not that hard of a class very helpful teacher, and decently easy tests."
4696,2588256,5.0,1.0,Professor Hill taught an amazing class. He made it super easy with little homework. The only bad thing was the lectures were sometimes boring. He's a really caring professor and it's easy to do extremely well in his class.
4697,740961,5.0,4.0,"Hard prof, and I found him to be intimidating at first. However, as the semester progressed I realized he is a good ass dude. Enjoyed his foundation class, but its alot of reading. Alot of the &quot;passage responses&quot;. Good guy tho good guy."
4698,740961,3.5,3.0,Believes students should teach themselves but class time is spent showing you how to do problems. Tests are difficult. Not a very fair grader so make sure he likes you and you will automatically get an A.
4699,1166946,5.0,3.0,He is geat
4700,1166946,5.0,2.0,Dr. Nega is great
4701,1166946,5.0,4.0,I have got nothing to say.
4702,1166946,5.0,1.0,"He amazing professor. I loved Economics because of him. He resourceful, knowledgeable and honest "
4703,1166946,1.0,5.0,"He is not Great professor, even he didn't understand the current world economy "
4704,1166946,5.0,1.0,"Very knowledgeable, positive and inspiring. "
4705,1166946,1.5,5.0,"Of all the courses I have taken, this was the most useless one. I don't think he is upto date with current economic realities. Also his accent was hard to understand "
4706,1166946,5.0,1.0,He is an expert in economic development and democracy. He knows the in-and-out of economics.
4707,1166946,1.5,3.0,"he knows a lot as an economist but not a good teacher! unorganized, doesnt use tech efficiently! rude and unhelpful! so much reading and he doesn't even talk about them in class! exam is long and he doesn't care giving you bad grade! very high expectations! "
4708,1166946,4.5,4.0,He is a great Professor makes the class very interesting. Very knowledgeable !! 
4709,1166946,1.0,5.0,It's very difficult to understand his English 
4710,1166946,1.0,4.0,"Rude, unhelpful, not understanding.  Does not explain, just talks louder and says the same thing at you."
4711,1166946,5.0,4.0,"Hands down best teacher at Bucknell. Very intelligent, very experienced, very fair.  Even if you don't think you would be interested in the course material, he will create a class environment that makes virtually anything interesting"
4712,1166946,5.0,2.0,he is great!
4713,1166946,4.5,2.0,A fair instructor.
4714,1166946,5.0,4.0,You just cant get better than Dr nega. He's Simply the best. And he has a great personality and went through a lot (you probably saw that he went to prison recently for allegedly disrupting peace in Ethiopia). Over all the greatest instructor everrrrrr.
4715,1166946,4.0,3.0,I really enjoyed his class. Sometimes he is hard to understand but generally his lectures are all very straightforward and you learn A LOT
4716,1166946,5.0,1.0,fair lecturing
4717,1166946,1.0,5.0,This accent makes him undecipherable. He is arrogant and mean.
4718,1166946,5.0,1.0,This class is like the Peace Corps- the toughest class you'll ever love. Fantastic experience. Can't wait to take another class with Dr. Nega!
4719,1166946,3.5,5.0,"He is a brilliant guy who has a wikipedia page about him, but he is a very hard teacher and his quizzes and exams are impossible."
4720,919139,5.0,1.0,"Er-dong is a real gem - he is so hilarious and friendly. He makes class so entertaining. I learned so much in his class, it was excellently structured, he gave great feedback, very understanding. 10/10 would recommend"
4721,919139,5.0,1.0,"Erdong is the greatest of all time.  The man cracks me up every time I'm in class.  I have zero dance experience and really loved taking Ballet 1 with him.  He is so much fun, and it was a great stress reliever!"
4722,919139,5.0,1.0,"Er Dong is an amazing dancer, choreographer, and mentor! He's hilarious and has a really great personality! Open up your snapchat, cause this guy's gonna make your story!"
4723,919139,5.0,1.0,"We love Er-dong. He's really fun, but makes you work hard. He's hilarious!!!!!"
4724,2588258,5.0,2.0,Super funny and nice and not too tough of a grader. The class is a lot of work and requires a lot of dedication but it's a great experience and 100% worth taking even if you're not in the management school.
4725,2588258,4.0,2.0,MGMT 101 is a time-intensive class but Professor Ng is really understanding and a funny guy. TAs teach the class and he just supervises. Overall no complaints.
4726,1113701,3.0,4.0,I needed this class for my lab credit so if needed for that I recommend to get it over with. However in terms of just another class do not take it its not worth your time. It is very difficult if you do not pay attention and read everything! As a professor he is super chill and funny though (be prepared for a lot of awful dad jokes though)!
4727,1113701,3.0,4.0,"honestly tough class, not an easy grade and there's a lot of work to do like readings, labs, weekly reading quizzes, 4 exams, a research poster etc. does give a lot of extra credit options, but definitely a lot of work. he's a rlly chill guy though and super accessible outside class if you're struggling, but is pretty vague during lecture sometimes"
4728,1113701,3.0,5.0,"This class was the hardest intro level I have taken with an insane amount of work. He is very flexible and helpful one on one so take advantage of that, but definitely not an easy A. Although he is very passionate, would not recommend if you do not like or don't care about geology. A good thing was only having to go to class once a week."
4729,1113701,1.0,4.0,"This is a warning please do not take Rob Jacob as a professor. He is a very nice guy, but be prepared to work really hard. He assigns the work of all my other classes combined. The lectures are very confusing and he expects a lot of his students. If you have a background in geology this class if for you, but this is not an easy A class."
4730,1113701,1.0,4.0,"Rob Jacob is not a good teacher. He both gives a tremendous amount of work in the class and expects a lot of outside of class hours work, but he also is incredibly unorganized, which makes the course and learning more difficult and frustrating. Definitely would not take him again, pretty horrible class experience. So much work and quizzes."
4731,1113701,1.0,3.0,"Rob is the most unorganized professors I've ever been forced to have. He basically spends the first week of class just fighting a war between geologists and engineers that no one ever started or asked for. Basically if theres a way to not have him DO IT. But if you have to, he's better at one-on-one interactions so take advantage of that."
4732,1113701,5.0,3.0,Professor Jacob is a wonderful professor. I really enjoyed his class. He is passionate about geology and is accessible for questions.
4733,1113701,1.0,5.0,Absurd amount of work that does not help your understanding of the class at all. Can never receive any help as he answers questions with more questions. If you're in his class get ready to spend many nights doing pointless work solely for his class. One of the most unfortunate classes I have ever been in.
4734,1113701,2.0,3.0,"Rob is a great guy and love him as a person. Doesn't teach very well but there are many opportunities to work with classmates and pass labs, group tests, etc. Tests are hard and doesn't prepare you very well. Quizzes everyday beginning class on long readings."
4735,1113701,3.0,4.0,"Rob is very laid back and has a tendency to get off topic a lot, but if you are willing to really listen to lectures, learn the material, and seek help the class can be an easy A/B. Lots of opportunities for extra credit. Keeps the content very interesting and takes you on awesome field trips during the lab period!"
4736,1113701,1.0,4.0,He isn't prepared for teaching us at all! He doesn't go over example questions before assigning similar homework questions; he totally screws up the last exam and the final by not getting the study guide online on time and keeps putting them off; he doesn't respect student's time by doing random chatting on class and doing nothing on review session
4737,1113701,5.0,3.0,"Rob was my advisor when I changed majors, and has taught two of my classes. I have TA'd for him and he's currently my thesis advisor. Rob is as dedicated to his students as anybody, and he's in the top tier of researchers in his field (geophysics). He's a great guy, clear in his lectures, and he'll always make time for you.  Give his classes a shot"
4738,1113701,4.5,2.0,"Great guy and good professor. Overall a very fun class. Lectures can get boring and are hard to take notes in but as long as you study handouts, worksheets, and lab material tests are cake. And you will learn. Highly suggest this proffessor!"
4739,1193576,1.5,5.0,"Worst professor I have ever had. She is extremely unclear, hard to understand, and not helpful. Even in office hours her teachings were unclear and hard to grasp. I would never recommend taking this class to anyone. Take another professor, trust me."
4740,1193576,1.5,5.0,"Very unclear and useless lectures, grading policy is stupid, and assignments are time consuming and harshly graded. Take this with anyone else, and only take her if you absolutely must for labor econ or econometrics."
4741,1193576,1.0,5.0,The only think this class has taught me is that I hate econ.
4742,1193576,2.0,4.0,"Worst professor I have had yet at Bucknell. Her office hours are extremely unhelpful, I often left more confused and insulted after her explanation. Specific students are called upon regularly to confirm their understanding, but in a way that nobody ask questions for fear of looking stupid. I personally recommend avoiding this professor"
4743,1193576,1.5,4.0,The least helpful professor I have had. Felt very uncomfortable going to ask for additional explanations as she somewhat took shots at my confidence with incorrect answers.  Class is really dry. Midterm class average was extremely low.. for a reason. I do not recommend.
4744,1193576,2.5,5.0,Don't take this class
4745,1193576,2.5,4.0,"Kazi is one of those professors who thinks that her class is the only class her students are taking. She assigns unreasonable amounts of work at the last minute. Assignments due almost every class. Also never shows up on time when scheduled to meet or will blow off a meeting completely without warning. Overall, very inconsiderate and unreasonable."
4746,1193576,4.0,3.0,The class is not an easy A but if you work hard it is not hard to achieve that. The class is very structured with very clear and specific notes for all the material that makes it easy to understand. She is EXTREMELY helpful in office hours so you should definitely take advantage of that. Tests are easier than problem sets in class.
4747,1193576,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I had in college. Considered a class average of 75 on the midterm &quot;good.&quot; Had 5 of 20 students failing by the end of the semester. During finals, impossible to contact. Didn't reply to emails, skipped her office hours (with a line of students waiting outside). Didn't return assignments before the final, but tested on the material."
4748,1193576,4.0,2.0,Professor Kazi is amazing and you should really take her for econ256. go to her office hours. she is very helpful. the tests are directly from the notes. Accent takes like 3 classes to understand TAKE KAZI
4749,1193576,3.5,3.0,This class was not as easy as I thought it would be. TA sessions were really helpful in terms of trying to understand the material and exams. She was very helpful to those who were having a hard time. Reading the book was not necessary if you pay attention in class. Go to office hours.
4750,1193576,2.0,2.0,"Overall decent teacher. Do the work and you will receive a good grade. If you are not an econ or management major, this course is not recommended and she will tell you that. Go to class and pay attention and the tests are very easy."
4751,1193576,4.0,1.0,She's a great teacher. The exams are easy. You don't have to read books if you listen carefully in class.
4752,1193576,1.5,3.0,"Extremely difficult to understand, and frankly not terribly interested in assisting students struggling with the material. If you are comfortable learning from the textbook, the class is doable. But for those seeking to actually learn from their Prof. take another."
4753,1193576,2.0,5.0,"Overall, I would not recommend Kazi.  She's hard to understand, and, frankly, she's not very nice to students seeking help.  But when you ask for help from her-if you ask during her office hours-she'll help you. If you arrive outside office hours, and she'll send you away, which I found rude. I fought for my A in this class."
4754,1193576,1.5,5.0,Extremely hard to understand. Material goes from middle school algebra to extremely hard microeconomics. I felt like an idiot the entire time. Very harsh grader. classes are boring. AVOID TAKING CLASSES WITH THIS PROFESSOR. did nothing to help me. office hours change constantly. will span your email. hard exams. all practice assignments graded
4755,1193576,2.5,4.0,"Very difficult to pay attention to her lectures, the material she teaches is never clear and it rarely relates to current events. Didn't learn much in the class."
4756,1193576,4.5,4.0,"Great person and professor. Provides fill-in the blank handouts. If you show up to class, take notes(aka copy what she is writing on the projector) and study somewhat, you will do well. She is always available for outside help. If you're having trouble with the homework, attend the TA sessions, they give away the answers."
4757,1193576,2.0,5.0,"Very poor professor, not clear in class, doesn't teach well. Felt very unprepared for exams."
4758,1193576,3.0,3.0,"Kazi is a mysterious mixture of the qualities which define a great professor and a poor one.  She is willing to work with you if you're having a problem in her class, but if you can't understand the way she is explaining material, don't bother asking.  Sometimes her wording (in class AND on TESTS) is incomprehensible."
4759,1193576,2.5,5.0,"The students below speak for maybe 10% of the class.  She was the most unclear professor I have ever witnessed. The classes were extremely boring and unhelpful, might as well spend class time reading the textbook. The problem sets she gave out were easy in the beginning, but by the end everyone was copying one another. Avoid this professor."
4760,1193576,3.5,4.0,She is a very nice professor and definitely knows her stuff.  She offers plenty of extra help.  Sometimes she is not very clear.
4761,1193576,3.0,3.0,"Brilliant professor, she really knows her stuff. But had trouble teaching it to students in class.  Final was on stuff that was not taught to us and that the practice problems didn't cover."
4762,1193576,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic professor. She e-mails you the notes, so all you have to do is listen in class. She organizes the material really well and if you participate in class she'll try to give you an A. Tests are fine as long as you read the chapters and do a couple practice problems."
4763,740968,5.0,3.0,He's really passionate about geotech. Took him in 2006 while he was still an assistant professor. I don't know if  his teaching style has changed at all since then. His class was very organized and he taught the subject matter clearly.
4764,740968,5.0,2.0,Great professor.  Class is entertaining.  He will work with people on deadlines and cares about the subject and his students.  Highly recommended but his courses are not push overs.
4765,2588266,4.0,3.0,"Super chill and funny. I took his foundation seminar on punk rock, and it was one of the most interesting classes I've ever taken. We didn't talk about the readings that much, but it's important to listen to all the playlists he assigns. The workload is definitely bearable and he's a very fair grader."
4766,2588266,4.0,1.0,"Professor Groff is a very funny man but his lectures can be boring. The class is super easy and he gives students a study guide almost identical to the test. If you pay the slightest bit of attention, you will get an A. Learned a lot of interesting topics in his class."
4767,740972,5.0,3.0,Absolutely a great Professor all around
4768,740972,3.0,4.0,"Buonopane is a pretty good teacher, but not a nice or forgiving person. He sometimes skips steps that he views as elementary but are not so when you're first learning a subject. He also suffers a bit from not being able to explain things simply because he knows them too well. Home works will seem torturous. Do not skip class or use your phone."
4769,740972,4.5,3.0,"Although he may seem intimidating at first, Buonopane is a fantastic professor.  There is never any question about what you need to know for tests as he outlines everything beforehand.  Workload is the same as any other engineering class, and it's definitely doable.  He really explains things and structures (pun intended) his class to perfection"
4770,740972,5.0,4.0,he is the best prof. I ever had!!!!! very helpful and very well experienced!
4771,740972,3.0,3.0,He and Ziemian are the 2 best civil engineering professors at Bucknell.  He's an awesome teacher!
4772,740972,4.0,4.0,No Comments
4773,2412136,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Saucier is probably going to be a hit or miss for most students. His classes are intentionally unstructured, with him preferring students to guide the class discussions or lectures by asking questions or providing commentary of their own. Class consists of a lot of close, analytical reading - but from my experience, has no exams or projects."
4774,2412136,5.0,3.0,"I've taken three classes with Khalil. His classes are all great and make you challenge everything from the police system to bananas. May be a bit intimidating at first, but he's a chill professor who genuinely cares more about what you learn than the grade you get."
4775,2412136,1.0,4.0,"I feel more qualified to teach this class than he is. This man exhibits some of the pettiest behavior I've ever seen from a so called &quot;professional&quot; in my life. Good luck to you should you be Black, have an ounce of critical thinking skills, and find yourself stuck in a room with this man."
4776,2412136,5.0,2.0,This class was so eye opening. I would recommend taking it.
4777,2412136,1.0,3.0,Here's the tea: Saucier's placement as the Africana Studies dept head was super controversial. Afst280 is a super interesting class - the materials are must reads! But his lectures and teaching style were at best shaky (or nonexistent). Definitely take the class but avoid this professor; the controversy is there for a reason.
4778,2412136,4.0,3.0,"Prof saucier sometimes gets a bad rep from those who havent taken his class but is so knowledgeable and really does care about Africana studies. Can be a little intimidating at first because the material is so complex, but if you take a class with him it will change your whole perspective. Just participate and show that you care and youll be good"
4779,1678958,5.0,4.0,I came into this class knowing next to nothing about language development. I left feeling like I had learned a great deal about both language development and several other areas of psychology related to it. Professor Mitchel is an amazing professor and his class/teaching has sparked my interest in language development. 
4780,1678958,5.0,4.0,"I loved coming to this class. He's one of my favorite professors. Knows a ton and was always happy to help. I didn't do as well as I wanted to, but he gave chances for extra credit and to make up the exam which was helpful. "
4781,1678958,3.0,3.0,"He is a good professor and cares about his students. He is chill and his lectures are interesting, but he is a tough grader. The tests can be hard if assigned even though they are open note. You do have to work to do well in this class."
4782,1678958,3.0,3.0,"For the foundation seminar I never read and was fine, but I'm pretty sure he knew I didn't read. As long as you participate he's nice. GET ON HIS GOOD SIDE. Lots of papers, but no tests which is really nice. "
4783,1678958,5.0,4.0,"I really like the content and the professor. I don't like that it's online, and the video lectures can get boring. But in a normal semester I would definitely recommend this class. Mitchel goes out of his way to help us."
4784,1678958,3.0,4.0,"This class is super easy because you barley go to class. However, tests are hard and need to be studied for seriously. The professor is great, but talks slow and is a heavy lecturer."
4785,1678958,3.0,4.0,"More work than any class I've taken at Bucknell. He assigns so much, makes you zoom 3 times a week and on the days you don't have class, hour long prerecorded lectures and assignments. Many students have told him they are overwhelmed by the amount of work and he said it was their fault for not managing their time better. Nice, but no."
4786,1678958,4.0,4.0,"I've come to really respect Prof M. He has high expectations and assigns a lot of work (I took this as a summer class and put 5-6 hours a day into it), but as long as you take notes, ask questions, and study, you'll do fine. Tests are fair but you NEED to study. Very interesting class with engaging and interactive lectures."
4787,1678958,3.0,5.0,this was definitely a hard class. Mitchel has high expectations for his students.
4788,1678958,3.0,4.0,"He covers so much information in each class period that if you miss class, you will fall behind quickly. His tests have material that you wouldn't expect, and he is a tough grader. You must put in extra effort to get a decent grade. I did not, and although I did all the readings and prepared, I did not get the final grade I expected."
4789,1678958,4.0,4.0,"Really interesting class. I looked forward to the class everyday because it is such a cool subject. However, he covers so much information in each class period and he is a really tough grader. Must see him in office hours. I put in so much effort in this class and felt like i deserved a higher grade but i learned a ton in the class."
4790,1678958,4.5,3.0,"Mitchel is a cool and funny guy. You can't get an A without studying, but  if you put in a fair amount of work you should be fine. He's definitely super interesting and I genuinely enjoy going to class everyday. Great class, would recommend"
4791,1678958,5.0,4.0,"Grades tough on papers, but gives you the option for revision which is helpful. I enjoyed his lectures, because there were lots of illusions and demonstrations--great way to make the material interesting.  Excellent class would recommend it to everyone."
4792,1678958,4.5,1.0,Easy. Listen to the lectures and study them to do well. Tests are fair.
4793,1678958,3.5,2.0,"He is fair, but the TA I had was a harsh grader. The material is easy and the exams are predictable, but it is just a lot of memorizing. He is an entertaining teacher sometimes. Not a time consuming class."
4794,2268783,5.0,4.0,Kristen is by far one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell. I had her for physics lab. She was very dedicated and knew what she was talking about. She explained things in a way that was easy to understand. Would definitely take a class with her again and would recommend her to anyone
4795,2184810,5.0,2.0,"Honestly, if you can take a class with Joe you should. Bucknell has no shortage of great creative writing professors, but he's one of the very best. Really willing to listen and hear you out no matter what. I promise, if you're worried about your writing being weird, you're alright showing it to Joe. Also, read his stuff if you get a chance. 10/10."
4796,2184810,5.0,4.0,"Professor Scapellato is the best teacher I've had by a long shot. This dude is the real deal, brilliant, kind, approachable, reasonable, everything. Best teacher at Bucknell, total boss."
4797,2184810,5.0,3.0,"Professor Scapellato is a great teacher and a great guy. If you can take a class with him, do it, the man is one of the best professors around."
4798,2184810,5.0,4.0,"This professor was very in tune and passionate about what he taught. He provided great feedback on all papers I turned in. I am talking paragraphs worth. This was a freshman class.  So, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who interested in writing , especially if you are leaning towards one of the English majors offered at Bucknell."
4799,2184810,5.0,3.0,"Joe is the reason that I became a Creative Writing major. He's hilarious, down to earth, and an extremely talented writer. I really adore him both as a teacher and mentor. He's a great lecturer, and gives amazing feedback on creative work. If you have the opportunity to take his class, DO IT!"
4800,1871473,5.0,2.0,"Professor Chen is super interesting. There are not a lot of assignments, and if you turn in the work, you should have no problem getting an A."
4801,1871473,5.0,4.0,"Professor Chen is an educator who's truly passionate about his subject. His classes are mostly lectures, but he frequently uses visual aids to help demonstrate key facts and figures. The lectures are key to supplementing your homework readings, which are fairly short (20 pages or less). Take notes and you'll be fine."
4802,1871473,5.0,3.0,"Read about 20 pages per class, listen in class is totally helpful because he is really passionate and clear in the information. Test are straight and individual based answer, no right and wrong. Absolutely will take again if have a chance."
4803,1871473,3.0,4.0,"Has very tough accent and has students read a ridiculous amount for a foundation class. When something doesn't work because the whole class has a mac, he expects the class to figure it out and that it is not his problem. Can be a little unreasonable with grading and if he doesn't like you watch out."
4804,1871473,5.0,4.0,"I would recommend taking his class only if you actually have enthusiasm for Asian History; not the course to take if you are just trying to fulfill a requirement. He loves and encourages participation, and his lectures are amazing if you are engaged. I read more in this class than in all my other courses combined, and reading is essential."
4805,1871473,3.0,3.0,Professor Chen is a confusing being. I have him for East Asian Civilization and the only grade we've received back so far was our midterms. The only other work is bringing in news articles and writing reading memos (these take awhile) and he never tells you the grade even if you approach him. You can do just about nothing in class though.
4806,1871473,4.0,3.0,"Lots of reading geared towards discussion in class. He lectures for a few minutes, and of course, he'll sometimes lecture for more than he originally wanted to, but then he turns it over to the students to build the discussion off the readings. Use readings in essays and discussion and you'll do great. 2-3 mini-presentations on current events."
4807,2713196,2.0,3.0,"Lecture every class. Only graded on tests, quizzes, and a project. The tests stem from in class notes which he writes on the board or says. Must take good notes to do well. Reading from the textbook every night. Very smart guy. He will help you if you go to him. He is a little standoffish. Worked hard every class and didn't do well."
4808,495230,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors at Bucknell hands down. It's clear he wants you to succeed, and if you put in the effort and pay attention in class, you will."
4809,495230,4.0,3.0,"Yes, he does write only on the board for lectures. Plenty of practice materials (old exams + their keys) for exams, which are weighted heavily. Helpful with homework questions. Relatively straightfoward to succeed in, and teaches key concepts very well."
4810,495230,5.0,3.0,"Magee mostly lectures, but he does not give any homework besides the problem sets, which are easy especially if you get help from the TA. His lectures can be interesting, he tries to involve the class. I actually learned a lot from his class and really liked him."
4811,495230,5.0,3.0,"Professor Magee is probably one of the best Econ professors in the department. He focused more on the main ideas rather than the specific terms which really helped me actually learn the information. If you studied even a little bit you would do well on his tests, and he really prepares you with a lot of practice tests. Overall, great professor."
4812,495230,4.0,3.0,I really like professor Magee. His focus is econ but he taught my foundation seminar. He presented himself well and did a good job of covering the material. I probably will not take his class again just because I hope to never take an econ class but if he taught something else I found interesting I would probably take his class.
4813,495230,4.0,1.0,"Easy professor, straight-forward tests but lectures can get pretty dry."
4814,495230,4.0,1.0,Professor Magee is a great professor. He taught my foundation seminar and did a great job getting everyone to participate. He really helped me adjust in my first year of college.
4815,495230,3.0,4.0,good economics prof but shouldnt be teaching an intro level class. Assumes too much of a base knowledge and isn't great about presenting material in a relatable way. 3 exams including the final but combined they are worth 80% of your grade. If you've taken econ in high school it shouldn't be terrible however if you havent i wouldnt recommend Magee
4816,495230,3.0,3.0,I had high expectations based on other reviews and was dissappointed. He is reasobale grader not exceptionally hard except you need to do well on the tests since there are only 2 and a final. The big problem is he is COMPLETELY monotone for lecture and writes on the board instead of using power point. Really hard to pay attention and stay interest
4817,495230,3.5,4.0,"Solid professor. Tests are very comprehensive and long, yet straightforward if you've studied. Teaches material well, overall. Office hours are key."
4818,495230,4.5,3.0,"Tests are hard, but he is a very nice and helpful professor make sure to go to office hours and you will do fine."
4819,495230,5.0,5.0,"Really nice guy, always willing to meet for help. Boring lectures but his teaching patterns are organized, clear and helpful. He's a very likable guy. Fair warning, his tests are HARD. You wouldn't expect it, but they are very tricky."
4820,495230,5.0,2.0,Great Professor. Not going to lie...his class is extremely boring and he's a bit monotone but he tells you everything you need to know. Literally if you read the notes you will have the information you need for do well. Do the problem sets and you should be good. Exams are kinda tough but hes really helpful if you do badly on them. Hes a great guy.
4821,495230,4.0,4.0,His econmetrics class was very boring but that has more to do with the subject matter than with him. The material was difficult but he teaches you everything you need to know and he helps you outside of class. There is a year long paper but otherwise not much work.
4822,495230,4.0,1.0,"Professor Magee is a very nice and helpful teacher. His tests can be a bit tough but he gives you sample tests to prepare for them. His lectures can be monotonous, though."
4823,495230,5.0,2.0,"love love LOVE him. such a nice guy. tests are tough, but if you do poorly on a test and do well on the exam he will drop a test grade.  tests are very similar to the problem sets, so he prepares you. lectures are a little boring, but really important to attend. didnt really read the textbook at all. highly recommend going to office hours"
4824,495230,5.0,3.0,"Damn good professor. His test are not easy but fair. He gives you everything you need to know for the test in class. Go to class, take notes, pay attention, and you'll get an A. Hes a damn nice guy too."
4825,495230,5.0,2.0,"SUCH A GREAT TEACHER! Take ECON 101 with him! He is super helpful and if you take notes during class, do all the problem sets, and read the text book before the tests if you need to, you'll get an A. I would definitely recommend him!"
4826,495230,5.0,2.0,such a nice guy- very straight to the point and clear. although the class is a little boring at times- he is a great guy and really helpful
4827,495230,5.0,3.0,He is the nicest guy.  He is willing to help you always.  Everything you need to know you get from the class notes.
4828,495230,4.5,3.0,"Really nice guy.  Very helpful, and clear notes.  Homework isn't hard if you pay attention in class.  Tests aren't bad as long as you are prepared."
4829,495230,5.0,5.0,No Comments
4830,495230,5.0,3.0,"I agree, great guy - very smart. his lectures are clear and helpful, but the tests can be really hard."
4831,495230,5.0,1.0,"The easiest Econ 103 professor.  Class can get a little boring, but he is really clear at explaining things.  If you study the practice tests and your notes, the tests are easy."
4832,495230,5.0,2.0,Great Guy. Explains things clearing and is very willing to helo you out. Work load isn't bad and tests are fair.
4833,2588287,5.0,1.0,"Professor Gregory is an awesome professor. My entire class consisted of engineers, but she was able to keep us all engaged every class. Her lectures and readings are very interesting, and she doesn't push any of her opinions on you (but asks that in return you are respectful)."
4834,1721986,5.0,4.0,Professor Higbie is an absolute genius. He is very careful when explaining things to make sure what he says is exactly correct. He knows a ton about programming in Python and always makes helpful simulations to show in class. Highly recommend this professor.
4835,1721986,5.0,4.0,Great guy. Knows his stuff.
4836,2244226,5.0,4.0,"Knows what she's talking about, which is obvious she has a PhD. She teaches things in a unique way, which is super engaging, but if you are student not open to new things you will not do well. Adapt or don't complain is what I would say if you have her."
4837,2244226,5.0,3.0,"She truly cares about her students if you do not go to class or if you are on your phone she will notice and you most likely will do poorly as a result. Fairly easy professor if you pay attention and are engaged. I cannot stress how nice she is, truly one of my favorite professors"
4838,2244226,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! Very few lectures and very engaging. I don't know any professor who cares more about their students than Dr. Miskioglu. If you're stuck only being able to learn with traditional learning styles than you won't like her, but the methods she employs are a much more enjoyable way to learn that allows us to explore what interests us."
4839,2244226,2.0,4.0,Teaches problems only one way and does not know any other way and has a hard time explaining things outside what she writes on the board. May not be able to answer questions because she does not know the answer herself. Wastes time in class and does not give enough information in class to answer homework problems. Better off using the book
4840,2244226,4.0,3.0,"Elif is a gem. Although we have 5 exams a semester, this is good because they were tested on a small proportion of things. She is always willing to answer questions, especially if you stop by after class or go to her office hours."
4841,2244226,1.0,4.0,Awful. Does not quiz on material from class. If you go to her for help she cannot help without looking it up. She tells you to get help from the book not her. Shes unfair in grading quizs. She wastes time in class and never finishes notes or examples. Cancelled class 3 days in a row and still gave a quiz.
4842,1488515,2.0,1.0,"Good guy, a little unclear.  Pretty easy."
4843,493189,5.0,4.0,"Tammy is the kindest woman you will ever meet. She is genuinely invested in every student's success. The course is definitely a lot of work, and she expects a high level of commitment from you, but it's so worth it. Every student at Bucknell should take MGMT 101!!! Tammy is a true light, inspiration, and an amazing professor."
4844,493189,5.0,3.0,"I went on the Cape Town trip and couldn't be happier. Professor Hiller is a woman everyone can look up to and aspire to be like. If you put in the work, she will ensue that you get a lot out of it."
4845,493189,5.0,3.0,Great foundations class! Learned so much and the work didn't feel like much work at all. She really cares about you doing well and passing.
4846,493189,4.5,3.0,"Favorite professor. Respected by the students, she truly cares about what she is teaching. There for you academically and personally. Great woman"
4847,493189,4.5,3.0,She really cares about her students and is so helpful if you reach out!
4848,493189,4.5,3.0,"Shes nice, class is a little annoying though."
4849,493189,4.0,2.0,Great professor! This has been my favorite class at Bucknell. She is definitely one of the better professors for this course.
4850,493189,5.0,3.0,"Loved the class.  Want to take it again.  Great Professor, very helpful"
4851,493189,4.0,4.0,"Quite possibly the nicest lady I've ever met.  Very friendly and helpful.  Her class is inherently challenging and time consuming, but she definitely helps you through it."
4852,493189,3.0,4.0,Not bad but definitely likes to hear herself!
4853,493189,2.5,3.0,Intersting real-life class. That ought to find a proferssor though that has worked in the real world!
4854,493189,5.0,3.0,"She talks a lot, but if you pay attention you'll realize that it's all very useful information.  She's VERY big on helping students and addressing their questions and concerns.  She's very approachable.  Just stay on top of your work, and definitely take 101 with her. Best class ever."
4855,493189,4.5,3.0,"Tammy is a great asset to the management department.  While her sections of MGMT 101 tend to be harder than those of Ciavarella, she is very smart, nice, and approachable.  I had to work my butt off, but I did pull off an A- (and no, I was not an exec).  I would definitely recommend this class.  It was a lot of work, yet it was a crap ton of fun."
4856,493189,5.0,2.0,"so nice, really eager to help and wants everyone to succeed"
4857,493189,5.0,2.0,my favorite teacher here so far.  sooo helpful and nice.  she really wants you to do well and has a sense of humor.
4858,583304,2.0,1.0,"For Baby Bio incredibly easy class, knows we did not care about bio. The real drawback was that the weekly quizzes were occasionally difficult, and he's kind of a douche. Very smart though."
4859,583304,2.0,3.0,"He was fine for lab science req. He knows that students in baby bio do not actually care about bio, but the in class weekly quizzes are still hard. The weekly online reading quizzes are usually fine and u can google everything, but once in a while will be very hard- and questions are usually different than your classmates."
4860,583304,2.0,3.0,"3 quizzes/week - lab quiz/reading quiz are easy, In class quizzes are difficult. claims he says every answer to every question before we start... maybe he does but 90% of us don't retain it. no tests or final. Meeting with him is useless and he ignores emails. Overall fine class for lab requirement just annoying not an easy A like he says it is"
4861,583304,1.0,5.0,"I have the &quot;pleasure&quot; of being in Professor Spiro's Biology for Non-Majors class. The first day, he came out swinging by screaming at and insulting a student in front of 100+ students for removing his mask to take a drink of water. He purposefully doesn't answer emails which is beyond frustrating. Would give a 0 if I could."
4862,583304,2.0,4.0,Interesting class discussions which is the only positive. He's a really tough grader and does NOT make it clear what he wants in your essays. Spiro can also be condescending and makes students feel nervous to participate in class. Tons of reading and essays... going to avoid him in the future.
4863,583304,2.0,4.0,Prof. Spiro is mediocre at best. He rarely answers his emails and the quizzes are almost impossible to get a good grade since he holds his students to insane expectations. He constantly makes condescending remarks towards students during lectures which makes everyone uncomfortable. Take this course with any other professor!!!
4864,583304,3.0,5.0,Spiro was not a good lecturer and is not a kind person. Avoid him at all costs.
4865,583304,1.0,5.0,"Professor Spiro is one of the most difficult educators I have ever encountered. He holds his students to unrealistic standards and is VERY picky with grading. You will never get full points unless you can read his mind. Unclear or little feedback given. Heavy focus on exams, lectures, and dense textbook readings. Take anyone else."
4866,583304,5.0,4.0,"I am currently taking his Organismal Biology class and I loveeeee it! Professor Spiro makes the class sooo interesting. He is so passionate about his teaching, but please make sure to do the reading and though question before coming to class, otherwise you are going to hate this class like the people who commented below. Go to office hoursss!!!!"
4867,583304,1.0,1.0,"Professor Mark Spiro is a horrible educator. He is so judgmental and ignorant and does not care about his students at all. Spiro has absolutely no compassion to student's history and how to help them. He grades based on favoritism, not on the actual work."
4868,583304,1.0,4.0,"He often made condescending remarks to students for asking questions or needing clarification. There was general uneasiness in class discussion. He graded papers harshly, leaving very rude comments or belittling you. He changed our exam from a take-home (which was listed on the syllabus) to an in-class exam the WEEK before we had to take it."
4869,583304,3.0,5.0,"Definitely very knowledgable but often extremely rude to students (would act like you were stupid if you asked questions). Thought questions will help you for the tests but he is an extremely picky grader. I felt like no matter how much work I put in or how often I went to see him, my exam grades stayed the same. The final and lab saved my grade."
4870,583304,2.0,5.0,"Engaging Lecturer. Knowledgable about subject. Will skim over important things you should memorize. Thought Questions tell what's on exams. Picky grader on test answer questions. Appears impersonal, can be rude at times, often forgets names. Must read before class and review notes/slides/books after. Graded clicker quizzes daily (90/1000 of grade)"
4871,583304,2.0,4.0,"Sprio was not helpful at all. He created an atmosphere of fear in lab, and did not make asking questions desirable. Any answers to questions were very condescending and he did not provide adequate feedback on lab reports to improve on the next one. Bio lab with Spiro was my absolute least favorite part of my week. Take 206L with anyone else"
4872,583304,3.0,4.0,"Prof Spiro is very kind and understanding you are transparent with your issues about the material. Difficult, but manageable professor. You CANNOT miss a class!"
4873,583304,1.0,5.0,"Tough grader that has little leeway on grade, Spiro is very helpful when you show effort however if he doesn't like you, he will ask you to drop his class."
4874,583304,1.0,4.0,Spiro is one of the worst professors that I've had at Bucknell. He is so rude to his students and micromanages every single thing we do. He acts as if the class you are taking with him is the only class that you have all semester and loads on the readings. Do not take a class with him unless you want to suffer for a C.
4875,583304,2.0,4.0,"He cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. He is just a bad teacher. He won't give you a good grade unless you do everything perfect and to a T. If you are a mind reader, then by all means take his class. He is absolutely brutal at helping students because he is so unclear and boring. I would not recommend him ever."
4876,583304,1.0,4.0,Prof Spiro is very intelligent but he doesn't know how to relay his knowledge to students. He is one of the most boring teachers on campus and does not reason with students in order to help them in class. He belittles his students to make them feel stupid. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES
4877,583304,2.0,5.0,If you are a robot then Spiro is for you. Tests are mostly short answer/essay type. If you don't use the specific terms he requires even if you know the concepts you're going to lose points. Lectures are very fast paced and slides have little terminology. He speaks very unclearly and often messes up concepts or gets things backwards. Try to switch.
4878,583304,2.5,3.0,"He stumbles over his words a lot, lectures are kind of disorganized and he definitely likes plants more than animals. Kind of condescending towards students, especially in lab.  Tests are okay, just do the thought questions. Not the best but not the worst."
4879,583304,2.5,3.0,"I had Spiro for 206 Lab and he was clear in the material and not a tough grader. He can be pretty fun and joke around sometimes. However, he doesn't have an endless supply of patience, he was rude to students on several occasions when they had made simple errors, such as mounting slides. In this manner he was highly unproffessional and unhelpful."
4880,583304,5.0,2.0,"Spiro is a great professor. He's very engaged in the things he teaches and he makes things easy to process. He basically gives answers to the test with Thought Questions each week and he answers each one like 10 times in class. To keep up, read ahead and answer the TQ's and tests will be no problem, but learn to pace yourself because they are long."
4881,583304,5.0,2.0,"Was very enthusiastic about the material. Lots of detailed material was covered, but he let you bring cheat sheets to exams so you could focus on concepts not details. If you work hard you will do well. The material was interesting."
4882,583304,3.0,3.0,"Spiro's personality is alright, but his lectures never seemed to reflect what was on his tests. He assigned these ridiculous essays that took up a lot of time that could have been used for studying. Very picky on essays due in class and on tests as well. Overall, this was a rather frustrating class."
4883,583304,4.0,4.0,"Definitely cares about the students and challenged us in 206. Essays are tedious, quizzes and tests consists of easy questions that he is relatively picky on. On the bright side, he's a nice guy in person; I learned a lot and became a better writer in the process."
4884,583304,5.0,3.0,"He was a great professor.  he graded very tough, but made me a better student.  wish i thanked him before I graduated."
4885,583304,4.0,4.0,"Happy and up-beat guy. Knows his stuff, and has many office hours, so outside help is great. His only downside is that he assigns a ton of homework."
4886,583304,2.0,4.0,He is the most frustrating teacher ever. He makes you write stupid journal entries for every chapter you read and grades them ridiculously. his quizzes and tests aren't very hard but you will lose half the points in your grade off of your journals. do not take him. he is rude and pretentious and unfair.
4887,583304,5.0,2.0,"He's the best professor I've had at Bucknell. Great guy, learn a lot, and if you do any reading of the book his class is not tough."
4888,583304,4.5,2.0,Always smiling. Will only know your name if you go to his office hours because the class is big. Very helpful in office hours because he makes things extra clear. Tries to keep class entertaining by including jokes in his lectures and powerpoints. Quizzes once a week that help students keep up with material. Definitely recommended
4889,583304,5.0,3.0,Professor Spiro is a great professor-- his plant growth and development class helped me have the know-how to bring plants into my classroom when I became a teacher.  He's a great professor.
4890,583304,5.0,1.0,A real great guy whose lectures aren't boring at all. He knows his stuff.  His exams were pretty easy too.  Recommended.
4891,583304,4.0,3.0,"He was hillarious, yet also knew what he was talking about. For a biology teacher, he was interesting. His tests had a lot of multiple choice questions, and his final was very easy."
4892,583304,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Spiro is one of the most involved professors in the bio department. The man is a genius and enjoys teaching. He is always willing to help out after class if you need it. If the class doesn't participate or don't pay attention, he has a hard time getting things through clearly. I would take many more of his classes."
4893,583304,2.0,4.0,"Professor Spiro is very difficult to keep up with in class. While he is very knowledgable, he's not good at conveying it. He talks too fast to write down everything he is saying, and essay question grading is RIDICULOUS. I almost quit my major for this professor. There are worse profs, but I personally would never take another class with him."
4894,583304,3.0,4.0,very hard class for me.  Extremely picky at essay questions and expects a lot out of you.
4895,583304,4.0,3.0,No Comments
4896,583304,4.5,3.0,"Definitely knows his material and is an energetic lecturer.  Very approachable, nice man, willing to offer help in class or during office hours. Tests are fair, but he's a picky grader. Expects  100% participation/dedication of students."
4897,1463952,4.0,2.0,"Professor Bakst was a great professor, rip professor"
4898,1463952,5.0,1.0,"Had him for a summer class- very easy, very nice.  Tries to keep the class entertained but its hard with the material.  Books are interesting.  Very helpful with writing and got me to become a better writer"
4899,1463952,4.0,1.0,"Bakst is always willing to help and is very friendly.. do not hesitate to go to him. As long as you do your work, show up to class, and participate, you will get a good grade. Very fair grader and not a big workload. Highly recommend."
4900,1463952,5.0,3.0,"Terrific way to start at Bucknell. Very interesting subject, human experience, and I improved my writing a lot."
4901,1463952,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Bakst is a great professor. My foundation seminar with him was about certain philosophies on good vs. evil, free will, personhood, and many more. He really values class participation and truly wants his students to succeed. I love going to class and the discussions we have. He is always eager to help you with any questions you have"
4902,1463952,4.0,1.0,Very easy grader
4903,1478293,5.0,3.0,"Genuinely the best Professor I've ever had. Seth is smart, clever, and a great professor overall."
4904,1478293,5.0,4.0,"Great guy.  Orsborn's classes are probably the most interactive and interesting I've ever had at Bucknell.  He doesn't emphasize memorization of trivial facts.  Rather, he tries to teach you real world lessons in a hands on way.  If you're looking for a fun spin on a traditional marketing class, take Orsborn."
4905,2533013,2.0,1.0,"Prof. Snyder is VERY involved in his student's lives, to the point where it is almost weird. He didn't teach us anything about the class, but rather assigned busy work like readings and essays. When you answer one of his questions he'll sit there in uncomfortable silence for 2 minutes before saying anything, and will call you out for missing class."
4906,2533013,5.0,3.0,"Prof Snyder a fun professor. He encouraged me to entertain other perspectives, which wasn't easy to do given my strong opinions. The class wasn't easy but is enjoyable, and his passion for the subject made it interesting. You can tell he genuinely cares about his students and his blue and orange outfits will never fail to disappoint."
4907,50842,4.5,4.0,"He's really interested in what he is teaching, and it shows. He was also my ANBE advisor, and was very helpful every time I went to him for help and advice. The material he teaches is difficult, but he is an excellent professor!"
4908,50842,5.0,4.0,"Dearborn is a great professor! He is demanding, but it is a 300-level bio course so it's appropriate. Study and go to class and you just may enjoy yourself."
4909,50842,1.0,5.0,He is garbage and so is his class.  Terrible professor who demands a ton from nothing.  Do not take any classes with him no matter what.  Its better to wait and take the course a year later with another professor then to suffer a semester with this devil.
4910,50842,1.0,5.0,AVOID!!! Look at other comments to confirm.
4911,50842,1.0,5.0,"This guy is worthless, not only is he hard as hell, he is an incompetent professor.  Do not take any of his classes"
4912,50842,3.5,5.0,"Really hard compared to others. Exams do not test knowledge learned.If you want to do well, you will need to spend many nights with your text and time in office hours. Extremely laid back professor which is deceiving because he expects a lot out of his students. Grade is only made up of exams and a few quizzes. No curving, no extra credit.Avoid."
4913,50842,4.0,5.0,"Really cool guy, knows the material from the book really well. He's very approachable outside of class and is always willing to help. He's the hardest genetics teacher of all of them however. You'll either do really well or really poorly, do the problem sets and read the book."
4914,50842,3.5,5.0,"You'll either do extremely well or extremely poorly in genetics. He's harder than other teachers but he's a really cool fun guy and is easy to catch outside of class, he DOES know the book very well even if he has some trouble rephrasing the material to explain things. READ THE BOOK and do the problem sets."
4915,50842,4.0,3.0,great teacher and a really nice guy. always willing to help.
4916,50842,4.0,3.0,"He's very funny, and is the easiest genetics professor, but often doesn't have answers to students' simple questions. His tests aren't that bad, and he doesn't check to see if you have done the problem sets (but do them because tests are based largely off of them!) He encourages class participation, but only test and quiz scores affect your grade."
4917,50842,4.0,2.0,very interested in the material now after taking the class
4918,50842,4.5,2.0,"He's not the best geneticist, but if you can do his problem sets then you will be fine on the exam.  And since you have problem session every week, you can learn how to do them."
4919,50842,1.0,3.0,"very unhelpful.  dosnt put slides up, dosnt give practice problems, always seems hesitant to answer questions when you go to him for extra help ,  dosnt seem to know conceptual stuff ( i dont think he has actually read the textbook in a while) AND wording and problems on tests are completely different to text book/class so tests are confusing!"
4920,50842,3.0,5.0,"Nice guy, but his class is HARD AS HELL"
4921,50842,1.0,5.0,No Comments
4922,1195678,4.0,3.0,"Overall,I'd say that leadership and a liberal arts education&quot; is a pretty dull class but she outlines it very well.  She's a little boring and takes long pauses in the middle of sentences but is a fair grader."
4923,46751,5.0,4.0,"Really cares about his students. Readings can be tough to understand because sometimes they're a bit dated, but he understands that they can be difficult and will go over anything if you ask. Won't judge if you don't understand something and will help you. Literally just pay attention in class and do the readings and you'll get a good grade."
4924,46751,4.0,4.0,"The works are old and can be hard to read, but the prof is very interesting and his lectures helped to understand the material. He is a tough grader though so you have to be a very good writer to do well in his class. He is also very caring and helpful."
4925,46751,4.0,3.0,"I enjoyed Professor Steiner, and would recommend his class as a solid Philosophy course. Although it can be a bit dry at times, a lot of the class includes interesting discussion that can be very inspiring."
4926,46751,5.0,4.0,"Had him for 3 classes. I really didn't like his teaching style at first but he really grew on me. I thought he was too hung up on particulars and was missing &quot;big picture&quot; ideas, but particulars are important because they can make/break the whole picture. You'll be astounded with how much your writing improves. High standards - hard, but worth it"
4927,46751,1.0,4.0,"Very obscure class. Lectures do not help you understand any of the material. Readings are tough to understand because they are very old works. On top of all that, the professor has a terrible grading criteria in which he expects you to fail the first couple of papers and pass the last couple."
4928,46751,3.0,4.0,"Steiner is a great guy who cares about his students. That being said, avoid taking this particular course with him at all costs. Epistemology is already a very difficult subject, and Steiner does nothing to make it easier for you. Paper topics are very difficult, very tough grader, and very difficult to keep up, especially if you fall behind. Avoid"
4929,46751,4.0,1.0,"Professor Steiner was fabulous. His classes were interesting and always a great discussion. I really enjoyed the first two portions of my course, 'Gods, Humans, Animals' and the second half was extremely informative. Steiner is also a great guy and extremely helpful in office hours."
4930,46751,4.5,2.0,"Professor Steiner was great! I had him for a 100 level philosophy class and for someone with very little interest in philosophy I still genuinely enjoyed his class. Attendance is mandatory but classes were interesting and engaging, never boring.  He is also incredibly helpful in office hours and going to them really helps your grade!"
4931,46751,4.5,3.0,"My favorite professor!  Very relatable and laid-back, although in class he expects everyone to stay attentive and conduct themselves, and encourages active conversation.  Very interesting class with a very enjoyable professor.  Definitely recommend him!"
4932,46751,4.0,4.0,"Good professor, but with an unbearably condescending attitude.  He explains the topics well, but demands far too much of his students.  For every class you must prepare 3 or 4 2-minute presentations on topics from the reading, and he does NOT excuse any absences without the dean's permission. Surprisingly easy grader given his general demeanor"
4933,46751,5.0,4.0,"This man is truly a gifted professor. He is extremely helpful and easy to talk because he wants the best for his students. If you do your work, you will come out with a great grade. One of the best teachers in the school, I recommend him to all."
4934,46751,3.5,2.0,Steiner really is a good guy. I'll be honest in saying I didn't really do the reading or pay attention too much in class but I'm still pulling away with a decent grade. If the material interested me more I would love this class. He's very helpful during office hours and wants you to understand the material. I recommend him if you like the material
4935,46751,4.5,5.0,"Be prepared to spend a considerable amount of time with the material.  Great professor but expectations are high.  Although I was extremely interested in the class, reaching deadlines was difficult while trying to put forward quality work."
4936,46751,4.5,5.0,Steiner is a great guy. Very friendly and VERY knowledgeable. He is a tough but fair grader- you have to do your reading in order to do well on the papers- but he is there to help you. Definately recommend him!
4937,46751,5.0,3.0,"A very serious, well educated professor who is willing to go to great lengths to help you.  If you work hard, your efforts will be recognized and rewarded.  Very interesting and knowledgable on his subject matter.  I would recomend him to anyone and everyone."
4938,46751,2.5,3.0,"knew his stuff, but graded really hard, graded based on writing skills since was a W1 but didn't really offer much help in fixing it.  Was fairly picky."

4942,1793696,1.0,4.0,this guy sucks. does not teach in a succinct manner
4943,1793696,4.0,1.0,"Prof Rogovin seems scary at first, but I quickly learned that he would do anything to help you succeed. He likes to cold-call (like every lang prof), so he expects you know the info; but if you are struggling, he is very willing to meet with you. I started not knowing the Hebrew alphabet and know I can have full on conversations, all thanks to him!"
4944,1793696,5.0,3.0,"Or is such a kind and great teacher. He is very understanding and helps students to receive a solid Hebrew understanding in class. The quizzes and tests are fair, and he is always transparent on what will be on exams. He has a fun vibe to him, and I learned a ton from him in just one semester."
4945,1793696,5.0,3.0,Professor Or is absolutely the best. If you are at all interested in Hebrew take his class. He has tailored the class so it makes learning a difficult language much easier. You will need to put in the work and study for tests to succeed. However if you're struggling Or is always willing to help.
4946,1793696,2.0,1.0,"Not a great class crossed with a rude guy. The class was not taught well as everything from the assigned readings was just regurgitated in class making class feel pointless. He has a very acquired sense of humor which often comes off as rude. He also doesnt really listen to students, its his way or the high way."
4947,1793696,4.0,2.0,Love this man. An amazing professor. Expects everyone to do all work assigned. Not too much each night and is easy if you follow along during class. Definitely should take Hebrew with him to fulfill language requirement.
4948,1793696,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, show interest  and do your work and he will like you. He can be very funny at times unintentionally. Highly recommend taking the class to satisfy your CCC requirement. A lot of work but you can do well by just skimming it. Make sure to take notes the Tests are specific and can be difficult"
4949,1793696,4.5,1.0,Great teacher and hilarious.  Loved him so much I took both Hebrew Bible Modern Literature and Jewish American Literature.  He is a fair grader and tends to be a pretty easy grader.  The reading can be a little bit much sometimes and sometimes understanding the essay assignments can be difficult.  But he is so fair and makes the course so fun!
4950,1793696,4.5,2.0,"Good teacher, very funny.  Not a hard grader but the work load can get high.  you only have to study a little and you'll def get an A"
4951,759460,5.0,1.0,"You're insane if you thought this guy was hard.  Basically, do the reading (if you want), go to class, and you'll be guaranteed an A.  It doesn't hurt to hit his office hours either.  You just have to have the ounce of intelligence required to pick up on what he expects you to write on the exam.  I'm pretty sure he is retired/semi-retired though."
4952,759460,5.0,2.0,"Greaves is so knowledgeable and nice. He is always willing to help.  Although his lectures can get boring, he really tries to make things interesting. The field trips are amazing. He does require mandatory class attendance. If you do well on the essays and speak in class you will be fine. Completely  recommend Greaves-awesome."
4953,759460,2.0,4.0,"Professor Greaves is a NOT a good professor. DO NOT take cultural anthro with him, wait until another professor teaches it. He talks forever, he's arrogant and condescenting, he's the most absurd grader ever with no real rhyme or reason for points marked off. the material is actually interesting...he sucks"
4954,759460,1.5,4.0,"Most frustrating class I've taken at Bucknell. He talks tons and is a horrible grader. You can get tons of points marked off, ask him what the correct answer actually is, and even if what he says is the exact thing you've written down you're somehow still wrong."
4955,759460,4.0,3.0,"Also have him for ANTH 287. Greaves is a very nice guy. However, he talks ALOT!!! Not an easy grader. He's very particular so make sure you read directions for writing assignments carefully! Greaves, like many Bucknell professors, is a big (if not the biggest) advocate for Study Abroad programs."
4956,759460,3.0,4.0,"do well on papers, do not need to pay attention in class. Make sure you follow his tips for the slideshows, you'll do fine. Watch your grammar!!!"
4957,759460,3.5,2.0,"i LOVE prof. greaves.  he's such a nice guy.  his lectures can get pretty boring, but he never ceases to amaze me with how much he knows.  the workload was pretty minimal, and the class was mostly discussion based.  go to class and do well on the essays and you'll do fine."
4958,759460,1.5,3.0,"Talks excessively and isn't very open minded.  The workload wasn't unbearable, but the papers were boring to write.  I didn't like how he critiqued my papers and presentations for certain mistakes that he himself made on a regular basis."
4959,759460,1.0,3.0,No Comments
4960,759460,2.5,2.0,"Pretty easy. HW is mostly readings, not bad."
4961,759460,3.0,4.0,"stories are good and knows lots on the subject, but tends to not listen to kids and gives unneccesary work"
4962,759460,1.0,4.0,No Comments
4963,759460,3.0,2.0,"tends to talk a lot, sometimes too much. he is very nice and is a fair grader and willing to help."
4964,759460,2.5,2.0,he's a realllly boring speaker but he's pretty fair in the amount of a work he gives you
4965,1193639,1.0,4.0,"Professor Leddington is a hardo. Don't take him if you're looking for an easy A. He basically requires you to go to office hours in order to do well, even for a level 100 class. Quizzes are multiple choice and often difficult unless you've done ALL of the reading, mandatory and &quot;recommended&quot; alike. They also count for half of your grade. Stay Away."
4966,1193639,5.0,4.0,"He's brilliant.  Tough grader, but definitely worth taking. Really encourages original thought, but can be hard to read. Is also super cool outside of the classroom."
4967,1193639,3.5,4.0,Took consciousness with Jason and it was a great experience. He definitely gives homework and has strict instructions with how he wants your notes and homework and such organized. You have to go to class to do well because he takes attendance through physically turning in homework every day. Really interesting and challenging course.
4968,1193639,1.5,5.0,"Not a very helpful professor at all. For a 100 level course, he grades way too hard. If you are looking for an easy A, look elsewhere. "
4969,1193639,4.0,3.0,The tests are supprisingly difficult to get a good test grade but he is very clear on what to study. There is homework everynight but its not excessive. You meditate as homework and in class. Its a really interesting class even if you aren't a philosophy major and he is always clear and super invested. Tests also aren't the only thing in your grade
4970,1193639,4.5,4.0,"Very interesting in class and conversing out of class.  Incredibly available, communicable, and helpful.  Reciprocates interest and effort."
4971,1193639,5.0,5.0,"A really hard grader but the course is incredibly rewarding.  Initially, he appears wildly condescending, however, by the end of the semester you will find he is incredibly friendly and intelligent.  One of the best classes I have ever taken."
4972,1193639,5.0,5.0,Extremely clear lecturer.
4973,1193639,2.5,4.0,Do not take this class if you are not really interested in philosophy. the material is not interesting and he is not good. Grading is extremely hard and and he is not very helpful when you ask him for help.
4974,1193639,4.5,4.0,"Very good teacher, he cares a lot about what he teaches and is very good at explaining things clearly.  He makes the classes very interesting and up beat.  There is a good amount of work but if you invest the time it can be very rewarding.  Professor Leddington and this class convinced me to major in philosophy."
4975,1193639,2.0,5.0,Do NOT take this class Very hard grader
4976,1193639,2.5,3.0,Very passionate about philosophy but grades somewhat hard especially when everyone in the 100 level class are not interested in the subject. The subject makes it hard to stay interested and he has a very rough attendance policy.
4977,1193639,4.0,5.0,"OK honest opinion of Prof. Leddington.  He is a little condescending at times, and he is a hard grader and requires a good amount of work.  With all that said, I still came out of the course with respect for him as he is a good professor as he really knows his stuff.  He is not easy, but he is a very good and knowledgeable professor."
4978,1193639,4.5,4.0,Awesome teacher. Any bad ratings are probably just from bad students.
4979,1840808,3.0,4.0,"If your opinions don't match hers, you won't do as well. She says that she wants you to form your own opinions based on the information she provides you with, but she shoots down any opinion or idea that doesn't align with her ideals. Very strict professor, but doesn't believe in exams. She makes you really think deeply and knows when you don't."
4980,1840808,2.0,5.0,"Honestly, Carmen and I just never seemed to get it going. I don't know if it was the way I smelled or the fact that I liked to show a little skin, but either way this class never worked out the way I had imagined, neigh, dreamed. Carmen is fairly strict and honestly at times I was pretty intimidated. Are you still reading this whole thing?"
4981,1840808,1.0,3.0,Henne-Ochoa was one of the worst professors I had at Bucknell. She claims her pedagogical way is to express her own opinion and use it to show one perspective as a way to prove to students the material is all about perspective. However Henne-Ochoa rather expresses her opinion forces her own values on the class and publicly defies students opinions.
4982,1840808,1.5,5.0,"Took her for two classes in two semesters and saw two totally different professors. I loved her the first class, but she completely changed. She became one of my least favorite professors and I dreaded  her class. Her attendance policy is absurd and was an extremely tough grader. Her lectures became boring and she's too opinionated. Takes favorites"
4983,1840808,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Henne-Ochoa is one of the best profs I've had at Bucknell. She's passionate, engaging, knowledgeable, brilliant, and very devoted to her students. She's really open about her personal background, which makes for a fascinating perspective on her subject. She really encourages students to think critically. Would highly recommend!"
4984,1957543,2.5,3.0,"Easy in the sense that there are no tests, just projects and blogs. Never returns or gives grades for assignments until months later. Class discussions are extremely controversial and uncomfortable, often racially driven. Very disorganized but very intelligent guy. Overall, if you need this course, try to take a different professor."
4985,1957543,3.0,1.0,"There are no tests, just papers, blog posts, and a lot of creative projects.  The class is pretty easy if you participate.  He takes a really long time to give grades back, but overall a chill young guy who makes you view education differently."
4986,130733,4.0,4.0,"Great Prof! I thought I would hate Accounting but really enjoyed this class. Tests are difficult, but if you read his textbook then you will do well. He is very lecture heavy and never asks for participation, but he is hilarious and always fills lectures with jokes. Would love to have him again!"
4987,130733,4.0,4.0,"He gives tricky exams that make you think a lot but the class is based on the textbook he wrote. If you know the text you will do well. No homework, just projects that are identical to in class problems. Also if your final is higher than a previous exam grade it will replace that exam grade."
4988,130733,5.0,4.0,"Very accessible, easy to talk to and always makes himself available to assist."
4989,130733,5.0,1.0,"Great Professor.  Easy course, funny, works with students and teaches!"
4990,130733,5.0,4.0,I will take this professor again.
4991,130733,5.0,4.0,Great professor.
4992,130733,5.0,4.0,I thought that I would hate Accounting. This course has changed my life.
4993,130733,5.0,4.0,"I want to be like him, someday."
4994,130733,2.5,4.0,"He is a nice professor and actually does care about his students. Although, his test are really hard even if you study for them a lot."
4995,130733,4.5,3.0,"Incredible teacher. Take his class. If you know the slides, you will do great"
4996,130733,4.5,5.0,"This man is my hero.  He makes the class tough (grade-wise) on purpose, but he knows accounting inside and out, and he tries to lighten the mood in the classroom by being hysterical.  Wear a calculator watch to class and you'll be his best friend."
4997,130733,3.0,4.0,Know accounting but other than that brings little business knowledge to the classroom.
4998,130733,4.0,5.0,The best in the world!
4999,130733,4.5,3.0,"Barely use books and mainly Power Points. If you study and know the slides, you will do fine on the tests. You must understand them completely or you will have trouble on tests. The tests are fair but you need to know your stuff. He's the best accounting professor I had at Bucknell."
5000,130733,4.0,3.0,"Bettner is the man.  He is really energenic and engaging.  His class is largely based on tests.  If you have even a minor interest in accounting, or calulator watches, then take a class with him."
5001,130733,3.0,4.0,"Class grades are based pretty much off of tests which are pretty difficult.  However, lectures are actually pretty entertaining for an accounting course. He goes off on tangents and throws in jokes to lighten the mood.  He teaches the material pretty well... enough to help you in future accounting classes."
5002,130733,4.5,4.0,pretty good accounting prof.  knows his stuff...aka he wrote the 161 book.  but he explains the material the best out of any accounting prof at bucknell.  hard tests and stupid project but helps u out overall.
5003,130733,4.5,4.0,"SOOOOO FUNNY!  Love thi sman in class.  He actually makes accounting somewhat fun...he's clear with what he teaches, but his tests are some of the hardest thing sever.  You need to study extremely hard in order to do well, but they aren't impossible."
5004,130733,3.0,4.0,"really nice guy and entertaining in class. if you understand the subject matter you will do well, if not, the tests are very hard"
5005,130733,4.5,3.0,"Great Professor. Hard Tests, but it helps you learn the material for future courses. He is funny too!!!"
5006,130733,5.0,3.0,bettner is hilarious.  he gives hard tests but he's a good prof and makes things fun
5007,130733,4.5,2.0,No Comments
5008,130733,1.0,5.0,this man is the reason i changed majors!
5009,130733,3.0,4.0,Hard tests
5010,659121,5.0,3.0,"Capaldi is very passionate, if a little quirky. Even though I didn't see myself being super excited about ants and bees, social insects ended up being one of my favorite classes. If you make an effort to participate and show interest in the material, you will have a great time and do well. You definitely get what you give with her."
5011,659121,2.0,4.0,Capaldi is tough. I've done more work for 208 lab than I have in most other labs by far. There seems to be a lot of unnecessary busy work that doesn't make sense to most students and isn't practical. I wish she streamlined assignments more because I find myself so overwhelmed just trying to get all the work done that I don't learn it well.
5012,659121,2.5,3.0,"Although I loved the material and learned a lot, this was the most disorganized class I've ever taken. She raced through the powerpoints and the required readings from the book were unecessarily detailed. She also grades things weeks after the due date and is just overall very unorganized in this class"
5013,659121,4.0,2.0,"I loved her in office hours, but the course itself was pretty boring and her exams were random."
5014,659121,5.0,3.0,"A great professor! Clear and easy to understand, except when she occasionally forgets why she put a slide in the slideshow. Keeps class interesting with fun stories and her incredible knowledge of the subject. Very interesting and engaging as a person. Tests are fairly hard"
5015,659121,5.0,2.0,"I had her for ANBE 256 and Bio 355 at the same time. Cool, fun, smart lady. I really enjoyed both classes a lot, she's one of my fav professors. She'll make you do a LOT of work but really isn't a tough grader and she's very fair. Her multiple choice often is tough but her essay &#63;'s are really good. You have control over your projects' subjects."
5016,659121,4.5,3.0,Such a great teacher! Very passionate and engaging.
5017,659121,3.0,2.0,Had her for Baby Bio. Pretty easy class. If you study for the tests (especially from the slides) then you should get a good grade. Class can be a little boring but if you're looking for an easy lab then you can't ask for more
5018,659121,4.0,3.0,"She's very good for upper level biology courses.  If you are at all interested in biology or animal behavior, take her.  If you are looking for an easy A in baby bio she won't give it to you so don't take her, she actually wants her students to do work..."
5019,659121,5.0,4.0,I have a new love for Bees....Capaldi Rocks!
5020,659121,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Capaldi is a caring and insightful teacher. She is passionate and while at times seems unreasonable, she pushes you to think in new ways. If you don't want to work hard or learn anything don't take her class....and drop out of school and stop wasting your parents money if you want easy A's"
5021,659121,2.0,2.0,"Awful lecturer.  She literally reads straight from the PowerPoint slides.  Tests are relatively easy; just study the slides and the chapter reviews.  You really don't even need to go to class at all.  If she would put the slides on public space you wouldn't even need the book.  Oh yeah, and she misspells and mispronounces everything. That is all."
5022,659121,4.5,2.0,"i really like the class, she teaches well and explains things clearly. definately take her classes if you get the chance, just make sure you like bees!!"
5023,659121,4.0,2.0,No Comments
5024,659121,4.5,1.0,"A very easy teacher, but she knows her stuff and is a great teacher. Good lectures, good powerpoints, and her tests aren't bad. She encourages class discussions. Overall, a good teacher."
5025,659121,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors and favorite classes, which first got me excited about the Animal Behavior major at Bucknell. Professor Capaldi is an amazing teacher."
5026,1308338,5.0,3.0,"Very well to convey material clearly, interesting in lecture, and helpful outside of class. Would take every chem class with her if I could."
5027,1308338,3.0,4.0,This class was definitely lecture heavy and without attending class the material would be so much harder to understand. Professor McGuire is clearly interested in the material she teaches and is very flexible with office hours. There are also weekly quizzes. Studying hard for the tests and attending class is extremely important.
5028,1308338,4.0,3.0,"I'm somewhere between a 3 and 4 with McGuire. She's pretty funny, but her lectures could get really boring at times. Her test questions were sometimes more difficult than the homework prepared us for. She was often available outside of class. She gave a couple bonus opportunities. The textbook was really bad for this class, but you still need it."
5029,1308338,3.0,4.0,I personally did not enjoy this class. Professor McGuires lectures were very boring which made it hard to stay engaged. If you study very hard for tests you will probably do well because she does not put any truck questions on her tests. I would not take this class again because the professor seemed very unapproachable and her lectures are boring.
5030,1308338,5.0,3.0,"Prof McGuire is amazing! She may seem intimidating at first, but in reality she's super approachable, is very accessible, &amp; explains things really well. I hadn't taken AP chem and the last time I'd taken any chem was 4 years ago in high school, but because of McGuire, I passed with an A!"
5031,1308338,3.0,4.0,"This professor is a very good teacher, but she gives you very hard questions on the tests unlike the questions in class. She is also a very harsh grader and takes off as many points as possible."
5032,1308338,5.0,3.0,I had Professor McGuire for two classes and thoroughly enjoyed both. She likes to keep things light and make jokes. I especially enjoyed having her because she gives great academic advice.
5033,1308338,2.0,3.0,She is a nice person but misleads you by giving very easy examples in class and then   adding problems that are 10X harder on the exams.  Also the exams are worth 75% of the grade so it's a little annoying.  Overall she does care though and will help you out if you need it.
5034,1308338,4.0,4.0,"She is super nice and friendly. Analytical chemistry is a really difficult class, but she is always willing to help and meet outside of class. Her tests are hard, but she doesn't try to purposefully trick you."
5035,1308339,3.5,4.0,Great professor in my opinion. He delivered the material in a clear and concise manner during every lecture. In lab he was funny and helpful and not nearly as hard as everyone said he would be
5036,1308339,3.0,3.0,"Actually not that bad, just focus on the homework problems. Really boring and confusing lectures. But helpful if you go to office hours."
5037,1308339,5.0,4.0,"Despite what most people say about him, he is by far one of the greatest mentors I've ever met! He is amazing and you will learn a lot about the subject from him..ask about his research! and to all those complaining, stop being lazy and getting used to other professors who spoonfeed you. Selby will train you well with how to learn the material well"
5038,1308339,1.0,5.0,"This guys is useless, unfair, and totally arrogant. Stay away!"
5039,1308339,2.5,4.0,"He is by no means a genius as stated in another comment, but he is an intelligent professor.  Nonetheless, I do not recommend this professor.  He is slightly arrogant and has difficulty explaining the material.  If you have to take him, work the practice problems he assigns a few times and know the book well.  Lectures are not as helpful."
5040,1308339,1.0,4.0,DO NOT TAKE! Horrible man that has no idea what he is talking about and never could do a practice problem in class without messing up at least once.
5041,1308339,1.5,5.0,"He is a genius that cannot teach. His lectures are not very comprehendible, so resort to the book, even though that is not much help. Assigns problems, but it doesn't even begin to cover the material he tests you on. Sometimes he is not even confident in working out the problems you ask him for help about in the book."
5042,589491,3.0,3.0,"I took her International Law class and her lectures were interesting and full of debate. She uses Kahoot on some days to make sure we understand. She gave textbook reading every night but Ive only read it a few times because I got all the info i needed from her lecture. I got an A, B+, and A on the 3 exams and she dropped the lowest grade!"
5043,589491,2.0,5.0,"Literally assigns new writing assignment every week. Writing assignments aren't short either. Way to much work for one class, I wouldn't recommend taking her. She seems like a cool person but doesnt understand that students arent spending their entire lives on her class."
5044,589491,5.0,4.0,"Respectful, organized, thoughtful, helpful, organized, friendly."
5045,589491,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely adore her. She gives a lot of reading (so if you aren't willing to do it, don't take her class). ] her classes are better suited for people who are majoring in what the subject is she's teaching.  She asks a lot but everything is completely doable. do the annotated syllabi because that helps and then the tests are easy/manageable"
5046,589491,4.5,4.0,I absolutely loved this course (International Law) and I loved her. Amazing teacher. Definitely a tough grader but you learn so much that it's worth the effort. She made everything interesting and I didn't even mind getting up at 8:30 for the class. Would definitely recommend.
5047,589491,3.5,5.0,"She is an extremely tough grader and you would never be able to tell what she wanted on test questions. 3 exams worth 75% of grade, participation worth 10%, and a moot court project that included a 30 page group paper, a 6 page individual paper, weekly progress reports (8 pages apiece), and an oral presentation all for 15%. Worst class I've taken."
5048,589491,4.5,4.0,"emek rocked my world! she is extremely helpful, understanding and passionate about what she teaches. i wish i could have taken more classes with her. i highly recommend her. the tests are not bad at all if you keep up with your reading and take notes. the annotated syllabi are also helpful."
5049,589491,5.0,3.0,"extremely intelligent, intellectually stimulating course. hard tests but worth the experience. really enjoyed the professor, would recommend."
5050,589491,3.0,5.0,"Incredibly hard tests and grading on papers.  She taught around having more background knowledge than I did, and it was impossible to keep up with everything I didn't understand."
5051,589491,5.0,3.0,"had three different courses with emek and enjoyed each and every one.  very well-read and engaging professor.  extremely helpful during office hours and outside of those and also very easy to approach and talk about all manner of subjects.  highly recommended.  generally high workload, but very fair in grading and everything else."
5052,589491,4.5,3.0,Great Prof.! Helped me out alot when I was struggling in class.
5053,1308341,4.0,5.0,"Marin is definitely the toughest BIOL 207 professor, but I also learned the most material I've ever been able to in a class.  Most of the learning is independent with problem solving in class, and her exams mostly reflect the problems.  A tough class, but well worth it if you put the time in and she is really helpful in office hours."
5054,1308341,2.0,4.0,Prof Marin is so boring. She stands at the front f the room and reads off the slides word for word. I was really interested and excited about taking this class and she made me hate it. Her test were extremely difficult and her grading was really tough.
5055,1308341,3.0,4.0,Too much info on slides. Speaks too fast and too quiet. Can't take notes because you can't keep up.
5056,1308341,1.0,5.0,"Too much information on slides, couldn't take notes. Tests are on so many chapters its impossible to study."
5057,1308341,3.0,3.0,"Although for genetics we had a LOT of material to be responsible for on the tests, I am glad we did. I learned a lot from this class and it pushed me to actually learn the material. Marin is nice, and definitely a fair grader. She is always willing to answer questions if you're confused. Just keep up with the material and you'll be totally fine."
5058,1308341,1.0,5.0,Dreaded going to this class. Lectures were extremely boring and she put way too much information on the powerpoint slides. Exams cover 8-10 chapters and she talks so fast in class that no one can even take notes. Other section covered half of what we covered all semester.
5059,1308341,4.5,2.0,"Very nice and laid back person. Marin was patient and always willing to help, but sometimes was not entirely clear on lab protocol. Overall a good lab prof."
5060,1308344,3.5,1.0,"Really cool class (Intro to Microscopy). You just learn to set up and use microscopes the whole time. The concepts he teaches aren't difficult, while you absolutely need to study for the tests, they aren't hard and he tells you what will be on them. Apart from that he's a really cool, easygoing guy. I actually enjoyed going to this class."
5061,1308345,5.0,4.0,"Haussmann is amazing. Interesting lectures, clear emphasis on what is important. Exams are hard and you have to know the content to do well, but he provides no shortage of help to get you there. Ignited a love of biology, could not recommend more."
5062,1308345,5.0,3.0,"Haussman is fantastic. Great lectures, hilarious banter and skits to make topics less intimidating, and always happy to talk about what you are interested in. Groups got shuffled if they weren't working well but stayed the same when they were, which was lovely, and he is always in your corner, even with problems not related to his class."
5063,1308345,5.0,4.0,"literal best teacher I've ever had. Made me love bio even more than I already do. I ended up spending almost 20 hours a week on Bio alone, but it made me love the class and the material!"
5064,1308345,5.0,3.0,Professor Haussmann is one of my favorite professors. He can turn a dull Monday morning into one that has you laughing and engaged in the material. He makes his classes really fun and gives daily quizzes that help to boost your grade. He teaches the material really well and is helpful in office hours.
5065,1308345,5.0,3.0,"Professor Haussmann is awesome! Would definitely recommend taking his section of 206; he explains concepts super well and has no shortage of anecdotes to share. He is very accessible, and handled the stress of figuring out remote teaching really well. If you do all the work &amp; reading for this class and attend office hours, an A/A- is within reach."
5066,1308345,5.0,4.0,Prof. Haussmann is my favorite professor at Bucknell. This class is known to be pretty hard but I took it anyways just because I wanted him as a professor again. One of the most rewarding and interesting classes I have ever taken.
5067,1308345,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Haussmann is the best professor I have ever had. Not only were his lectures incredibly informative and often hilarious, he is single-handedly the reason I want to study biology. He is very well-respected at Bucknell and is an extremely accessible and caring guy. His tests are always very fair. Really wants his students to succeed and LOVES bio"
5068,1308345,5.0,4.0,Best professor I have ever had at Bucknell
5069,1308345,1.0,4.0,Hes okay. Not really accessible outside of class. Tbh probably wont take again.
5070,1308345,5.0,4.0,Haussmann is amazing! His exams were tough but if you take good notes in lecture and engage with him and the material you will do great. He also really cares for his students and their success. 10/10 will be taking more classes with him.
5071,1308345,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite teachers. He makes lecture fun and interesting and is just a great guy. If you do the work, you will do well in the class. He has 5 point daily quizzes that boost your grade at the end of the semester because you can drop a lot of them. Awesome teacher"
5072,1308345,5.0,4.0,"Incredible class. Most people come out from the war zone that is 205, and do sooooo much better in 206. Didn't do great on the final, but the class was really fair. Don't ditch as you get daily quizzes that boost your grade and he drops a huge number of them!"
5073,1308345,3.0,4.0,"Very funny guy and a great person in general! I liked him a lot in lecture, clear! Although, his exams were quite difficult and he doesn't have scheduled office hours. I wish he was more available. He is the least accessible professor I have had at Bucknell truthfully speaking. Also, he is very auditory, less visual which wasn't helpful for me."
5074,1308345,5.0,4.0,"Probably my favorite professor! He is super interesting in class and is always wiling to help prepare for an exam. I lived in his office and I am doing very well in the class. Exams are not easy, but if you study and prepare ahead of time you will do well. I highly recommend!"
5075,1308345,4.0,3.0,"He is very fair and makes the lectures interesting. Exams are difficult but you can use an ""info"" cheat sheet. I would recommend him! Makes Organismal Biology fun and interesting."
5076,1308345,5.0,4.0,"Hands down the class that prepped me best for med school. If you actually want to learn something, take Haussmann. He will make you work for it, but it's worth it. He's brilliant, he's hilarious, (and he's hot!). "
5077,1308345,5.0,4.0,"Definitely would recommend Bio of Aging! Lectures were always interesting, and we weren't always doing the same old assignments and projects. However, tests are deceptively hard, and it's really hard to know what you're grade is unless you ask"
5078,1308345,4.0,3.0,I absolutely love Professor Haussman. He makes even the most boring topics interesting and is always so fun and engaging. His use of David Attenborough in class is always a nice break from lecture. His tests are really fair and mostly consist of application problems.
5079,1308345,5.0,4.0,"Haussmann is the best professor at Bucknell. He is very passionate about biology and also cares deeply about his students. Tough teacher, but you will learn a lot, and he is very fair. He rewards hard work."
5080,1308345,4.0,4.0,"Haussmann is a wonderful professor. Very passionate about the subject. Also very funny and keeps the class interesting. However, he demands A LOT from his upper level students. This is the hardest bio class I have ever taken at Bucknell and it has been very frustrating. Only take this class if you are ready to dedicate all of your time to it."
5081,1308345,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Haussmann is the best teacher that I have ever had. He makes the material funny, interesting, and totally understandable. His tests are entirely application based, and they can be challenging due to the time constraint of class. Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! He is an amazing person and a fabulous teacher!"
5082,1308345,5.0,3.0,"Best Bio prof I've ever had. Great professor in class, funny, and interesting topics. David Attenborough fanatic - shows awesome clips."
5083,1308345,5.0,2.0,"Haussmann is the best teacher I've ever had, hands down.  I looked forward to his class, and learned a tremendous amount of really useful information from it.  He has the best sense of humor, he's attractive, and all of his lectures are extremely engaging.  He makes bio fun and totally relevant.  Definitely take him if you can, you won't regret it."
5084,1308345,5.0,1.0,Easily best bio teacher at Bucknell...maybe even best teacher period.
5085,1308345,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Haussmann is awesome! He has great humor sense and always helpful. I loved his class so much. If you want  to take bio classes, you should take his class."
5086,1308345,5.0,2.0,"Professor Haussmann is awesome! I would highly recommend him.  He is very helpful and always keeps class interesting.  He uses really great examples that help students remember the ideas.  This class was so much fun after taking 205.  His tests are fair, but you definitely need to study.  Take him if you can!"
5087,1308345,5.0,2.0,No Comments
5088,841404,5.0,2.0,"Professor McTammany is great! He's so down-to-earth, kind, and truly cares about his students. I found his course to be very interesting and his assessments to be very fair. He will never put a trick question on an exam but it will cover the content completely. I learned a lot in his course and enjoyed it as well. Definitely recommend!"
5089,841404,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite courses I've taken at Bucknell. Field trips are so much fun and are only about exploration, no assessments. Workload is low and exams are take home. Exams are very extensive but open note. If you pay attention in class and seek him out in office hours he is super willing to help. One of my favorite profs I've had!!!"
5090,841404,4.5,1.0,"Everything you need to know is on the powerpoints which he posts online before lecture which is very helpful.  Not a very good time planner, so tests could be very long and labs could take way over class time. A fair grader, clear lecturer, works extra to help you succeed in the class, and gives little homework. Great overall."
5091,841404,4.5,3.0,McTammany is THE MAN. He is one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell and he makes everything interesting - class meetings are easy to get through and he always gives examples and lets you print out the lecture slides which help sooo much for studying.
5092,841404,5.0,2.0,"He was the best bio professor I have had yet.  Great guy, since he was a Bucknellian not long ago he has a tolerance for Bucknell student life.  Easy to relate to and makes his exams do-able.  You do need to study, but he makes the material engaging enough that it's not terrible to study."
5093,841404,4.5,3.0,No Comments
5094,882370,2.0,1.0,"If you like to do other work during class or stare blankly into space, this is the class for you. He doesn't tend to teach in lectures, but rather asks repetitively what we think."
5095,882370,4.0,3.0,Loves drawing the class out to the maximum possible length even if there is an obvious stopping point. BOOOORINNGGGG but EZ
5096,882370,3.5,4.0,"Professor Wilshusen is a good teacher who cares about his students but it's not that easy to pull of an A in this class, at least it wasn't for me."
5097,882370,3.5,3.0,"Great Guy! Really knows his stuff. You can't help but be interested in what he says because he's so passionate...in a good and open minded way. Intro has a lot more work than you'd expect though. Exercise essays every week and you have to read for the tests though he's a fair grader. Take his class, you'll DEFINITELY learn a lot!"
5098,882370,4.5,2.0,"i completely agree with the other rating. he's a great guy, really enthusiastic, really into the material. take his intro to env. class for sure"
5099,882370,5.0,3.0,"great professor, really loves to teach, enthusiastic. hard grader at times, but he's always there to help. take his intro to env. studies class no matter what major you are"
5100,2535108,2.0,4.0,"Well she loves a lot about chinese literature, I have to say. However, her mandatoary outside class activities are ridiculous. I have to wake up at 8 to have breakfest with a scholar to chat and this is mandatory!!!! unbeliveable"
5101,1044174,3.0,3.0,"Camuto is a good prof but very tough grader. Going into this course, I thought it would be more discussion based since it was an English course but he most just lectured the whole time. He opens your mind to interesting new ideas but we often got off topic and it could be pretty boring at times."
5102,1044174,4.0,3.0,"Camuto is an engaging professor with great insight and thought provoking questions/thoughts.  He makes you feel like you really have the ability to pursue writing if you'd like to, which is a great source of encouragement and inspiration.  I'm looking forward to taking another class with him in the future."
5103,1044174,3.0,3.0,I had this professor for an 8am hour&a half class. So boring. We only had 3 essays to do over the whole semester (that was basically the entire grade) and we barely learned anything. It was such an annoyance to go to class. BUT the other enviroRes course option is WAY more work so i guess this was the better option
5104,1044174,4.0,3.0,Professor Camuto can be blunt and to-the-point which might be off-putting to most students; I liked that about him though. He is honest and straight-forward in his critiques and treats students like adults by not sugar-coating the ways in which they can improve their writing skills. Very passionate about nature. Lectures can be long though.
5105,1044174,2.0,3.0,"I was really excited to take his class but, instead of the amazing and interesting class I expected, I was bored during most class discussions. He was a very mono toned voiced that seemed to start putting me to sleep. I also wasn't found of his grading comments and found him to be very opinionated, especially in what you wrote about."
5106,1044174,4.0,2.0,"Professor Camuto is clearly a passionate writer, and his experience has given him insight into the philosophies behind the various modalities of creative writing. That said, he's not always the best at expressing these insights in an engaging way...he also tends to be blunt in feedback, which at least is honest, but isn't always great for morale."
5107,1044174,4.0,1.0,"Easy class, not that hard of a grader, but soo extremely boring"
5108,1044174,4.5,3.0,"Chris Camuto taught me, &quot;An opinion is different than a point of view.  In writing, it is the point of view that allows you to break through and understand a perspective, even if it is not necessarily your own.&quot;  An amazing professor and an phenomenal creative writing course!"
5109,1044174,3.5,3.0,Show up to class.
5110,1044174,4.5,3.0,He is a great professor who is truly interested in the students and helping them become better writers. Not a difficult course if you write well and attend class. Take him!
5111,1044174,5.0,2.0,Very clear with expectations. Also a very great orator. Lecture is never boring no matter what he is talking about.  Very fair kind of guy. Definately take his classes if you are looking to learn something in a good classroom atmosphere.
5112,1044174,4.5,3.0,I'd never taken a creative writing course that taught &quot;intuitive&quot; writing--and was shocked how much it helped my writing! Definitely my favourite class.
5113,1799891,4.5,1.0,Brahmdog is the best teacher at this school. I'm pretty sure he can walk on water. Ask him about life lessons and the meaning of life and it will be like Jesus telling a proverb. Take any class you can with him. You won't regret it. His homeworks and tests are pretty easy and you can always convince him to delay assignments if they are difficult.
5114,1799891,4.5,1.0,"The call this man the ""Matlab wizard"", and for good reason. If Matlab skills got you laid, this man would be knee deep in the poon before he could blink. Gives some great life advice, ask him about corporal punishment back in India. One forgotten equation and boom, cane to the knees. He wants to bring it back but Bravman won't let him."
5115,1799891,5.0,1.0,I believe he created MatLab. Fastest coder I've ever seen and I've seen some of the best. Ask him to show you the video of his son with the sling psychrometer.
5116,1799891,4.5,1.0,Brahma is a legend. If you want to make him happy talk about anything that has to do with diesel
5117,1799891,5.0,2.0,Frankly the man kills it in every way. I have never enjoyed a class more. You will learn and you will love it. Packs the fattest hogs east of the Mississippi.
5118,1799891,5.0,2.0,Brahma is the best teacher in the entire world. He can literally solve any problem that he is faced with. He is a walking legend.
5119,968408,5.0,3.0,"Gates was amazing. Interesting in class, endlessly helpful. Really cares for students. We had a flipped classroom (problems in class/lecture videos outside of class). Best genetics professor."
5120,968408,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. 10/10 recommend. Super clear with her expectations and due dates etc. Always accessible outside of class. She truly wants all her students to succeed. Her class is test heavy, but she is very generous with partial credit and makes it very clear about what she expects from you on exams. Definitely take her classes!!!"
5121,968408,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors. Gives tons of partial credit on exams and hw and is super helpful during office hours and Q&amp;A sessions. Genuinely cares about her students, wants you to do well in her class, and gives great career and life advice. You do lots of practice problems in class that are very similar to how the exams are set up."
5122,968408,5.0,2.0,"Professor Gates is one of my favorite faculty at Bucknell. It's obvious from her class that she cares about teaching, and she goes to ridiculous lengths to help you understand the material. Huge amounts of partial credit are given if you show your work, and she is always awesome, especially during office hours or Q&amp;A sessions. I'll miss her class!"
5123,968408,1.0,2.0,"After trying to reach out to professor Gates multiple times this professor, she has failed and failed gain to give me clear feedback. A tough grader with even harder exams. Try to avoid this class if you can."
5124,968408,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gates is HANDS DOWN my favorite biology professor that I have had at Bucknell. She prepares her students well - her tests are modeled after her in-class problems and homework. Definitely take advantage of her office hours! If you show that you care about the class, she will take notice and do everything in her power to help you succeed."
5125,968408,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gates is one of the greatest biology professors I have ever had. She was always available to answer questions and her tests were very fair. As long as you do the homework, in class problems, and go to her for help you will get a good grade."
5126,968408,4.0,3.0,"Professor Gates is very likable and understanding with her students. Though her lectures might be boring at times, she offers lots of practice problems that you do in class that really help you prepare for the exam. She is very accessible outside of class, and going to her office hours really help. Definitely the best genetics professor at Bucknell"
5127,968408,2.0,4.0,"she teaches well in lectures, however the exams are only 8 questions and so hard. you have to go and see her in office hours and constantly reviewing the material or you won't pass. way too hard of a class."
5128,968408,5.0,3.0,"I was nervous to take a lab science, but TAKE IT WITH GATES. Her lectures are interesting and relevant to our life (cancer/ genetic/ ext.) and she is always available for office hours, she wants everyone to do well. Tests are fair and if you don't cram, you will get the A. Highly recommend her, she definitely knows what she talking about!"
5129,968408,5.0,3.0,"Awesome! She does expect you to know a lot, but her tests are fair and she's always straight-forward."
5130,968408,4.0,3.0,She's helpful but you need to know EVERYTHING she tells you.
5131,968408,4.0,2.0,"She was very engaging and genuinely cared about whether or not the class understood the material she lectures. Usually posts the lectures online before she actually gives the lecture, so I recommend taking your laptop with you and taking notes on the powerpoint slides to keep up. Tests aren't hard if you read the assigned sections in the book."
5132,968408,4.0,2.0,good teacher!
5133,968408,2.5,4.0,Don't take her.  She lectures simple material but expects an in depth knowledge of the material.  also labs are not short she lectures for an hour about what the lab says (hello we can read) but the actual experiment takes 15 minutes.  Such a bad teacher.  She should lecture what she wants not expect us learn the details on our own.
5134,968408,4.5,2.0,Good class to meet lab science requirement.  Lecture slides every day posted after class so class isn't mandatory. Labs are relatively short and easy.  Very helpful outside the classroom if help is needed. Tests are fair and not overly difficult and even if you do poorly it's not that hard to pull a B.
5135,968408,1.5,5.0,Worst prof ever. Intro level requirement... taught like a 300 level course. Most boring and worthless class ever.
5136,968408,1.5,4.0,"Run far, far away.  Took for a lab requirement.. will be my lowest grade @ Bucknell."
5137,968408,4.5,2.0,"very approchable, friendly, very engaging, explains well and cares about students. Doesn't give enough time to write notes, but doesn't use text; only lecture-based tests."
5138,968408,2.0,3.0,Jumps around during lecture.  Kind of a waste to even attend.  Would be better off just reading  the book.
5139,2539224,4.0,3.0,"He's a good guy, and he LOVES to talk about and share music (as all music teachers should). Sometimes he assigns way too much reading/listening homework, but he's pretty understanding and doesn't really punish people for not doing it."
5140,2539230,1.0,4.0,This class was like a bad trip. Numerous contradictions in reasoning. Constant algebra errors during class paired with never finishing a problem completely. A textbook that just left me more confused. Office hours never seemed to help much either. He's a nice guy but teaching is not his strong suit.
5141,2539230,1.0,3.0,"My man is smart as hell but has no idea how to teach. Sulai continuously contradicts himself, does not cover topics nearly enough in order for you to get wtf is goin on, and also messes up algebra a lot. References readings when the textbook wasn't mandatory. Very not helpful in lab or with explaining his work. Highly recommend to avoid"
5142,1713890,4.0,2.0,Took political economy of natural resources with her and she had interesting readers and guest lecturers and always showed clips and news articles in class to give real world context. Mid term is a short paper and final is a take home as well as weekly reports. There is a ton of reading but if you keep up and do well on the weekly reports its easy
5143,1713890,4.5,1.0,So friendly and always willing to help all of her students. Classes are discussion-based so come prepared and ready to talk.
5144,2096867,4.0,4.0,"It is a W2 class, but there was a two page critical commentary due every class. The subjects can be rough like trigger warning for the class."
5145,2096867,4.0,1.0,Extremely nice!
5146,2096867,4.0,1.0,"Really easy class. Not many people took it seriously because of the lack of mandatory homework, but if you show up and buy into what he's teaching, you'll get a good grade. Really fun guy and makes hilarious comments throughout class. Definitely recommend any class with him."
5147,831207,4.0,2.0,"Honestly not sure what's with some of these negative ratings- professor Krohn, while a bit monotone at times in lecture, is a very good professor overall. Very clear what will be on exams so if you attend lectures and pay attention you'll do well. Textbook was also quite helpful in illustrating examples. Would recommend Krohn for intermediate macro"
5148,831207,5.0,4.0,"Professor Krohn might catch some slack for not delivering riveting lectures, but he is a tough but fair grader and presents material in a clear, methodical fashion. Your grade consists of 2 Midterms, a final, and homework, all of which you can do well on if you pay attention in class. Highly recommend this professor for intermediate Macro."
5149,831207,1.0,5.0,Prof. Krohn was easily one of the worst professors Ive had at Bucknell. Lecture is extremely boring and even if you do manage to pay attention you will hardly learn a thing. Class participation is nonexistent. Final is worth a ridiculous 40% of your final grade. Text book isnt great. Expect to be teaching yourself just about everything for exams.
5150,831207,1.0,4.0,He is incredibly boring and the text book he uses is terrible. Expect to go to class and learn nothing.
5151,831207,2.5,5.0,"He used a horrible book this semester and he sort of have to use something else, which is quiet confusing. He's monotone and his text book is even more horrible than his lecture. "
5152,831207,2.5,4.0,"Very nice guy, but his classes are rather dry and boring. His grading policy is a little ridiculous, and he takes off points for the most absurd things. He loves what he does though and with hard work you can do well."
5153,831207,2.5,4.0,"Definitely understands what he's teaching, but is terrible at getting the information across. Tough grader and not the most helpful guy. 60% of the class got a D or lower on the first exam."
5154,831207,3.5,4.0,"Nice guy who really likes what he does. He is very dry though and without coffee I would not have lasted. Very math heavy course, rather than theoretical based (its basically micro economics). Tough grader although he does curve."
5155,831207,4.0,3.0,"literally such a nice guy, go to his office hours. class can be dry but it's not hard to do well if you put in some effort. definitely take him for macro"
5156,831207,2.5,4.0,"Not the most interesting class, but he is a good guy and wants you to do well. You may have to teach your self alot of things. His first 2 tests are right out of his notes or the book. His final exam may be one of the hardest tests ive ever taken."
5157,831207,1.5,5.0,"HORRIBLE! Sports Econ could have been the coolest class ever but he killed it! Too much math not enough application of the idea of sports econ. If you are not a math wiz, never take any of his classes no matter what. Really dry lecturing that doesn't make sense half of the time. DON'T Take him!!!!!!!!!"
5158,831207,4.0,3.0,"The guy certainly knows what he's talking about, he just presents it in a really boring way.  Pay attention though, because his tests do a good job of covering ALL of the material he covers.  He is a tough grader, but he's fair and willing to help outside of class."
5159,831207,4.0,3.0,God this guy is boring
5160,831207,4.0,3.0,He's sort of boring so it's kind of hard to focus in class.  He always willing to help outside of class though.  Test/homeworks are not too hard.  Don't let his nice attitude fool you.  You can go in for hours of extra help but he won't curve your grade you get what you earn numerically so i guess that's fair
5161,831207,4.0,2.0,Krohn is a bit dry/boring but there are way harder econ teachers in the department. Definetely possible to get an A in his class. Tests/hws are straightforward (although he did throw in a question on the final that came from the reading and not from his notes grrr).
5162,831207,4.5,5.0,"Hard grader, but willing to help as much as possible"
5163,2475760,5.0,4.0,"The worst thing about a professor is when they test on information they didn't address in class. Lin is the perfect example of prof's that doesn't do this. Once you get used to his accent, the only thing stopping you from getting an A is yourself.

I took 3 classes with Lin; his tests are not easy, but every answer is always on his slides"
5164,2475760,1.0,5.0,worst professor at bucknell
5165,2475760,3.0,4.0,"Although I did good in professor Lin's class, it was solely based memorization because he uses the same questions in the lessons on the exams. I would not say I learned much from this class and it gave me a lot of stress over the course of the semester. SO test heavy but luckily the extra credit boosted me a letter grade. if you do bad on a test..."
5166,2475760,1.0,4.0,Lectures are incredibly boring and useless. You won't learn the information unless you teach it to yourself.
5167,2475760,5.0,4.0,"This is the second time I have had Prof. Lin and I can say he is one of my more favorite professors at Bucknell. His grading criteria and expectations are very clear, he is very accessible outside of class and gives plenty of opportunity for extra credit. My only complaint is lecture can be boring at times but that is more so due to material."
5168,2475760,5.0,4.0,"Lin is a great Prof. Everything on the exam is covered in class and on slides so you never have to be surprised. Class is test heavy and you definitely have to put in the work, but he's a great guy and totally reasonable. Also, he gives extra credit for participation and attendance is not mandatory."
5169,2475760,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, explains everything that is on the tests. tests are heavily weighted in. Accessible if you need help, very generous with extra points and credit."
5170,2475760,4.0,3.0,"Tells you exactly what is going to be on the test and what to study. Solid amount of extra credit given. Only two complaints would be that the class weights tests very heavily, making up about 70% of your total grade, and occasionally homework problems have not been covered in class, but if you go to his office hours he is more than happy to help."
5171,2475760,3.0,4.0,"Professor Lin is extremely helpful and approachable outside of class. However, he does not do a great job in lecture and often skips calculus steps. Average for the first two exams were around a 60. There was an extremely generous curve at the end of the semester."
5172,2475760,1.0,5.0,"Classes were incredibly unhelpful. He would skip over teaching how to solve problems, especially the calculus saying &quot;its easy you've done this before&quot; where the vast majority of us hadn't. Similarly homework answers and quiz answers posted on moodle were impossible to follow with many steps skipped. Maybe this is why the class average was a 50%?"
5173,2475760,2.0,5.0,"he wouldn't teach any of the important material in class, just boring background info that wasn't relevant and would skip over solving problems and doing the calculus. the homeworks were okay but not at all relevant to class discussions and the exams were impossible. every exam had a 50% average, it was terrible."
5174,2475760,4.0,4.0,Great Professor. Very easy to meet outside of class to answer other questions. Classes are not mandatory but skipping lectures makes the class much harder. Definitely would take another class of his.
5175,1834739,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, took him for multiple classes. Great lecturer! and really caring and answers all your questions."
5176,1996534,2.0,4.0,"Lectures are directionless and she spends most of her time rambling. Huge amounts of reading, something that could be mitigated if her classes produced anything meaningful."
5177,1996534,4.0,4.0,Very nice teacher. Monotone. But funny
5178,1996534,2.5,3.0,incredibly boring with a monotoned voice. very knowledgable about politics but classes are not structured.
5179,1996534,2.5,3.0,shes a good teacher
5180,493308,2.0,4.0,Not my fav professor. Not a fan when someone prides themself in being a tough grader - you should want your students to succeed. not into the course nor the teaching style. wouldn't recommend for your IP but im sure could be more interesting as an astronomy/physics professor. 
5181,493308,4.0,3.0,"I had him as a lab professor for PHYS211 and I probably learned more from him in lab than I did in physics lecture! He does keep his students in lab for a long time and is tough with critiquing work, but he really does care and wants to make sure everyone understands the content."
5182,493308,4.0,4.0,"The lectures seem to take forever and while he tried to make the material interesting, the lack of visual representation made it hard to follow along and easy to drift off. The labs, while time consuming, were the most interesting and the most relevant to exams. Even though the material was difficult, Ladd was always wiling to help outside class."
5183,493308,4.5,1.0,He gave really good lectures. He made astronomy seems so interesting. Definitely recommend this class.
5184,493308,2.5,5.0,"His tests were VERY HARD and the labs were graded harshly. He is helpful with office hours, but the class itself is extremely difficult"
5185,493308,5.0,1.0,Easy test. Easy classes. He's awesome. Interesting and has the sense of humor.
5186,493308,5.0,3.0,"Took an Energy and Sustainability class with him. LOVED him. Very helpful, clear, passionate about the subject matter. I absolutely hate physics and loved this class, it's a testament to his teaching. Lots of work but a fair grader. Really nice guy."
5187,493308,4.5,4.0,Astronomy is a really hard class but I loved having Ned as a professor.
5188,493308,2.0,5.0,Very hard tests and boring material. You must be really good at math to do well in this class and the labs take a long time. Beware.
5189,493308,5.0,3.0,"Is always extremely clear. Probably one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell, who seriously understand how to teach. Probably would have gotten more into physics had I had him earlier on."
5190,493308,5.0,5.0,I liked him.
5191,493308,4.5,2.0,"Ladd is a good professor.  He's a nice guy, knows what he is talking about, and is willing to help.  Physics 211-212 can be a tough course, but I have nothing but good things to say about our physics department."
5192,493308,4.5,2.0,Very helpful problem session instructor. Good person.
5193,493308,5.0,2.0,Very helpful but sometimes was not specific enough with his instruction. Great guy although does tend to sweat a lot...
5194,493308,4.5,2.0,Great Prof for Problem Session.  He really wanted students to succeed even if he did change up the symbols between his lectures and the book.  I would highly recommend for problem session.
5195,493308,4.0,4.0,"He is a great professor. He is not a tough grader, but the course is challanging. If you want an easy lab science, astronomy may not be the best choice."
5196,493308,4.0,4.0,Really entertaining during lectures and really helpful during the long boring labs.  Very strict when it comes to late assignments but always willing to help you out.  Not one of the easier lab sciences but he's a really entertaining guy.
5197,493308,5.0,2.0,His lectures were very interesting and his teaching style is entertaining. The labs can be a little tedious but that is expected for a basic lab science. One of my favourite professors at Bucknell.
5198,493308,5.0,4.0,"He is honestly one of my favorite teachers.  He is extremly helpful, and really wants you to understand the concepts of the class."
5199,493308,5.0,1.0,He was the most lucid professor I had at Bucknell. His lectures and class in general were great. Good sense of humor and extremely bright. Take his classes if you can.
5200,1507078,1.0,1.0,She has a colorful personality... the kind that might respond to medication.
5201,1511179,4.5,2.0,Great professor.  kept the class interesting and did not require much work out of class except for readings and take home exams
5202,1511179,4.0,3.0,"You get what you give in Prof. Duckles' class.  It was obvious that the students who didn't pay attention or care about the class didn't get much from it, but the students who put forth effort on her papers & reading assignments (I'm including myself as one of them) seemed to get a lot out of the class.  And she's not tough if she sees you trying!"
5203,1511179,4.5,2.0,"Duckles is super passionate about what she teaches, which comes across in class, and makes the material more interesting. She is a very reasonable grader and is more than happy to help outside of class. I recommend this class to anyone interested in sociology."
5204,1511179,2.0,2.0,EXTREMELY unorganized. Also very close-minded and her assignments all needed clarification. Do NOT take her class.
5205,2359055,4.0,4.0,"Jeff is an awesome professor with a great personality. Although the class was not that easy, he made lectures very fun and was helpful if you were struggling on something. Make sure to review a lot before his exams and immediately ask questions if there is something you don't understand!"
5206,2359055,5.0,3.0,"Jeff was an AMAZING professor! The course material was difficult, but he taught in a good way that made a lot of sense, and he tried to bring in humor to make the early morning class bearable. His exams were kind of difficult, but they were like the homework or problems that we did in class, so fair. If you do the assignments, you should do well. "
5207,2359055,5.0,4.0,"Great professor who really cares about students. Good lectures, very clear. Hard exams but worth it. Very good professor and I learned a lot."
5208,2359055,4.0,4.0,"the material in this class is hard, but he is very clear and a good lecturer. he gives reading and homework every night and there are projects that are very complex problems using Mathematica. tests have a t/f section where you can get 1/2 credit for simply not answering. tests also have a final hard question and alternate easy one worth 1/2."
5209,2359055,1.0,5.0,"His class is overly difficult for no reason. There is no reason for his exams to be that difficult. They are nothing like the lectures in class. Be prepared to receive a full letter grade than you would with any other professor. From my experience, when I asked for help, he was rude and condescending. I do not recommend to those who care about GPA"
5210,2359055,2.0,5.0,Jeff is overly difficult and unwilling to help. His tests are absolutely nothing like his lecture and homework. Be prepared to receive a full letter grade lower in a class than what you would with another professor.
5211,2359055,5.0,5.0,"He is one of the best mathematics professors I have taken. He is a bit fast in his teaching pace, but he cares too much about students and their understanding. He is a funny guy as. There is hw submitted at the beginning of every class and a quiz once a week. His tests are few in questions but they are hard. Remember to try completing the square."
5212,2359055,5.0,3.0,"He is known to be a hard grader, and give difficult tests. While he surely exceeds that expectation, he is extremely willing to help you to succeed in the class. He makes the lecture really interesting, and funny (as in bad mathematical puns). There is a quiz every week, and homework after every lecture."
5213,2359055,5.0,3.0,"Jeff was an incredible professor. His exams were quite difficult, but doing (and re-doing) the homework assignments definitely helps with understanding the material. He is almost always accessible outside of class, whether that be in office hours or at any time which works for you. I would definitely take his class again."
5214,2359055,5.0,3.0,best math prof I have encountered so far the exams are a little bit tough but he curves a lot
5215,2359055,5.0,3.0,best math prof I have encountered so far his exams are hard but he curves a lot
5216,2359055,5.0,3.0,He is a great professor. His door is always open to students. He prepares careful notes before class and knows the materials very well. Homework load is not heavy but exams are very hard.
5217,2359055,4.0,4.0,"While known as giving tough tests and lives up to his reputation, he is a great professor and is very good at teaching the material. He is a quirky guy but very engaging and if you listen then you shouldn't have too much trouble understanding the material. Would take again."
5218,2653970,5.0,2.0,"Really enjoyed attending this class.  Prof G is Very knowledgeble, loves teaching and does an excellent job of teaching. Positive , enthusiastic personality. Grading, assignments, work load & assessment is all what you expect from such course at any top 100 Engg universities."
5219,2653970,5.0,3.0,"You will benefit a lot in his class if you follow him. Materials in MATH 216 are not easy, but professor G will guide you through. It is important to treat his class with professionalism, and you will find the fun part out of it. Otherwise, you might think they are just busywork. 

Good luck and I hope you will enjoy this class with professor G! "
5220,2653970,1.0,4.0,"Professor Gutekunst has some kinks in his teaching system which he needs to work out. Namely, he won't answer any relevant questions during exams, even if the question arises due to something which is his own fault. Additionally, he refuses to make changes to students' workload despite significant extraordinary circumstances."
5221,2653970,5.0,3.0,"If you spend 4 year at Bucknell, you HAVE TO spend one semester with him. The materials are not easy in MATH216 given the timeframe, but he deliver the content in the BEST way it can possibly be. ProfessorG is super clear about what he wants, and he replies to your email literally in minutes. "
5222,2653970,5.0,3.0,"I took this class first semester of my freshman year. Prof G made my transition into college CS very easy and was very helpful, especially during office hours. You can expect a homework some weeks, a lab most weeks, and 3 projects. Everything was super interesting and fun to code, if I found myself at a roadblock I would go to him for help."
5223,2653970,5.0,3.0,By far the best Professor in the Math and CS department. Makes abstract concepts look easy with great explanations. Fair grader. One weekly hw assignment which might be a little long but doable. One question quiz every week. One final project (presentation) about a topic that he will assign you - overall not bad! Make sure to take him if you can!!
5224,2653970,5.0,4.0,"Awesome professor. He is young and funny. His best attribute is that he explains difficult concepts better than any professor in the department (great examples, step by step, easy to follow). His course is very structured week by week. His is not an easy grader you will need to put in some serious effort to get an A. But he teaches cool material."
5225,2653970,5.0,3.0,"Prof Gutekunst is a funny guy. He always shows up a with a lot of energy, which is great since most of the class was often not energetic. His lectures were pretty good and helped me understand the difficult material. Prof Gutekunst is also really into the play/movie &quot;Mean Girls&quot; so be prepared for references"
5226,1511186,5.0,3.0,"Professor Reed is very knowledgeable about south Asian culture. Her class is not hard to do well in by any means if you simply do the work, show effort, and participate in class. Professor Reed was also very accessible outside of class for help. Overall really sweet and intelligent woman"
5227,1511186,1.0,4.0,"She said that classes were optional since this was during 2020. But, the only time I ever missed class I got the SASSIEST email I've ever seen. She also gave incredibly vague descriptions for all of our assignments and then took off points if they weren't written exactly the way that she wanted them to be. Lectures and reading were also boring"
5228,1511186,3.0,3.0,"The class is fairly interesting, however it is a lot of reading and so if you do not need the credit, I would recommend another class. She is adamant about her research which makes it better, but the pop quizzes are difficult if you didn't take notes, even if you read."
5229,1511186,3.5,2.0,"easy, just do the work, which isn't hard. "
5230,1511186,3.5,1.0,Professor Reed was the easiest professor I had at Bucknell. You do have to participate in class discussions so reading/ skimming the assigned homework is necessary. Mid-term was super easy. Reed spent way too much time explaining future classes than focuses on the topic of the day. Just show up and you should do well in the class.
5231,1511186,4.0,2.0,Ok class. Her lectures were pretty boring and she tended to talk about a topic for 20 minutes when it could have been covered in just a few. Not too hard of a grader though.
5232,1853207,5.0,2.0,Professor Delasandro is well respected and kind. You will read awesome material and talk about it. There is a lot of writing but it isn't that bad. Definitely take a class with her if you can.
5233,1853207,5.0,3.0,"One of the best wgst professors that Bucknell has. She is extremely knowledgable and always makes class interesting and engaging. Further, she genuinely cares about her students and interacts with the university as a whole. Definitely take a class with her!!!"
5234,1853207,1.0,1.0,"OK, if you agree with her you are golden , if you do not you will have a tough time. Very opinionated and set in her ways. Clearly has a left wing agenda and is not afraid to use it on your grades. Seems like a nice person but I did not get much out of the class."
5235,1853207,5.0,1.0,THIS WOMAN IS A BLESSING TO THIS EARTH. Worth it for an intro to women and gender studies course! Learned a lot without being forced into overdrive mode for an intro class.
5236,1853207,5.0,2.0,"THE BEST professor I have ever had at Bucknell so far. She is the most passionate, enthusiastic, and truly caring person. She really cares about you as a person outside of class as well. She was also my adviser my first year and I would come to her about any issues I was having whether it was academic of personal. If you get the chance, take her!"
5237,1853207,4.0,1.0,"While I love her, this class was semi frustrating. We spend a lot of time talking about what we observe in the world about gender which makes us never get to course material. I eventually just stopped doing the readings because we never even got to them. But, I still liked the class overall because I think the content was eye opening &amp; important."
5238,1853207,5.0,2.0,"Erica is a great professor. From day 1 she begins to learn the names of every student, even in a class with 35 students. She loves talking about current events in class, wants students to be engaged outside of the classroom, and always has a snazzy outfit on. Show up and be engaged and you'll do just fine."
5239,1853207,5.0,2.0,amazing and inspiring professor. Take this class to better yourself
5240,1853207,5.0,2.0,Absolutely loved Dr. Delsandro's class! She really brought the material to life in class and was more than willing to provide feedback / help students outside of class as well. Truly seemed to care about her students. I would definitely recommend her.
5241,1853207,5.0,2.0,Erica is the best!! Nicest person ever!!! Really helps understand the novels you read. She is not a difficult grader and gives positive feedback!! Would love to have her again.
5242,595740,1.0,1.0,"She is very nosy. She asks a lot of personal questions during attendance, and is not flexible or considerate of anyone's time."
5243,595740,5.0,3.0,"By far my favorite professor at Bucknell. SOC 209 sucks during it, but it is so rewarding handing in the final paper and you learn so much. Hard professor, but she really genuinely cares for all her students."
5244,595740,4.0,3.0,209 is an extremely demanding class. The class sucks when your in the middle of it but when you turn in a 30 page research paper with quantitative analysis on the last day its very rewarding. Professor Durden is amazing and invested in each student as long as they are putting forth their best effort.
5245,595740,4.5,3.0,"My favorite professor I have had at Bucknell so far! Challenging but fair, incredibly insightful, and very invested in any student that takes the time to talk to her. Her class is very engaging and will never put you to sleep. You have to keep up with the reading and assignments but they are definitely very doable."
5246,595740,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I have ever had. Not clear on what she wants at all - not invested in any of her students.
5247,595740,2.5,5.0,"asks a lot from the students. what is on the tests is barely touched on in class. i tried hard, but she made a potentially enjoyable class unenjoyable."
5248,595740,5.0,4.0,"Best professor ever.  Challenging but fair, and incredibly insightful.  She came into class full of passion and ready to foster discussion everyday.  You will read and learn a LOT but this class truly prepared me for grad school.  I would take this course again if I could.  But while classes are not ""mandatory"" DON'T miss unless you have to."
5249,595740,5.0,4.0,Her lectures and class discussions are really interesting. She's really passionate about her work and her students. I would definitely recommend a class with her.
5250,595740,2.5,4.0,"best teacher i have ever had. had her for freshman foundation class and she is amazing. shes a little all over the place at times and isnt the best at answering all emails but she is a great lady. super nice and always willing to help, if you can get her attention. by far my favorite teacher ever! took her again for sociology 100. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
5251,595740,4.0,4.0,"Very, very tough on essays and rarely gives feedback. In-class tests are easy enough if you study the readings religiously. She doesn't follow her own syllabus and she isn't always clear on what she wants to see in your assignments. She is very passionate about her material. A great class if you're willing to work."
5252,595740,4.5,4.0,"Professor Durden was my favorite professor last semester! She was extremely energetic and passionate. She is a tough grader on papers, but if you go to her, she is willing to help you make sure you know what she wants. Before the class, I was only somewhat interested in Sociology, but now I am seriously considering it as a major. Take her classes!"
5253,595740,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Durden presented really interesting readings, was always energetic and engaging in lectures and was readily available to meet outside of class for additional clarification or help. I HIGHLY recommend this teacher to anyone interested in learning about Sociology, as I went into the class with only a slight interest and its now my Major!"
5254,595740,2.5,4.0,"STAY CLEAR OF THIS PROFESSOR...She cannot follow a syllabus for her life.  Papers were graded unfairly.  Reading assignments were sparse but extremely long. All discussion and not much learning. The class basically had no clue what was going on for half the semester.  Not an overly difficult class, but definitely a painful experience."
5255,595740,1.0,4.0,"Over estimates her intelligence.  Thinks she is right about everything.  Cannot teach.  Biggest interest seems to be getting ahead, and will step on whoever in order to do so and kiss up to the most important people.  As teaching is not high on her priority list, students treated like dirt."
5256,595740,2.5,5.0,"Be prepared for A LOT of reading and writing. There are times when she asks you to read 150 pages and write an essay in 2 days. Extremely harsh grader, especially for essays. Had us buy a book that we didn't even use (i still lost money when trying to sell it). Didn't follow the syllabus and wasn't always clear about assignments."
5257,595740,5.0,4.0,Extremely helpful in class and during office hours.  Loved her!
5258,595740,5.0,2.0,"I had Prof. Durden for a 400-level capstone course and had such a great experience. She's fun, not too serious, and is really passionate about what she teaches."
5259,595740,3.0,5.0,she hated our class and made every class miserable.  she assigns a huge amount of work/reading and expects you to know very specific details.  she taught the class at more of 200 level course - i spent more time on this class than any other class this semester.
5260,595740,5.0,3.0,"She is a good professor,very open you have to work a lot but it's not bad. Her classes are fun."
5261,595740,5.0,4.0,No Comments
5262,595740,4.0,3.0,No Comments
5263,595740,5.0,3.0,"awesome prof... so much charisma & passion for the subject... shes very open - you can go to her office to get help w/ classwork, schedule, personal problems, anything! grade is a midterm, final, 2 papers & an essay"
5264,595741,4.5,3.0,"Helpful and clear while teaching, availablity is good, tests are more difficult than quizes"
5265,595741,1.0,4.0,"I had a bad experience with her. She doesn't teach anything, rather she just reads off her Powerpoints, which are straight from the book (which is incomprehensible). Most of the class was clueless about what was going on for most of the material. She's a nice lady and wants to be helpful, I just think the course itself is extremely poorly designed."
5266,595741,5.0,1.0,EASY!!!!! And she is so sweet and always  willing to  help. Def choose her for any math classes she teaches.
5267,595741,4.5,2.0,Very easy grader. Highly recommended if your just taking calc for a MGMT requirement. Also a very nice teacher.
5268,595741,4.0,1.0,"extremely easy grader, definitly take her if you are taking calc just to fulfill a requirement.  weekly homework, but she will help you if you ask"
5269,595741,5.0,4.0,Very cool chick - goes out of her way to help students outside of class and her lectures are very clear.  I love that she puts it all on Blackboard too.  I'm taking her again next semester.
5270,595741,5.0,4.0,"Lots of work, but you learn a ton, especially if you have to do research in the future - really prepares you.  Very helpful prof.  Two thumbs up."
5271,595741,4.5,4.0,"Good teacher, tough grader, nice person."
5272,595741,2.5,4.0,"hard tests, not a very good teacher, but a sweet lady and will help if needed"
5273,595741,4.5,4.0,"Her tests are extremely hard, but she's very willing to help you prepare.  I had calc in HS but forgot a lot.  She met me at all hours of the day or night to answer questions.  She knows her stuff.  Highly recommended - da bomb!"
5274,595741,1.5,3.0,"HORRIBLE! She's very nice but unhelpful. She often appears to have no idea what she's talking about. Her lectures are vague and the homework is extremely difficult and has nothing to do with what's taught in lecture. The test are HELL! If at all possible, request a different prof for this course. You'll regret it if you don't!"
5275,595741,5.0,4.0,I thought the class was very fair - but it was a lot of work and the tests were tough!  Too much homework.  She did seem to know her stuff though.  And not many profs have study sessions in the evenings before exams - that's above and beyond.
5276,595741,1.5,4.0,did not like her at all. she was constantly corrected by the students in the class and the homework assignments did not prepare you at all for what was on the test. A lot of the hw didnt even cover what was on problem sets due at the end of the week.
5277,595741,5.0,4.0,"Had her for Calc and was a tough class, but learned a lot.  She really went the extra mile to help me outside of class - I was really prepared for Calc 2.  Highly recommended."
5278,595741,4.0,1.0,"pretty easy class.. she knows that her lectures are boring, so she sorta rushes through them.. always lets class out early, exams and homework assignments are pretty easy.. no midterm or final, but an easy project at the end"
5279,1060641,2.0,3.0,Funny and a good person but not specific in requirements and class different from course description. Lots of reading and studying. I had no background in Art History in high school and had to study for hours to memorize boring dates and names of art for each test. Barely learned anything and worked way too hard for the grade I got.
5280,1060641,1.0,3.0,She is awful and mean. Narrow minded. Boring.
5281,1060641,3.0,2.0,Lots of memorization but Mann makes this class as easy as she possibly could. She is very willing to make grade adjustments to help out her students.
5282,1060641,1.5,4.0,"She is funny and nice, but super judgemental. Her class was boring and not at all what the description said it would be. She is fair to her students, but I have learned absolutely nothing. Nice person, not a worth while professor"
5283,1060641,2.0,3.0,she might be a good professor but she judges students A LOT. she gets paranoid without any good reason. she's strange and weird. avoid her if you can.
5284,1060641,5.0,2.0,I had her for art history. She was very fun and entertaining. She is easy to talk to. Her tests requires a lot of memorization (its art history) so you really had to study but if you did you were golden. Our class took a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC so that was lots of fun.
5285,1060641,3.0,2.0,"The class wasn't hard and I learned a lot. Sometimes it seemed like she didn't really know what she was talking about but she's very friendly, funny, and a fair grader. It's all power points which was nice. She's a little crazy and I was upset that she didn't get to as much art as we were supposed to bc she fell behind. A good class and not hard."
5286,1060641,5.0,1.0,"I had no art history experience prior to taking this class and it was really do-able. Fun, energetic, and quirky professor who loves art. The trip to the met in NYC is fun. 1 paper, 3 exams, no final. The exams cover a lot of material. Great for those with a good memory or an interest in art. Show interest, answer questions, easy A."
5287,1060641,4.0,2.0,"Janice is a crazy and energetic woman who does a good job of keeping the class interesting. If its an early morning class it can be difficult to stay awake with the lights off being lectured at and just looking at slides. Work load is minimal, a few tests and one paper. I'd definitely recommend her, just make sure you are interested in the topic!"
5288,1060641,2.5,3.0,"I took her islamic course and it was a waste of time.  It was good because we had no exams so I never payed any attention.  But our only assignment was one paper with numerous parts.  Shes a pretty easy professor, but this class was terrible."
5289,1060641,4.5,3.0,"Professor Mann is such a fun, crazy, wonderful professor.  She really improved my writing skills and helped me choose relevant topics to research in her class that would interest me, since I wasn't especially interested in Medieval Arts.  Very understanding and friendly, just give her 5 min of your time!  Highly recommended!"
5290,1060641,4.0,2.0,ART 101/275/401
5291,1640234,5.0,1.0,"Very good professor. If you show up and participate, you will get a good grade. She has great reading selections and her enthusiasm for the topic shows. She is extremely understanding and if you need a coffee, she lets you go. She wants her students to succeed. Highly recommended"
5292,272175,5.0,3.0,"BIOL205 is not an easy class for many students, as you do need to study, but Prof. Field is super helpful if you're not sure how. His lectures are dense but he is always happy to clarify material. As long as you are willing to put in a bit of work on your end, he WILL help you, and he was never condescending about the &quot;dumbest&quot; of questions."
5293,272175,5.0,3.0,Dr. Field is a great professor and someone you can rely on if you have a situation and cant meet certain requirements. He is always willing to help and always makes himself available for his students. Great experience in general.
5294,272175,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Field is great. He is super quirky in the stereotypical scientist way, which makes class entertaining. He is available to help and is helpful. He makes grading criteria very clear and attainable, although grades and feedback are not timely. I learned a lot in his advanced data analysis class and recommend all biology students take it!"
5295,272175,4.0,4.0,"To clarify the EC-- attending recitation replaces your lowest test score with at least a 90% from the worksheets; it's super helpful. The recitation worksheets are pretty confusing, but you get to work in groups. Definitely go to office hours, and DO THE STUDY GUIDES HE MAKES. His class is difficult but not unmanageable, and he's a really nice guy."
5296,272175,1.0,5.0,"He honestly does not know how to relate the material to the students. He messes up a lot in lecture as well. In retrospect, he does care and wants to help, but he just makes the material so hard to comprehend. He emphasizes heavily on exams the application process of the material, but only covers the terms in class, so good luck!"
5297,272175,4.0,4.0,"Professor Field is an amazing professor. I'm in his Bio 205 class right now and I admit if you don't do the worksheets he provided, you won't do well on the exams. Do the readings, take notes, and go to his office hours with questions!!! Those are the keys to getting a good grade in his class. I wish someone told me that before the first exam."
5298,272175,2.0,4.0,"Nice guy, bad professor. He never sounded sure of what he was teaching and always got things messed up. Made the material way harder than it needed to be. He may be better for other courses, but I probably won't risk it. One positive is that he wanted us to do well and made himself assessable with lots of office hours especially around exams"
5299,272175,1.0,5.0,He confuses the material all of the time and never seems to know what is going to be on his own exams since he writes the quizzes and exams the night before. NEVER TAKE BIO 205 WITH HIM
5300,272175,1.0,3.0,He was absolutely horrible. He knew none of his material. I felt as though the the class was teaching me rather than him. He is always getting his facts mixed up and makes the class much more confusing than it should be.
5301,272175,4.0,3.0,"Professor Fields is one of the nicest most understanding professors I have had. The work load is pretty light and he gives you many opportunities to easily boost your grade if you don't do well on the weekly quizzes. Going to office hours is really helpful, he seriously wants to help you understand. He is also hilarious, I laugh every single class."
5302,272175,3.5,3.0,"Textbook basically taught the course with very select topics being covered briefly in lecture. The course was organized around scientific papers and you could bring them to the exams. Lab was disorganized, but &quot;raising&quot; cells was a cool experience. Definitely way more stress than it was worth. It is not impossible, once you learn how to study/prep"
5303,272175,2.0,5.0,"Field is honestly one of the worst prof's I have ever taken in the bio dept. He makes his exams extremely difficult, and is constantly contradicting himself. He will tell you one thing in lecture the and the exact opposite in lab. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
5304,272175,1.5,3.0,"Lecture was boring, but he wrote all notes on the board. What was most infuriating about him, besides his obnoxious rude comments, was his absurd attendance policy. Lecture was not mandatory yet each discussion session was worth 20 points of your final 600 point grade. Nothing relevant was ever discussed, and participation involved odd &quot;tickets&quot;."
5305,272175,4.0,1.0,"Honestly I don't know what the hell these other comments are talking about. Prof. Field is an incredibly nice guy, and an all-around good instructor. He made biology relatively interesting for me (a non-science major). His tests weren't at all difficult and he taught the material very well (I barely even had to consult my textbook)."
5306,272175,4.5,2.0,"He is a great guy, and he made me really interested in biology and how it applies to the world today -- which is difficult for me as an English major! As for the negative reviews: Just take notes,pay attention, and study. It's not that hard."
5307,272175,1.5,4.0,"Lecture was extremely challenging to sit through. Discussion seemed pretty useless, and I only went to get participation points. He made the subject hard to enjoy and the tests are wicked hard. Although it fulfills a natural science credit, I would not recommend this class to anybody."
5308,272175,4.0,2.0,"I wouldn't trust all of these negative comments -- you have to think what motivates people to write on this website sometimes. He's a really nice guy, is very clear, and we get a lot done in class. Plus, our discussion sections are pretty interesting and by no means am I a science-person. Just do the readings for class, take notes, and study."
5309,272175,3.5,5.0,"Field's section of 205 was definitely the hardest one of the three, and his students seemed to study more than any other section. However, he writes all the notes on the board, so if you take good notes, do the reading, and study hard, good grades are not impossible to come by. Watch out for open ended multiple choice questions!"
5310,272175,2.0,4.0,worst professor i've had at bucknell. going to class is a waste of time because you have to teach yourself everything (so plan on buying the textbook). painful to sit through. completely incompetent as an educator. and brace yourself for his  inappropriate comments
5311,272175,3.0,4.0,"Tests on notes & the most random topics only said once. Writes everything on the board, but jumps around a lot. His exams are multiple choice, but the open ended questions are hard. Open for extra help, but mostly tells you the info backwards and leaves you more confused. Do-able if you teach yourself and don't mind your prof coming in a kilt."
5312,272175,1.5,4.0,"What a joke of a professor.  Talks about random broad things during class and then gives exams that are very detailed.  Makes you think you're prepared for the exams and then gives an exam that nobody does well on.  Class is a complete and total waste of time, plan on teaching yourself everything from the book."
5313,272175,1.0,5.0,"class is waste of time as he teaches broad, general topics but expects students to know minute details from book. huge disparity between what he teaches and what you need to know."
5314,272175,3.5,5.0,Covers material in class in general detail but exam questions are often more specific.  Difficult to study for tests b/c he is vague about what material from the textbook that was not covered in class will appear on tests.
5315,272175,4.0,2.0,"He is entertaining and often makes slightly inappropiate comments which are funny, but the class is pretty dull. The tests cover material that is not covered in class and can only be found in the text book, which is frustrating. This is a good class to take if you need a lab science out of the way."
5316,272175,4.5,2.0,Great professor.  Very funny and interesting.
5317,272175,3.0,4.0,"He does write out the notes and the board and he gives you places to study from, but the lectures are pretty boring"
5318,272175,4.5,1.0,"Great teacher, easy to follow. Writes good notes on the board... tests are based off notes completely. Fair grader, if class doesnt' do well he gives extra credit points. Highly recommend. Funny teacher that makes the subject interesting"
5319,272175,4.0,3.0,No Comments
5320,272175,3.5,3.0,"He should hand out his syllabus and then list the test dates, giving extra credit for cutting. Listening to him will only bewilder you. Fortunately, he is a fair grader so just learn from the book and take the exams. IS THIS WORTH $40,000 PER YEAR&#63;"
5321,272175,2.0,4.0,"He gives clear and concise notes on the blackboard, but you don't understand them when you go back to review.  Secondly, his exams are very difficult."
5322,272175,2.0,4.0,He doesn't teach the material well and everyone ends up teaching it to themselves before the exams.
5323,272175,2.0,4.0,Lets just say that I did a better job teaching myself and understanding the material before the exams than I got out of the class
5324,1617715,5.0,2.0,"Best professor ever, she is very nice and always willing to help, but her exams are tough."
5325,679740,4.5,2.0,Slava was a summer teacher at Penn State for our Russian 2 language. He is the man.
5326,679740,4.5,3.0,"Slava was my adviser and one of the best profs I ever had.  He is amazingly brilliant if you take the time to get through the accent.  His english is good, just muddle under a thick russian accent.  The man loves his craft."
5327,679740,4.0,2.0,"Amazingly nice guy. He's really helpful and fun to talk to outside of class. Class though, can be a bore. Not to worry, if your class establishes a good rep with him in the beginning you can get away with murder in his class. He's an easy grader (expect few if any grades below a B in HUMN 98) but he makes you work for A's."
5328,679740,3.5,4.0,Took humanities seminar with him freshman year; a bit on the boring side; very nice and easy to talk to during office hours
5329,679740,3.0,2.0,"The main prob that ppl seem to have is the accent; hard to get used to. Funny guy both in and outside of class (if you take the time to listen) but I have to admit that he gets boring and most of his lectures are unclear. By himself, he's a bit better at answering your questions."

5331,1951550,5.0,3.0,Nicest professor I've ever had at Bucknell. She is incredibly helpful.
5332,737099,4.5,3.0,"Problem session with Schoepf is a fantastic idea. He is incredibly clear with explanations and can rephrase things in many different ways if you aren't getting it, or didn't understand something from lecture. Ask questions if you have them, he is eager to help his students."
5333,737099,5.0,1.0,He's extremely helpful and wants to make sure he can do anything in his power for you to succeed.
5334,737099,5.0,2.0,Super nice and helpful professor. One of the best at Bucknell.
5335,737099,4.5,2.0,"such a nice guy! really confusing subject matter but his office hours really helped, and so did doing the readings in advance. not a bad choice to get your lab requirement out of the way"
5336,737099,4.5,2.0,Great professor who loves the subject and does everything in his power to make sure his students succeed.
5337,737099,5.0,2.0,"Really friendly, nice guy.  Great teacher too - knows the subject, will really try to explain things til you get it, and will work with you for hours outside class if you need it (often extending his office hours way beyond what he needs to)."
5338,737099,5.0,2.0,A great guy - the freakin Physics department Chair. Will re-explain things if you don't understand and actually tries to help students who are confused.
5339,737099,4.5,1.0,"He knows his stuff, and he is really fun and nice. He is always willing to help, and is really easy."
5340,737099,4.0,1.0,"Amazing. VERY helpful and fun.  Although we had him for a foundation seminar, he definitly knows what he is talking about--and is willing to help out at anytime. Very laidback"
5341,2320205,5.0,5.0,Made stats work for me.
5342,2320205,5.0,4.0,Loved the 362 class. Just the right amount of statistics for a good time.
5343,2320205,5.0,3.0,"This man is the best professor of all time, he cares and makes sure you succeed.... if you do bad you just don't care about your own education"
5344,2320205,5.0,5.0,"Stats, yeah. This is the prof to take. He cares."
5345,2320205,5.0,5.0,Stats? Are you kidding? Dr. Dexter made it palatable. Love him; take his class!
5346,2320205,5.0,5.0,"Crazy stats class, but Dr. Dexter was amazing! Please take!"
5347,2320205,5.0,4.0,"Not easy, but fair. Dexter is a great professor - he really cares."
5348,2320205,4.0,4.0,Great class. I didnt think I would care as much for Disabilities. Dr. D. Made me see the light. Love him and loved this class. He really cares about you.
5349,2320205,5.0,2.0,"Dexter was my favorite professor at Bucknell. Would definitely take another class with him. Doesn't answer his emails often, but great in class."
5350,618320,4.0,3.0,"Kochel is a super cool guy who knows more about geology than anyone you will ever meet - He literally wrote the geomorph textbook for our class. With that being said, he realizes students enter the class knowing nothing so he starts basic and makes everything easy to understand. Tests can be difficult but nothing too crazy if you study."
5351,618320,4.0,2.0,Prof Kochel is very boring. He just lectures the entire class reading off a powerpoint. At least a 1/4 of the class never shows up because they don't need too. You can still do well if you show up to only 70% of the classes. The powerpoints are online and the test are fairly hard(lot of writing and details). But the class is pretty easy.
5352,618320,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, has a wealth of knowledge.  "
5353,618320,5.0,1.0,"Kochel WROTE the geomorphology textbook. If that's not enough, he draws heavily from his past research projects around the world to explain concepts, and introduces a lot of history of geomorphology. A very qualitative while enjoyable class.  Kochel is also a big armadillo fan and play music about landslides before class."
5354,618320,5.0,3.0,Great guy who is one of the smartest men I have ever met.  Very passionate for his work and a great teacher.  only bad thing is he is very liberal
5355,618320,5.0,3.0,"Sweet class. Awesome Professor, always willing to give you help. Really nice guy to talk to and to listen to in class. Class lectures are interesting, tests are challenging but go to reviews and they are cake. Also, final projects are huge but not to bad if you dont wait til last min. to do them"
5356,2686800,3.0,5.0,Probably the hardest class I have taken at Bucknell. She is smart and very nice. She expects you to know more than she teaches. The material is very tricky and she moves fast. I would have done well if the tests weren't impossible. Homework due almost every class and it would take about 3-5 hours for one problem set. 
5357,2189136,5.0,3.0,"Prof Martino made chem lab easy to understand &amp; honestly enjoyable! Labs are graded on the accuracy of calculations &amp; the process &amp; effort you out in, not whether the experiments have the correct results, which makes it easier to learn &amp; absorb info rather than stressing about the grade. I had a great semester, &amp; would definitely recommend Martino"
5358,2189136,1.0,4.0,I had a really bad experience with Martino. Didn't think he helped at all with labs and wasn't really willing to help or look over stuff. Lab was just a confusing mess of an experience that he runs. Took away from the lecture experience.
5359,2189136,4.0,2.0,"Really nice Professor. Wish I had him for every Chemistry lab. The class is a regular class: Pre-lab quiz, lab and Post-lab quiz. Do your work and you will pass."
5360,2189136,5.0,2.0,He's a super great instructor that gives clear directions!
5361,2056019,1.0,5.0,This professor does not teach and lets us watch videos recorded by Professor King from 2013. I spent most of my time doing these ridiculously large labs but still did not pay off. He does not respond to questions anywhere. I got A in all other courses but C in this. All my friends got the same or worse grades and I wonder why.
5362,2056019,5.0,3.0,Professor Dancy is class is not heavy but we still can learn a lot in his lectures. His in-class activities are super helpful to learn. Projects are heavy and are super helpful in applying the knowledge learned in class. Be aware of pop up quizzes! The weekly journal helps conclude the materials. Lots of extra credit in projects and engagements.
5363,2056019,5.0,4.0,Professor Dancy is a great lecturer. Get ready to work hard for your grades though as he is going to make you struggle from time to time. You'll end up learning a lot though
5364,2056019,5.0,3.0,"Great Prof, know him outside of class and he's very intelligent."
5365,2056019,5.0,4.0,"I just finished this class with Dancy. I had an internship interview that I rocked because of this class, which is why I'm writing this! Lots of work. Don't get behind and it'll be fine. Of all CS classes I've had, I learned more from this class than any others."
5366,2056019,4.0,3.0,Dancy is just a really solid professor. He knows his stuff and he's good at explaining everything and answering questions. In-class practice is helpful and he always has a review class before exams.
5367,2056019,4.5,3.0,Exceptional teacher. Very supportive of his students and is easy to approach and ask for assistance. Offers extra credit for attending talks on various subjects. Took him for 203 and 204 and would GREATLY recommend him to any student who wants to learn the basics of Comp Sci.
5368,2056019,4.5,3.0,Really cool guy. Very average toughness for a comp sci class. Also gives extra credit for attending speakers.
5369,2056019,3.5,4.0,"He is a new professor and has some work to go until he really knows how to get everything across well. But, that being said he does very well explaining anything you need and helps is more than happy to help you learn the material better. The labs are difficult but doable. Tests are tough but gives generous partial credit. Beware the pop quizzes."
5370,1718108,5.0,3.0,Fantastic professor! She really cares about what she is teaching and knows what she is talking about! She encourages a lot of critical thinking about the stories you read for class and the stories you write yourself. Definitely one of my favorite professors ever!
5371,1718108,5.0,1.0,"Professor Watkins is very nice, fair grader, and clear. The work load isn't that bad, and its very easy to get an A in her class if you just do the work. Highly recommended."
5372,1353568,5.0,3.0,"Gasaway is a great professor. Very engaging and fun class. Readings for every class and one page double spaced case brief once a week. Tough grader on midterm and final papers. Wish I went to meet with him before both of those, probably would've done better. I would buy a physical copy of the one textbook. It is better to highlight and participate."
5373,1353568,4.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors. He runs an engaging class, but you should be ready to participate. He is a tough grader, but is always around to help and truly cares. Lots of class discussions that are intriguing. I would take his classes again!"
5374,1353568,5.0,3.0,Prof Gasaway is one of my favorite professors! He genuinely cares about every one of his students and give everyone in class the opportunity to speak. He is also one of the few profs here that actually cares about discussing different opinions without shooting any down.
5375,1353568,5.0,2.0,Amazing prof! So engaging in his lectures and passionate about what he teaches. Appreciates well written assignments and is incredibly fair and honest about what assignments need more work and development. Absolutely recommend taking a class with him.
5376,1353568,5.0,3.0,"Very caring prof. Brings candy to class and is really sweet. Is a bit of a tough grader but fair and is willing to work with you to improve. Very smart guy, I learned a lot."
5377,1353568,5.0,3.0,"Great professor-funny, engaging, energetic, and helpful. He wants you to succeed and encourages you to email him any questions and responds very quickly. Takes the time to learn everyones names and actually cares about his students. Very cool guy, I highly recommend taking his classes."
5378,1353568,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic Professor. He engages the class better than any professor I have had, and I have learned so much. There is a lot of work, but it is very rewarding. He is a very fair grader and lets you know how to improve. If you put in the work and participate, you will do well. I would recommend this class to anyone and would absolutely take it again."
5379,1353568,5.0,2.0,My favorite class this semester! He makes the topics real interesting and always has the class engaged. Homework can be annoying but he is very chill with grading. Has really cute young daughters who came to class once or twice! Definitely taking one of his classes in the future!
5380,1353568,4.0,1.0,"Nice, loves to talk about his life, open to all kinds of perspectives. Loves class discussion. You have to read for every class, there are numerous writing assignments which are kind of a pain, but they're not difficult. As long as it's clear that you make an effort, he's not a hard grader"
5381,1353568,4.0,3.0,"He kept me interested almost the whole time and I never dreaded going to his class. While you have homework due every class, it isnt hard and doesnt take long. He was my favorite professor and I will be taking another one of his classes next semester."
5382,1353568,3.5,3.0,You definitely need to do the homework because it's checked everyday.  Keeps you interested in the topic and tells stories to start off the class.  Hard grader on papers which you have a few of per semester.
5383,2127716,5.0,3.0,"Malone teaches very well, and it's clear he has a lot of experience both in music and teaching. He assigns a lot of reading, but most of it is optional. I'd encourage people to do the reading anyways because it only makes the class better. MUSC252 gets a bad rap for being all about dead white guys (which is true), but Malone keeps it interesting."
5384,2127716,3.0,3.0,"Professor Malone is knowledgable, but tends to go on tangents that end up confusing students more. He does ear training in class everyday."
5385,2127716,5.0,4.0,"Professor Malone is both an excellent professor and a very difficult man to deal with. You will learn a lot if you work hard. The problem is that he is unprofessional, unreasonable, and petty. Students who are willing to work hard without interacting with him will do well. Those who want to meet with him or learn more will not be happy"
5386,2127716,4.0,5.0,"This class was so, freaking hard. As an extremely-hard-worker, to work really hard and still only end up with a B+ was very frustrating. I met with the professor multiple times outside of class, a few times, because he suggested it. When I went to these meetings that he suggested, he expected me to direct the discussions, instead of giving advice."
5387,2127716,5.0,3.0,"This theory class would have been much harder if Dr. Malone hadn't been such an engaging lecturer. His expansive knowledge and grasp of music theory, as well as music history, is awe-inspiring and he always makes the time to help students out and work with them when they are struggling. Attend class every day and you will be fine!"
5388,2127716,5.0,4.0,"Probably the most empathetic and helpful professors at Bucknell. Dr. Malone makes time for every student who needs help and always makes class interesting and engaging. While he assigns a lot of work, he is incredibly fair and understanding on exams"
5389,2127716,5.0,4.0,"I saw Dr. Malone was not highly rated and thought that I should set the record straight. The class isn't easy and will be a shock if you think music history is easier than other history. Expect details and to discuss music in a professional manner. However, Malone puts effort into improving his own teaching and will do anything for his students."
5390,2127716,3.0,3.0,"Expects you to do a lot of reading and listening between classes, but while this can help with the test, it is not essential (especially if you have knowledge already about music history - the course only assumes that you know basic music theory).  The class is going to be full of students who are either majors are very into music; be ready."
5391,268133,5.0,2.0,I love professor Randall so much. I highly recommend taking any IP course she offers (I took Harlem Renaissance) as she cares about her students and makes an effort to make lectures enjoyable and interesting. She's an easy A and really great to be around!!
5392,268133,5.0,1.0,"I LOVE ANNIE RANDALL if you have the opportunity to take a class with her, do it! Super easy but so much fun. She really cares so much about her students and always puts in so much work to make everything not boring"
5393,268133,5.0,1.0,"this way hands down the best course I've taken at Bucknell. Professor Randall is so amazing and always accessible to learn from or just to talk to. she's hysterical and makes class fly by. as long as you show up, the class is an easy A"
5394,268133,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Randall is extremely well-spoken and intelligent. She does a wonderful job of making sure that her students have the tools that they need to succeed. As an experienced researcher and music historian, she was able to give us excellent strategies and tips that will prove useful  throughout my entire educational and professional career."
5395,268133,5.0,2.0,"Professor Randall is one of the greatest teachers I've had. She is amazingly kind, well spoken, and intelligent. She is very clear during her classes, and makes the material very entertaining. Her tests weren't difficult because around the time of the test she covered the material so well that all students understood it. Plus, sometimes she sings."
5396,268133,4.0,1.0,She is so funny! I LOVE HER.
5397,268133,4.0,1.0,"Great teacher! We had 2 homework assignments the whole semester, and two take-home exams, and that was it! Easy A! Just put in effort on the few assignments she gives."
5398,268133,1.5,2.0,"She's easy, but quite honestly hers is the only class I ever dropped at Bucknell.  The material wasn't that bad, the grade was an easy A, I just could not stand her!! She doesn't care about her students, is completely unavailable, and extremely boring"
5399,268133,4.0,1.0,She is awsome.  Very interesting... Seems to know everything and always has a funny story to tell.. She gets off topics at times but the stories are worth it.  Her grading system is easy.  You don't have to attend class but if you don't you won't do well at all.
5400,268133,5.0,3.0,Incredible - makes everything from Renaissance music to the Beatles interesting.  For heaven's sake she had a forum on girl groups of the 60s.  I could listen to her talk forever.  You are an idiot if you don't take as many classes with her as you can.
5401,268133,1.0,1.0,"Hands down the worst class I've had here. Prof. Randall is boring and disinterested in both the subject of the course and her students. She is completely unaccessible (no office hours, never responds to email). Take her if you're looking for an easy class; if you want to learn, though, try anyone else in the music faculty (they're great)."
5402,268133,5.0,4.0,Truly the best teacher I had at Bnell - you want to listen to her forever
5403,268133,4.0,2.0,No Comments
5404,268133,5.0,3.0,shes the best teacher
5405,268133,4.5,3.0,Dont have to do reading...30% participation/30% project/20% take-home midterm/20% final
5406,268133,5.0,2.0,more professors should use her teaching style:)
5407,268133,4.0,2.0,She is a funny lady and the class goes by quickly
5408,2127721,5.0,4.0,"If you are curious about lesser-known works, join Camerata and/or University Choir! Dr. Willer is the most dedicated music director I have met in my life. She is an exemplary conductor and music interpreter and makes us laugh with her dry, witty humor. I learn so much in rehearsal because she works with every section with equal passion. 'Ray choir!"
5409,2127721,3.0,4.0,"I enjoy taking choir with Dr. Willer, but she does have high expectations for participation. The music isn't the hardest, but it can take a long time for all the sections to learn the music. I really love the treble music Dr. Willer chooses, but the SATB music is hit or miss. I recommend Dr. Willer and choir to all!! Ray choir!"
5410,2127721,4.0,2.0,"She's a good director, and has a lot of good insights into critiquing diction, vowels, and phrasing. If you are an alto, prepare for your section to be under the microscope - she's an alto herself, and claims a ""special connection"" to your part.  Textbook grade refers to the importance of having your music with you at every rehearsal."
5411,2629483,5.0,3.0,Best professor ever. Very understanding and nice! Makes something that seems kinda boring actually exciting! Great field trips!
5412,2629483,5.0,2.0,One of my favorite profs at UWT. Clearly passionate about geography and kept the lectures engaging. Hands-on lab activities were always fun. Bataa clearly cares about his students and did a great job explaining the material and answering questions. Didn't really have to worry about grades because he was lenient. 
5413,2629483,5.0,2.0,"Bataa is a wonderful and kind professor. Hes very chill, down-to-earth, and isnt crazy on grades. This is a lecture-based course and despite him recommending to the read the textbook chapters as well, I passed just from his lecture notes. Its really easy to pass and he doesnt give much work. The labs are pretty fun."
5414,55157,2.0,3.0,"I don't think I would take again. My IP course and prides himself in being a ""tough grader"" - I get that to an extent but you shouldn't pride yourself in tearing others work a part. Not a super understanding professor either - had to miss 2 classes for very valid reasons and got no email response."
5415,55157,4.0,4.0,Professor Lofgren is overall a good teacher but he assigns a lot of work and readings. This class is definitely time-consuming but I think it made me a better writer which is what I wanted to get from this class. His hard grading forced me to work harder.
5416,55157,3.0,4.0,"He is Ted Mosby. ""It's pronounced cyuuuuulinary not cullinary"" wtfu"
5417,55157,3.0,2.0,&quot;sensei&quot; is a total jerk on a power trip.  skip his class and you will avoid a lot of stress and boredom.  i otherwise had a fun and enjoyable education at Bucknell.
5418,55157,4.0,4.0,"He is one of the most interesting characters I've ever met. If you are looking for an easy A, better stay out from his classes, but in general professor like him make Bucknell great."
5419,55157,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. Enough said
5420,55157,4.5,3.0,"Really nice guy!  Great class, was the most enjoyable one I've had so far.  I recommend taking another class with him.  There is some work and reading involved, but for the most part it is interesting."
5421,55157,4.0,3.0,WE LOVE HIM!
5422,1232762,4.5,5.0,Smart guy.  Clear explanations.  Has a weird sense of humor but it can make a bland subject ok.  Not an easy grader and can respond with a lot of sarcasm to  complaints.
5423,1232762,5.0,4.0,"A great philosophy professor must render sensical the technicalia of analytic philosophy.  Hood does that exceptionally well.  His summations of the arguments were masterfully concise and informative.  Whenever necessary, he would meet with me in his office to work through proofs and to discuss the arguments generally.  The course was simply great."
5424,1232762,4.0,4.0,"Professor Hood is a superb philosopher and excellent teacher.  He has a remarkable power of understanding and explaining difficult philosophical problems, often with his devilishly delightful sense of humor.  His courses are rigorous, but college is not for idiots.  All those interested in thinking ought to take his courses."
5425,1232762,1.5,5.0,"With the material being challenging at times, Hood does not make it any easier. He spends more time thinking of his next sarcastic line rather than being more clear on the subject matter. He is very odd too, his humor is random and dull. But personality aside, the class is tedious. The tests are tough and Hood is not much help outside of the class."
5426,1232762,5.0,2.0,"Personally, I've never had an issue with Hood answering emails. He does mention in his syllabus that he may take two days or so to answer emails. Class is test-based, but he's also willing to meet and look over exercises in the text. Odd guy, but nice enough. Not a class for students who aren't self-motivated. Likes unicorns."
5427,1232762,2.0,4.0,"this professor is terrible. if you are not that interested in pursuing a degree in philosophy, take this class with someone else! he does not respond to emails because apparently he doesnt have internet at his house, but when he does they are not clear and do not answer the questions asked. do yourself a favor and DO NOT take a class with this man"
5428,1232762,2.5,4.0,he's funny until he's using his humor to belittle you. he's willing yet condescending if you approach him for help. your grade is totally test-based. i wouldn't recommend him if you don't have a good sense of humor-- his tests can make you laugh in cry within a 52 minute period.
5429,1232762,4.5,2.0,No Comments
5430,1232762,4.0,1.0,"Hood is the man. He makes hilarious jokes and teaches the material very well. He wants everyone to be on the same page. A very interesting professor, Hood is one of my favorites."
5431,1232762,2.0,4.0,"Pretty good professor overall.  Sometimes unclear in class discussions and somewhat of a difficult grader, but will help outside of class."
5432,1353596,5.0,4.0,"Curtis is the BEST professor I've ever had!! He such a great teacher and really helps you understand the content. He wants you to succeed and is so encouraging. Not only is he incredible in the classroom, but he genuinely cares about the well-being of his students and supports us both academically and mentally. I wish he taught all of my classes!!"
5433,1353596,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic professor. If you put in effort, you will do well. He might even raise your grade just for trying. Genuinely cares about how every one of his students is doing in and out of the classroom."
5434,1353596,5.0,3.0,A true gem of a professor. Cares about the students and is the most non-judgemental professor I have met. One of the few professors who make it so that you can truly focus on your learning rather than your grade.
5435,1353596,5.0,3.0,He's a great professor. Super nice. He's so energetic that it makes you want to go to class. You won't understand that much if you don't go to class. The textbook is hard to learn from. Come to class happy and excited to learn. He'll reciprocate!
5436,1353596,5.0,2.0,"I went to class once a week but still managed a B+ because Nicholls is the most understanding, helpful, and kind professor at this school. Would love to take another class with him. Hands down favorite professor I've had."
5437,1353596,4.5,2.0,Had him for two classes. Best professor in the school of management for both accounting 200 and corporate finance. Tests you need to study for but very manageable to get an A in. You have to take him before you leave. 
5438,1353596,5.0,3.0,"THE NICEST TEACHER AT BUCKNELL. Everything he does is fair and he wants you to succeed. Quizzes are easy, exams are challenging, but he prepares you well for them. Not a single complaint. "
5439,1353596,5.0,3.0,"Birds sing songs of curtis' greatness.  do whatever you can to take his classes...he is crystal clear and will make you love the material...he really knows his stuff, might be the best professor at bucknell"
5440,1353596,5.0,3.0,"awesome. best accounting professor the school has. probably one of the best in the whole school too. helpful, fair, interesting even if you're not a management or accounting major. if you get a chance, take his class."
5441,1353596,5.0,3.0,"this guy was absolutely born to teach. so upbeat and pleasant to be around. you will learn a ton of practical and useful info from his classes, regardless of your major. he wants everyone to succeed and will go the extra mile to offer help to anyone that needs it. definitely take any class with him if you can. lots of work but very worthwhile"
5442,1353596,5.0,1.0,"The greatest professor ever to walk on this planet. He will go the extra mile to help you out with any problems you have, whether it be in accounting or in life. Whether you are an accounting major or not, it is imperative that you take this class with Professor Nicholls before you leave Bucknell."
5443,1353596,4.5,4.0,Great professor! Really uses useful examples and is extremely helpful outside of class if you don't understand something.
5444,1353596,5.0,4.0,Curtis is THE MAN. Most likely the best prof. at Bucknell. He's tough but well worth it.
5445,1353596,5.0,3.0,My favorite professor at Bucknell. He is so passionate about accounting and tries as hard as he can to make sure everyone understands what he is teaching. He is super friendly and easy to ask for help. The tests were challenging but he tells you that ahead of time and if you study they aren't bad.
5446,1353596,5.0,4.0,"Curtis is amazing.  Absolutely so passionate about accounting.  He is pretty tough though, 1st test was a pain and 2nd was definitely not as bad.  He is such a nice guy you cant hate him.  I had him at 8 in the morning and I was completely awake for it..and I am not a morning person.  Take him, youll learn alot"
5447,1353596,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. Is truly passionate about accounting and is willing to help along the way. Tests are quite difficult, but if you study they aren't too bad. He drops your 2 lowest homework and quiz grades, which is beneficial. Definitely would recommend him to anyone."
5448,2080638,1.0,4.0,"Marchiori does a terrible job explaining the material in lectures. He assigned homework daily and labs weekly, which would be fine if he didn't have labs and homework due the day of an exam. We would try to discuss pushing lab to be due the next day when we had an exam, and he claimed that we weren't working hard enough or starting early enough."
5449,2080638,1.0,2.0,Rude. Bad lectures.
5450,2080638,2.5,2.0,"Not a great class - Marchiori loves computer science and will help if you sit in the right part of the room, but hes not very dedicated to his classes and doesn't have office hours unless you make an appointment. He's  not very clear, and talks really really fast. He grades fast, but doesn't really read your answer, just looks for words or numbers."
5451,2080638,5.0,1.0,The lectures are straightforward and Marchiori helps you out if you're confused. Tests are very manageable if you read the textbook / slides occasionally and work through activities. 
5452,2471808,3.0,4.0,"shes nice. gives weekly homework assignments you have the entire week to do that help you learn the material. 2 midterms + final. definitely not an easy A, helps if you have a background of Econ already from HS. boring lectures. join a study group or learn from classmates!! but shes easily accessible to answer questions ig"
5453,2471808,4.0,4.0,"Good professor. Does not assign busy work - all homework is helpful in getting you to prepare for the exams, and there isn't an unfair amount of homework. Prof. Kose writes on the whiteboard all class, I enjoyed this style of teaching but it may not be for everyone. Pay attention in class and do the homework and you will succeed!"
5454,2471808,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Kose knows the material really well and her lectures are very explanatory. She posts all her materials online, including her slideshow notes. She goes fast if that is your style. Incredibly structured course, challenging but not too hard. She actually improves in the ways students want to see after asking for course feedback. Great class."
5455,2471808,1.0,3.0,"This was by far and away the worst class I have ever taken at this school. Lecture was very disorganized with frequent errors and mistakes, slides and worksheets are from a different professor from a different university, expectations for exams were unclear. You will be teaching this class to yourself."
5456,2471808,3.0,4.0,Professor Kose's class was pretty hard for an intro econ course. Her lectures are pretty boring and often confusing. I don't think anyone got an A without joining a study group.
5457,2471808,5.0,3.0,"Very nice woman, super accessible outside of class. Really cares about her students and wants them to do well. Not an easy class, but the level of difficulty was very fair for a 300 level class."
5458,2471808,5.0,4.0,"Amazing teacher that truly challenges her students. If you get an A in her class, you must have truly mastered the material and done well. The average on exams tends to be high 70s. She is very accessible in office hours and very nice in general. 10/10 would reccomend."
5459,2471808,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Kose is a decent choice when it comes to ECON103. She has a good understanding of macro/micro econ and tries her best to present the material in the most engaging way possible. Lectures can tend to be material-heavy and feel like they drag when she goes through slides, but she does a good job of getting as much material to you as she can."
5460,1236866,5.0,3.0,Great professor and had amazing lectures. Very understanding person and willing to work with you for deadlines. Not super homework heavy which is nice.
5461,1236866,5.0,3.0,Fun class that was nice and a lot of information but overall was amazing and did a great job teaching never had a problem
5462,1236866,5.0,3.0,"Prof Gilmore is undoubtedly the best professor at Bucknell. I look forward to every class I have with him and is the reason for my passion for environmental engineering. Although he is a very tough and particular grader, he will make sure you understand the content and is always available outside of class if you don't."
5463,1236866,5.0,4.0,One of the best I ever had!
5464,1236866,5.0,2.0,"Professor Gilmore is very committed to his students.  His main objective is that the class is worth your while.  A great teacher and friend, would definitely recommend.  "
5465,1236866,4.5,4.0,Doesn't just lecture. Always has interesting brain breaks throughout class so you don't fall asleep. Very passionate about the subject matter. Never at a loss for Dad jokes to make the class more enjoyable. Incredibly caring and accommodating. I look forward to taking more classes with him.
5466,1236866,4.0,3.0,"Interesting class, made labs interesting.  Took points off for small things on pprs/lab reports.  Tests weren't too bad if you paid attn and knew how to explain/draw diagrams."
5467,1236866,3.0,4.0,"Nice guy, but a really harsh grader.  The problem is that he's very unpredictable and arbitrary with the points that he takes off. Not that fun of an experience."
5468,1628038,5.0,4.0,"Professor Waldrep is hands down my favorite professor at Bucknell. He is so inspiring and truly makes your writing better. He poses questions about your writing to make you think differently/more about your subject. He is super talented and creates an amazing, fun, inspiring and intellectual class environment. Highly recommended!!"
5469,1628038,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I've had so far! My writing improved so much during this class. I loved going! G.C. is really one of kind. I highly recommend taking a class with him!
5470,1628038,5.0,4.0,"G.C. is one of the most interesting, nurturing, and blunt professors I have ever met...sometimes you forget how INCREDIBLY intelligent he def not for long. Be prepared to challenge your writing, and you will learn a ton from him! Very clear with directions and what he wants. Use office hours, he really does want everyone to be successful."
5471,1628038,5.0,4.0,"G.C. is one of the most interesting and insightful profs at Bucknell. His willingness to broach controversial and dark issues helps facilitate a class that can delve into a subject matter much more deeply. If you can, take a class with him. We are lucky to have him at Bucknell."
5472,2731914,5.0,2.0,"A gem. Guard him with your life. So kind, really cares about his students and the subject material. He brought us dark chocolate one time so we could try the different types. Literally the best"
5473,595851,4.0,3.0,"He had a very strange dry sense of humor that helped to lighten up the classes. The exams were difficult, as you'd expect for calc 3, but the material was straight out of our classwork (lectures, homework, and reading). My one complaint is that he wouldn't let me do much work in office hours. He held the pen and wanted to write everything out."
5474,595851,1.0,4.0,"He has this wonderful habit of teaching us the most important piece of lecture in the last 20 seconds of class, meaning we can't do any example at all. Also, he either goes a mile a minute, or crawls through lecture. Very disorganized, and calls out students when they don't do well. In front of the class."
5475,595851,1.0,5.0,Very hard to follow and disorganized lectures. Didn't learn a single thing.
5476,595851,4.0,3.0,"Prof. McGuire is one of the nicest professors I've had.  He's very detailed in answering questions and really determined to get everyone understand the materials. Honestly though, his lecture is not very organized and interesting, especially if you have 8 a.m class."
5477,595851,1.0,4.0,Hard to follow on tough material. Unless you already understand the material you won't be able to understand what he's doing.
5478,595851,1.0,4.0,Worst Calculus professor I ever had. So disorganized and hard to follow.
5479,595851,3.5,3.0,"Hilarious professor, definitely take Calc II with him. Clear with his explanations for a subject that is tough. Many say Calc II is the hardest of the three calculus classes, but take McGuire and you'll be fine. Definitely would recommend!"
5480,595851,1.0,3.0,"Professor McGuire's tests are the easiest of the Calc 2 professors, but the problem is he does not teach.  His tests are all theoretically, not much ""plug and chug"".  However, he does not teach.  He rarely finishes examples or clearly answers questions.  Good professor when you can follow him, but too confusing on the harder material."
5481,595851,5.0,3.0,"McGuire is one of the best professors I have ever had.  He is extremely knowledgeable but also extremely clear.  He teaches at the perfect pace and level, making sure that students understand the conceptual, graphical, and practical aspects of the material from the get-go.  He is very funny, amiable, and caring.  He is always there to help."
5482,595851,2.0,3.0,"I've heard great things about him in the past, but he is awful for Calc 2. He doesn't actually teach the material, only goes through problems and hopes his students understand it. He rarely ever finishes problems he starts, instead saying ""you can see where this is going."" We never can. Do not take him for Calc 2 if you can avoid it."
5483,595851,5.0,2.0,He is an extremely good math teacher. He will take the time to make sure the whole class understands a concept before moving on to the next one which is really helpful.
5484,595851,4.5,3.0,"great teacher. always encouraged students to come to office hours, always interacted well with students. my only caveat would be that his lectures could sometimes be a bit tangential."
5485,595851,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! He is very clear about everything. Teaches great and very accessible after class. Only homework and tests count towards the final grade (no quiz!). He is really helpful during office hours. Often takes questions about homework before lecture. Not an easy A, but as long as you put in effort you'll be fine. Highly recommend!"
5486,595851,4.0,2.0,"Great Professor. Calculus 3 is a hard subject to explain, but McGuire did a great job.  He assigns a lot of hw, but they help a lot when it comes to taking tests."
5487,595851,4.0,3.0,He's a great guy! Not too hard and pretty helpful.
5488,595851,5.0,3.0,"I learned so much! When someone didn't understand, he explained it clearly & was really good about taking questions and giving examples. He's a great professor & was always pleasant and willing to help."
5489,595851,5.0,3.0,Great teacher! Gives lots of hw but its helpful with tests and quizzes. Hes very clear in his lectures. Great personality. Moods in the class room are great. Hes understanding takes as many questions as he can to help out any student.
5490,595851,4.0,2.0,"Such a nice guy with a good sense of humor.  Lectures are really straightforward.  Tends to assign a lot of homework that's required to be handed in, which sucked.  But, as long as you attend class and do the homework, his classes should be a breeze."
5491,595851,5.0,3.0,very helpful and really nice. he's one of the few people who can actually teach the material to anyone
5492,595851,4.0,3.0,pretty good professor - not too hard if you do all the hw and attend class
5493,595851,4.5,2.0,"this guy is laid back, has a good sense of humor, assigns alot of homework which is actually good because if you do it his tests are easy as pie. no quizzes or pop quizzes either, just 3 tests that arent that bad. its easy to get an A in this class"
5494,1634188,4.0,2.0,"She is so caring and sweet, and so quirky. She uses a lot of props but also lectures for long periods of time. Very few assignments, I get by without reading tbh. She wants the class to understand the material and play philosophical mind games."
5495,1634188,4.0,3.0,The final project was fun and she is very accommodating outside of class. She cares about her students. The only downside was that the written exams were kind of hard.
5496,1634188,5.0,2.0,A very fun and entertaining course
5497,1634188,4.0,3.0,"Professor Balcells takes the time to explain her lectures thoroughly which is good because not everything is intuitive. She gives homework that totals 2-3 hours per week on average which is doable. Very nice professor, actually cares about students"
5498,1634188,4.0,3.0,"Not a lot of homework, just reading a book and occasional articles for homework.   Graded on 2 tests, a final, and a mixtape project which is fun. She gives good study guides for the tests, and you do trivia on the class before which is helpful.  Material can get boring, but she does her best to give interesting examples."
5499,1634188,3.5,2.0,Easy class filled up with stuff thats not that interesting and that you don't really need to know. Don't need to go to class and could still pull an A. Nice lady
5500,1634188,3.5,1.0,"Fairly young and inexperienced so she didn't really seem to have a solid grasp of how much the class understood so she would repeat simple concepts a lot.  Should get better in time.  That being said, this was the easiest class I've ever taken and I did almost no work outside of class and got an A."
5501,1634188,3.0,2.0,Easy class. Second guesses herself alot which makes it easy to doubt her but she really does know what she is talking about. Just an inexperienced teacher
5502,595852,4.0,3.0,"Nina Banks gives great lectures. You must do 1 presentation at some point during the semester, Everyone gets an A unless you mess up big time. Homeworks are once a week and is a 1 page single space review of the movie u watched in the previous class.  Midterm and Final are average. Study and take good notes - questions are direct from notes."
5503,595852,5.0,3.0,Professor Banks is an amazing person and is super sweet. She has a great sense of humor and is always willing to help students outside of class. Sharing your opinion is important and showing an interest in the subject matter really makes you stand out in class.
5504,595852,5.0,3.0,I loved Professor Banks. Her class was always enjoyable and we had great discussions every day. We did not have a lot of pointless homework and the exams were comprehensive and if you pay attention in class and participate/take notes they were easy to do well on. I highly recommend taking any course she teaches.
5505,595852,5.0,2.0,"I love Professor Banks as a professor and on a personal level! She is super kind and wants you to do well but, she also wants you to put in effort and work. If you care about the subject matter and show that, Professor Banks definitely takes it into consideration."
5506,595852,3.0,4.0,"Decent teacher, can be a bit boring. Really nothing special but she's fine. Do your readings!"
5507,595852,3.0,3.0,"The tests are based on your notes so write down everything she says. Hard to do because it's boring, but you will thank yourself if you take a lot of notes. Tests are long and at night during the common hour."
5508,595852,5.0,2.0,"Professor Banks is one of the best options for Econ 103. Her lectures are engaging and quite interesting. Her grading is not complicated, as long as you show up to class and do your homework, which is only graded for completion, then you will do well. Her tests are completely taken right out of your notes; so take good notes."
5509,595852,3.5,4.0,Some fellow students struggled with this class but Nina Banks was always around for questions/office hours. She also held study sessions for our class before exams. She is a very fair professor.
5510,595852,5.0,3.0,"best econ 103 teacher. She is unbelievably caring about her students, teaches the material that needs to be taught and her tests were relatively easy. So glad to have taken her."
5511,595852,3.5,4.0,NOT an easy professor. tests are based off of notes so memorize those! lectures are boring and tests are hard and she tries to keep her test averages at 75. take if you want to study a lot and be an econ major but dont take just to fulfill requirements!!!
5512,595852,5.0,3.0,"Professor Banks was awesome for a freshman level Econ course. She made everything very easy to understand and her lectures were interesting. I would definitely recommend her to any incoming students interested in Econ. Her tests were mainly notes based, so there's not even a lot of textbook reading or use. Great professor."
5513,595852,4.5,3.0,"doesn't give that much work, but her exams are HARD"
5514,595852,4.0,3.0,"Nina Banks is a wonderful Professor.  If you do all of your work, actively participate by actually doing the readings before hand, and study for the exams you should do well.  She is a very fair grader as long as you show interest and understanding of the course material."
5515,595852,4.0,3.0,"Compared to other 103 teachers, Banks is one of the best.  Class can be a bit slow at times but you need to take good notes so that makes it go by faster.  Very clear about expectations and material.  Made econ easy to understand.  Gives very little homework and if you memorize your notes, there's not reason you shouldn't get an A on every exam."
5516,595852,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor! Made econ really easy to understand. I don't know why people gave her bad reviews they probably just didnt study for the tests. Her tests are not easy, but they are if you study the material. Tests are based only on notes which is nice so no need to buy text book because she puts it on reserve on the library if you need it for hw"
5517,595852,4.5,2.0,"Made Econ really easy...people down below don't know what they are talking about. Tests are straight from the notes, and you know exactly what to expect on tests. Also, not a lot of homework at all. Plus she's hilarious - uses examples like natty light as an inferior good in class. From what I have heard about other 103 teachers, take Banks!!!"
5518,595852,5.0,2.0,Prof Banks is a wonderful professor for 258.  The workload is fair and she is always available in office hours.  The exams and papers were challenging but not impossible.  Highly recommended!
5519,595852,5.0,3.0,Prof. Banks is by far the best Prof at Bucknell. I can't stand numbers and she made Econ fun and easy to understand for me. The other slappys probably just skipped the classes and wondered why the got bad grades. She is the best by far.  everyone is just dumb. GO head on Prof. Banks!!
5520,595852,5.0,4.0,"I don't know what everyone is talking about - I LOVED Professor Banks!  She is a pretty good teacher, very clear, answers all questions, and very helpful and accessible outside of class as well. I know she is a feminist and I sensed a true liberal, and was willing to meet with me whenever. She may seem a little cold at first, but give her a chance!"
5521,595852,1.0,5.0,"Wow...I really wish I had talked to some people about this prof.  The worst prof ever!  Although I have to admit that she is amazing at memorizing economics; word for word and example for example.  Even though she fails to demonstrate knowledge outside of the text book, she is very arrogant.  Test grades are disappointing.  Unfair grading."
5522,595852,1.5,4.0,"this class is TERRIBLY boring, banks just drones on reciting material exactly how it is in the book. you could do fine just reading the book yourself, but attendance is mandatory. TA's do everything in this class too. test are long and straightforward but she   is a nitpicky grader."
5523,192394,5.0,3.0,Professor Ulmer cares about her students and puts them in the best position to succeed as long as they are willing to show up every day and participate.
5524,192394,5.0,2.0,She is awesome. I love her class. As long as you complete the work with some level of effort you will receive an A. Her classes are very interesting and she is a great person. There is a decent amount of work in this class but nothing crazy.
5525,192394,5.0,5.0,Difficult issues
5526,192394,5.0,4.0,don't skip class
5527,192394,5.0,3.0,The best.
5528,192394,4.0,2.0,"Very knowledgeable in her field. Classes generally were a bit of lecture followed by a movie clip. Lots of outside of class reading, but that is to be expected with any foundation seminar.  She grades rather easily, but there are very few assignments that are actually graded, so each one still matters."
5529,192394,5.0,5.0,Amazing workshops and great questions; I finally understood Israel's position. She is so amazing. The best at Bucknell. Take a class with her before you graduate; you will think about the questions for ever.
5530,192394,5.0,4.0,"The discussions our course had will stay with me for ages. She is the best grader that I have ever encountered--her comments on my papers helped me transform my writing, and I am now acing nearly every writing assignment I am given. She is a professor that everyone should take before leaving Bucknell."
5531,192394,5.0,5.0,"Best professor of Religion at Bucknell. If you love learning about Jewish Culture, she is the best here. Super passionate and will talk about it with you. She is really unique but has to be one of the more engaging and better teachers at Bucknell."
5532,192394,5.0,4.0,"Professor Ulmer is AMAZING. I sincerely wish I had more time at BU because I would take a semester of just her classes. Her readings are super interesting, she lets everyone talk, and the comments she writes on papers are incredibly helpful and let me become a better writer. She's a tough grader, but she's so great that it makes up for it."
5533,192394,5.0,5.0,"awesome lady; great class. Readings are VERY interesting. new viewpoints, amny different approaches to the holocaust. She really knows her stuff. AF"
5534,192394,5.0,5.0,"she presents such sn interesting approach in evaluaing the past, present, and future."
5535,192394,5.0,4.0,Great prof! Very interesting assignemnts and discussions. She keeps it going. Expert in her field.
5536,192394,3.5,1.0,"Very, very nice. Knowledgeable, respectable. But i honestly don't feel like i learned much. Classes could be very boring."
5537,192394,5.0,5.0,"The best class at Bucknell. She is extremely knowledgeable; very kind and supports athletes. The exams are hard, you have to keep up with the readings."
5538,192394,5.0,5.0,Great Teacher; best professor at BU
5539,192394,4.0,2.0,"Extremely nice teacher and really knows her stuff.  Tests can be difficult but they do not really reflect what went on in class.  Overall, easy class, homework not necessary but helpful in class discussions.  If you participate in class, she will really work with you if your grade is slipping."
5540,192394,4.0,1.0,"VERY nice lady.  Very sympathetic to everything that's going on with you- GO TALK TO HER, and she'll love you forever.  This class was kind of all over the place, but she gave our midterm on one chapter, notes she sends us after every class, and five minutes of a movie.  TAKE A CLASS FROM HER."
5541,192394,4.5,3.0,"Extremely intelligent and interesting professor. Melodious accent. Very willing to discuss and help, in class and one on one. I learned a tremendous amount despite being overwhelmed sometimes by the volume of material we covered."
5542,46995,3.5,4.0,"Watson is probably the smartest man i know.  I've had him for several classes over the years and he continues to make me think in new ways.  I have definitely learned more in class with Watson that can be applied outside of Bucknell than any other prof.  Hes tough, but I highly reccomend him.  its worth it."
5543,46995,3.5,5.0,"MIND-BLOWING. Prof. Watson honestly changed the way I think. He challenges your opinions, beliefs, and most American notions. This class is the best I have taken at Bucknell. Like all great classes you have to be ready to work, but if you are interested in having a true college-learning experience you have to take Watson at least once."
5544,46995,4.5,3.0,"The classes I took with him (3) were the classes I learned the most from at my time at Bucknell. Incredibly well read and intelligent.Opinionated, but logical and coherent too. 3 ten-page papers and a research paper for each class. Need all the articles and chapters assigned very carefully and quote extensively. Need to take him at least once!"
5545,46995,5.0,5.0,I took three classes taught by Prof. Watson between 1996 and 2000 and they honestly changed the direction of my life. Do his coursework and lectures challenge conventional American notions of history as well as global and economic relationships&#63; Absolutely. And that is what makes his courses so valuable. Does he have his opinions&#63; Naturally. But th
5546,46995,3.5,4.0,He'll make you read until your eyes bleed. He's kinda intimidating because of his demeanor and his intelligence and he's kinda ruthless with his assignments in terms of quantity and quality. In the end though he's fair and you'll learn a lot even if you resent him the whole way through. Would i take him again&#63; no. But i gained a lot from his class.
5547,46995,3.5,2.0,"Smart guy. Challenges your thinking and critical reasoning. Opinionated but logical and clear thinking process. Can be intimidating, but you learn a lot in his classes."
5548,46995,1.0,5.0,"Horrible teacher, rude and opinionated, is very unclear,jumps around alot, his class is an hour and a half of him talking with no pauses but then gets mad at the class for not participating, 10 page papers expected regularly"
5549,46995,1.5,5.0,"He is the worst professor at Bucknell. Cold personality, unclear about what he wants, and grades with no mercy. If you have to take IR 250 with him get ready to work harder than you ever had and still get a bad grade. Avoid at all costs!"
5550,46995,4.5,2.0,"Watson is brilliant man but hard to come across. His papers are easy if you pay attention to in class.  Dont necessarily have to do all the readings, just take notes he sums everything."
5551,46995,2.0,5.0,"while brilliant, prof. watson is extremely biased and will grade you based on his biases, so you better write based off what he believes rather than what you believe if you want a good grade. he is ridiculously unclear and boring. avoid if you can"
5552,46995,2.0,5.0,"Hated this class and professor. He's very biased and is offensive, and it's hard to ever realize what he wants from your writing. I say avoid him if you can, but you can't even pick the other professor for IR250, they randomly split the students up and you're stuck. I've gotta believe it's because everyone avoids his section that they do this."
5553,46995,4.5,5.0,"hilbourne taught me how to write, read and learn in a whole new way. he is absolutely brilliant...if you take good notes and internalize how he wants things done, you will be unstoppable. make sure to participate in class too and be careful when writing your journals. he is great, esp. for theory."
5554,46995,3.0,5.0,The world of Prof Watson has been bittersweet at best for me. I have to say that he's one of the most intelligent professors I have ever had;  he academic demeanor is definitely puts him on role model status for me. HOWEVER his initial greetings seem to be quite cold and impersonal. I don't know if itis his peronality or if he's making a statement.
5555,46995,3.0,4.0,"Lecture based teaching; very hard at first, but once you get his rhythm, you'll be fine. Very challenging, but he is willing to help if you ask for it. Not the best advisor."
5556,46995,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely the most frustrating professor I've ever had.  Unclear about what he wants from you, wildly offensive during his lectures (especially if you're Catholic)...I will never take one of his classes again."
5557,46995,4.0,5.0,Never have I met anyone with such a lucid understanding of the interrelatedness and interconnectivity of so many things. He has an amazing ability to introduce a multiplicity of variables that affect an outcome or situation without loosing sight of the iss
5558,46995,5.0,4.0,"probably the least understood prof in the dept.  absolutely brilliant man, extraordinary knowledge of his material.  go in expecting to have your beliefs turned upside down.  quite thought-provoking in his theory-based courses.  takes some getting used to, but i highly recommend his courses for the open-minded and academic."
5559,46995,1.0,4.0,"Professor Watson is a horrible professor.  He is unbelievably unclear in what he wants, but when you don't give it to him, he'll not only deduct from your grade, he'll also make you feel stupid for making the mistake.  Avoid any class of his like the plague."
5560,46995,1.0,5.0,No Comments
5561,46995,1.0,5.0,"SELL OUT, oh! and NEVER allow him to be your advisor, her is absolutely incompetent at that"
5562,46995,4.0,3.0,"Hilbourne is not the worst teacher at the school! At times he may seem intimidating, but that is only because he expects a lot from his students. If you e-mail him with problems he is very helpful...Just do exactaly what he tells you to do. He is a genius"
5563,268180,5.0,2.0,"MJ is an awesome professor who really wants her students to do well. As long as you show up and turn in the assignments you should do really well. She is really funny, and the coursework is super interesting. Highly recommend taking one of her classes."
5564,268180,5.0,1.0,"MJ is the best. you don't even have to do the readings or participate just show up and look attentive. she is super caring and wants every student to do well, shes super funny and interesting to listen to. super easy grader with only one exam (super easy and she gives a study guide) and three papers which were equally as easy. would def recommend!!"
5565,268180,5.0,2.0,"MJ is AMAZING. She is undoubtedly one of the nicest professors I have met at Bucknell. Her class is pretty easy; as long as you do the readings and actively participate, you'll be fine, even though the vast majority of the course grade comes from only four assignments. The course teaches you so much about the world, too. Take her if you can!"
5566,268180,5.0,2.0,"MJ is THE best professor I've had so far. Coming from a STEM background, I can tell you that she made my life a TON easier. She's very caring, incredibly engaging, and super flexible. She makes overwhelming concepts a piece of cake. I would take every single class she teaches if I could."
5567,268180,5.0,2.0,This class was AMAZING! The reading is a lot but its super interesting so it doesn't even feel like work. The class is super engaging and MJ makes everything fun. There is an optional field trip and I would highly recommend attending as you get to spend the whole day with MJ and her family! I would take this course again if I could.
5568,268180,4.0,2.0,"Her theory class is a genuine gift to every aspiring anthropologist.  She makes the material approachable and relevant, which isn't always easy."
5569,268180,4.0,1.0,"Modern Africa is the easiest class I've taken at Bucknell. I'm getting an A and I've done 3 of the readings. It's really interesting though, Dr. Johnson is really engaged and goes out of her way to make you interested in the subject. She loves class discussion and participation and wants to spark your interest. I highly recomend her."
5570,268180,4.0,3.0,"she loves what shes talking about, she even says its her favorite class. You dont exactly have to do the reading (she outlines the reading in class) but to get an A, you should participate."
5571,268180,5.0,3.0,"My favorite (motivated me to major in anthro)!  Theory course is dry, but she always tries to find readings that spark student interest and debate.  Very good at expressing the unique worldview that characterizes anthropological scholarship.  I've been able to use skills acquired in her Methods course in many areas, including legal internships."
5572,268180,4.0,4.0,Fun teacher. The theory course is pretty rough in general but she does a good job of teaching.
5573,268180,1.0,1.0,"She's nice, but her class is very boring in how its conducted and the material, and she's not a good analyst of papers (perhaps she's not a good writer herself, I don't know) but she's an easy grade."
5574,268180,4.5,3.0,"A very enthusiastic teacher with lots of class discussion. There's a lot of reading for the class, but if you do that and participate you'll be fine, and the material's interesting. Taking her class makes me want to minor in anthropology."
5575,268180,4.5,3.0,Very energetic and excited about material.  LOVES discussion and class arguments.  Talk a lot.
5576,46997,5.0,4.0,I have spent 40 years working with and in colleges. He is the best professor I ever had the opportunity to learn from. I took every class he taught when I was at BU (Late 70s). I just want to thank him for being so inspirational. I still use some of his examples in my teaching and consider his classes the best investment I made in my education.
5577,46997,4.5,4.0,Extremely engaging.  Great classes.
5578,46997,5.0,3.0,"I took his Poli Geo and Int'l Law classes, and then was a TA for Poli Geo.  Best prof I ever had, and he made us think for ourselves, even if our ideas contrasted with his (strong) ideas.  He didn't have extremely easy exams, but they were all interesting.  And I had so much fun being a TA as well!  Fantastic guy."
5579,46997,5.0,5.0,Prof. Peterec is not only the best Prof. at Bucknell but the best prof ever.  His interest in his students was not only in the classroom but outside.  He cared about everyone.  He will be greatly misses at Bucknell.
5580,46997,5.0,3.0,"I agree with the previous guy - I had Peterec almost 20 years ago and will never forget him as one of the best, if not THE best, instructors I've ever had. The fact that we're rating him 20 years later says it all."
5581,46997,5.0,3.0,"I had this guy over twenty years ago, and I am 100% confident that there is some weird reason behind any negative comment on him.  He was the most dynamic and interesting teacher I have ever seen.  He had the best rep on campus - a SUPERSTAR.  Utterly facinating and FUN.  Even at 8 a.m.!!!  I still remember most of what he taught me about pol. geo."
5582,46997,4.5,2.0,"He has to be one of the best Politcal Geographer's in the country, this man is just an awesome presence. What I've learned in his class has allowed me to make friends and travel all over the world (except East Asia, as I have no interest). I can connect wi"
5583,46997,4.5,2.0,"Easily one of the best Politcal Geographer's in the country (based-on nothing whatsoever), this man is just an awesome presence. What I've learned in his class has allowed me to make friends and travel all over the world (except East Asia, as I have no int"
5584,46997,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Peterec's class in Fall 1969!! He made us read the NY Times every day to learn what was going on in the world. He opened our eyes to the Middle East Crisis. His passion, intensity, enthusiasm, and knowledge helped inspire me to become a high school social studies teacher. Dr. Peterec was tremendous."
5585,46997,2.5,1.0,"Highly overrated, but extremely easy"
5586,46997,2.0,1.0,Take his class if all you want out of college is a piece of paper that says you deserve X amount of money and you are good at being a parrot. Typifies everything wrong with American education.
5587,46997,5.0,5.0,He's a Master! Best professor at Bucknell.
5588,46997,1.0,3.0,Way over-rated.  Much style and no substance.
5589,46997,5.0,3.0,Political Geography was a good class
5590,46997,4.5,3.0,thanks for a good course
5591,192404,4.0,3.0,"Professor Rickard is great! He is extremely intelligent and makes all of the material fun and easy to understand and engage with. I have take two classes with him over my time at Bucknell, and he's been great. Very interesting and encourages student participation!"
5592,192404,5.0,4.0,He is super smart and one can learn so much from him!
5593,192404,5.0,3.0,"GREAT class. The material we covered is rather difficult, but Rickard manages to help make it interesting and make sense of it. Class is never boring, but make the most of it by doing the readings and GET HELP on papers early!"
5594,192404,5.0,2.0,"My favorite professor thus far at Bucknell. He is so great that I took his Survey class as well. He makes the material interesting and wants to generate stimulating discussion. Basically, do what he asks and you will get a good grade. He wants effort and wants you to succeed."
5595,192404,5.0,3.0,"Very interesting course. He always has an interesting article or video to share every lecture. Brings chocolate to class sometimes. Awesome guy. He's a great mentor. However, he seems to base his opinion of your intellect on the grade you get in his class alone."
5596,192404,4.0,3.0,"Great Professor, he was interested in the material and his students. Not an easy A class but if you do the work he will reward it. Best advice: speak up in class and go to his office hours."
5597,192404,5.0,4.0,"This is what a professor should be. He cares about his students and his material. Fair grades, but will call you on BS. Class sessions are engaging. Highly recommended."
5598,192404,4.5,3.0,"One of my favorite professors. Not an easy grader, but not an unfair one. He really loves to meet with students outside of class to discuss the material. I still talk to him about the books I'm reading all the time. Highly recommended."
5599,192404,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, I had him 1st semester for evo fictions. He is very easy going and understanding, demands a moderate amount of effort from you. Highly recommended."
5600,192404,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic prof.  Not a devastatingly hard grader, but he knows BS when he sees it.  Very helpful with papers and always specifies what he's looking for.  Very open-minded and interesting.  He's a great guy and he was my best prof by far this semester."
5601,192404,4.5,3.0,"He is awesome!  I had him for Evolutionary Fictions, and it was my best class all semester! His discussions are awesome, and there is always a lot of student participation"
5602,192404,5.0,3.0,"The way that a prof. should be.  Wants his students to learn, and very helpful with papers (he will let you rewrite a paper and combine the grades).  As an advisor, he was very helpful and went out of his way to help.  A very fair grader- I was one of the only people in my class with an A, but it was mostly engineers in a writing course. Highly rec"
5603,192404,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, great syllabus.  paper topics are completely open which is great. he loves to meet with you to discuss your paper which is very helpful. I strongly suggest going to office hours at least once before each paper is due. no tests/quizzes which takes away a lot of stress."
5604,192404,5.0,3.0,"Loved his class. His class was the only class I've looked forward to going to in a LONG time. He's great, and is SO helpful with papers."
5605,192404,5.0,4.0,"He is so interesting, and fun. He grades fairly, and the best way to get a good grade is to not do your work the night before."
5606,192404,5.0,4.0,No Comments
5607,192404,5.0,2.0,"Enjoyed his class. He wants his students to do well. Very accessible for help, make up work, etc. Good-natured and fun. Comments on tests and papers very helpful."
5608,46996,1.0,1.0,"Prof Riley's classes are TOUGH to sit through. He teaches based off of his own textbook, so don't dare to challenge the reading. If you ask a question in class, he will talk for 45 minutes using words no one understands. If you hit word count on weekly blog posts, thats half of your grade and you'll get an A. But truly sitting here is hard. "
5609,46996,3.0,3.0,"Riley means well but expects students to retain hundreds of pages of reading and remember every detail. He curves the tests, and I've heard most people get an A, but sitting through that class is brutal. He just talks and talks and talks- no room for questions or discussions. Also if you email him, don't expect him to reply."
5610,46996,5.0,4.0,"Riley gives you the honest low-down on sociology. Really valuable course. If you pay attention, you can learn a lot from him. Assignments not tough. He's not out to get you, but if you're a snowflake, you probably won't like his class because when you want to talk about your feelings, he'll ask you for evidence."
5611,46996,5.0,3.0,"Professor Riley has become one of my closest advisors here at Bucknell. Wonderful professor and an expert in his field. His lectures are long but boy, can you learn a lot from them. You can get by not reading, but the readings he assign will enrich the material covered in class as well as your general knowledge of sociology as a whole."
5612,46996,5.0,3.0,Dr. Riley is the best! One of my favorite professors at Bucknell.
5613,46996,5.0,3.0,"This is my second time taking a class with Dr. Riley and I enjoyed it just as much as the first go around. He knows his stuff, and gives some of the best (if not long-winded) lectures at Bucknell."
5614,46996,3.0,2.0,"Very intelligent prof, the course has some interesting material but GOD he is so abrasive, never lets anyone talk, and is quite rude. He just talks at you, gets lost on tangents and never covers some material. There's basically no work involved so you can get an A if you show up, semi pay attention, and survive through the class itself."
5615,46996,5.0,3.0,Professor Riley is one of my favorite professors at Bucknell. He's a brilliant guy and really helps to stimulate conversation with his own tidbits and questions he asks his students. He provides a perspective that is not seen so much amongst other members of his department and the school in general.
5616,46996,3.0,1.0,"This class was really interesting and he brought in so many different fields to discuss death. The class is meant to be discussion based, but he tended to go off on tangents which did not allow for a lot of participation. He assigned a good amount of reading and writing, but I believe he is an easy grader, especially if you participate in class."
5617,46996,5.0,3.0,"Professor Riley is by far one of my favorite professors at Bucknell. He's unbelievably intelligent and can talk with eloquence about almost any subject. His lectures are quite long - he's a talker - but they're so, so interesting and thought-provoking. He's such a funny person, too. I always looked forward to coming to class."
5618,46996,2.0,2.0,"very lecture heavy. expect reading quizzes pretty much every other class. an easy A if you show up to class, gives +10 on quiz avg. if you have perfect attendance. lectures are dry and easy to zone out. mid term and final are take home which is a plus. easy grade if you do the work and post in the moodle forums weekly. easiest A for a soci100 class"
5619,46996,1.0,4.0,Likes to go on rants and you rarely get what he's trying to say because his vocabulary is way too over the top. He wants participation but doesn't let people get a word in most of the time.
5620,46996,2.0,5.0,One of the worst classes I have every taken. For a 100 level class this guy expects way too much previous knowledge. Wants to have discussions like we're all experts in the field.
5621,46996,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting guy. I've taken two classes with him. On the first, a lot of Due Papers and Midterm and Final were papers. My second one : just quizzes. Papers are more useful to understand and apply sociological concepts to my view. Focus on a lot of different fields (neuroscience, biology, philosophy) not always useful with sociology."
5622,46996,1.0,5.0,"This professor was nearly impossible to please. 9 textbooks, read cover to cover, and he assigned papers that had no rubric or clear direction. Ambiguous grader, huge ego, seems to want students to fail. This guy has post-grad level expectations at an undergrad university. Avoid at all costs."
5623,46996,2.0,3.0,"The material of the class was interesting, so read the book.  Riley doesn't explain things well, he talks in circles and uses complicated language a lot of the time."
5624,46996,2.0,3.0,"Riley spends much of the class going off topic. He does not assign nightly homework, which is nice. However, his quizzes can be very difficult and time consuming (but it is nice that they are all take home). The midterm and final were both graded hard. It would have been a better class if there was some kind of organization."
5625,46996,2.0,3.0,He lectures the whole time and is a tough grader but I will come out of the class having an understanding for American Society from a Sociological perspective
5626,46996,4.0,3.0,"Definitely a talker, has alot of knowledge and his mind and mouth move alot faster than most, but if you show a small effort of interest in class he will help you out in any way he can. In larger classes he primarily lectures, but if you have him in a smaller class its more discussion based. One of my favorite people at Bucknell, by far."
5627,46996,4.0,3.0,"interesting person to talk with, but in lower level classes that would take place outside the classroom. with a large class it's hard because he likes to lecture. do the reading and study the questions religiously(ha ha). he will help you if you ask. i thought 211 was bleh, but later classes were much more fun. don't avoid him, choose which class."
5628,46996,1.5,3.0,"loves to hear himself talk. a class that should have had interesting discussions he just stood there and talked about reading no one did from a week ago. class has no structure, he just stands there and babbles. what a waste of what could be an awesome class."
5629,46996,3.0,2.0,"Nice guy and enthusiastic, but babbled a lot in class. Exams are straight forward (he gives you the questions). Still, you have to answer all the questions while you read or you are screwed when tests come."
5630,46996,1.0,5.0,No Comments
5631,46996,1.0,5.0,"terrible. 8 AM class where he lectures often times about nothing we are doing. he will go on tangents for about 20 minutes. his tests are insane where he will give you a fill in the blank and the answer is just a random word (cool,boring) that you barely talked about in class. AVOID."
5632,46996,1.0,5.0,He scares me.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
5633,46996,1.0,5.0,"He seems to hate all students, especially the kind of student who is really not smart enough to be in college but whose parents bought his way in anyway."
5634,46996,2.0,4.0,alexander...needs to be more organized.  tests are unpredictable... memorization--nothing conceptual. he talks to fast toward the end of class and gets on random tangents about things that arent important to testing.  this class scares me.  who knows about grades.  hes kinda funny tho.  interesting guy--shouldnt be a teacher
5635,46996,1.5,5.0,"One of the worst professors in  soci. never is clear, gives extremely hard tests, never gives you guidelines. makes you write blogs, if you don't participate you're screwed, never there for office hours, always goes off topic, talks a mile a minute and is way to intense for an 8am class."
5636,46996,3.0,2.0,He goes off on a lot of tangents and I wish that he would discuss the reading questions in more detail but he's interesting.  His tests are pretty easy.
5637,46996,5.0,1.0,"Alex is a great guy. Super funny and really easy to work with. He teaches through a lot of multi-media, movies, etc. I struggled on the midterm, but he allowed me to do a take-home version of the test instead, which I aced. Great guy."
5638,46996,2.0,4.0,"I heard he was an easy A, but he's pretty tough.  Also, class topics were strange.  He's a sociologist (e.g., social SCIENCE anyone&#63;) but we talked a lot about the soul, philosophy, art, semiology, and crazy thinkers (that focus solely on suicide and death, like Michel Lei-who&#63;).  Weird books representative of weird teacher.  And he stinks kind of."
5639,46996,1.0,5.0,Forces students to talk in class by randomly selecting them from his class printout and then makes you feel like a retard.  Hated it!  I got so upset one time I pee'd a little bit in my pants.  He's a mean person and GRADES SO HARD!  I think he was a police officer in his past.  He says he plays police games at home for fun and how he admires them.
5640,46996,5.0,1.0,"Will allow you to take make up tests and do extra credit. A real easy touch. Shows lots of movies and is funny, like crunk funny. I had a 64 average, but he let me do a number of last minute assignments to get the A I needed."
5641,46996,1.0,4.0,"VERY biased, never considered the perspectives of bigendered, Third World, anarchist-socialists of color in his lectures, it was very hurtful that he couldn't at least have an open mind, I wanted to read a poem or do an interpretive dance about my feelings in class, but he wouldn't let me."
5642,46996,1.0,4.0,"Got mad at me once because I was asleep in class, very uncool, also doesn't like students to browse online or listen to IPods during lectures, totally wack"
5643,46996,5.0,2.0,"The best professor I've had at Bucknell, basically a college student in a 40-year old person's body. Can't stop talking and loves discussion. Grading is all over the map, but fair. He gets you to think critically about the material and why it really matters to us."
5644,46996,2.5,4.0,Boring and arrogant - not into his crap
5645,46996,2.0,4.0,brings a lot of energy to class but talks faster than his mind thinks....

5647,46996,1.5,2.0,Notoriously late for return your work.  Exceedingly difficult to understand what he wants from your work.
5648,46996,4.0,3.0,Cool dude
5649,46998,5.0,3.0,"I had Travis 40 years ago. His thoughts, even teaching styles remain with me 40 years later as I try to explain complicated history/pol science themes to 18 year old that do not care. He changed my life. I was not the straight A student but I was a straight A learner. Thank you Tom and Bucknell for all that you gave me."
5650,46998,5.0,3.0,Travis is good. He cares and he has a lot to offer. Pay attention and be inspired.
5651,46998,5.0,3.0,"fantastic, fair professor"

5653,47001,4.5,4.0,"Shawe is a funny and corky guy and a lenient grader. His tests however are very difficult. If you missa lecture, you will fall behind. Office hours are extremely helpful (and you also receive extra credit). Stay on top of your game and read through his notes frequently. If you sleep through a Friday quiz, the make-ups are nearly impossible."
5654,47001,3.0,2.0,"Shawe is entertaining and funny. He's a fair grader and his quizzes and tests are fairly easy (well, as easy as organic chemistry tests can possibly be). HOWEVER if you're planning on taking the MCATs/DAT/OAT, you're screwed because he doesn't use the technical, textbook terms that you'll see on those tests."
5655,47001,3.5,3.0,He has a deep Southern accent and says things like &quot;Doggone it!&quot; He has office hours from 2-5 three days/week. He adds 5% to your final grade for appearing at office hours and/or recitation. He makes the subject interesting by using cute analogies. I've never come close to falling asleep in one of his 9 a.m. lectures... What's not to love&#63;!
5656,47001,1.5,2.0,"just awful. he talks about somali pirates, mailmen, lizards and electron hot tubs in lecture. just doesn't make sense. dont sign up for his class. take kerber or another prof."
5657,47001,4.5,4.0,211 is easy if you stay on top of things. 212 is difficult but doable. He makes it obvious what you need to know. He keeps lectures pretty entertaining too.
5658,47001,3.5,4.0,"Also had him for 211, 211 was a breeze 212 got much harder. Skips easy examples and jumps right to the difficult level. Hard to follow, but class is always interesting. He's a funny guy and plays favorites, make sure you go to lecture"
5659,47001,3.0,2.0,I actually didn't have him. I had Tillman for 211 and 212 who is really tough. All my friends in Shawe's 211 class were getting good grades while i was struggling. A couple of them switched to Tillman for 212...who proceeded to run train on and shock and awe them. If you have Shawe for 211 don't switch to Tillman or anyone else for 212.
5660,47001,2.5,4.0,"He's quirky and crazy. He hands out the notes before class, which I personally don't like, but that's the way it is. If you practice and learn the notes really well, his tests are no surprise."
5661,47001,3.5,3.0,"Also had him for 212; picks his favorites and adjust grades accordingly. Make sure you go to class and take notes because his tests are based on those notes. Doesn't explain things well, so it's hard to have him for 211 and a different teacher for 212. If you start with Shawe, stick with him, because Tillman will just be too hard"
5662,47001,2.0,4.0,"He's not the hardest professor, but he's definitely not easy. If you think you can get by with an easy A, you're horribly mistaken. You're going to have to work pretty hard just to get a B. CHEM 211 wasn't too difficult, but Shawe's CHEM 212 is VERY hard."
5663,47001,4.5,2.0,"He is the man.  He really knows his stuff and he makes his class really funny and intresting.  His tests are just like his practice tests and he is avaliable always for help.  Learn the mechanims, show up to class, and study the notes he sends and this class is pretty easy."
5664,47001,4.0,1.0,Very easy class.  He isnt the greatest teacher but he awsome in class.  Keeps class fun and interesting.  He has the best tests ever.
5665,47001,4.0,3.0,"&quot;Alright gang&quot;...Shawe is one crazy conservative.  His tests are pretty hard but if you know all the mechanisms and do the practice tests that he gives you, they are pretty much the same as the real test so you will do ok."
5666,47001,3.5,2.0,"Easy tests but not a great teacher, pretty goof for orgo1"
5667,47001,5.0,2.0,"I think that Professor Shawe is a great teacher.  He really helps his students by giving out the notes.  The tests are almost identical to the notes, so just show up to class and recitation and study your notes and you will do good in class.  I think he is a great organic professor.  He makes the subject intresting."
5668,47001,3.0,4.0,"Crazy, crazy man. It'll take time to get used to him at first, then his antics become entertaining, at times exasperating. You'll appreciate that his tests are straight from the notes. And he's a pro-student grader."
5669,47001,4.0,2.0,For lab he's pretty good unless you want someone who will be constantly babysitting you through lab.  He doesn't see a need to talk students through a long prelab - so his classes get out of lab early and don't waste time.
5670,47001,4.0,1.0,"Into what he teaches- it's no mystery that you need to study to do well in Organic Chemistry, so being lazy and not showing up to class will not cut it. If you do the optional HW problems, go through the notes after lecture and take full advantage of office hours, you should be fine- study the notes closely and redraw mechanisms to do well"
5671,47001,1.5,2.0,Seems to believe that if you're not already an advanced chemist there's no reason for you to be able to become one...Definitely picks out favorites...good luck getting class participation points if you aren't one of them...
5672,47001,2.0,3.0,note are helpful but u cant guess whats gonna b on tests/quizzes.the &#63;s are out of nowhere but dont change much from year to year.hes never given a cumalative final b4 but decided spring '06 was the perfect time to start.i had a solid A/A- in the class until the final & now im hoping for a C/C+. he plays favorites & changes final grades accordingly
5673,47001,2.0,3.0,One word: Lazy. He is unclear about the material and he'll just leave lab and go to his office and let the TAs run it. Avoid at all costs or you'll regret it.
5674,47001,1.0,5.0,"Sadistic. Puts minimal effort into teaching, has an attitude. I did well in Orgo in high school but he gives you no clue what to study for tests, etc.  Simply lazy who takes pride in making Orgo a weeder course for Bio and Chem majors... stay away and take Tillman!!!!"
5675,47001,1.0,5.0,"Get him for lab because he is a dumbass and doesn't make you do work. Most definitely do not get him for second half of orgo. The average on one of the tests was a 47 and he didn't curve it, he just laughed. There was never an average higher than 70. I did fine in the class, but it pissed me off to have to watch it."
5676,47001,4.5,3.0,"Clearly explains material, lectures completely from an overhead"
5677,47001,5.0,2.0,"Great personality, knows his stuff and teaches it to you very well"
5678,47001,3.0,3.0,The online notes are a big help. Quizzes can be difficult but his grading on tests helps to make up for it.

5685,810909,4.0,2.0,"Very nice, definitely an intro level class but tries to keep material interesting and is very clear about grading expectations"
5686,810909,5.0,3.0,"She is wonderful. Her class was awesome, I truly enjoyed every single reading we did and learned a ton."
5687,810909,5.0,1.0,She is very nice and her intro to ethics was pretty reading light
5688,810909,5.0,2.0,"Best Professor I've had at Bucknell.  Her classes are challenging but in an intellectually stimulating way.  The readings are hard, but she doesn't expect you to know everything/have gotten everything out of them before class.  Definitely participate in class discussion and go to office hours -she values your thoughts and is awesome to get to know!"
5689,810909,5.0,2.0,best teacher i've ever had! extremely interesting and passionate. such a sweet woman. makes for a very comfortable and enjoyable learning environment. DEFINITELY take one of her classes!
5690,810909,2.0,4.0,Interesting course but shes a VERY inconsistent grader. She graded shorter essays much easier than the long ones which killed my grade. I went to office hours probably 8 times to get feedback to improve my essays and ended up with a B+ after a ton of effort. Definitely not worth it for non-majors.
5691,810909,5.0,2.0,"Had her for intro to ethics as well. Extremely, extremely nice, caring and helpful person. She knows what she's talking about, as well. Just know that classes will have few grades, hard readings, and dry subject content if you know you aren't particularly interested. Recommended"
5692,810909,4.0,4.0,"Great prof and great person. Very helpful outside of class. Must be willing to participate bc it counts a lot toward your final grade. 2 challenging papers, 1 very long presentation, and 1 final research paper. Fair grader who gave lots of great feedback. If you aren't into participating and discussions then don't take her class."
5693,810909,2.0,1.0,"Very boring lectures. I hope she will retire soon. Papers were equally boring. However, the class is easy."
5694,810909,4.5,2.0,"Very good professor! She is really helpful.  Her assigned readings are tough, but if you go to class and ask her for her help, I am sure you will do well.  Just be aware that there will be very few assigments in the class"
5695,810909,5.0,3.0,Professor A presents the Ethics subject consistently and fairly. She encourages in class particpation and values any type of comment. She is one of the smartest and hard-working professors I have had at Bucknell. She takes time to grade the papers and gives detailed feedback. Overall I'm thrilled with the class and glad I took her.
5696,810909,4.5,3.0,"Very enjoyable class. The class is well organized, but not rigid. Expectations are clear, so there is a great opportunity to do well. The texts selected for reading fit well into lectures. She's also a really nice person, which makes going to class easy."
5697,810909,4.5,1.0,"Environmental Ethics is the best class I've taken at this school.  Many people see the teacher as boring, cause its basically all lecture and discussion.  But I loved the material and became involved in the discussion so I enjoyed it.  The class is super easy, she's available whenever, and she's extremely nice and approachable."
5698,810909,4.0,2.0,"Very boring readings and discussion..grade based on three main papers which were a pain to write but most people did very well on them..Shes so sweet, amazing, and smart, shes very approachable and wants to help everyone out. highly recommended, but not this acutal class (contemporary Christian ethics, mostly theory not social issues)"
5699,2473889,5.0,2.0,"She was truly an amazing teacher. Super easy class and makes content relatable. She will talk about her kids a lot, but she was a great professor to have. I wish I had her in person. As someone who wasn't an education major, I also still enjoyed this class."
5700,2473889,5.0,1.0,So sweet and understanding. My favorite class Ive taken at bucknell so far. An easy A with barely any effort put in yet I still learned a lot. Class is very relaxed and she is very nice and understanding. Very easy grader.
5701,2486184,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors in the math department. Lots of partial credit and fair grader. Exams and quizzes were not bad if you studied. You will learn a lot of MatLab. Sanjay wants everybody to succeed in the class, he makes sure everyone is learning. Very accessible outside of class. If you have the chance to take his class, do so!"
5702,2486184,5.0,4.0,Take some coding before hand. You are expected to know the basics
5703,2486184,5.0,4.0,Awesome and exciting.
5704,2486184,5.0,3.0,Sanjay is great! He genuinely cares about the well-being of all of his students and will take the time to explain concepts if you don't understand them. He is also a very fair grader who gives a lot of partial credit and is open to discussion regarding certain grades. The exams and quizzes weren't bad if you studied. Definitely recommend!
5705,546729,1.0,3.0,He is literally the meanest guy ever don't let him fool you. He only cares about himself. He is a liar. He is creepy. He should be fired. Don't take any classes with him.
5706,546729,5.0,4.0,"Truly an amazing class. Learned an insane amount. There is a ton of reading and you really can't afford to miss lectures. All tests are take home open book open internet but there will be questions that you have to have been in class and taking notes for to get right. Lectures are always very interesting, so it's a pleasure to go to class"
5707,546729,5.0,2.0,"I loved Boyatzis. He has been one of the only teachers I have had where I was genuinely engaged throughout the entire class. The material was fascinating and he really cares about what he teaches. He can be a little tough of a grader, but I have not found it to be very bad by any means. Great guy and very funny, would definitely recommend. "
5708,546729,5.0,3.0,Boyatzis is a great professor. He makes you think so differently and when you leave the class you feel more well rounded and knowledgeable about the world. I learned so much in his course and look forward to manipulating my knowledge about the psychology of children to my future family. I have taken two classes with him and would take another!
5709,546729,5.0,4.0,"Boyatzis is the most passionate person at Bucknell. He is highly opinionated and respects those who share his values but is ultimately an insightful, caring, sophisticated professor with a lot to offer. I have the utmost respect for him."
5710,546729,4.0,4.0,"Boyatzis is an incredibly intelligent and passionate professor who really knows what he's talking about. Although slightly disorganized at times (which can be pretty frustrating) I would recommend taking at least one class with him before you graduate.  It won't be an easy A, but you'll learn a lot from him."
5711,546729,3.5,4.0,"He's a good lecturer, he puts a few trick questions into his tests"
5712,546729,1.5,3.0,"I took PSYC 100 & 207 w/Prof.Boyatatzis. He seems like a likable person, but not an excellent professor. He has favorites and does not respond to emails. It's difficult to engage him in conversation, even during office hours, and there's little time for questions during class. He doesn't seem to care for students' input, perspective or originality"
5713,546729,3.0,3.0,A nice guy overall. He really does play favorites. He's a picky grader and may even grade harder on his favorites just to make the point he doesn't have favorites. He often seems too busy for students and is frequently out of his office and away from the university. The advanced developmental class was presented in a very soft headed manner.
5714,546729,3.0,4.0,"Nice person and knowledgeable professor, but very picky grader. Make sure he gets to know you personally cause he likes that. A little upsetting that he favors students though."
5715,546729,5.0,2.0,AWESOME I WOULD RECOMMEND HIM TO ANYONE. HE IS PASSIONATE AND CARES ABOUT THE STUDENTS SUCCESS AND KNOWS YOU PERSONALLY
5716,546729,5.0,4.0,"If you love psychology, take professor Boyatzis.  He is passionate and interesting and loves students who love psychology.  One of the best classes I've taken at Bucknell"
5717,546729,1.5,3.0,"The most clear, passionate teacher I've ever come across. Go to class and sit back and enjoy- he is an amazing lecturer. He is not easy, but if you have any passion in the subject you will do fine"
5718,546729,4.0,4.0,Passionate teacher that really cares about material and wants students to learn.  Tests and papers are hard but grades should be decent if you keep up with material.  Very helpful if you can catch him in his office for extra help.
5719,546729,4.0,4.0,"amazing teacher!  his tests and grading are harder than other professors I've had, but overall you learn a lot!"
5720,546729,4.5,4.0,"Definitely the most difficult intro the psych teacher, but I knew from attending a mini seminar at the incoming students open house in april of the previous year that he would be an incredibly interesting prof. Take his class if you're ready to work hard! He (and the TA) are extremely picky on tests, and even on the essays that we handed in."
5721,546729,4.5,3.0,"He's truely passionate about the material and there is a lot to learn from his class. However, his tests are way too diffucult (though they seem easy) because he is an extremely picky grader."
5722,546729,4.0,4.0,"Probably the hardest intro to psych teacher- try to avoid him. the subject material itself isn't hard but he is a hard grader, and his tests are pretty hard"
5723,546729,3.5,2.0,"cares about the material, but seems to have favorites and that is so distracting. Kids care more about if they are liked then if they can saytheir own opinion"

5725,1447849,5.0,4.0,"She's the best. Super caring and understanding and although she comes across as strict and maybe intimidating at first, she is the best. Learned and grew so much in her class - definitely worth taking her class"
5726,1447849,1.0,4.0,Worst professor I have ever encountered. DO NOT TAKE!!
5727,1447849,5.0,3.0,"Even though I had little to know background going into to the course I was able to gain insight and knowledge of the material and truly enjoyed her course. She is very helpful in office hours and personable outside of the classroom as, as well as in the classroom itself."
5728,1447849,5.0,4.0,Very helpful and likes her students.
5729,1447849,5.0,3.0,Really cares about her students! Goes over all the homework in class so definitely try to do it. Grades can be tough but with hard work you can get a good mark in this class!
5730,1447849,5.0,2.0,"Latin is not an easy language.  But she teaches it well, is very helpful, and keeps you interested.  Highly recommended."
5731,1877942,5.0,1.0,She's awesome. Easily one of the best professors I've had at this school. If you have the chance to take any of her classes you should definitely do it. 311 is very much based on class discussion and she's really good about giving genuinely interesting topics and keeping the discussions low-pressure.
5732,1877942,5.0,1.0,"Lamont is the best. She has a quirky sense of humor which makes her lectures awesome. I learned so much from her! Really looked forward to class everyday. Shes the reason I want to major in psyc. She really knows how to make everything understandable. Her tests and papers are easy and there's barely any work.  She's awesome, I highly recommend."
5733,1877942,5.0,3.0,"Smart, knowledgeable, passionate, and kind! I was exceptionally grateful for her emphasis on developing research skills, e.g. how to read scientific articles, design studies, and write a professional APA research proposal. Very helpful in office hours too. She's the prof every psych major should have, and the earlier in their time here the better!"
5734,1877942,5.0,2.0,"One of the best and easiest teachers I've had so far. She is so cute and totally into what she is teaching, making things engaging and exciting. No need to read the book at all, she teaches everything that will be tested on in class. Tests are easy and you play jeopardy the class before. This class is an easy A and is fun. "
5735,1877942,5.0,1.0,"Professor Lamont is one of my favorite professors! She is so nice and cute, and she makes going to class a pleasure. She really cares about her students and is so helpful! I'm excited to be taking another class with her this year!"
5736,1877942,5.0,1.0,Fantastic professor. Very helpful!
5737,1877942,5.0,2.0,"Hands down my favorite professor at Bucknell!! She is the sweetest, most helpful person. Very fair tests and easy grader on writing assignments. I enjoyed every minute."

5740,1808318,3.0,2.0,"Lots of readings that can be done by skimming. There are very few grades that make up the final grade and he is a very tough grader without any reasoning behind doing so. If he does not like you, good luck. "
5741,1808318,5.0,3.0,This class was so interesting. I would definitely recommend.
5742,1808318,5.0,3.0,Awesome teacher and a really funny guy. Doesn't give a lot of tests or papers but there are a lot of readings to keep up with so I found it easy to fall behind in that way but otherwise a great class.
5743,1808318,5.0,2.0,He is the best! HE makes assignments and class very interesting and I enjoyed going!
5744,1808318,4.0,3.0,Really funny guy and really teaches well. Lots of participation needed and a couple big essays and test. Other than that pretty simple grading rubric. I loved the class and learned so much even if anthro wasn't my major. Easy B+ if you do all your work and participate. You need to work a little more for the A
5745,1808318,5.0,3.0,"Great, great teacher, funny and easy to listen to in lectures.  As long as you skim the reading you'll be fine for class discussions.  Minimal actual assignments, 2 exams and 2 papers."
5746,427971,1.5,3.0,Prof. Page was a very frustrating teacher to have for lecture. Her powerpoint notes were all over the place and sometimes the notes she would post on moodle don't follow along with the slides. Random fill in the blank pop quizzes were just dumb. Would not recommend taking her. 
5747,427971,1.0,2.0,"Doesn't explain material well in lecture, had two exams in two weeks which were both scantron. "
5748,427971,3.5,3.0,"At first lectures were a bit confusing and scattered, however, as the semester went on I definitely got more accustomed to her teaching style. Random quizzes force you to stay up with course material and Dr. Page is definitely very knowledgable. I recommend joining a study group on the side / reading textbook chapters thoroughly."
5749,427971,1.5,3.0,"She was very confusing and jumped around during lectures. In my opinion, just go to class and try to understand, but really just teach yourself using the textbook. Definitely seems more suited for upper level classes."
5750,427971,1.0,2.0,"Going to class usually left me more confused about the subject than I was when I got there. She seems like she would be more equipped to teach higher level classes, because she is terrible at explaining concepts. The tests aren't too bad if you are good at memorizing, and there are a couple easy assignments."
5751,427971,2.5,3.0,"If you have taken Page before and are familiar with her teaching style, it doesn't change here. For those who get her, this is a manageable class. That being said, if you have not done well with her in the past, spare yourself the headache and take something else!"
5752,427971,3.5,4.0,"I was not a fan of Page for NEUR 100, but I think she is better suited for upper level courses. She can be goofy and entertaining during class, and she recognizes effort and understands if some concepts don't come to you at first. That being said, READ THE BOOK, as her lectures are not always the clearest, and study the figures!!!"
5753,427971,4.0,1.0,"Professor Page is the best. While her lectures can sometimes seem disorganized, she 100% reinforces the material..over and over and over again. Read the textbook, takes notes in lecture (this is key), and stay awake, and you will get an A. She is a huge believer in..use it or lose it...so review your notes regularly and quizzes will be easy too."
5754,427971,1.0,2.0,"One of the easier teachers for 205, which is just memorizing the book, with her especially memorizing the pictures from the book and naming each part of them. FOLLOWING HER LECTURE IS LIKE CHASING A FOOTBALL DOWN A HILL."
5755,427971,2.0,3.0,"She seems like she's a nice person. However, as far as class goes she's not great. She's also a fan of getting rid of necessary information on figures (such as the labels of axes AND the graph itself) and asking you to fill it in and/or write about it. Um&#63; 205 was way easy with her though."
5756,427971,1.0,5.0,Horrible professor!!! If you can avoid taking her then do so like the plague! If you have to take her be prepared to memorize the figure because she basically photocopies it and asks you to fill in the blanks of text
5757,427971,2.0,3.0,"Don't take Page if you can avoid it.  It's still very possible to do well if you do all the readings and go to class, but don't depend on her lectures to get you through."
5758,427971,1.0,4.0,"I stopped going to class and started going to the library to read the book during class time, because I didn't learn anything from her and couldn't stay awake.  She is more of a tour guide than a teacher."
5759,427971,2.5,3.0,very nice person...all over the place as far as lectures go. helpful outside of class.
5760,427971,3.0,3.0,"ok well sometimes i couldnt follow her... but for 205 its really all about the book and the powerpoints.  if youve read everything while looking at the pwrpoints, u should be able to take her tests.  you dont need to be able to spit anything out.  you just need to recognize the information. True and False!"
5761,427971,2.0,3.0,"My problem with Page is her apparent lack of knowledge in every matter other than biology.  Her test questions were incomprehensible because the grammar was so botched.  If the statements actually had verbs, they were insane runons and often contradicted themselves.  How can you determine t/f if the statement says nothing&#63; Exams NOT returned."
5762,427971,4.0,3.0,"She does go off on tangents sometimes, but eventually she ties them in. She's really into it, and really willing to help you. What she goes over A LOT in lecture is pretty much the basis of her exams, with a bunch of little details thrown in as well. It took a while to get used to her teaching style, but she's pretty cool."
5763,427971,2.0,3.0,"two exam times were scheduled for her classes, thursday and monday. she didn't tell anyone you could take the exam either day because &quot;you are all smart, you could figure it out on your own&quot;. she was 15 minutes late to the thursday exam and hadn't revised the test, had to make corrections durring the period, then was 10 minutes late on monday."
5764,427971,4.0,2.0,"Okay, she is a really nice lady and a decent teacher, even though she does go on some tangents and she takes mild offense whenever somebody doesn't understand a topic.  Better in lab than in class.  Her tests are a breeze.  I have gotten to know her realatively well and she really is a good person, people need to stop giving her such a bad rap."
5765,427971,1.5,2.0,"Do not take Page.  She cannot communicate the subject matter at all.  Her power points are most likely from years ago, and she has forgotten what is on them.  Take Heintzelman (or Pizzorno if you're lucky), you'll learn more and be less frustrated."
5766,427971,1.5,4.0,"I thought her class in general was really boring.  I had a hard time staying awake, and the fact that I couldn't stay awake while at class made it hard for me to like this class."
5767,427971,4.0,3.0,"i took 205 with her and while she doesnt hold your hand and baby you through it, its still pretty easy"
5768,427971,3.5,2.0,"She's bangin' hot. Just kidding. She's kind of unclear during lectures, but her tests aren't too bad. All you have to do is circle the correct statements from a list of true and false ones, and she tells you how many on the list are right."
5769,427971,1.0,3.0,Lectures don't have a logical progression and are very repetitive. Likes to test on minute details and trick you.  Tests are multiple multiples. Speaks down to students so much!  I come out of her office hours feeling even more stupid from her treating me that way.
5770,427971,3.5,3.0,"She apparently thinks in a circle, so she lectures the same way.  If you like to take linear notes, you will hate this course."
5771,427971,2.0,3.0,"She was always late to lab, and never stayed on topic. Makes labs a lot longer than they need to be. Tries to be funny, but she really isn't funny at all. Avoid her if possible."
5772,427971,4.0,1.0,"Professor Page is awesome for anyone who is self-motivated and is already interested in cell biology. While her lectures are somewhat disorganized and almost always repetitive, they clarify what the book muddles. Suggestion: read the book to get the detail, pay close attention to the lecture to find out what you have to know."
5773,427971,5.0,3.0,"this class has a lot of information. you need to learn how to ask questions and how to learn it on your own. page will lecture and cover the most important things. dont go into the class thinking an A will just happen. its college. work hard and focus on details, otherwise, dont take upper level biology courses. take art if you want to do nothing"
5774,427971,2.0,3.0,Goes on tangents during class all the time since her field is physiology; cannot concentrate on material. Very boring; nice; knows the material just doesn't convey it very well
5775,427971,2.5,3.0,the most disorganized professor i've ever had.  somehow every lecture turned into a lecture about big macs and Na/K ATPase-pumps...avoid her at all costs!
5776,427971,3.0,3.0,"Not sure how she is now. but she was pretty good when I was there.  She's truly in her own world though, and you have to put in more effort in upper level classes."
5777,427971,1.0,3.0,her lectures are SO boring and aimless...i slept in class all the time. her test format is also a pain in the ass...she's a bit of a space cadet
5778,427971,1.5,4.0,Extremely disorganized. Lectures were hard to follow and almost always had no point.  She is very entertaining but as far as teaching goes she just can't.
5779,427971,2.5,3.0,"You had to take her this year so it was no escape for us.  She goes in circles through the material, which might work for some people, I guess.  She also cut her time very short this semester and had to rush through major questions on the test.  Acceptable, but not recommended."
5780,47046,1.0,4.0,"All of the below comments are true. She wastes so much class time making mistakes, and her work is illegible. Her tests are made up of ridiculous/unimportant material, and the stuff she stresses is barely on the test. She is obsessed with things her way and won't update her teachings to today's technology, bc as she says, 'shes old'"
5781,47046,1.0,5.0,"AWFUL professor. Comes to class completely unprepared and makes constant mistakes on the board and has to start over multiple times to get anything right. there's often 5 minutes where she sits in the front of the class and stares at her note sheet, trying to figure out what the hell is going on. detriment to bucknell's teaching. AVOID"
5782,47046,1.0,5.0,Absolutely the worst professor I have ever had. Miserable person who enjoys seeing her students do poorly. Information not even taught encompasses the majority of her exams and she can rarely answer questions when asked. Never ever take her if you can avoid it!
5783,47046,1.5,4.0,"the recitations are her only strength, which doesn't come close to outweighing her rampant flaws. she's terrible at math, there's mistakes all over her answer sheets and in class when she does problems. the class is difficult and learning goals are unclear. the lecture is USELESS, be ready to teach yourself from the book."
5784,47046,1.0,5.0,"Awful awful teaching.  Useless information becomes suddenly relevant for tests.  She's simply getting back at the world and doing it through the teaching of general chemistry. I like the subject, but this class  is an insult to the tuition money I pay for Bucknell."
5785,47046,1.0,5.0,"She is the absolute worst professor I have ever had.  I love chem, yet I can find no redeeming features about this class.  The teaching method is slow, vague and unhelpful.  Tests are stupidly hard- things that are mentioned for 10 minutes of one lecture will make up 10% of a midterm test.  She is terrible at explaining things outside of class."
5786,47046,1.5,5.0,"she is by far the worst educator i have experience in my time on earth. i figured i could deal with her seeing as i got through orgo. with a very hard (but very good) teacher...but every day i become more confused and agrivated...she is unclear, unhelpful, hard, and makes constant mistakes on the board. our last quiz average was a 65%"
5787,47046,2.0,5.0,"cruel and unusual teaching, not really. just sort of arghhh."
5788,47046,2.5,4.0,"By far the worst prof I had this semester.  Always seemed more interested in fulfilling her administrative duties and conducting research.  More helpful in recitation, but otherwise seemed apathetic about teaching.  Don't take her if you can help it."
5789,47046,1.0,5.0,She taught the most worthless stuff in the most grueling details...Worst class I've taken. Period.
5790,47046,1.0,3.0,You will hate yourself for reading these warnings and taking her anyway.  Trust me.
5791,47046,2.0,5.0,It's as if she thinks this is the only class we take @ Bucknell.
5792,47046,3.0,5.0,I've never been assigned so much work in my life.
5793,47046,1.0,4.0,No Comments
5794,47046,1.0,5.0,Avoid her like the plague
5795,47046,1.0,4.0,don't do it
5796,47046,1.5,4.0,DONT TAKE HER!!!
5797,47048,2.5,3.0,"The class itself was difficult but he tired his best to convey the material in an easy way. In class he would often make algebra errors, but everyone does, he is only human. Tests were hard and quizzes were weekly."
5798,47048,5.0,2.0,This guy is cool.

5800,47049,4.0,3.0,"I LOVE PROFESSOR BOWEN!! Go to office hours and you'll pass the class. It is easy to get lost in his lectures, but if you talk to him one on one, he will make sure you understand the material... even if he has to say it in like 10 different ways ha"
5801,47049,4.0,1.0,"he lets you work out problems in class with your partner, and he walks around so if your stuck he can help you.  On days with quizzes he does an example that is the exact quiz question with different numbers before giving out the quiz"
5802,47049,4.5,4.0,"Amazing.  Responsible for me passing Physics and getting perfects on almost all the homework.  He is very funny and wants you to not only learn, but love the material.  Very VERY helpful in office hours.  AKA live there!!"
5803,47049,4.5,2.0,"Bowen is a great teacher, he is willing to help you understand the material, and will help you learn something that you thought you were never gonna learn.  He can be a little boring in lecture, but he puts up notes on the board that are unbeatable."
5804,47049,5.0,3.0,He is a great teacher and will go out of his way to help you.
5805,47049,4.5,4.0,"He loves his students, and it shows. He's extremely helpful if you come to office hours (even if it's just for homework help) and his lectures are interesting and helpful. It's a very tough class, but with him, you should be able to survive."
5806,47049,5.0,3.0,No Comments
5807,47049,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor.  Helpful and friendly and though he gets too excited about physics, it at least helps you stay engaged."
5808,47049,5.0,1.0,He has a lot of energy and makes the class exciting with his antics and demonstrations.
5809,47049,4.5,3.0,Makes physics fun and interesting with his in class demonstrations. Great teacher.
5810,47049,5.0,1.0,Yay for the moustache and the man that bears it.  He's great at explaining things and makes physics fun.
5811,47049,5.0,3.0,"he looks like merlin from the sword in the stone after he turned himself into a squirrel.  also, i kind of love him and his worksheets."
5812,47049,5.0,3.0,he looks like mario!!!!!!
5813,47049,4.5,3.0,I heart Prof Bowen!
5814,47049,5.0,4.0,He is a ****. Bowen knows how to make things understandable and his worksheets are very helpful. Takes time to memorize names and is a nice guy.
5815,47049,4.0,3.0,"bowen is a god among men...he makes class bearable, he's very approachable, and this evaluations are not overly difficult."
5816,47049,4.5,4.0,"Bowen is insane, but that’s good.  The insanity helps to make the complexities of physics survivable.  He keeps class interesting and is always happy to talk to his students.  His mind is a little overly physics-centric per say.  Still, I would recommend him."
5817,47049,4.0,4.0,"I hated him when I had him for lab because he's so inefficient at getting us out on time and he's pays too much attention to detail, but if I go to him for help w/ non-lab stuff, he's very nice and helpful."
5818,47049,5.0,3.0,Helpful and approachable outside of class.  Is interested in making sure that you succeed.  Great prof!
5819,47049,2.5,4.0,...

5826,47051,5.0,4.0,"Awesome professor, always willing to help you understand. Tests might be a little difficult but totally fair."
5827,47051,1.0,5.0,"she is a very kind person but an awful professor, she doesnt prepare you well at all for her tests. The tests are overly difficult and you are expected to teach yourself the entire course."
5828,47051,4.5,3.0,Really cares about students progress. Tough on no phones in class and attendance.
5829,47051,4.0,3.0,"Prof gorkin is one of the best math teachers here in the department at bucknell. She wants to see students give an effort so PLEASE go into her office hours get to know her,she is a sweet lady and will help you one on one and better you in the course you are taking. I would not recommend calc 2 to anyone,but if you have to take it with Gorkin!"
5830,47051,5.0,3.0,I'd definitely recommend her!
5831,47051,5.0,4.0,"Professor Gorkin is the sweetest woman ever. Her tests are hard and she is definitely looking for specific things in the answers, but she is always available for extra help and she has a great sense of humor. 100% recommend for any math class."
5832,47051,5.0,5.0,"Tough like beef jerky but funny like Elaine from Seinfeld, so pretty much the coolest prof evah"
5833,47051,2.0,4.0,"She's very nice but I would not recommend you take statistics with her. She doesn't test you to see if you know statistics, she tests you to see how well you can memorize tiny details that have no actual importance; it's as if she wants to take points away. The project you have to do is also poorly organized and her instructions are very unclear."
5834,47051,5.0,4.0,"She is AMAZING, she explains everything so clearly and covers everything, I never had to read the textbook for clarity.  You will need to put a lot of time into her class and the tests will be very difficult, but doable with enough effort.  Very neat, clear writing.  Couldn't be any better"
5835,47051,5.0,5.0,"Professor Gorkin is very passionate about math, and it shows through her teaching. Calc II is incredibly time consuming, but very rewarding. She's also very approachable and understanding. I would highly recommend her."
5836,47051,4.0,3.0,"She is the best math teacher I ever had. I decided to major math because of her. She loves her students, addressees your question perfectly and yeah neat hand writing. Amazing jokes! She is perfect!!!!"
5837,47051,5.0,5.0,"She's a great teacher.  She knows what she's talking about and she's very clear in class.  Just beware... her tests are brutal.  Then again, which math teacher's tests aren't&#63;"
5838,47051,5.0,5.0,She's awesome.  Just look out for her infamous tests... brutal.  Loves what she does and knows what she's talking about.
5839,47051,4.5,5.0,"She's a good professor but expects you to devote your life to math. Beware of her classes unless you have a lot of time on your hands, because you're going to need it.  Grading is very curved, but subjective and she is not always impartial with her curves. If she doesn't like you, you won't benefit from the curve."
5840,47051,3.0,4.0,"just like high school math class. which is neither interesting or enjoyable. everyone else seems to like her, so buyer beware."
5841,47051,5.0,3.0,"MATH280 is not easy, but she makes it understandable and interesting. She loves keen students and tries to give them good grades. Beautiful handwriting, helpful outside of classroom, very nice personality, definitely one of my favorite professors. HW, mini-exams, essays, presentation, midterms, and final.  I added MATH major because of this course."
5842,47051,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, very helpful. She is very good at explaining things and answering questions. Possibly the best professor that I have had at Bucknell. She doesn't make you use trig identities!"
5843,47051,4.0,3.0,"Good professor with a good attitude.  This wasn't the easiest math course I've ever had, but it was definitely worth while.  She's mild-mannered with a good sense of humor.  There are quizzes every week and homework every to every-other day."
5844,47051,4.5,3.0,"Pam is amazing...she will go out of her way to help you, all you have to do is ask.  Her teaching style is clear and she really prepares you for tests with the weekly quizes, but you do have to study.  You really learn the material.  HIGHLY recommend!"
5845,47051,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher! Extremely helpful outside of the classroom. Really wants her students to understand the material and do well. Material is difficult but her handwriting is good, she explains things clearly and makes it as easy as possible. Definetley recommend!!!!!"
5846,47051,5.0,3.0,"Pgork is a great professor.  Explains things VERY well and is helpful outside of class if you dont get it at first.  Quizes every week, 3 exams, quiz questions come directly from the homework which is collected twice a week and not graded on correctness.  If you have to take math, you want pgork."
5847,47051,5.0,3.0,Real helpful with questions
5848,47051,5.0,4.0,"I love Prof. Gorkin.  Not only is she a great professor with a sense of humor, she is one of the nicest people I know.  I loved her so much, I am taking Calc 2 with her as well."
5849,47051,5.0,4.0,"I'm definately not a math person, but I loved Prof. Gorkin's class.  She's a fabulous teacher; I actually understood what was going on! :)"
5850,47051,5.0,4.0,"She teaches like a high school teacher, which I like.  She's really nice and she's a great teacher."
5851,47051,5.0,4.0,amazing professor!  nothing more to be said.
5852,47051,5.0,4.0,Absolutely wonderful teacher.
5853,47051,5.0,5.0,"A wonderful teacher, she is helpful and has a good sense of humor."
5854,47051,4.5,4.0,good professpr overall
5855,2629581,4.0,3.0,"Professor Li is so sweet and very knowledgeable about chemistry. She is quiet so recommend sitting towards the front of the class. Although she might have trouble explaining concepts in different ways, she is always so willing to help her students and does not judge students for being confused on topics. Study her slides!!!"
5856,2629581,4.0,3.0,"Professor Li is a very nice person, and she really seems to care about her students. 205 was a lot of lectures, but I felt like her grading was always fair, and if you had a question she would walk you through it. She is kind of quiet so sitting in the front might be helpful. Overall super sweet and knowledgeable."
5857,2629581,2.0,4.0,"Professor Li is an incredibly kind person but not my favorite prof. Her entire class is lecture based and she is not a very engaging lecturer. She struggles to explain concepts in more than one way so if you are confused on something, good luck. Great person, ok teacher."
5858,2629581,4.0,3.0,"Prof Li is super sweet and very helpful. Some of her grading is a bit tough, especially for problems that have multiple parts that build on each other, but her lectures are clear and straightforward. If you go to class and recitation, you should be fine. She is a bit quiet when speaking, so try to sit towards the front in lecture."
5859,2629581,4.0,4.0,"Prof Li is such a great professor. She is good at explaining and goes through problems with you during lecture which is very helpful. Plus she cares about her students. You have to be willing to work hard for a good grade in the class though, and the exams are more difficult compared to lecture/homework problems."
5860,2629581,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Li is the best. She is very helpful and explains things really well. I was rarely lost when it came to concepts, and if I was every confused she was very accessible outside of class. I wish I could take her for orgo. The way does lecture is also helpful. She usually does an example problem and then you do one of your own that she goes over."
5861,380879,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Wade's Social Psychology course is great. His tests reflect the material he presents, and are based on course notes and information he gives.  Read the book, attend class regularly,  use the outlines he gives for every class, and take good notes and you can do well.  It is not surprising that he is an award winning teacher!!"
5862,380879,3.0,5.0,"Really good guy and you can tell he cares about his students, but his tests are very hard and grading is really tough. The grades are very test heavy. The tests are unfair and different from how we were taught material in class. No online resources, and his lectures are just him speaking with no PowerPoint or notes. "
5863,380879,5.0,3.0,Amazing lecture !!! Not a tough grader. His homework will be very helpful. His PSYC 369 and social psyc are both my favourite class. 
5864,380879,5.0,2.0,"I took Prof Wade's PSYC169 class during the summer semester as part of the BCCSP Program. Wade is extremely knowledgeable, and is respected by everyone I've met on campus. He gives good feedback and encourages participation."
5865,380879,5.0,3.0,"Professor Wade is one of the best professors I've ever had at Bucknell! The material is genuinely interesting, and he is a great person who cares about his students. It's one of those classes where you won't even bother to check the time because you're so engaged with the lectures. Although I didn't end with an A, I learned a lot and still did well"
5866,380879,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Wade is hands down one of my favorite professors at Bucknell and my absolute favorite in the psych dept. Lectures were interesting and conversational. Dr. Wade brings himself as a person into the classroom. Warm, friendly, caring and super smart. Appreciates critical thinkers. Accessible and understanding esp if you have a question or problem."
5867,380879,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Wade is one of the best Professors at Bucknell. I love his use of outlines, and how he does not use PowerPoint. His lectures are extremely clear and very organized, his tests are extremely fair. He has always been extremely helpful anytime I have gone to his Office. Take his course, it is one of the best I have ever taken at Bucknell."
5868,380879,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Wade is a good guy, but if you actually care about getting a good grade you should avoid his class. There are no power-points, lectures are hard to follow and often incoherent. Tests are ambiguous, and nearly impossible to study for. Dr. Wade is also not helpful in office hours. This class has been an extremely frustrating experience."
5869,380879,5.0,3.0,"Wade is hands down the best professor at Bucknell. He loves what he does and he takes a great interest in his students. His lectures are clear, interesting, and he loves when you ask him insightful questions. Do whatever you can to take a class with Wade because you will learn SO much"
5870,380879,5.0,2.0,"Professor Wade not only knows the material, but wants his students to know as well. His class is super interesting, and the fact that he cares so much about it makes the class even better. I HIGHLY recommend any of his classes!! No exams in 369, and lectures in 209 are well laid out so the tests are easy if you review notes from class!"
5871,380879,5.0,3.0,"Great professor! I've had Prof Wade for 2 classes, and he has been one of the most genuine, caring, brilliant, AWESOME professors I've ever had! He is so knowledgeable in his field, and wants his students to do well. I would highly recommend any class with him! :)"
5872,380879,5.0,2.0,"Wade is the man. Love going to his class, genuinely loves what he's doing and there if you need him."
5873,380879,4.0,2.0,Professor Wade is a great person! He was happy to explain anything that the students in the class were confused about. He also was happy to meet with anyone that wanted to go over things. Tests are easy and you have very little homework. Definitely take this class with Wade!!
5874,380879,5.0,3.0,"Good class, good professor"
5875,380879,5.0,2.0,"He's GREAT! Very helpful, overall nice guy. Cares about his students and really loves what he teaches"
5876,380879,3.0,2.0,Wade is a GREAT professor.  His class is extremely interesting and he's so intersted in the material. You always know what he's looking for and his short 2pg papers are painless. He does a lot of inclass activities (all interesting) and he keeps the class exciting. Great class.
5877,380879,5.0,4.0,"Great professor!  Had him for both Social Psych and Beauty and Attraction.  He makes the material clear, relevant, and fun."
5878,380879,5.0,2.0,VERY invested in his students. Cares about if you get the material. A nice guy in real life to boot.
5879,380879,4.5,3.0,Great teacher
5880,380879,5.0,3.0,"i took several courses w prof wade who to this day remains one of my two fave profs.  he really knows his area and conveys it in an interesting manner.  he is always available to help you, take your questions, or listen to comments.  he also remembers his students.  great prof! take him if you have the opportunity - it'll be your fave class at bu."
5881,380879,4.5,2.0,"Awesome proferssor! very interesting and straightforward, knows a lot! class is also pretty easy. I definitely recommend him!"
5882,380879,5.0,1.0,"His classes are wonderful, he makes everything interesting, he is fun to talk to, and insightful, one of the few professors at BU that will actually teach you something. OH! he has the sexiest voice in the universe"
5883,380879,5.0,3.0,"He's a great guy, nice, presents info clearly, and even has a senes of humor. Fun to take class with him."
5884,2451407,5.0,3.0,"Safe to say that she is the most enjoyable professor in the political science department: has a personality and can be quite abstract, but overall she makes political theory easy to apply and draw upon to evaluate politics and justice. i liked going to her office hours.  she is really welcoming and found time to help me."
5885,2451407,5.0,4.0,"This professor is charismatic and thoroughly considers different partisan viewpoints. It is hard to tell if she is conservative or liberal. Ultimately, she cares a lot about people that are poor, or otherwise disempowered, such as racial minorities. If you make arguments based on the text, she will give you a fair grade.
"
5886,2451407,5.0,4.0,"So bright and motivates you to do your best.  Chill in office hours and will help a ton of you ask for it. Also, did I mention that she is gorgeous?"
5887,2451407,4.0,3.0,Passionate about what she teaches and a fair grader.  I loved her and recommend her highly.  Unpretentious and funny.
5888,2451407,5.0,3.0,She made hard work fun!  I love this professor.  She is an inspiration and taught me so much about politics.
5889,2451407,5.0,3.0,"Professor Williams is a serious academic.  Her exams are fair and everything is covered in class. If you attend class and review lecture materials, you will do well. Funny, straightforward, and wants you to learn."
5890,2451407,5.0,3.0,"The best!  So smart, not boring. She makes incredibly hard ideas easy to understand."
5891,2451407,5.0,3.0,"Her feedback is helpful, always constructive and on point.  Really chill and not self-involved like a lot of professors can be.  She cares about you learning political theory."
5892,2451407,5.0,4.0,"Professor Williams is the most eloquent professor I have ever had a class with. I didn't mind lectures because she really has a way with words/ ideas. She is a visiting professor so definitely seize the opportunity to take a class with her! Also, go to office hours- it will save you and your grade if you are struggling!! "
5893,2451407,5.0,5.0,"Professor Williams' course is demanding, but you'll learn more in this course than other ones. It is a lot of reading, but in general, she grades fairly and is reasonable in her expectations."
5894,2451407,5.0,3.0,Clear and straightforward.  Better than other political theory courses at Bucknell -take 210 with her.
5895,2451407,5.0,4.0,Professor Williams is a true gift to the idea of learning.  She cares about what students think while also being fair and maintaining high expectations. 
5896,2451407,5.0,3.0,"Professor Williams is wonderfully unique and bright. I have to imagine that students who don&#39;t like her classes, don&#39;t like to be challenged intellectually. POLS 364 is one of the best experiences I&#39;ve had in the classroom at Bucknell."
5897,2451407,5.0,4.0,"This professor is so bright. She is more demanding than the average Bucknell professor and actually expects you to do the reading. I learned so much from Professor Williams: she is caring, intelligent, and isn&#39;t impressed by lazy students."
5898,2451407,5.0,3.0,"She is smart. If you don't read and go to lecture, you won't do well."
5899,2451407,1.0,1.0,"Terrible, has no idea what she is talking about and rambles about theories we have not even discussed in a Political Theory course. Says um, ok, right, every other word"
5900,2451407,5.0,4.0,"She grades hard, but I learned more in this class than any other Political Science course Ive taken: its worth your tuition. She is interested in an analytical response to readings: dont take her class if you dont like reading. If you like learning, study with Prof. Williams! If you want to go to law school, I highly suggest her course."
5901,2451407,5.0,3.0,"Political Theory is somewhat challenging, but Professor Williams explains topics well. Exams are extremely easy if you use the study guides and attend office hours to clarify confusion."
5902,2451407,3.0,5.0,"She knows her political theory! Even though it is abstract stuff, she makes it easy to understand. Take 210 with her."
5903,2451407,4.0,4.0,"She is so well informed about her subject and loves teaching. Take her classes at Bucknell, if you have a chance. She's also incredibly clear about her expectations."
5904,2451407,4.0,4.0,"She can be old school. She wants you to read a ton of political philosophy, but she is gifted at making it easy to understand. I also expanded my vocabulary just by listening to her. I found her friendly and funny in office hours. Go just to talk to her about whatever; she is chill. Her review sheets before exams make the course non-threatening."
5905,2451407,5.0,4.0,"Williams read drafts of my seminar paper and graded all the grammar, directed me to books that made my research seamless, and then wrote my law school rec this fall within a week of me asking for it. Way better than almost any other prof in PS that I had at Bucknell - take her seminars."
5906,2451407,5.0,4.0,"Professor Williams is so reasonable and this class is great. You learn about new biotech, reproductive justice, and pandemic politics. She is also has a good sense of humor. I laughed a lot at her jokes in class, but you have to listen for them. Really clever lady."
5907,2451407,5.0,4.0,She is better than your average Poli Sci Professor. Take pols210 with her.
5908,2451407,5.0,4.0,"If you dont read, you will not do well on assignments. Her lectures are interesting, informative, and unique."
5909,2451407,5.0,4.0,"She is quite reasonable and prepares you well for the midterm. If you read the assignments, this class is not hard."
5910,2451407,5.0,3.0,"She taught me a ton about how to write well. Her lectures tell you most of what you need to know, but don't skimp on the reading."
5911,2451407,5.0,3.0,She is so smart! She expects you to read and teaches you how to think. I would encourage any Bucknell student to take a course - major or non-major. This course taught me how to write well and I will be better for having taken it in my sophomore year.
5912,2451407,5.0,4.0,Professor Williams knows her subject well! She taught me a ton about how to write well and her expectations are transparent. I highly recommend taking political theory with her. Her grading is fair.
5913,2451407,1.0,5.0,She is the worst professor I have ever taken a class with. Her lectures bore me to death and she grades tough regardless of how much effort you show in the class. If you have any respect for education then do yourself a favor and try to take a class with another professor.
5914,2451407,1.0,3.0,"Very tough grader, goes off on lots of tangents too and cold calls all the time. Not helpful at all in trying to understand the material and is not flexible at all with grading. Readings are extremely dense and sometimes pretty hard to understand."
5915,2451407,4.0,4.0,Must do outside reading because lectures can be confusing but she's nice and very helpful meeting outside of class for clarifying concepts and help with essays.
5916,2451407,4.0,4.0,"If you are interested in the topic/motivated she is an amazing professor. Her lectures can be easy to snooze through (which is great when youre tired), but participating/engaging makes all the difference in her class. Participate and do the reading in the first months and youll get an A. A+ professor I recommend to anyone willing to read"
5917,2451407,1.0,3.0,She is an awful teacher that goes off on tangents that are not helpful when trying to understanding the material. There are no powerpoints and the pop quizzes will make or break your grade.
5918,825298,3.0,2.0,"Doesn't teach you organic chemistry, teaches you Stockland chemistry. Easy class as far as orgo goes, but if you don't get him for Orgo 2 you are in deep trouble."
5919,825298,5.0,2.0,"Stockland is what every prof should be. Really passionate about the subject, but also cares about his students and wants everyone to feel comfortable and succeed. He often will just give exact questions that will appear on quizzes and emphasizes the big themes that you should know. 100% would take again and wish more professors were like him."
5920,825298,5.0,3.0,"Stockland really cares about his students and wants them to do well. He gives a lot of extra credit, and goes over problems in class that are similar to his quizzes. He is very easy to reach outside of class, and is very passionate about chemistry. I actually love sitting in his class and learning orgo. "
5921,825298,5.0,3.0,"I've had Dr. Stockland for four classes; he's a great professor. Easy to reach outside of class and very passionate about chemistry and his students. I found his lectures clear and his optional homework very useful. I will say, if you're premed, look elsewhere. He's a great intro to pure chemistry but doesn't cover all the MCAT stuff in depth."
5922,825298,5.0,1.0,I am here to write my 4th and final review of the amazing Dr. Stockland. Does it again with his special topic class. By far my favorite course I've taken in the chem department. Read lots of papers and wrote in a journal. Our midterm/ final were the same thing with different requirements. Whole class was Stockland getting excited about his fav chem
5923,825298,5.0,5.0,"I cant talk enough about how much I love this man. 3 semesters of chem. Orgo 2 ramps up the difficulty from orgo 1 by a lot, but with Stockland, you'll be okay. He gives you so many opportunities to do better and you're never &quot;stuck&quot; with a bad grade. Don't make the mistake of not studying for quizzes bc they help and do the extra credits."
5924,825298,5.0,3.0,"Stockland is easily the best orgo prof. I've had him for 2 semesters in a row (going on a 3rd with orgo 2), and he has never disappointed. Super caring and really tries to help his students with time outside of class/ the best email responder ever. Sometimes he's not super clear on what he wants, but if you email him he will give you a yes or no."
5925,825298,5.0,3.0,"Stockland is the most caring and loving professor I've ever had. He just wants everyone to succeed. Is very fair. He curves and drops a good portions of quizzes. He hated that the CHEM 205 class was a universal test, because the exams were different than how he wanted them. Taking him for orgo next semester! Highly recommend"
5926,825298,4.0,4.0,He is one of the best professors I have had. The material in this class is challenging but he is the best professor for this course. Super helpful and really wants students to excel so he will help you wherever he can. If you listen in class and go into him for extra help you can do well. i love him!
5927,825298,5.0,2.0,"Explained material better than lecture professor, very relaxed and understanding about deadlines/making mistakes in lab, practicals were pretty difficult but labs in general were fairly simple"
5928,825298,1.0,3.0,"Absolutely terrible. Everyone told me to take him becuse he was the easiest and I regret it so much. He is such an awful teacher. Even though his exams may be ""easier"" I've never seen someone teach chemistry in such a confusing way. He makes everything so much harder than it has to be. Take a prof whos exams may be harder but is a better teacher."
5929,825298,1.0,2.0,"I had a different professor for CHEM 211 and switched into his section of 212 due to scheduling issues. I wish that I hadn't. I learned little to nothing from his exams that are basically exact replicas of his ""worksheets"". If you want to learn Stockland chemistry, take his class. If you want to learn organic chemistry, stay away."
5930,825298,5.0,4.0,"Professor Stockland is by far the most amazing professor (both 211 and 212). HE will sit with you for hours until you have mastered the material. If you understand the material, you will do wel on exams - in fact he lets the class help write them. He cares about the students who seek him out and will make you love orgo. i highly recommend him."
5931,825298,2.5,5.0,"I liked Stockland a lot for Orgo 1, but definitely not for Orgo 2. He is not clear and he rushes through about a chapter a day with little explanation beyond the powerpoints. He gives 3 large tests that make up most of your grade besides for the final and lab, but there are no quizzes or homework grades to boost it. Avoid him for this class."
5932,825298,5.0,5.0,"Professor Stockland is an incredible professor. He loves helping you outside of class and loves seeing his students succeed. Stockland's tests are all about proficiency - so if you get it, you will do well. He is really funny too. Stockland also is a great lab professor."
5933,825298,4.5,3.0,He absolutely loves what he does and wants you to succeed. He is more than willing to help you when asked. His lectures stick closely to the textbook so reading is a good supplement to his lectures!
5934,825298,4.5,3.0,"Such a gerat lab teacher! He makes all the labs quick and preps you on everything. We got out of every lab almost an hour early, if not earlier. Really helpful and a nice guy!"
5935,825298,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Stockland is an excellent teacher who is always willing to help out is students. As a bio major I was pretty scared when I first walked into 211, but after a couple lectures with Stockland all that trepidation disappeared. I really enjoyed Stocklands class and cannot wait to take him for 212! (p.s. print out slides instead of writing notes)"
5936,825298,4.0,4.0,"He is a great professor minus the fact that for exams he does not give much, if any partial credit. Put a double bond instead of a triple and you get 0 of 3 points. If you make silly mistakes or have anxiety with tests I would avoid this professor. -This is coming from a person who has been a TA for 3 years. He is picky."
5937,825298,5.0,3.0,No Comments
5938,825298,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Plans and paces the class to fit anyone's needs. Be awake in class, attend recitation, do worksheets with friends to answer questions and studying for exams will be a cake-walk. Entertaining side comments and knows all additional semi-relevant facts."
5939,825298,5.0,2.0,Such a great professor. One of the best chem professors out there. Funny and explains things really well. Very nice and cares about your success and understanding. Makes hard concepts easy. He is great!
5940,825298,5.0,4.0,"One of the best teachers I've had at Bucknell. He makes sure that everyone understands and is there for you at any given moment. He asks students what days work best for them for tests, and makes a lot of optional worksheets to help with comprehension. I absolutely loved his class"
5941,825298,5.0,2.0,Is a great teacher and a funny guy.  Has a way of making hard things easy.  Is very straitforward and was the best Chem teacher I have had here so far.
5942,1353689,4.5,3.0,One of the most phenomenal professors at Bucknell. Definitely get to know him if you have the chance to. So willing to do anything he can to help you.
5943,1353689,4.5,2.0,"This was an interesting, stimulating, rewarding, and dynamic class!  Although I chose the class because it looked like the least terrible of the Capstone options, it turned out to be one of my favorite classes at Bucknell."
5944,1353689,2.0,4.0,this teacher is aweful. he is soo boring and condescending. i hated attending his classes.. as did all of my other class mates. he has a major creep factor... dont trust this man at all. you will only do well if you do your work exactly the way he wants you to.. do exceptions.
5945,2193375,5.0,2.0,I absolutely loved having Professor Chambers! She explained course expectations and materials VERY well and is super easy going and fun. If you were struggling she was super available to meet and was just a great mentor and person to talk to.
5946,2193375,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I've had. So caring and passionate about what she is teaching. Answers questions and gives great feedback. There are no tests/quizzes, but lab periods are lots of work in and outside of class. Go to office hours! Gives chance to talk to professor and get help on work."
5947,2193375,5.0,5.0,"Moria Chambers is such a caring and dedicated professor. Her lectures are very informative and engaging. She encourages students to get extra help in office hours and she even comes in on the weekends to help students. Her tests are very demanding; since they make up most of your grade, prepare to study a lot and attend her office hours."
5948,2193375,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Chambers is easily the most devoted professor to the success of her students that I have ever had. This year she even opened up a study hours session on Sundays for students to come in and get help on study strategies. Lecture is very engaging, exam expectations are very clear and are graded fairly, and overall makes the course more enjoyable"
5949,2193375,5.0,5.0,"Her lab section is by far the most subject dense and fast paced course I've ever taken, however Professor Chambers has every facet of an outstanding professor. She's nothing short of brilliant, and she will go out of her way to help her students. Her passion for her job is equally notable. Only students devoted to science should take her class."
5950,2193375,1.0,5.0,"The only good thing about this class was the recitation grade replacing your lowest test score. Other than that, she makes you work ridiculously hard to barely pass and the tests are application based to the extreme with multiple-multiple choice. It's almost like she wants you to do poorly on them. She's nice and accessible but not super helpful."
5951,2193375,5.0,5.0,"Class was extremely difficult and she'll make you work hard for a good grade - really hard. She is ridiculously accessible, and always has office hours. If you go to office hours and ask questions or even just discuss material and do all the practice worksheets, you will do fine. Funny, nice, and amazing professor. Very clear and organized."
5952,2193375,5.0,4.0,"Professor Chambers is an amazing instructor that really cares about her students and wants you to succeed. While the course is lecture heavy, you'll be fine if you skip a couple, and office hours are a godsend, its where I learned most and got a lot of clarification. Overall you need to put in the work, and in she makes what seems boring seem cool."
5953,2193375,4.0,5.0,Professor Chambers is a good 205 professor. Her tests are extremely difficult though and require a lot of application. Be ready to apply every concept to an extreme. She is extremely helpful during office hours and she does care about her students. Lectures are hard to absorb information from.  Do the reading!
5954,49123,4.0,4.0,"Nancy White is a great professor, but a hard grader. She is truly invested in what she teaches and in the learning of her students. You will learn in this class, if you so choose. Professor White will not hold your hand and expects genuine effort and participation. Would recommend for econ students that are willing to put in the work."
5955,49123,3.0,4.0,"Prof. White really takes participation into account.  The course is your average first-year intro course, with a decent amount of busy work, but it's not too intellectually challenging.  I visited White for office hours once to get help before a test.  Never have I been regarded with contempt more, for not knowing a class concept.  She's not great."
5956,49123,5.0,3.0,Great professor! Tough at times but is sweet! The topics she covers in class are really interesting!
5957,49123,1.0,5.0,"This is the worst class I've taken and she is the worst professor I've had. She expects you to know all of the information so she doesn't help much. I've been working on a paper for over a month and consistently went to her office hours only to be told rhetorical questions that provided no help. No one in class thinks she's clear. Doesn't ""teach."""
5958,49123,1.0,5.0,Belittling and degrading to students. Very tough grader. Gives very broad questions and expects you to answer very specifically with great detail. I went to office hours where she was condescending and disrespectful and did not give me any answers I was seeking. I would take a class with anyone else before I took a class with her. 
5959,49123,4.5,2.0,"She can be pretty condescending at times, and she's not willing to work with your schedule if you are an athlete, but she's overall a good and easy professor. Just do the readings and take notes from them, and raise your hand a lot in class. Quizzes and exams are very easy, and assignments are easy and few in number."
5960,49123,1.0,5.0,"Hardest class I have ever taken at Bucknell. She doesn't teach the material very well and if you try and ask for help, unless you suck up to her so she loves you, it is extremely difficult to get extra help. The tests are reallly hard."
5961,49123,1.0,5.0,"if you love constipated professors, youd love her"
5962,49123,1.5,3.0,Professor White might be the most condescending Professor I've ever had the displeasure of having at Bucknell.  She clearly thinks her ideas and opinions trump anyone's in the class and she's not afraid to embarrass kids that she disagrees with.  She is not fair in her grading with people she doesn't like.
5963,49123,1.0,5.0,I am frustrated by how much people complain about her. Bottom line is that she is a great teacher. She has a true passion for the material and she teaches it in an un-biased way. She is very very tough and she expects a lot out of all her students. Use her office hours and show her you care about the material! The research paper is very demanding.
5964,49123,3.0,4.0,"She is a really tough grader. If you have not taken economics before you will need to study endless hours for her 2 tests which are worth more than half of the grade. Does do a good job explaining concepts, but is really tough about knowing all the details"
5965,49123,4.5,2.0,I thought she was a very good teacher. Teaches straight from the book but clarifies ideas with examples. She grades very very fairly and you deserve the grade that you get. Study hard for the tests and you will do well.
5966,49123,4.0,3.0,"She's quite nice and helpful outside of class, but in class she can be a little bit condescending.  If you don't answer in the exact fashion she wanted, she'll pretty much not say anything and move on.  The class is not overly difficult, but make sure you do the readings."
5967,49123,1.5,3.0,Not a good teacher. She doesn't teach at all. Her examples are straight from the book and she not very good. Very dry and hard to pay attention in class. She's a nice lady but you probably won't learn anything if you take the class
5968,49123,1.0,4.0,"If you do not put down the answers she's looking for in the homework assignments, you get points taken off, even if your answers are better than hers. The homework assignment questions are high-school level easy, so make sure to put high-school level answers, or she might not understand it. She talks slow, as if everyone in the class is retarded."
5969,49123,2.5,2.0,"She is the worst teacher ever. She is not capable of explaining anything. The only thing you can rely on is the book. Without the book, you would leave the course learning nothing at all... At times, her explanation is so bad that I even feel that she is not correct and not sure about what she's talking."
5970,49123,4.0,3.0,"she gets a bad rap because she doesn't baby students and let them get away with not being prepared. maybe she is not the best for 103, but once you have the basics of economics down i would HIGHLY reccommend her class... all she asks is that you be an adult and do your work and show that you care about the material that is covered. she is fantastic"
5971,49123,4.0,3.0,"If you do the readings, participate, and act interested in what she's saying, she'll love you. If you don't do the reading, she can tell and will call on you and kind of humiliate you. Her tests are definitely reasonable if you study. the course is pretty interesting too! having her is an experience... i recommend it."
5972,49123,2.0,5.0,"Worst teacher ever, she humiliated and belittled students and if you didn't do the reading you were screwed for class.  She picks favorites, she's cold and not a good teacher.  Avoid at all costs"
5973,49123,3.5,4.0,"She's not that bad.  She was frigid in the beginning of the semester but she got better as time went on.  she is kind of a hard grader but you do learn a lot.  and if you go to class and do the work, you can get a B."
5974,49123,2.0,4.0,"terrible teacher, goes straight from the book, hard grader, avoid at all cost"
5975,49123,3.5,3.0,"She's tough to figure out.  Sometimes she's a lenient grader, other times she's picky.  Sometimes she's very helpful, other times she's just condescending.  Sometimes she's easy to follow, other times she talks in circles.  Having prior experience in econ would be most beneficial for her class."
5976,49123,3.0,4.0,very hard and has a condescending attitude
5977,49123,2.0,5.0,"This teacher is by far the hardest teacher to understand at Bucknell. Basically, do not go class, just memorize the book. She only recites from the book, and does not teach anything else. She's quite cold and she is a hard grader."
5978,49123,3.5,3.0,"If you take her, you will really learn your stuff.  But, if you aren't really interested in economics or just taking econ 103 as a filler class, most people would agree not to take her.  She is a pretty tough grader.  Also, her grading policy/standards suck"
5979,49123,5.0,2.0,She gives homework problems which are very easy.  Everyone stresses for her tests but in the end she is a very fair grader.  She is very helpful and emphasizes the important points.  Easy to take notes in her class.
5980,49123,4.0,3.0,She was actually a very good teacher i thought.  If you kept up decently with the class readings and took notes in class you'll be fine.  She's a very hard grader though.  Doesn't give too much work in 103.  Right in the middle of the road i'd say.  You'll learn the material at the very least.
5981,49123,3.5,3.0,Very snotty and critical.  There are definitely better professors in the department.
5982,49123,4.5,4.0,She' tough but fair. Stupid or lazy kids need not apply.
5983,49123,4.5,4.0,"Challenging, but you'll learn the material. She'll tell you when you are wrong. Pretty much right from the book."
5984,49123,1.0,2.0,worst teacher in dept
5985,49123,1.0,3.0,wow...dont take her.
5986,49123,4.0,4.0,She sucks...
5987,49123,4.0,1.0,"She's really condescending, I thought... easy enough though considering I'd learned all of the material in high school... I guess my issue is more with the class than her."
5988,49123,4.5,4.0,"Stupid students don't like her, you need to be smart enough to do well in her course."
5989,49123,2.5,3.0,so boring and dry i dropped the class
5990,1554405,4.0,2.0,"I loved his class and also had him for RESC098. It was always upbeat and he tries to give you a break from harder classes. Consistent with HW, but it is easy assignments. It is an easy A if you put the time in. Highly recommend taking his class."
5991,1554405,4.0,1.0,"Barry Long classes are good to take if you have a loaded schedule. The classes were discussion based and he never assigned homework. I felt they were sometimes unnecessarily political. I didn't learn much, but it was nice to get familiar with jazz and hear his (sometimes) funny jokes."
5992,1554405,5.0,3.0,"Music theory at 8AM. It was a struggle getting to class but Prof. Long was always energetic even if sometimes too patient with latecomers. I liked the variety of music we covered and when we talked about practical, real-world topics. Would recommend."
5993,1554405,1.0,1.0,"Barry Long has not taught us a single piece of useful music theory information in the two very, very long semesters that we have endured his existence as our music theory professor. He takes no authority over the classroom, and demonstrates literally no desire to teach music theory. Thus, his class is extraordinarily boring and uninspiring."
5994,1554405,4.0,1.0,Classes consist of Professor Long facilitating conversations. He just tries to get his students to talk about music and its effect on society. He is really funny and loves Beyonce more than anyone else. Great guy and great class to be in.
5995,1554405,2.0,1.0,"This class was so pointless. I felt like I was wasting my time getting up for this 9am that no one seemed to care about, let alone the professor. The professor's teaching method was basically encouraging conversation, but this led to stupid arguments and a really uncomfortable setting. We had one paper, which the professor took a month to grade."
5996,1554405,5.0,2.0,Just turn your assignments before the grades are due at the END of the SEMESTER. Guaranteed A
5997,1554405,5.0,1.0,"Professor Long made my freshman year experience that much better! He is a very welcoming teacher, loves to let students express their opinions, and he encourages creativity! Highly recommend him"
5998,1554405,3.0,2.0,"Good professor, but don't take his W1 unless you are seriously into the topic. It's an easy course, but it gets very boring very quickly if you're not particularly interested in the subject."
5999,1554405,5.0,1.0,"Best teacher I ever had. His class isn't hard at all and there's barely any papers, but the class is discussion based and we get into really interesting and oftentimes fun conversations. I learn a lot despite not doing many graded assignment. If you have the option to take one of his classes, do it."
6000,1554405,5.0,1.0,"Professor Long has been one of my absolute favorite professors at Bucknell. He always kept class interesting, and I enjoyed going to class everyday. Definitely take one of his classes he's really the best."
6001,1554405,5.0,1.0,"Best Professor I've had at Bucknell.  Funny, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable, even early in the morning keeps class interesting!"
6002,1554405,5.0,1.0,Dr Long is the man. His class is interesting and varies from day to day. He is concerned with your opinion and offers inciteful responses.
6003,1554405,5.0,1.0,"Easily one of the best professors at Bucknell, take him if you can! Class is so much fun and he is such a funny and engaging teacher. Definitely the most enjoyable class I have even attended"
6004,1554405,4.5,2.0,"This guy is probably my favorite professor I've had at Bucknell. Fun, understanding, reasonable workload, and you still learn a lot! Never upset that I have to go to his class, looking forward to taking more with him."
6005,1583080,1.0,1.0,Pretty meh.
6006,1583080,5.0,5.0,"He brought his trumpet into class the last day, played in a little combo band with other students, and let us bring drinks to class. Michael is great!!"
6007,1583080,5.0,5.0,Michael is brilliant and riveting in the classroom. Plus his eloquence and great body just make me melt. Intellectually and visually stimulating!
6008,905197,5.0,1.0,Best professor at Bucknell. Don't let long classes intimidate you. He knows what he's talking about and explains things in a way that always make sense.
6009,905197,4.0,2.0,"The 3 Hour class is not that bad, he makes it go quickly. Make sure to read because participation matters. He is NOT a professor that is big on grades so he is pretty flexible."
6010,905197,4.0,3.0,"great professor - well read, intelligent, and big on class participation. He thoroughly enjoys being challenged in discussions and doesn't mind going off topic. First time I really learned how to give a professional presentation so take notes when he gives advice about speaking. do the readings because he cold calls on people."
6011,905197,4.5,4.0,He's a great Prof. He engages the class and makes a 3 hour class go by quickly. Do the reading because he tends to call people out but generally he keeps class interesting and makes the material enjoyable. No exams is also a plus.
6012,905197,3.0,3.0,"While he's an ok teacher, I also had him as an advisor. He put me off at first meeting, and it hasn't really changed. I never get this feeling from professors here; but he acts like he's too important to have time to meet with you. He's a cocky**** and just personally annoys me and some of my friends as well."
6013,905197,5.0,4.0,"Easily one of the best professors I've had at Bucknell.  Extremely helpful and understanding, and classes are very interesting."
6014,905197,5.0,4.0,"Professor Johnson-Cramer is one of the best professors at Bucknell! He is smart, interesting, and makes a 3 hour class go by quickly. He is an asset to the MGMT department... take him!"
6015,905197,5.0,4.0,"He is the man, best teacher at Bucknell. Will make you work, but class is interactive and entertaining.  He is one of the most current up-and-comming scholars in his field of stakeholder theory. Get in his class if you can."
6016,905197,2.0,3.0,ew he's soo annoyingly creepy and has a very annoying voice..thinks he's so cool i hate him
6017,905197,4.0,4.0,No Comments
6018,1812476,4.0,4.0,"I really liked Alex during the semester. However, the final was awful. We were given 1 equation on the test, and the other ~50 equations we were expected to know how to write, the written definitions of, what they applied to, and how to solve them. I went from having around a B or B+ to a final grade of a C because of that final. Just be warned!"
6019,1812476,5.0,3.0,Rice is the man don't take his class if you want an easy A but he is definitely one of the best math professors at Bucknell and pushes you in the right direction to do well in his course
6020,1812476,4.5,3.0,I loved Alex! He is extremely helpful and clear.  I had a hard time in Calc 1 last semester (my teacher was bad) but everything is so much better this semester.  Alex walks through everything step by step and makes sure people understand what's going on before he moves on. Super helpful and friendly in office hours. Liked him and the class a lot!
6021,1812476,4.0,1.0,"Alex is the man. At the beginning of the semester everything was incredibly easy. But towards the end he started to shove a lot of information into very short time frames. His teaching style is annoying if you're someone, like myself, who cannot follow when steps are skipped. He also stands directly in front of what he writes..."
