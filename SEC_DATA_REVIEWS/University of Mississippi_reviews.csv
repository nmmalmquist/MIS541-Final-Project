0,1161221,5.0,4.0,I thought her class was a little challenging but an A is possible.
1,1161221,1.0,5.0,Just a terrible person

3,1161221,4.5,4.0,"I was warned countless times not to take Jackson's News Reporting class because I would recieve unfair treatment and assignments that taught me nothing about reporting.  However, this was completely false.  Not only was Jackson's class the highlight of my semester, but I learned more about reporting in one class than I have in two years as a major."
4,1613839,1.0,5.0,He comes across as very rude and full of himself.
5,1613839,4.5,4.0,"Probably the most organized prof I've had.  With his syllabus, what you see is what you get.  He might come across as slightly cross, but he can be very helpful if you make sure he knows you take his class seriously."
6,774162,5.0,4.0,Love her!
7,774162,1.0,5.0,"She flys through content faster than a concord jet flying to London from new york, you'll never grasp any concept she teaches, minimal examples are provided during lectures. The book you're told to buy is a novel that's 90 pages with 0 content. TA's take 3weeks to grade one homework assignment, you'd be lucky to get feedback the day before an exam."
8,774162,1.0,5.0,Worst class I have ever taken in MY LIFE!!!!!
9,774162,1.0,4.0,I literally cannot figure out what is going on in this class. the lectures make no sense and there is no guidance for exams
10,774162,5.0,1.0,"She is by far my most favorite professor at Ole Miss and her class kept me afloat during freshman year.  The lectures she generates are amazing and interesting! Easy class overall, but there is a good bit of reading, 3-4 essays, and a 10 page research paper.  But she is one of the best! You will learn a lot from her!"
11,774162,4.5,1.0,I've taken almost every class she offers. I love her very much but she doesn't deviate outside her interests in the LAMSAS project and Appalachian English. She has funny kids that she's brought to class before. Lovely lady!
12,774162,5.0,3.0,"Very funny teacher! She's quite the character; makes class interesting! Her tests are challenging, yet easy. (like you think you did bad, but you did well actually). She normally tells everyone what to expect on tests."
13,774162,5.0,3.0,Amazing prof. Intro to Linguistics was one of the best classes I took in college.
14,774162,5.0,3.0,Don't take her if you don't want to be inspired to study linguistics for the rest of your life.
15,774162,5.0,3.0,"An awesome teacher, I enjoyed every class I attended and had fun writing my homework papers."
16,774162,4.5,2.0,"If you need to take Intro to Linguistics, take her section! Thoroughly, completely, and interestingly covers all the bases you'll need for every other linguistics class ever."
17,774162,5.0,3.0,"She's a great teacher!  Extremely helpful, loves the material, and makes class very interesting.  Her tests are pretty long (essay questions), but are completely fair.  As long as you study the notes, you'll be fine."
18,774162,5.0,1.0,She is hilarious :)
19,225314,1.0,4.0,I felt like studying was futile because no matter how much I studied or knew the material that the tests were still impossible
20,225314,1.0,5.0,Where to begin.... The worst grader ever. Very stuck up and thinks he is better than everyone else. Very rude. Has expectations that everyone should have the same math knowledge he does. Does not explain work at all. You get so lost so quickly in this class. 0/10 would not recommend
21,225314,4.0,4.0,Wasn't a huge fan. I had a rough time with this. Very old school
22,225314,5.0,1.0,hes hilarious and a really easy teacher.
23,225314,4.5,3.0,"funny guy, helps you if you have questions, good teacher"
24,225314,5.0,1.0,Dorrough is a class act.
25,225314,5.0,2.0,Good teacher...loved his class. A lot of fun.
26,225314,5.0,1.0,Really great teacher
27,225314,4.0,3.0,He's a nice guy during class but is kinda snobby outside of it.

30,225314,5.0,2.0,He is such a fun teacher!
31,225314,5.0,2.0,"AWESOME teacher.  best i've had in college.  very interested in making sure the students learn, often schedule after class study sessions to help even more.  wish i had him for every math class."
32,2408482,5.0,3.0,BEST PROFESSOR EVER!! TAKE HIM FOR THIS CLASS! YOU WONT REGRET IT
33,2408482,4.0,4.0,Mr. Irwin went above and beyond for his students.
34,1841197,1.0,5.0,Very smart man but cannot transfer information to his students. During lectures he usually gives easy problems while you are stuck with the hard problems for homework. These homework problems are based on a textbook that someone else wrote therefore it does not fit his material at all. This makes &quot;his&quot; homework impossible to do. Avoid him.
35,1841197,1.0,5.0,"No study material for tests. Will not reason with you if you have questions or concerns, he simply claims he is right. Very little partial credit on tests. Only good thing I can say is that the grading scale is loose."
36,1841197,1.0,4.0,"Lectures were boring and rarely useful. Failed to provide concrete formulas and examples, and refused to inform us on material to study for tests. Very intelligent man but frustrating to have as a professor. Would not recommend."
37,1841197,4.0,4.0,"He is a tough teacher - I mean that as a sincerest compliment. If you want a professor whose expectations will push you to get the grade you want, this is your best choice. He has high expectations for completing all assignments & paying attention, but this makes his tests easier than other less engaging and relaxed professors, especially for Cal 3"
38,1841197,4.0,3.0,"He's very understanding and cares about his students. The key to pass  his class is to stay focus, pay attention in class, and do your homework on time."
39,1841197,3.0,5.0,Do not take other hard classes along with his classes.
40,1841197,3.0,5.0,"He a hard teacher, but he is there to help."
41,1841197,1.5,5.0,"Don't ask him any questions, he will look at you like you are crazy. He will help you during his office hours, however. The test are extremely hard but he gives a big curve at the end of the semester."
42,1841197,3.5,4.0,"Longla will make you work for the knowledge you seek, but is also there to help you with the process."
43,1841197,3.0,3.0,"Class on Number Theory/Proofs for math majors. Dr. Longla is a smart man and wanted to be there each lecture. His lectures covered specific topics in detail, while leaving some unclear. This combined with the HORRIBLE textbook(check reviews from sites online for example), made the class difficult at times when it shouldn't be."
44,1841197,1.0,5.0,"The man is hard headed and generally unpleasant to be around during his office hours. Seems to know what he is talking about, he just isn't good at teaching it. Also makes students feel foolish if they ask questions. I barely managed to squeeze out a C- in the class, even after he curved the entire class's overall grade."
45,1841197,3.5,4.0,"Even though i thought this was a hard professor. I can say he knows his stuff and he wants you to know it as well.  The mathematics he taught were along the lines of complicated, but i realized that it was very helpful.  Now when i see a cal II problem, i see how easy they are.  For a really simple problem, now i can almost do in my head."
46,1841197,5.0,1.0,"Great communication with the class. Follows the calendar as planned, but will always go back in case of any doubts. He also explains the best way to solve any kind of problem."
47,1841197,1.0,5.0,"Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE professor. Goes too fast, hard to understand, and difficult to work with. Won't exaplain some concepts in depth, and he even began yelling at one person in my class for asking about a particular problem during class! If you need to take this class, stay away from Longla."
48,2201646,5.0,2.0,THE BEST IMC TEACHER YOU COULD EVER GET!! He has a blog about corn and if that doesn't sell you on him idk what will. I was genuinely excited to go to class everyday. He understands the material so well and makes it very applicable to everyday life. He puts his slides on blackboard and if u go to class the tests are super straight forward. TAKE HIM
49,2201646,5.0,2.0,Very passionate about IMC and makes class very engaging
50,2201646,4.0,3.0,Very good professor. Really enjoyed his class. Highly recommend taking him.
51,2056242,5.0,3.0,"This class was great! Just ask questions, he thoroughly explained every topic, making sure that all questions were answered before moving on to the next topic."
52,2056242,5.0,4.0,Great professor and grades leniently. You can miss 2 of 4 problems on a quiz and make an 80.  He also reviews the exact type of problems that will be on a test or exam the class before.  He also explains the concepts well. Definitely recommended.
53,2056242,5.0,4.0,Excellent. I wish I had Dr. Derevygin for previous courses.
54,2056242,5.0,4.0,Awesome teacher. Very helpful during office hours.
55,2056242,2.0,5.0,"The lectures are quite intense; some details are never explained clearly no matter how hard you ask. Homework is never graded, so you never get feedback; it makes you fruitlessly wonder what did you do wrong"
56,2056242,4.5,3.0,"He's very into definitions. Although, make sure you understand the problems in class. Usually, the day before a test, he will go over problems that will be on the test. He said how many problems and specifically what kind. Homework is fairly straightforward if you go to class."
57,1677371,5.0,2.0,Pretty cool guy.   Makes German interesting and also is friendly with students.   Will help you on anything and really helps familiarize you on the language (if you pay attention)
58,1339452,5.0,3.0,"She's GREAT-I really like her. The class isn't extremely easy, you have to work for it, though, you learn a whole lot and it's a 6 credit class."
59,1339452,5.0,3.0,No Comments
60,2338877,5.0,1.0,Absolutely awesome instructor! Be ready for pop culture references! I've always hated music class but he made it so much better. He wants the best for all of his students and gives great opportunities for extra credit!
61,1339451,3.0,4.0,"He is a great person! He now teaches at Mississippi College, and I had him last semester! He loves history and has so much enthusiasm when he talks about it! However, he talks about events out of order, he only gives two test and a lot of material, you dont know what will really be on the test, and he talks extremely fast!"
62,1339451,2.5,4.0,"talks super fast and out of order, hard to take notes. doesnt make sense of the events if you dont already have an understanding of the topics"
63,1339451,5.0,2.0,History is my LEAST favorite subject but Dr. Pickett made it enjoyable. I tell everyone to take him if they want to know what history teacher to take. His lecture is NOT a typical monotonous lecture that is impossible to stay focused in. He explains it like a story with enthusiasm. You can tell he really enjoys teaching history.
64,1339451,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher! Though history can be boring, he makes it fun. This is because he always seems so excited about the class. Brilliant too. On the first day of class we all told him where we were from and he told us a historical fact about the place right off the top of his head. Take his class, you won't be disappointed."
65,1339451,4.5,3.0,"Awesome teacher, laid back and willing to help with anything!"
66,2129982,4.0,2.0,"She is very kind and considerate of her students, even those who get stage fright. If you show up the day you give your speech you are guaranteed a B. She also did online, un-timed, open-book quizs for my class. She is an easy A, and the best teacher you can get at the school for a speech class if you are anxious about public speaking."
67,2129982,4.5,2.0,She is very helpful and kind. I had health issues and she worked with me to get my work done. She is willing to help you just have to ask. It is not a hard class you just have to do your work.
68,2687044,5.0,3.0,"Professor Johnson wants everyone to succeed. She lectures over the material, works out examples that will be on exams, and even hands out guided notes if you go to her lectures. Don't blow this class off because you do need to work out problems in order to do well on the exams (same problems she works in class)."
69,2687044,3.0,3.0,She is fine when it comes to lectures and she does engage with the class but she can be annoyingly strict with things like deadlines and homework and not allowing drop tests or students who've done well on all the other tests to skip the final. She is good and you can definitely do much worse
70,2687044,4.0,3.0,I loved her as a professor. The class was on zoom &amp; she spoke clearly &amp; gave clear examples and descriptions for homework. Consistent office hours. Hand grades work-out problems. The class was pretty hard but the free tutoring hours and homework helped.
71,2693189,5.0,1.0,"Ms Brewer is a really great instructor. Her class is built on allowing students to succeed. She is very available for help, and will do everything she can to help you pass. Her assignments are very simple and easy to do. It is an easy A, but also a very fun class."
72,2730064,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Lee is currently the only Korean professor at Ole Miss so if you need Korean (for your career path), youre kind of stuck with her. However, if you want to take Korean as a pleasure class or to complete your language requirement - I dont recommend her at all. Doesnt care about students, moves very fast, and is less helpful than the textbook."
73,2818130,1.0,5.0,never ever 
74,2164820,5.0,3.0,Pretty amazing class actually
75,2164820,5.0,3.0,Would definitely take again!
76,2164820,5.0,3.0,"His stats class was pretty awesome, there was a lot to memorize and keep track of but mr. dirle was pretty transparent about what was on the test and grading. Even if you fail a test you can totally save yourself with the final which is what i did."
77,2164820,2.0,4.0,"Good guy, bad teacher. He clearly understands statistics, however he does not understand how to teach statistics to college kids with no prior experience. Only 2 tests and homework for grades so study hard. Final can replace lowest test grade, though, which is nice. Heavy on vocabulary."
78,2164820,1.0,5.0,"The man knows his stuff about statistics, but he fails to understand his audience. Namely, the twenty-somethings who don't know their stuff about statistics. I've spent many hours scouring the text book to look up how to solve things he didn't touch on in class, but were on the homework. One homework assignment shouldn't take 3+ hours."
79,2164820,5.0,4.0,I was eager to take business statistics with Mr. Dirle because I heard of his experience with poker and trading currencies and thought that was interesting. Overall course was good.
80,2164820,2.0,3.0,Poor lecturer. Hes a young professor a gent quite figured out how to lecture effectively
81,2164820,5.0,3.0,Great!
82,2164820,4.0,5.0,"I didnt need this course but specifically took it bc I heard Professor Dirle was a great teacher. Im not too mathy, but he explained things very clearly, and found him to be very entertaining, a lot to memorize though! The homework was way harder than the tests. P.S. if you know how to do the tests (which he goes over) you should ace the final."
83,2164820,5.0,3.0,"This class was definitely tough (mostly the online portion) but prof. Dirle told us exactly what we should expect on tests so we knew what to study. Wish there were more opportunities for extra credit but if you knew your derivatives you could get a lot more points on tests. Super nice guy, very good teacher!"
84,2164820,1.0,4.0,"He reads straight from the book. Be prepared to teach yourself if you take him because he is no help. Nice man, awful teacher."
85,1001557,5.0,4.0,Dr. Johnson doesn't play around. You have to work for the grade that you want. This is absolutely one of the best professors I have had and have learned the most from.
86,1001557,1.0,4.0,"This woman was not of fan of me because of my opinions. many of our classes were discussions so when id share, she grew to hate me more &amp; more &amp; it showed in grading. impossible grader with unrealistic expectations for her students. i hear shes gotten awards for her work but i honestly cant imagine why. worst professor ive ever had hands down."
87,1001557,1.0,5.0,"She is unrealistic with her expectations. She expects students to think exactly as she does, otherwise you will not pass. Do not give your own opinion. being favored over others is vital in order to pass this course. This class is about disabilities, but I learned more about race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity than disabilities. Do not take her."
88,1001557,1.0,5.0,Save yourself. Dont do it.
89,1001557,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Johnson gets upset at the class, screaming and ranting because students did not answer an email on time or someone missed class. She also grades inconsistently, expecting students to read her mind on what she wants for assignments. Her class is so unorganized and she gets confused about names and places, but if you forget one name she gets mad."
90,1001557,1.0,5.0,I wouldnt wish this class or teacher on my worst enemy. Worst professor Ive ever had! Terrible!
91,1001557,1.0,5.0,"SOC 327 is a NO GO. It is EXTREMELY hard and she is an impossible grader. Her class is lecture heavy and she gets MAD if you do not do the reading. If you don't follow the directions and go above and beyond what she is looking for, you will not do well at all. Over half of my class got F's on our midterm papers for literally NO reason."
92,1001557,1.0,5.0,"She is really intelligent &amp; dedicated to her work but she is much to scatterbrained &amp; outrageous to be a teacher. She expects students to read her mind about what she wants for assignments, she is an impossibly hard grader, and if you upset her, she will retaliate (to the tune of 10 extra papers). I have had a horrible experience &amp; would not rec."
93,1001557,4.0,5.0,"Came into SOC 310 thinking that it was SOC 101, I was sadly mistaken. I only stayed because I already bought all the books. This was by far the hardest class I have ever taken.  Do not take unless absolutely necessary"
94,1001557,2.0,5.0,The worst class I have ever taken. If you are thinking about taking this class DON'T DO IT!!! She grades extremely hard and is not very clear in what she wants. Even when she is somewhat clear about what she expects she still grades hard. I wouldn't take this class unless I really needed it. DON'T TAKE IT!!!
95,1001557,4.5,5.0,She's amazing and very dedicated to her work!
96,1001557,2.0,5.0,"Poor Mrs. Johnson...I feel like she tries really hard to be a good teacher, but she just isn't up to the task.  She is somewhat scatterbrained in her lectures, and when asked to repeat what she just said, she will often say something completely different.  The tests are extremely hard and not always on material covered in class.  I prepared basical"
97,1001557,3.5,3.0,"Not the most organized woman, but she keeps class going at a quick pace and often helps with most questions you have. Tough tests, but managable with adaquete study time."
98,557142,4.0,2.0,"If you go to class you will succeed. Each one of Goulet's classes are taught by a TA. My TA was Maggie Livingston and she was wonderful. Mr. Goulet himself is not a super exceptional guy but if you get a good TA and go to class, then it will be easy."
99,557142,4.0,3.0,"Rarely see Dr. Goulet, your TA will make or break this class. Attendance is mandatory, if you miss a lab, you will probably drop a letter grade. Just make sure you have a clicker and Goulet's lab manual and you will do just fine. If your TA is a chill grader, you will most likely get an A or B in his class."
100,557142,3.0,4.0,super strict about attendance on the first day he told us if we have to miss we have to send an excuse even if its a funeral you have to send like the eulogy. but hes never in there its always just a TA so it completely depends on who you get but ive taken bisc103 and 105 with him and both TAs were super chill. and classes are usually cut short
101,557142,4.0,2.0,"This lab depends completely on your TA - It's a coin toss on if they're strict or relaxed. Dr. Goulet is not involved at all except first day of class. There's only a few labs, so missing one could class easily drop you down a letter grade. Overall easy lab just show up and do your work and you'll be fine."
102,557142,1.0,3.0,"He refuses to round your grade at all literally wont even give you a half a point. Not friendly at all and very unsympathetic. Highly recommend never taking this class with this professor, youll thank me later."
103,557142,2.0,3.0,"I rarely ever saw or talked to him, because he usually lets the TA take over. However, the times he was there he wasn't the friendliest. Thankfully, my TA was amazing and helpful."
104,557142,2.0,1.0,"Honestly, he seemed pretty cool at first and the lab was pretty straightforward and easy at first. But, he put all of the grades in so you don't know your grade until after finals. Also, he will not round your grade up at ALL. I had to finish with a 79.45% because he refuses to round even half a point. So, beware."
105,557142,4.0,1.0,easy lab and helpful to the class it went with show up and you will pass with at least a B
106,557142,5.0,3.0,"Just know that if you have Dr. Goulet for lab, it all depends on your TA. They do most of the teaching and grading. Very clear grading criteria for the class and there is really no way to misunderstand any of the assignments. Very easy as long as you attend class and read the lab manual before."
107,557142,5.0,4.0,"He can be really intimidating, but if you get his notes and actually go to class he will help you out."
108,557142,5.0,3.0,He's very helpful.  All you have to do is ask.
109,557142,4.0,4.0,have to study lots
110,557142,5.0,4.0,anatomy isn't going to be easy with any professor. Dr. Goulet is very clear and helpful
111,2781272,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Drew is an absolute gem among Ole Miss's English Department. She is very intelligent, but in an approachable way. She wants you to learn! Class participation/student led discussion is key. Read, draw comparisons between the courses literature. She is very understand! Be honest and upfront, and she will always make accommodations."
112,1937499,1.0,5.0,This class is really lecture heavy and test heavy. The tests are extremely hard and the professor is RUDE. He literally said he did not want to be there on multiple occasions. Neither did I but I didnt tell him that.
113,1937499,5.0,3.0,-Incredibly informative &amp; engaging lecturers -encourages student participation &amp; interest in current events -works to help students resolve issues and answer questions
114,1937499,3.0,4.0,"I enjoy this professors individuality, and that is the #1 thing I look for in people. However, my personality preferences don't completely cloud my judgement. This professor is teaching this freshman 100 level course like its upper class. The scope of information this guy is teaching in this intro class is mind-boggling."
115,1937499,4.0,2.0,If you're from the north you'll love this professor. As long as you show up and participate you'll get a good grade.
116,1937499,5.0,3.0,"He is a Yankee, but he challenges his class to think differently than conventional southerners."
117,1937499,2.5,3.0,To be completely honest if your good at reading power-points then the class will essentially teach itself. He's from New York and lives in the South so he has a mentality of someone who thinks some of us are small minded bigots. At times it can be frustrating but once you get past that you can enjoy the class.
118,2637918,1.0,4.0,"Nick Bergan is the worst professor I have ever taken. Zero emails, reminders, or responses all year. If you email him, he's rude and doesn't answer your question. The discussion posts make no sense. I haven't learned a single thing this year because of his teaching style. I'm sure he'll be at a different school next year."
119,1841251,3.0,3.0,She has no clue what she's doing....
120,1427564,5.0,4.0,Too bad he's not there anymore. I was going to take his class this semester again.
121,1427564,1.0,5.0,Really obnoxious and unreasonable
122,1427564,3.5,4.0,"If you ask for help he'll give it. Do the homework! Online and in class, that's the ONLY way you pass!"
123,1427564,1.0,5.0,"Bully. Participation was required, but don't be wrong because he will berate you in front of classmates. You won't find any constructive criticism here. Easily angered, incredibly unprofessional, sweats continuously. His grading is nontransparent. "
124,1427564,5.0,2.0,Great prof.
125,1806446,2.0,5.0,Extremely long and boring lectures. Horrible at explaining things. Some of the quiz and test material was stuff he never even taught. Had to work so hard just to get a low B
126,1806446,1.0,2.0,Worst lectures I have ever listened to. Speed his voice up to like 1.5x on youtube. Don't bother buying or reading the book. his test and participation assignments come straight from the lecture video. The only way I got a B is from the extra credit assignments. He also makes class mandatory just to sit and talk about due dates for 50 mins.
127,1806446,5.0,3.0,"Professor Copp did a great job of adapting to the circumstances that COVID brought, and was very helpful. He provided many extra credit opportunities that allowed me to receive the grade that I wanted. If you put in the effort, this class is easy."
128,1806446,1.0,3.0,Terrible class he never actually teaches during class and instead makes you go watch his youtube videos for hours. Avoid this class.
129,1806446,3.0,3.0,Mr. Copp's class was personally hard for me because it was all online. I really believe Covid was a cause to me not doing my best. If your class is all in person I feel it will be easier to succeed. While he is lecture heavy the tests follow everything he teachers. There is just a lot of information and he doesn't provide what to study for exams.
130,1806446,3.0,4.0,"This Professor has a solid class considering the COVID circumstances. I actually did learn from his class unlike all of my others. He gives a lot of work but it can be good because it gives you a chance to improve your grade. Overall he is not a walk in the park but he is not impossible, I would recommend for students who can do some work."
131,1806446,2.0,3.0,"Participation points usually every class via clicker. Attendance is not mandatory but if you don't go your grade will suffer because no participation points. S.I. sessions help A LOT with the test! Homework is not given often, but when given its very hard."
132,1806446,3.0,4.0,"Tests were pretty hard, studied a lot and still made B's... Lectures could get a bit dry and sometimes confusing. A lot of the material wasn't explained well. Took bisc 104 after this with a different prof and easily understood and made an A. The class is definitely doable, but there might be better profs out there. Final was super hard."
133,1806446,4.0,3.0,Clicker questions during every lecture. Go to class on Fridays and he usually gives extra credit.
134,1806446,2.0,4.0,He belittles the class on a regular basis. Also most of his lectures are boring
135,1806446,4.0,3.0,"He tries to act tough, but he isn't."
136,1806446,3.0,3.0,"Good lectures, lot of bonus points, fair grading"
137,1806446,3.0,5.0,Exams are tough n he goes real fast during lecture
138,1806446,4.5,2.0,"I loved this class. You get out of it what you put into it. The test and quizzes are pretty easy as long as you study. Attendance isn't mandatory, but he does clicker question. If you miss class, you miss the points for that day. The lectures are long and go pretty fast. Overall, I recommend anyone to take him."
139,1806446,5.0,1.0,He is the best teacher that I've ever had
140,1806446,3.0,4.0,"attendance is not required, only 3 tests and final. Barely any homework"
141,1806446,4.0,5.0,"Professor Copp is very passionate about Biology. As someone who see's science like a second language, I wouldn't recommend Copp. He goes fast during class and the online homework was impossible to get a 100%"
142,1806446,4.5,3.0,He comes off strict at first but as you go in the class he really is an awesome teacher who is super interested in the subject and really does want all his students to pass. Make sure you read the textbook though because thats where all his test questions are from.
143,1806446,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Copp is one of the coolest professors I have ever met. At first he comes off as very strict, but all you have to do is go see him for help and before tests and he is the coolest guy ever. Him and I grab lunch every now and then and i'm not even a bio major. Just show him you care, and you are golden."
144,1806446,4.0,2.0,"Copp is very interested in the subject and wants to make sure that everyone understands the material. He's very strict about attendance and cell phone usage, but if you go to class and take notes the exams aren't hard. He takes a lot of the test material from the books, so make sure you read. Overall not a hard class"
145,1806446,4.5,2.0,Easy overall. I went everyday but did not take great notes. He puts his slides on Blackboard so I just used those and the textbook to study.
146,1806446,5.0,3.0,"Copp is a great teacher, see him for help during study hours and you will ace the class. Pay attention to lectures and attendance is mandatory but helps your grade dramatically. There are only three exams the entire semester so make sure you don't miss more than 3 classes."
147,1806446,3.0,3.0,He will go over something a million times if needed for everyone to understand something. The clicker questions in class really help out.
148,1806446,4.0,3.0,Prof. Copp tries to make the material as interesting as possible. Attendance and participation are part of your grade so you have to go to class. Tests are easy and mainly come from the book.
149,1806446,2.0,4.0,Not that great of a teacher. Class is boring. Attendance is mandatory. READ THE TEXTBOOK a lot of test questions come from it.
150,929902,4.0,5.0,"Mrs. Treloar is a cool teacher, not understandable but you can pass if you get help. Overall she is do able"
151,929902,5.0,5.0,"Mrs. Treloar is an awesome math teacher! No matter what math you take, you should definitely get her. She makes it interesting and fun! :)"
152,1427568,3.0,4.0,Go to class and do your MY SPANISH LAB work
153,2054258,5.0,3.0,Ms. Faulk has been one of my favorite writing teachers at Ole Miss. I had her my first semester of college and am continuing to be in her class for the second semester. Her grading style is not to criticize but to give the writer a different viewpoint and understanding of their writing style.
154,2054258,3.0,5.0,Although she normally teaches writing she taught my edhe class. I think she did a good job at making discussion about some of the topics we covered. A lot of the work she gave us was busy work and pointless which was annoying.
155,2054258,5.0,3.0,"One of the best teachers I've had. She is helpful and so nice. I loved her class. She teaches you how to improve so that you do better in other classes. If you listen to her and follow her guidance, you will improve. Some students here don't want to work at all."
156,2054258,4.0,3.0,"Great first writing teacher into college. Participation matters, so don't be afraid to speak up in class. Lots of peer review grading, always come prepared to class. Don't get carried away with your papers, stick to what the teacher is asking of you. Other than that, awesome teacher, I recommend taking her for your intro into writing."
157,2054258,4.0,3.0,"People who say she is a tough grader have not tried hard enough. Really isn't bad, she grades tough, but it's a college course. Everything you need to do is in her rubrics. Only like four papers and you have two weeks to write them!"
158,2054258,3.0,4.0,"She's a great teacher and I learned a lot from this class, but it's not an easy A and she is a fairly strict grader. She does give great feedback on essays which is always helpful. Probably would not take again."
159,2054258,2.0,5.0,"Proffessor Faulk isn't that bad. I think she should refrain from pushing her political views. She is a tough grader and compared to other teachers i wish i could be getting the A everyone else is getting. A bit too harsh for a gen ed. Prompts are too vague. She is fun and helpful if you ask though. If you're good at english you'll be fine, if not:/"
160,2054258,1.0,5.0,Shouldn't take this class. I googled her and found a mass of compliants at wayne state and Michigan state. Wish i had known. A total idiot
161,2054258,1.5,5.0,isn't clear on what she is expecting from students on papers if you don't share her same view you are penalized on paper extremely tough grader and doesn't give feedback
162,2386038,5.0,4.0,"When I say textbook usage, I mean that he has you buy your own music. If you are traditionally an independent person, he will be good for you since he leaves a lot of musical interpretation up to you. However, you must put work into your piano playing."
163,1228921,3.0,5.0,She is so hard. She expects you to write as if ohave a Ph.D like her.
164,1228921,1.0,5.0,"She doesn't care about the students, and her lectures are hard to follow, would not suggest taking this class."
165,1228921,5.0,1.0,Ms. Denton is a great teacher. She is very kind and if you go to class and participate should be a fairly easy A. Some of her questions on tests are worded weirdly but you get used to it. I suggest taking this class
166,1228921,3.0,2.0,"Ms. Denton is not the best teacher, her lectures are very basic, but she is helpful, nice and relatively easy."
167,1228921,5.0,3.0,One of my favorite teachers! She really cares about students learning the material and will meet outside of class if you need to.
168,1228921,1.5,1.0,Ms. Denton is very unprofessional.  Would not recommend.
169,1228921,4.5,3.0,"Prof Denton is smart, funny & hot."
170,2519162,2.0,4.0,"microbiology. homework and lab online is the only reason im not failing. test questions are very vague and extremely hypothetical instead of actually applying material to stuff that matters. someone hurt this man before, major trust issues. WILL NOT ROUND UP, NO EXTRA CREDIT, DO NOT ASK."
171,929915,5.0,2.0,She is my favorite professor I have ever had. And beautiful! She loves French and now i do too!
172,929915,4.5,2.0,"Easily the best/nicest/most enthusiastic professor I've had so far at Ole Miss. She will do anything she can to help you, and you can tell she really cares about what she's teaching. I've had her for my entire sophomore year of French (201/202), and I'm disappointed she doesn't teach any of the higher levels."
173,929915,4.5,4.0,A great teacher. Full of enthusiasm for the language. And one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. Ooh-la-la!
174,929915,2.5,4.0,blah
175,929915,5.0,2.0,"Madame Karahan is an AWESOME teacher. She's sweet.. always smiling, and she loves French.. pay attention to what she says though, and come to class! :)"
176,2048123,4.5,3.0,She's always helpful and understanding. Lots of quizzes but you can make them up if you miss one
177,2048123,4.5,2.0,"She is a great professor, puts all of her slides on blackboard. She shows a lot of interesting videos and always willing to help. You don't have to come to class she doesn't take attendance but you will want to go. She's hilarious and a quick grader."
178,796800,5.0,4.0,do the homework and you will get a good grade. Also she gives practice tests and worked out answers that are the same as on the tests
179,796800,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely love her!!! My favorite professor by far this semester, and hoping I can take her again next semester too because that would be incredible! She is hilarious and likes to joke around, but she also is a very good teacher, and easy! Everything on Hawkes!!! Tests in MathLab! Overall, great great gal!"
180,796800,5.0,1.0,easiest professor i've had
181,796800,5.0,1.0,"Easy to learn through her lectures. She broke down every problem, but keep in mind she worked very fast. I am a slow writer so it was a little hard to keep up, BUT she is VERY good at her job. Even if I missed some notes, I was able to remember for the homework."
182,796800,5.0,3.0,Loved this class. It is super easy my final grade was over a 100. She is super nice and cares about you.
183,796800,5.0,1.0,An amazing teacher and an even better person.
184,796800,5.0,4.0,Love her
185,796800,5.0,1.0,"I have not taken a math class since my junior year of high school so I was very nervous about taking this class. She made it SO MUCH EASIER. She wants people to come to her office hours, she tells the whole class that you can just sit there and do homework. SHE WANTS TO HELP YOU. If you raise your hand for a question she will stop and help!"
186,796800,5.0,2.0,"Shes the best teacher Ive ever had. Im not strong in math but she explains things so well and if you dont understand something, her office door is always open. All of the homework is extra credit. You have one quiz a week that you take online from home and 5 tests, including final. Everything on the tests are on the practice test, so do them!!"
187,796800,5.0,2.0,Amazing teacher. Cares a lot about the class and wants everyone to pass. Also try to make the class interesting with some jokes. It's such an easy class if you go.
188,796800,5.0,4.0,Shes absolutely amazing
189,796800,5.0,3.0,Ole miss legend. You can tell she loves the school and wants to make the class easy.
190,796800,5.0,2.0,Mrs. Anderson was a great teacher. She gives great notes and cares about all of her students. I am taking another one of her classes in the spring
191,796800,5.0,1.0,"She wants you to understand the material. Wonderful professor, really helped me grasp the concepts of business calculus 2."
192,796800,3.0,1.0,"She is nice and helpful. However, she just works examples and doesn't really teach the concepts of calculus. I have taken AP calc in high school and this class is sooooo watered down in comparison. If you just want a grade, take her. If you want to learn calculus you should probably find someone else."
193,796800,5.0,1.0,Best professor I have ever taken. I love her.
194,796800,5.0,1.0,Anderson is my favorite teacher ever! I had never taken a Calculus class before I took her and I came out with an A. She made calculus fun!
195,796800,5.0,1.0,Best math teacher ever! She makes math so simple! EASY A!
196,796800,5.0,2.0,"I love her, she helps you really understand the subject. I recommend getting her for both Math 267 and Math 268"
197,796800,4.5,1.0,"Anderson is great. Especially for classes like Bcal 267/268. She can go pretty fast in class, but doing the homework helps a lot (plus its extra credit if you do it). She's phenomenal if you go to her office hours too."
198,796800,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Anderson is a great teacher, she's very helpful and wants to help. I struggle with math and she worked with me every step of the way and I ended with an A. Definitely the best teacher in the department."
199,796800,5.0,1.0,amazing teacher. if you fail this class you did not try at all. not an easy A class but an A is possible
200,796800,5.0,1.0,Very nice and willing to answer any questions you have. She wants you to do well in her class.
201,796800,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Anderson is the best! She explains math in a way students can understand. Extremely helpful and the best math teacher that there is!
202,796800,5.0,2.0,The best math teacher I have ever had! Perfect in every way!
203,796800,5.0,3.0,Best math teacher at the university
204,796800,5.0,2.0,BEST MATH TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will take her class every chance I get.
205,796800,5.0,3.0,She was an amazing teacher. I took her fall semester of 2010 and am taking her again for Business Calculus II in spring. I LOVE Anderson. She's very eager to help and wants you to enjoy and understand the material
206,796800,5.0,1.0,Probably one of the easiest math teachers I've ever had. She's a great teacher and makes learning calculus fun. I highly recommend taking her class. She is amazing
207,796800,5.0,2.0,amazing
208,796800,5.0,2.0,shes one  of the best math teachers i have ever had. shes an amazing teacher.
209,796800,5.0,2.0,Ms. Anderson is one of the best teachers I've ever had.  She made a difficult subject seem easy and was very patient with students who were having trouble understanding the material.
210,796800,4.0,3.0,loved her! take her if u can her classes fill up quick!
211,796800,4.5,1.0,"In my opinion, one of the best math teachers if not the best. If you get the chance to take her, do NOT hesitate. Before test days, she will go over the test format. She really cares about her students so it is easy to get a hold of her outside the classroom. She is also VERY funny."
212,796800,5.0,2.0,Excellent teacher!  One of the bests I've had so far in my college career.  Really cares about her students.
213,796800,5.0,1.0,No Comments
214,796800,5.0,1.0,"Julie is a great techer that takes her students on a wild ride in her class.  She teaches very well, and tests EXACTLY what she teaches.  Pay attention, do homework, and the rest is easy."
215,796805,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher on campus, does not supply study guides, does not supply feedback, currently only updates his blackboard site with his prerecorded lectures from 2 years ago. Brutal grader, impossible tests, and such an out of touch person."
216,796805,3.0,4.0,MIS 317* is the class. He doesn't seem like he has a lesson plan.. Also no one knew where there grade stood going into the final since he didn't grade any of the assignments until after we had taken the exam.
217,796805,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Garner is an excellent professor, I enjoyed his class. His tests will be tough if you don't put in the time to learn the material. But seriously if you are taking this class by the time you get to the test you should know how to write a class in C#. I am amazed at how many people can not do this."
218,796805,2.0,5.0,Class was so difficult. He is not clear at all and goes way to fast !
219,796805,3.0,3.0,He did not lecture on the test material.  He would rant about the governement and politics.  I felt like I did not learn much at all.
220,796805,1.5,5.0,This is a terrible class. It is made a lot harder by terrible teaching and awful tests. Class average on the Final Exam was a 68. No curve. Avoid this class. Maybe and hopefully he will get fired before you take it.
221,796805,1.5,1.0,"Probably the most bland, least useful professor I've ever had.  Every now and then, he came to class, usually it was just the TA."
222,796805,2.0,1.0,"Dr. Garner is a good guy.  Wierd, but decent.  However, he is unforgiving on abscences from tests and requires that you take a comprehensive as a make-up.  Be there on test days.  The TA i had (Gao Hongman) literally knew little english, making the class difficult."
223,2621574,3.0,1.0,"The homework only prepares you for about half of the exams and the other half is based off of non lecture based readings. She cancels class all the time and gets really far behind in the lectures because when she does come to class, she takes the first 20 minutes to update us about her life. "
224,2621574,3.0,3.0,"Professor Barton cares about the success of her students, but struggles to teach. Spends too much time at the beginning of class talking instead of actually working through and explaining material. On a positive note, her study guides are almost exact replicas of the test. Barton isn't bad, but wouldn't be my first choice."
225,2621574,1.0,5.0,I dropped the class. Take Burney if you can. Miss Barton said on the first day of class NOT to email her or come to office hours if you needed help. She insisted that you go to tutoring. Very confusing and unhelpful lectures and tough homework. Would not suggest her classes
226,2621574,1.0,3.0,"Often wastes half of the class rambling about her life or kids or how tired she is instead of teaching. She should honestly just get a therapist instead of wasting our time. Everything I learned was more or less self-taught. She should be an inspiration to Education majors, however, because if she can become a professor, anyone can!"
227,2621574,1.0,5.0,Study guides will save your life. But do yourself a favor and take another professor.
228,2621574,2.0,5.0,"Wouldn't take this class again. I took because I am an accounting major, and I barely got anything out of the class. It is a lot of teaching it to yourself rather than learning from the professor. Don't get me wrong she is probably one of the nicest professors you will encounter here but just overall not great at teaching."
229,2621574,2.0,5.0,Took this class as a hybrid. Her video &quot;lectures&quot; were just hours of her reading the online textbook and she wasted a lot of class time going over stuff that wasn't important. You're going to have to teach yourself almost everything on the McGraw Hill Connect website. Her exams aren't awful but you have to really study hard for them.
230,565383,1.0,5.0,extremely long review sheets for tests with only 65 questions. literally impossible to study for it all in the time period youre given unless you dont have a job or any other types of responsibilities or social life.
231,565383,5.0,4.0,Dr. Bruce was a fantastic teacher. He gives amazing lectures and he definitely knows all of the information he talks about.
232,565383,5.0,2.0,"One of the best teachers I've had so far. Rapid-fire, hilarious and high-stakes discussion. Charismatic as all hell. Demands explanations for opinions. Expect buttons to be pushed and worldviews challenged. Not too hard; grades essays based on general quality of prose and message. Requires real thinking over busy work, and for that, much respect."
233,565383,5.0,4.0,"He was a great teacher. Although his tests were difficult, he was a great professor. He taught the material well and was very entertaining."
234,565383,3.5,4.0,Good teaching style.
235,565383,4.5,3.0,Great class. I enjoyed it and learned a lot.
236,565383,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher, make sure you ALWAYS bring your clicker to class.  He has a quiz at the end of every class so attending class and paying attention are  very important.  He makes a commonly boring and hated class interesting.  Just don't fall asleep or get caught texting...he's a great teacher all in all."
237,565383,4.0,4.0,"knows his stuff.  a bit dry, but you'll learn"
238,565383,3.0,4.0,"Interesting lecture, but very subjective class.  If your opinion is thorough & well explained, yet disagrees with his....your wrong!! The texts used will generally put you to sleep, but they're very helpful come exam time!  Overall a professor worth taking...as long as your openminded."
239,565383,5.0,2.0,"Yeah, so if you have basic understanding of American politics or took a good high school course in it, you're golden.  Tests are straight forward, if you do the reading and listen a bit in class you'll get a good grade.  He's also just a good speaker, interesting, and cool to talk too"
240,565383,4.5,3.0,not bad. its not the easiest class ever but he certainly doesn't make it any harder
241,565383,4.0,3.0,Very Liberal but a good teacher still tough
242,2263178,1.0,5.0,I would never take this professor again and you should never take her. Has no feel. Assigns busy work. Grades extremely hard. Thinks her class is the only class.
243,2263178,5.0,5.0,Digregorio is so smart and cool but also loves animals. I've never cared more about multitudinous multicultural contested American materialities than I do right now.
244,1863819,5.0,5.0,HONESTLY TAKE IT. EASY A IF YOU SHOW UP
245,1630348,3.5,2.0,"Its a rather easy class. Papers due every other week, 3-5 pages. Barely any homework. I don't like the way she grades, she has her doctorate so she gives off a vibe she's to qualified for the job."
246,1917075,5.0,3.0,He is a great teacher. Very willing to help you. Go to class.
247,1917075,4.0,4.0,"He teaches you what you need to know, and if you do not understand he is glad to help."
248,1917075,3.0,3.0,"Although his English isn't the best, he tries his hardest to get the concept as easy to understand as possible, and is always willing to help. He's a really funny guy and his lectures are pretty interesting, albeit mathematics. He has a blackboard in his office and will work out any questions you may have. "
249,1917075,1.0,4.0,"Super nice and kind of weird. But he is Spanish and impossible to understand. I had to change professors, I would never learn a thing since i couldn't understand what he was saying......"
250,2080916,5.0,1.0,He's wonderful
251,2080916,5.0,3.0,Professor Roll is the best professor I have ever had.
252,2080916,2.0,4.0,"you're grade comes from four extensive papers- no quizzes, homework, exams. if you like writing (you don't have to be good) take this class. you don't need to go to lectures, when writing these papers all you need to do is read the sections you're righting about."
253,2080916,5.0,1.0,"Take this class. Super easy even if you are interested in history the slightest bit. He's super into the subject matter, and it is contagious. Take him!!! There are no tests!"
254,2080916,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Roll is honestly one of the greatest professors I have ever had. You would be ripping yourself off if you did not take him during your time at Ole Miss, especially if you even have the slightest interest in American history. His lectures are interesting and relevant for his tests. Skipping his class would be an injustice to your education."
255,2080916,3.0,4.0,He's VERY interested in the material but he's cute and quirky so I got a little distracted. The tests were ALL writing and there were 2 papers on books he assigned.
256,2080916,2.0,5.0,Honestly worst professor ever.
257,2080916,5.0,3.0,"Really cool guy who knows how to keep students interested. Obviously enjoys his subject matter. The reading isn't fun, but you gotta do it to do well."
258,2080916,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Roll is a great lecturer, but also involves students in discussion. There are 3-1000 word essays and 2 tests. Attendance and Participation is 10% of your grade, but you'd be ripping yourself off if you skipped."
259,2488471,5.0,4.0,"AN AWESOME PROFESSOR. A Lot of work, but not unnecessary. It helps you understand the material/context/time period more. A very passionate and understanding teacher. Made US history my least favorite subject to my favorite subject."
260,2488471,5.0,3.0,"Really passionate teacher who cares about his students doing well, unlike a lot of profs. He made the lectures sound like a story and the discussions helped bring the course material to life. I'd definitely take him again."
261,2488471,5.0,3.0,"Lots of lecturing, but it is an intro class and his style keeps you pretty engaged. Makes you read a lot of primary sources and has discussions for most classes, but he was respectful and open to student opinion. 4 quizzes, 2 essays, and a take home final paper. No complaints."
262,2488471,1.0,3.0,"I managed to get an A in the class, but the grading is extremely subjective. He is a closed minded professor who refuses to accept the viewpoints of any of his students if they do not fall in line with his own beliefs"
263,1251482,1.0,5.0,"The worst grading scale ever. Goes to 1.00 and will judge arbitrarily. First two weeks are miserable and condescending, after that it goes alternating Thursday Tuesday, so you have the weekend before you talk over the subject. It leads to lots of lost content. Tests are not what is taught in class. Do not take if you don't have too.  "
264,1251482,1.0,4.0,"Had us write two papers a week, grades participation every class with seemingly random numbers down to two decimal places. Spent the first week teaching us 1st grade math and then taught us nothing the rest of the semester. Every class now is alternating between group presentations that he grades harshly and him telling us to read 50-page articles."
265,1634463,5.0,1.0,"I can't relate to the rambling ratings but that could be b/c I had him online. He is very sweet and I can email him at 10 pm and him respond that night. He gave really good feedback on my public speaking videos and was very encouraging. His class is an easy A, but then again it could be b/c it's online. No extra credit, but he's very flexible."
266,1634463,4.5,4.0,"I don't think he rambles, but the courses he teaches are hard and he uses a lot of examples so it seems like rambling sometimes. But he is always prepared and always willing to answer questions. And he has lots of experience. He has high expectations. I liked him. And I learned a lot."
267,1634463,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Mongue does ramble about during the lecture and is hard to follow on some things. If you ever need help understanding something or need to work around your schedule; he understands. That makes for a good instructor. He will go over your hw before it is due and help you through it. So, that you can get a good grade."
268,1634463,1.5,2.0,"As a student, Dr. Mongue is perhaps the worst professor I have ever had.  His classes are mandatory, but pointless to attend due to his rambling the entire time.  Paralegal is such a wonderful major, but he makes it miserable.  I changed my major because of his class."
269,1198240,5.0,4.0,"He may have long hw activities, but he is a delightful teacher and clarifies that what he has taught will be on the quiz only. He is a good teacher and he helps with confusion after honors recitation."
270,1198240,1.0,5.0,"Grades students differently.  Lectures do not line up with exams or homework. Hours of homework per night.  Only covered about 50% of material that would be on final.  Assumes every student already knows the material before he teaches it. On the plus side, you can fail multiple exams and still have a B.  "
271,1198240,5.0,4.0,"He’s hilarious- I love him. He actually makes you care about chemistry. His class is no walk in the park though, but as long as you show up and take notes- you should easily pass. "
272,1198240,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ritchie makes his lessons--with anecdotes ranging from mountaineering to the special effects in a James Cameron film--interesting but also,and more importantly, memorable."
273,1198240,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ritchie was my favorite professor this semester!! I was in his honors section as well as his recitation, and if you have the chance to take him, do it. He definitely challenges you to know the material, but his classes were always engaging. The tests are pretty close to the practice test he gives so I never got below a B on his tests."
274,1198240,5.0,4.0,I absolutely loved Ritchie for chem105. He definitely cares about you and how his students do in class. He is also very helpful on his zoom office hours. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you do miss you'll be missing a lot of notes. I would take him again 100%
275,1198240,5.0,3.0,Ritchie is an amazing professor. He knows what he's teaching and teaches it well.
276,1198240,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ritchie is the best teacher I have this year. His lectures are very well structured: he has a great understanding of the material and provides anecdotes and real-world applications that make the material tangible. He's enthusiastic, and he actually cares. I highly recommend him."
277,1198240,3.0,5.0,"Very very very hard class. The way Ritchie teaches (if you are not in one of his Honors classes) is he tells you what the topic is, does one example, lets you try one example on your own then moves on. He does not give step by step before that on how to do it. Also, homework is so so difficult, and there is so much of it! Would not take again!"
278,1198240,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ritchie is one of the best professors I've had. His class is very tough, but he does a good job of helping his students learn the material. He is also the nicest and most understanding teacher I've ever had. He actually cares about his students and their well-being. I would take him if you get the chance, and you are up for the class material."
279,1198240,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors. Yes the class is challenging, but its a higher level chemistry class, it is not going to be an easy A. Very good teacher and gets really into chemistry. Very easy to talk to and he is so helpful if you dont understand something or are out sick. highly recommend"
280,1198240,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Ritchie is great! His class is extremely hard, though. I think he forgot we were not honors students (his usual group) and often taught above my head. He's not joking when he says the class average is a 70 at the end of the semester. Go to SI sessions! They are the only reason I got a B in this class! Tests are crazy hard compared to quizzes!"
281,1198240,3.0,5.0,He moves very fast during the lectures n the homewok is tough and takes forrever
282,1198240,4.5,3.0,"Ritchie was one of my favorites. Not great at Chemistry at all, but I managed to snag an A- in his Honors Chem 105. Assigns a lot of homework, but if you do the homework and make sure you fully understand it, you'll get the material on the quizzes and tests. He is there to help during his office hour. Pretty easy going and loves what he does."
283,1198240,4.0,3.0,Fantastic professor
284,1198240,5.0,3.0,He's good to take if you are pre-med.  This was an honors class.  Just go to class and pay attention. There is a quiz every Friday. Study for those
285,1198240,5.0,3.0,He's good to take if you are pre-med.  This was an honors class.  Just go to class and pay attention. There is a quiz every Friday. Study for those!
286,1198240,4.5,2.0,Very clear lectures and a very apparent passion for the subject. Really helpful and always eager to answer questions. Would definitely take him again! 
287,1198240,5.0,2.0,"He's an awesome chem teacher. He does a great job of explaining the material. You wont use the book too much, but you will need the code for masteringchemistry, this is where you will do your weekly hw. The class is only as hard as you want it to be. My highschool taught me little to nothing about chemistry, but I have a B+ in his class."
288,1198240,5.0,2.0,Fantastic professor.  Very enthusiastic and passionate about chemistry.  Very helpful.
289,1198240,5.0,1.0,"He loves his subject and is a great teacher. He clearly explains what can be a difficult subject. His grading scale is extremely reasonable. Take him if at all possible! I loved his class, and it is far better than an 8 o'clock (O'Neal). His voice is kind of comical in how animated it is, but he is just a great and fun teacher to be around."
290,1198240,4.5,4.0,"He makes great notes and offers a problem session on Wednesdays. The tests are a tiny bit hard, but with the homework and quiz grades, I'm pulling off an A."
291,1198240,3.0,4.0,Do not take him. Take Dr Oneil!
292,1198240,5.0,2.0,Great teacher! teaches very well
293,1198240,5.0,2.0,No Comments
294,1939624,4.5,2.0,Kehoe was one of the kindest professors i have had.  I feel he genuinely cares for his students.  
295,1939624,5.0,1.0,Professor Kehoe is one of the sweetest teachers I've met at Ole Miss. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to learn how to write. Take Kehoe for writing!
296,2117802,1.0,4.0,"Asks very minute things on tests about one of the 50 things youve read over the semester, did not prepare me well for either test, but was an average grader on written assignments, weekly discussion posts fairly easy, tests were extremely hard"
297,2037931,1.0,3.0,"I usually love my writing classes but she was an absolutely terrible teacher. She is confusing and completely contradicts her self 24/7. She never makes sense which results in students being confused. She’s passive aggressive and I did not learn a single thing from her class. She is flat out rude, chaotic, and unhelpful. Do not take her class."
298,2037931,1.0,4.0,"I took this class for all of one day and dropped. Read everyone elses feedback and believe it because I didnt. I dropped in class while she was reading the syllabus because I truly would not take her again if my credit depended on it. She seems to be everything the other feedback indicates, although I would say shes nice, believe the feedback."
299,2037931,1.0,5.0,The worst professor ever. I do not suggest this class at all with professor Shook. She bullies her students and will not help you but rather thinks passive aggressive comments will get you through class. She is overall 1000% the devil. If you want a writing teacher to actually help you and give GOOD reasonable advice dont take Shook!!!
300,2037931,4.0,3.0,Professor Shook is very willing to work with you if you take the time to put in effort outside of class. Vague on what she is actually looking for/grading but is not a super tough grader. Has lots of completion work that will ensure you could have a good grade if you just turn your work in.
301,2037931,1.0,5.0,"She is very quiet making her hard to hear during lectures. The rubrics are very vague and hard to understand as to what the expectations for the final paper are. For that reason alone, she has been known to be a very difficult grader. In addition to this, she responds to questions poorly often leaving kids more confused than before."
302,2037931,4.0,5.0,"Toughest grader Ive had so far but this class has taught me so much about revision, citiations, and writing a solid paper in general. Thankful for her class but I would never do that to myself AGAIN lol"
303,2037931,2.0,5.0,This professor is one of the worst that I have had.  She doesn't explain things well at all and she is a very tough grader.  She also has no mercy when it comes to making things up.
304,1933486,4.5,2.0,"He's a awesome teacher. The epitome of a laid back but stern type of guy. He's a younger teacher but don't let that fool you, he knows his  stuff. He will give you the opportunity for extra credit, but don't take advantage of him."
305,2738350,1.0,5.0,"Had her for many courses throughout my time at Ole Miss. One of the worst experiences I have ever had. She is careless and difficult to understand. She often belittled students in class. She will not answer questions if she believes she has already answered them. Unfortunately, she is the only teacher for the majority of the courses needed."
306,2169023,5.0,2.0,"Loved taking Professor Bliss, shes not like other teachers shes a cool teacher (mean girls reference). She made learning relatively boring stuff entertaining. I will say that although the work is easy, there is a lot of it. Would take her again, she makes taking her classes worth it."
307,2169023,5.0,1.0,I absolutely loved Professor Bliss. This is my first review I have ever done on a teacher on this website but I made sure to go out of my way because of how awesome she is. She is so passionate and enthusiastic and you can tell she loves her job. Love her!
308,2169023,5.0,3.0,Loved her! Take her if you have the opportunity!
309,2169023,5.0,1.0,"Take her you wont regret it I promise! Syllabus said we would need a book but I didnt get one and was perfectly fine! Her lecture videos are the best, she makes them interesting. As long as you do what you are suppose to, she makes it a breeze. You can tell she loves her job and cares about you! She is the best!"
310,2169023,5.0,2.0,Loved this class!!
311,2169023,5.0,3.0,I really enjoyed taking another class with Professor Bliss. She is really enthusiastic about psychology; puts me better learning mood. Great teaching style!!!! More teacher should take notes. The workload was a lot but she made it fun and bearable. The information you learn in this class can help you a lot in your other classes. She's the best!
312,2169023,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Bliss is absolutely amazing! One of the best classes I'm taken at The University of Mississippi. Wherever you teaches throughout her career, I know that the students will love her. The passion that she puts into her lectures is phenomenal. She is younger than some professors, and she makes it known by her engaging and fun assignments! AMAZING!!"
313,2169023,5.0,1.0,The best teacher I have had at the University of Mississippi.. she is very understanding and willing to work with students to ensure they get the best grade possible! A prime example of what a great teacher looks like!
314,2169023,5.0,3.0,She is great!!! I would take again. The software takes a little bit of getting used to but shes there for you the whole time!
315,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bliss is amazing. There is a lot of work, but all of it is fun and interesting. She lays the course out where you learn without even knowing your doing it sometimes. Take this class!! You will have to work for your grade, but it is absolutely worth it!"
316,2169023,5.0,2.0,Heather Bliss is the best Professor I have ever had at Ole Miss. I wish all of my teachers were like her.
317,2169023,5.0,2.0,She is GREAT. She cares about her students and their success more than any prof ive ever had. Shes really open to working with her students and what is going to best benefit them. Communicates through twitter which i really cool and convenient. Super funny/ interesting easy to follow lecture
318,2169023,5.0,5.0,Awesome
319,2169023,5.0,2.0,"Bliss is awesome! Shes actually very relatable and makes the class interesting and fun with her witty humor! Some weeks may seem like a lot of work, but its busy work not hard work! You also do discussions with your classmates but no worries they are not hard at all and not long either. Take this class for an easy A and a great teacher!"
320,2169023,5.0,3.0,"I took Bliss my last semester of my senior year. I wish I had taken one of her classes sooner so I could have taken more! She's one of my all time favs. She is understanding and is easily accessible. She knows being a student is tough, so she is empathetic. She makes lectures fun and offers extra credit opportunities. 10/10, would def recommend!!"
321,2169023,5.0,3.0,Professor Bliss is the best. professor. ever. Im serious when I say this class grounded the fact that I want to minor in psychology. She genuinely loves her students&amp; this class is by far the most enjoyable class Ive ever been in. I love that shes active on twitter and keeps us up to date there &amp; also provides lots of extra credit opportunities.
322,2169023,5.0,4.0,Heather Bliss is the best professor in the Psychology Department. Her enthusiasm for Cognitive Psychology is unmatched. Her non-traditional lecture style started my MWFs off on a great note. She provides her students with the materials to be successful and gives students the flexibility to decide how they will achieve their desired grade.
323,2169023,5.0,4.0,This is my second time taking Ms. Bliss and she is beyond amazing. She is extremely funny and cares about her students and really wants everyone to succeed. Her grading criteria is really easy to understand and it helps keep you on track to earn the grade that you want. 100/10 definitely recommend taking this professor!!!
324,2169023,5.0,3.0,Best professor ever! I wish I could take her for another course.
325,2169023,5.0,3.0,A wonderful teacher! Deserves nothing more than the upmost respect! Wish I could take her again she was so awesome!!
326,2169023,5.0,3.0,Just the best teacher ever.. Ive taken her twice and will take her a million times more!!
327,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Best professor Ive had during my 3 years of college. Shes highly accessible, she makes class fun, and she doesnt try to make your life hard. The grading system is the biggest plus and it helped tremendously at the end of the semester. She also uses echo 360 which is the best when studying for exams."
328,2169023,5.0,2.0,"Heather is awesome!!! A great explainer and knows what shes talking about. If you have a question, she tries her best to explain it as simple as possible. Shell make sure to make the material relatable. Shes so gooood!!"
329,2169023,5.0,3.0,"The best damn teacher that ever existed. Kind, smart, and hilarious. Gives learning a new perspective and pushes students to try there best. For sure one of the best professor at the University of Ms. More than a teacher, a true individual who cares about their students."
330,2169023,5.0,3.0,Ms. Bliss is very knowledgeable in psychology and clearly loves it. She made lectures interesting even if they were early in the morning. She is also very caring and tries to get to know her students.
331,2169023,5.0,3.0,"An absolutely fantastic professor. Workload is very manageable and all very relevant, no busy work or anything unnecessary. Lecture is very good, shes very engaging, uses relevant examples, very technology competent. Quizzes and tests do require good knowledge of the material, but she goes miles out of her way to help you with this and truly cares"
332,2169023,4.0,4.0,She is very smart and good at what she teaches
333,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Heather Bliss--AMAZING prof. Her greatest qualities includes she is REAL, always kept her lecture interesting, &amp; truly cares &amp; wants to help ALL of her students. Even though attendance wasn't technically mandatory--HIGHLY recommended. I don't think I could've made it thru without going to lecture. Tests are intense but doable. LISTEN &amp; take notes!!"
334,2169023,5.0,4.0,"She is very intelligent in her field and actually cares to share it with other people, in turn is motivated to make sure her students succeed."
335,2169023,5.0,5.0,A professional professor!
336,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Even though she will tell you that you don't get points for showing up, activity points earned goes towards you being present in class. A lot of points make up for this actually so go to class! You'll enjoy it! Very enthusiastic and not monotone. She gives you a lot of extra credit, but don't ever ask for more! She won't like that! Class is great!"
337,2169023,4.0,3.0,Overall if you do what she asks of you youll get a good grade just make sure to take all the extra credit she throws at you and be thankful you get as much as you do.
338,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Great overall, really helps you understand the material."
339,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. She was very engaging, and always interesting. I always looked forward to her personal anectdotes that help us students to remember information. I am sad that she is no longer teaching because i would have loved to have her again."
340,2169023,5.0,2.0,"She cares about her students and her class as a whole, although sometimes challenging, is one of the more fun classes Ive taken. Shes the only proffesor Ive had that makes a hard subject (for me) easier to understand by the way she teaches. I highly reccomend taking her if you have the chance!"
341,2169023,5.0,4.0,"I took her for psychology 201 and I absolutely adore this woman. She tries to intimate you at first but once you get to know her she's amazing, I even consider us friends. She'll do absolutely anything and everything in her power to help you. She gives out a ton of extra credit, even just for showing up to class which I highly recommend."
342,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor all around. Had the best lectures &amp; really knows what shes talking about. She doesnt just read from the slides, she gives examples of topics that are harder to learn. Her test were quite hard, but they really help you learn the material better because they are application questions, so you attain the material well from studying."
343,2169023,5.0,2.0,Wonderful teacher! I would definitely recommend her to anyone. She really cares about the subject and will help anyone is they are confused at any point. Also really funny
344,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Bliss is amazing. She genuinely cares about her students and will make you laugh in class. She's super approachable and relates with our generation (Cuz she's so young). Her lectures are always interesting, even if the content is boring (You try making a lecture about action potentials interesting. It's pretty tough but she did it)."
345,2169023,5.0,4.0,THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER!! Bliss is a good teacher but is also there for her students whenever they need her.
346,2169023,5.0,3.0,Loved this class. The tests are pretty difficult but she makes it interesting to learn. Very funny and gives lots of extra credit.
347,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Awesome teacher would recommend 10/10. Gives you plenty of opportunity for extra credit. Very intelligent, passionate, and knowledgeable about psychology. By far my favorite teacher. If you want a hip and cool teacher, take Bliss."

349,2169023,5.0,2.0,"genuinely wants you to pass, great lectures, relates material to everyday situations, engaging personality"

351,2169023,5.0,3.0,This class is my favorite to go to. I know that each lecture will be taught really well. I always love hearing what she had to say. One of the best professors I have ever had. Im going to miss having her class once this semester is over.
352,2169023,5.0,3.0,She is an awesome professor. This was my favorite class of my freshmen year. She really cares about each of her students. She gets you to comprehend the material.
353,2169023,4.0,3.0,Best professor I've had at this university thus far. Lectures are simple and easy to understand. TONS of ways to get points. A good laugh to say the least. I actually learned so much more than I was expecting. She made everything interesting and the stories and demonstrations really got certain topics across. I've never missed this class.
354,2169023,5.0,4.0,If you want to learn then definitely take Bliss. If you do not care then you will not pass. She is an amazing professor and definitely one to take.
355,2169023,5.0,3.0,Bliss is an amazing professor and goes out of her way to make sure you know the information.
356,2169023,5.0,4.0,"She is a really great professor! There are quizzes which are easy if you go to class, and the tests are not terrible but you definitely need to study and go to class in order to understand the material. There is not much home work but when there is, it is kinda enjoyable."
357,2169023,5.0,3.0,Heather made my first semester of college a real treat. I always looked forward to going to this class!! The tests are straight forward as long as you study.
358,2169023,5.0,4.0,She has the best sense of humor! She is my favorite professor! She makes her lectures interesting. She gives a lot of extra credit like no other professor does! She is also very good at responding fast to questions. She made me feel comfortable in the class room as a nervous freshman! She was the best professor I had my first semester.
359,2169023,5.0,2.0,"even if you only pay the smallest amount of attention, odds are, youll get at least a B"
360,2169023,5.0,3.0,"super nice,entertaining, and very interesting lectures"
361,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Every positive thing I would choose. She is the best teacher ever. Always trying to help you!! Great Information, makes you think."
362,2169023,4.0,3.0,"She is an amazing teacher as long as you come to class you will pass, she relates real life situations to the topic we are learning. She is extremely nice just don't cross her."
363,2169023,5.0,3.0,10/10 would recommend her class. Shes easily accessible outside of class. Definitely would advise following the class Twitter. Showing up to class is worth it when it comes to activity points and some questions on tests.
364,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Heather Bliss was one of the first teachers I ever had here at the University of Mississippi, and she, although being a somewhat difficult teacher, was a great person and I loved going to her class every other day. Do not expect an Easy A, but if you actually care then you're in good standings for an A."
365,2169023,5.0,4.0,Heather Bliss is AWESOME. The class is hard but she weeds out those who do not want to work in the beginning of the semester. She is accommodating and understanding if you approach her and cares about your wellbeing outside of class. Psych can be hard to understand if you're not a science based person but I would not want any other teacher for it.
366,2169023,5.0,3.0,Very helpful. She always answers questions and is always willing to help. By far my favorite professor.
367,2169023,4.0,3.0,I love how yuh relate real world problems to your lectures
368,2169023,5.0,2.0,"So inspiring, caring, and fun. Her class is a blast. Tests aren't hard if you study. Homework is easy. Most fun I have had in a class in a while."
369,2169023,5.0,2.0,Great person!
370,2169023,5.0,3.0,Very helpful in and outside of class. Lectures are always informational and entertaining.
371,2169023,5.0,3.0,"She was a great professor, had a good balance regarding the difficulty of the class. One of the few teachers who I can tell genuinely cares about the well being of the students. 10/10 recommend"
372,2169023,4.0,3.0,"Heather is a very caring and good instructor. She breaks down lectures and topics to be very understandable, she gives you a lot of chances to get extra credit as well. She is also very easy to get in touch with outside of the classroom."
373,2169023,5.0,2.0,"Sets you up for success its just up to you to actually do it. She always answers quickly outside of class, and gives out extra credit. Shes funny and just a really great professor. Class was relatively easy but I actually learned a lot."
374,2169023,5.0,4.0,Best class I ever took.
375,2169023,5.0,4.0,"This was honestly one of the best classes I've taken at Ole Miss so far. Dr. Bliss makes the lectures fun and enjoyable. Yes, you have to pay attention in class but she makes her lectures interesting so it's not hard to. If you do what she says about studying the material, you will do just fine on the tests. Oh and DO THE EXTRA CREDIT!"
376,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Heather is the best professor ever! She wants you to excel in her class. It is not a hard course, but you will have to work for the A. Introducing ECHO 360 has helped make the class a tad bit better because of interaction."
377,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Heather says that you need the textbook but I haven't even looked at it since the first week. She comes off super 'my way or the highway' kind of teacher, but I swear if you give her a chance, it'll be one of the best classes you take. I had to take this as an elective and still enjoyed every second of the class."
378,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Super fun professor, always available to answer any questions concerning class. Just make sure you pay attention in class and study for test"
379,2169023,5.0,3.0,GREAT!!
380,2169023,5.0,4.0,In my opinion the lectures were always very interesting and I never left class without learning something new. She also kept the lecture interesting by telling these stories that were really funny in my opinion and they went along great with what we were learning so it makes learning the material easier. She gives a good amount of extra credit.
381,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Loved her class, she used many stories to keep the information interesting. I also liked how she incorporated more of the biology aspect of psychology. She uses Twitter so she is so easy to ask questions and will answer any of your DMs."
382,2169023,5.0,4.0,The best professor Ive ever had honestly
383,2169023,5.0,2.0,Bliss is my favorite teacher on this campus. She genuinely cares about her students and will go out of her way to make sure they understand the material. She's also really funny and gives a ton of extra credit. The material came easy to me so I did not have to spend much time preparing for class and exams. If you get the chance TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!
384,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bliss is very thorough in her teaching and grading, her tests and extra credit are relevant to the material in class, and she is a very entertaining professor to listen to."
385,2169023,4.0,4.0,"Good teacher, really cares about her students and getting them a good grade. Have to go to class. Keeps lecture entertaining and easy to pay attention to."
386,2169023,4.0,4.0,Heather is always easily accessible outside of class. she wants her students to do well in this course and its very obvious she cares a lot about this subject.
387,2169023,5.0,3.0,"I highly recommend this class because she makes the content of lectures very relatable and understanding. She isn't boring like regular teachers and gives us ample opportunities for extra credit(a whole letter grade). If you put in the effort, she will work with you. She uses social media to keep in touch, which makes it easier to keep informed."
388,2169023,5.0,4.0,"very passionate about what she is teaching, does everything to help you pass"
389,2169023,5.0,2.0,"She tries to scare you off in the beginning, but this is only to keep those who are prepared to put in work. She gives real-world applications to everything discussed, which makes it easy to learn. Bliss is also very easy to talk to and gives a ton of extra credit."
390,2169023,5.0,2.0,"Bliss scares you early to weed out those who aren't ready to work, BUT, once you get past that you really have one of the best psych professors. She makes lectures interesting and takes time to give examples so you understand the material. The most important thing is that you put in the effort to pay attention because her tests are application."
391,2169023,5.0,2.0,"Always willing to help you pass, easy A, never wants you to have a bad grade in the class, Always shows what is going to be on the test, Makes sure you enjoy her lectures!"

Just make sure you go to class and study!"
395,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Awesome lady, I think that the class is difficult but doable. It requires you to actually pay attention though. This isn't highschool psych where you can just half-pay attention. You are required know how to apply what she teaches to real world situations for the test."
396,2169023,4.0,3.0,"While Miss Bliss is a strict professor and her quizzes are not simple, she knows a lot about what she is teaching, funny and gives a lot of extra credit that can help balance out the student's grade."
397,2169023,5.0,3.0,"The only complaint I have against her was that she moves pretty fast through material. But if you go to class, do the assignments (not hard or long), and study for her exams, you will get an A or at least a high B."
398,2169023,5.0,3.0,Shes a great teacher and her class is pretty interesting. She shares a lot of personal stories that are hilarious yet still relate to the content.

400,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Throughout the semester, I came to Ms. Bliss multiple time discussing my grade in her class, she strived me to push forward and do better in her class. She always made me laugh and I always felt as if I could go to her if I ever needed help with anything. I would 100% recommend this class... she's really not mean!!!! :)"
401,2169023,5.0,4.0,"By far my favorite teacher I've had at the university. Very challenging, but cares for her students and actually cares that they learn. It's hard to find someone like this in general, especially a teacher!!"

403,2169023,5.0,5.0,Loved this class
404,2169023,5.0,4.0,Heather is a great teacher. She explained things very well.
405,2169023,4.0,4.0,"Make sure you get the SONA stuff done as soon as you can. Talks pretty fast, so would recommend just adding notes on powerpoint rather than taking actual paper notes. Homework and online quiz every week. Also it's based on overall points."
406,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Bliss cares about her students. If you show her that you are trying for her course, she will try to make sure that you get the grade you deserve."
407,2169023,4.0,3.0,she rocks

416,2169023,5.0,4.0,"She wants her students to learn. The best part about taking her class is knowing that she doesn't want to make your life harder, and she cares about what is going on with her students.

423,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Heather is the best teacher I've ever had. Not lying. She explains everything and makes sure you understand. She is almost always accessible outside of class. She gives a very fair amount of extra credit. And to top it all off, she is very very funny."
424,2169023,4.0,2.0,Be open minded when you enroll in class. Psychology itself talks about a lot of controversial things.

431,2169023,4.0,4.0,She wants her students to be successful and pass.
432,2169023,4.0,4.0,"She is very well respected. She doesn't take any bull crap. She is a great teacher, will help you in any way that she can. Definitely not an &quot;easy A&quot; but for sure possible if you put in a little effort. I love her. If you have a problem with cussing or aggressive personalities, don't take her, but my class thinks she rocks."

She gives a lot of extra credit opportunities too!"
443,2169023,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I've taken. She doesn't make the class easy, she makes it interesting. However, it is a lot of information to intake so take notes and ask questions.

449,2169023,5.0,2.0,Dr. Bliss is the bomb. I wish all of my teachers had her mindset. She cares for her students and wants them to excel.

463,2169023,4.0,2.0,she's cool
464,2169023,5.0,3.0,She is pretty understanding of outside situations. She send audio recording and copies of the notes if you have an excused absence in the class. Nobody can claim that she is dry.
465,2169023,5.0,3.0,I get a good understanding of each lecture. There a some pop quizzes but nothing that I wouldn't be prepared for. Related course material to students everyday life to give better explanation.
466,2169023,4.0,5.0,The test are hard.
467,2169023,5.0,3.0,"She's a really good teacher, and she has really wonderful analogies to help you understand what she is talking about. It is also a comfortable class to be in because it seems like a student is teacher us rather then an actual professor."
468,2169023,4.0,4.0,"She is a genuine person. She responds to emails lightning fast and has a good sense of humor. I really did not like the class at first, but I appreciate the subject now. I also am not doing as well as I would like in the class, but my grade does not reflect what I have learned because I have learned so much more. Bliss is highly recommended"
469,2169023,5.0,2.0,Great professor. Super funny. Lectures are very helpful. She gives study guides which sometimes have the exact answers to the test.

478,2169023,5.0,4.0,"She gives you plenty of opportunities for extra credit. She also gives you plenty of tools to help you study for the tests along the way. You do have to put in the effort if you want an A in the class, but it's not overwhelming if you keep up with the material along the way."
479,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Gives great opportunities for extra credit, don't waste it! Go to class and you will do fine."
480,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Heather Bliss does a fantastic job of relating all of the terms we learn to real life. This helps us, the students, understand the material better, and this helps us develop the ability to apply the terms to different situations."
481,2169023,5.0,2.0,"This was the one class I looked forward to every day! Miss Bliss makes the class so much more interesting than it already is. She incorporates memes into her lectures, so that's a huge plus. Even though attendance is not mandatory, it stilll helps to go to her lectures. The tests are a little hard, but if you go to class and study, you'll do fine."
482,2169023,5.0,2.0,When I tell you that there is no other PSY201 professor you need to take... I'm serious. There is no possible way that you can fail this class if you do the work... you'll get an A. She gives you soo many resources to be successful. I even thought about changing my major to PSY because of her! SHES AMAZING! TAKE HER!
483,2169023,5.0,4.0,Great Professor
484,2169023,4.0,3.0,Pretty laid back. Tests can be challenging if you don't study
485,2169023,5.0,4.0,She really is an amazing professor. I felt like she honestly cared about my education rather than just her job. I would love to have her as a professor again.
486,2169023,5.0,3.0,She's awesome and really cares about her students. Curves tests if needed and even let us  have a cheat sheet for one.
487,2169023,5.0,2.0,She does a really good job lecturing and keeping attention. She truly explains why her grades work the way they do. She also is easy to help you if you need it.

492,2169023,4.0,3.0,Great teacher. I feel that she really cares about the class. Really helps with studying for the test due to the review slides.
493,2169023,5.0,5.0,last year i failed to write a review for Heather. I wish I did. I went to her privately with a personal problem and she actually walked me to the counseling center and let me know I was not alone. I never thought i would have a teacher be so caring. i was like a stranger to her. more prof. should be like her. I miss her
494,2169023,4.0,4.0,overall pretty good and she's cool. highly recommended.
495,2169023,5.0,2.0,If you want to pass Psychology at Ole Miss you will take Heather. She is easy to get a hold of and wants every to do well. She understands that this is a class that many students take! First test is hardest and gets easy from there. If you have any sort of work ethic you should pass this class with a High B or A. Plenty of extra credit
496,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Young super cool professor. Very laid back lecture class because the notes are posted online, so you can just sit and do what you want as long as you aren't disturbing the class. Quizzes are very easy. Tests are somewhat easy if you just take the quizzes and skim over PowerPoint notes once."
497,2169023,5.0,2.0,She is a good teacher with great analogies!
498,2169023,4.0,4.0,She makes class interesting. Always has examples and  comes prepared
499,2169023,5.0,4.0,She is very helpful with anything you do.  She emails back extremely quick.  All her exams are based on the lecture slides.  As long as you read the lecture slides and understand the quizzes you will do fine in her class.  Awesome teacher.
500,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Very good Professor who really cares about her class. Not very easy class, put in the work to get the grade."
501,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Heather is one of the most passionate teachers i've had this semester. She cares about our success and went above and beyond for us; however, we still had to work for our grades.  Extremely fair and reasonable teacher."
502,2169023,3.0,4.0,Tests are hard but she does her best to try to help us out with review days. GO TO REVIEW DAYS!! Leave lots of time to study for this class. Lots of info is crammed into each test.
503,2169023,5.0,4.0,"I enjoyed attending Heather Bliss's class.  She was very intimidating at first, but she cares about you succeeding and is willing to work with you to achieve that.  She is young and cool and understands the college process.  Her tests are hard, but she prepares you for them."
504,2169023,4.0,4.0,"Super,Super,Super awesome teacher! Her slides are not to boring and they are very easy to understand! Heather is very easy to reach. I love this psychology class and I would most def recommend students to chose her!"
505,2169023,4.0,3.0,She's a good psychology teacher
506,2169023,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher, she really care about you and your grade, be sure to come to class and study. You will enjoy her and the class."
507,2169023,2.0,3.0,The lectures are just her reading the powerpoints that we already have
508,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Heather Bliss is easily my favorite instructor ever. She's very funny and helpful. She obviously knows what she's talking about, and I have thoroughly enjoyed her class."
509,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Really good teacher, you have to be able to pay attention or you will not pass at all."
510,2169023,4.0,4.0,Lots of critical thinking! if you study you'll be fine!
511,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Bliss is a great Psychology professor. If I was able to take Psychology 201 again, I would love to take Ms. Bliss again."
512,2169023,5.0,4.0,She genuinely cares about students learning the material rather than remembering for an exam. The exams are tough but have gotten easier. The quizzes help to study for the exam. Learn how to think critically instead of remembering terms because she doesn't care what you know she cares how you apply it. This is my favorite class of all time!
513,2169023,3.0,4.0,"Obvious first year teacher. In-classs examples of the material were odd. It seems like she teaches the way she understands and relates to the material versus how it should be taught. Tries to give ""relatable"" examples to the class, but it just comes off very awkward and odd. Great effort, but her teaching methods just do not click with me."
514,2169023,4.0,3.0,"Heather Bliss is a great professor who gives great examples for her topics. Tests will be hard, something you definitely need to study for. Extra credit comes easy with a little extra effort. I would totally select her as you professor if you have the option to, she makes coming to class pretty easy."
515,2169023,5.0,3.0,She tells good stories about her life. It helps to remember the definitions better.
516,2169023,5.0,4.0,Really smart and passionate teacher. Teaches at a fast but smooth pace thats easy to understand. Never gets boring and is easy pay attention to. I highly recommend this class for those who have a interest in the material because I can't imagine someone teaching it in a fun and interesting way.
517,2169023,4.0,4.0,"She's really funny, and cares about the grades of her students- she offers a lot of extra credit opportunities, but they still make you work for the credit. Due to the heavy amount of material, her lectures go by very quickly and she speaks very fast, but she posts the powerpoints online. Come to class for material she may not post online!!"
518,2169023,5.0,4.0,YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE HER CLASS!!! I love her class so so so much!!!!! She is hilarious and explains things to where you can understand it. She makes sure that she goes along with the book and gives her own examples. The most fun I've had in a lecture class. She slays!!!! If you plan to take psychology GET HER!!! I promise you wont regret it.
519,2169023,4.0,3.0,"She is honest, and gives students enough materials which covers the textbook and exam."
520,2169023,5.0,4.0,"The material is really long, but easy to learn. Heather Bliss is a really good teacher who makes the classes really interesting and hilarious. She is also very understanging with students and gives you options to earn extra credit"
521,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bliss does a great job of covering the material and gives you many resources to help you pass this class. She truly enjoys what she does. She talks a little fast sometimes,but she will catch herself. Also, if she likes your class you will get funny stories. I definitely recommend her. (Laugh at her jokes)"
522,2169023,5.0,1.0,She makes the material really easy to understand by telling a lot of personal stories which I personally find very funny. She is very considerate because she is a graduate student and totally understands what we're going through as college students. She gives a lot of quizzes but they help you learn the material instead of cramming for the exam.
523,2169023,5.0,4.0,"She's really funny and cool. The class itself is a lot of information to know and learn, but she is helpful with remembering through funny stories or analogies. Also, she tells you straight forward what's going to be on the exams and quizzes and provides enough review for you to pass."
524,2169023,4.0,3.0,Class is enjoyable. Professor makes jokes and helps you understand the material.
525,2169023,5.0,4.0,She is a good teacher that makes you work for it. If you pay attention in class and put forth a bit of effort outside of class you should be fine. You should also read the book. That would help.
526,2169023,3.0,3.0,"She's a pretty good teacher, and she's really good with answering any questions you may have on the material. All of the learned information comes directly from the textbook, so you actually have to read it. The tests are pretty straightforward, but they do have some critical thinking questions (they're not hard though)."
527,2169023,5.0,2.0,Very good at explaining the material.
528,2169023,5.0,4.0,She is a good teacher that makes you work for it. If you pay attention in class and put forth a bit of effort outside of class you should be fine.
529,2169023,4.0,3.0,I really enjoyed this class. Slides are available online and are really helpful for the online quizzes.
530,2169023,5.0,3.0,Great professor! This is my first time taking a psychology class with Ms. Bliss it is awesome! She has very informative lectures mixed in with a great sense of humor! In order to well in the class you need to come to lecture and should read the book. If you want to get a high grade you need to read the book too. Take Ms. Bliss! You won't regret it!
531,2169023,5.0,2.0,Great teacher.
532,2169023,4.0,3.0,Pretty easy class if you just study a lot the night before the test. Gives a lot of extra credit opportunities.
533,2169023,5.0,4.0,"She makes understanding the lessons extremely easy. She makes (sometimes) funny jokes, and one of my best professors. I would extremely recommend anyone taking this course to choose her as their professor."
534,2169023,4.0,4.0,Challenging but determined to make students succeed
535,2169023,4.0,4.0,Solid teacher tough but fair
536,2169023,5.0,1.0,Awesome.
537,2169023,5.0,3.0,Great attitude in class. Very helpful and kind. Responds well and very quickly to e-mails and text messages.
538,2169023,5.0,2.0,I really enjoyed the class and Heather's willingness to help all students and see us succeed. She is always helpful with reviewing for tests and answering any questions. Every test is very accessible and extra credit is offered regularly.
539,2169023,5.0,4.0,Great teacher. Difficult material but helps better understand material. Fun class. Makes material interesting and easy to learn.
540,2169023,5.0,4.0,She's great! Goes really in depth into lectures and gives great analogies for the material. I would definitely take her again! AMAZING!!
541,2169023,5.0,3.0,She's freaking awesome and can really help out if you aren't doing good and has great stories.
542,2169023,5.0,4.0,great teacher. really knows what she's talking about and is engaged with the class instead of having a monotonous tone every lecture. makes jokes a lot so just laugh even if they aren't funny. i would highly recommend taking the class even if you aren't interested in psychology that much. There's a lot of information so be prepared but its worth it
543,2169023,5.0,2.0,This is me being more specific because its required. She's good.
544,2169023,5.0,3.0,"The class is awesome, but she tends to teach fast. All the slides are posted though so you could get away with really not listening at all."
545,2169023,5.0,3.0,Heather Bliss is an awesome teacher and I highly recommend her!
546,2169023,4.0,3.0,"She is a cool teacher, helps out as much as she can, and is hilarious."
547,2169023,5.0,3.0,This is my favorite class and my absolute favorite teacher. She begs us to come visit her outside of class. She really wants you to do well and makes sure that you know that. The lectures are interesting and not hard to follow. She gives examples of everything to help you understand. There are always extra credit options. Definitely take this class
548,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Offers a lot of extra credit and all lectures are accessible online. If you miss class she is understanding. Study for tests then you will do fine as she gives you a review of exactly what is on the test. The course in general requires studying, but she definitely makes the course much easier than other professors."
549,2169023,4.0,4.0,The tests are hard but she's cool
550,2169023,5.0,2.0,"Love her, she's awesome. Jealous of her fiance."
551,2169023,5.0,4.0,She is a very funny professor who is very good at communicating what she wants you to learn in class. She gives good exam reviews. I would highly recommend her.
552,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Although the first test is the hardest one, it doesn't mean that you should give up after that. If you come to class and review the PowerPoints, it is not that hard to make an A. She gives a lot of helpful info to those who actually come to class, so I highly suggest that you go (it will make the class a lot easier). Her lectures are entertaining."
553,2169023,4.0,2.0,"She is so sweet and so helpful! She will respond to you as soon as you email you. She will answer all your questions and will never be condescending. She understands if you have personal problems come up and her personality makes the class enjoyable. She wants everyone to do well so she will do what she can, as long as you do. Take her class!!!!"
554,2169023,4.0,4.0,"Professor Bliss is a great psychology teacher. At first, I was a bit scared and intimidated because she did not try and make the class seem easy. But, If you make sure and go to class, pay attention, and put in study hours outside of the class you will pass with an A. She is also very fair and willing to take time to make sure you understand. DO IT"
555,2169023,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. Lectures are not boring
556,2169023,3.0,4.0,"This was her first class to teach ever so I understand she is likely to learn and get better with time. Lectures have the potential to be good, she goes quickly through things and I feel as if she doesn't prepare for the test. Tests are a lot of  critical thinking and that is tough. She is, however, caring and wants us to do our best."
557,2169023,5.0,3.0,Great teacher
558,2169023,4.0,3.0,"While this class is fun, be sure to pay attention and take notes! The first exam is without a doubt the hardest, but the rest get easier from there. Her office hour meetings are also very helpful and I would highly reccommend scheduling a time with her. She's also very relatable and wants you to excel in school!"
559,2169023,5.0,2.0,Really good teacher. Makes it known that she is available over email at almost all hours of the day.  Lectures are on blackboard. She tells you what to prepare for on the test and. Quizzes are not too difficult but take some critical thinking. Take her!
560,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Lectures easy to follow, attendance not mandatory but helpful, tests get easier through semester"
561,2169023,4.0,3.0,she is awesome take her
562,2169023,5.0,3.0,She is a great teacher. Very laid back. Always answers emails or texts. Lots of extra credit
563,2169023,5.0,3.0,Professor Bliss is a great teacher that helps students understand and learn more difficult content easier.
564,2169023,4.0,3.0,Good teacher who cares about her student's success.
565,2169023,5.0,3.0,Heather Bliss is awesome!! She relates things in her lectures to outside stpries so the concepts are easier to understand.  She also gives lots of extra credit and warns you about certain things on her tests.  I would definitely take her again.
566,2169023,5.0,3.0,"Professor Bliss is a very good professor even though it's her first semester teaching. She not only is understanding of any issues that may come up, but she also is willing to help resolve the problems."
567,2169023,5.0,3.0,Professor Bliss is a good teacher and make the difficult content of psychology more understandbale.
568,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bliss makes the material easy for everyone to understand. She puts her powerpoint up on Blackboard so you have more material to study with for the test. If you do not understand something, she will go over it during class or during office hours more in depth."
569,2169023,5.0,3.0,"She is always looking for ways to help you, and is genuinely concerned about your grade and how to help you pass the class."
570,2169023,3.0,3.0,"Good teacher, uses powerpoint to go over information which are posted on blackboard.  Tests can be tough but if you pay attention in class they will be easy.  I would definitely recommend this teacher."
571,2169023,5.0,4.0,"Super fun and she makes the really hard stuff understandable, but not a slack off class! You do need to do work and pay attention! She will subtly leave hints to extra credit and test questions you just have to be listening"
572,2169023,5.0,3.0,Professor Heather took the time to ensure everyone understood the material before advancing. She also values feedback from students about quizzes and tests. She answers emails within 15 minutes of them being sent with full explanations of the answer. She also puts all lectures up online so you can be ready for class.
573,1953984,3.5,3.0,"Go to class because he gives quizzes randomly and they help your grade a lot - kind of guy who loves to give quizzes when attendance is low. Acts like he wants to be a nice guy but then out of nowhere will do things to downright rude students. Also, no laptop policy-total insult to students. Not a hard class if you study."
574,2128071,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr. D for the Honors Accounting Thesis course, and we had to write cases every other week, participate in 2 case competitions, and attend meetings every other week with the firms. Dr. D is great and being in this class has taught me so much and given me such an advantage in the recruiting process for internships!"
575,2062537,5.0,3.0,Great teacher with experience in the field. Not a sugar coater!
576,2732232,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely loved this class. This is my favorite class I have taken so far in college. I am in her Pop Culture writing class and I would take it again and again. While there is work and you can't slack, she makes herself available and essay prompts that you actually enjoy. I am genuinely sad I will not be able to take her class next year."
577,2732232,4.0,3.0,shes not a bad professor. she gets snappy sometimes and most of the time there is hw due every class. a good amount of work but its not hard to pass. strict attendance policy and she talks to you like your dumb but i would take again
578,2732232,4.0,2.0,I am the laziest student ever and still got a good grade in her class. Shes really helpful and makes it where you can pass very easily
579,2732232,4.0,3.0,"Shes so usually nice and helpful! However some days shes really moody and yells a lot. Easily ticked off but when in a good mood shes nice. Not hard to pass, and her lessons help a lot."
580,2414804,4.0,4.0,Good guy but quizzes are kind of hard. Easy to listen to & hes funny!! Need to study the book for them!! Only 5 quizzes and a midterm and final.
581,1319125,5.0,1.0,I love his class.
582,1319125,5.0,2.0,"He is a great teacher. He is really helpful in learning the material, and he explains everything really well. He is pretty funny too. As long as you listen in class, you will do fine."
583,1319125,3.5,3.0,"He is fully willing to explain all problems that anyone has trouble with and has bases a lot of his homework online, which isn't that hard and has help if you need it along the way. There are also an unlimited amount of tries on the homework."
584,1319125,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I've ever had
585,2257113,1.0,4.0,I went into theater thinking it would be an 'easy A' class. She won't respond to emails with questions. She does not have office hours. My roommate and I  are both really bothered by this class and the teacher. It is the day before the final and multiple major grades are not entered.
586,1478876,4.0,2.0,"He is a sweetheart. Honors chem isn't easy, but he provides several past years' tests with the keys to help you study, and his tests are true to what you learn in lecture. The only qualm is that the grade for the class is only the four tests + final, but overall his class is not v hard and he is more than willing to help in office hours if needed. "
587,1478876,3.0,1.0,I personally didn't find lectures very helpful but I could see someone who didn't already know the information finding them useful. I took AP Chem in high school and this class was a breeze in comparison.
588,1478876,5.0,2.0,"He is a pretty chill teacher, only graded by test (for honors vs of course), but the tests are easy and he provides you with test banks."
589,1478876,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Davis is one of the smartest teachers I have ever had. He is hilarious and a good proffesor. He is so smart that sometimes it is very complicated to understand, but he is so helpful and accesible outside of class. There is no attendance policy and our only real grades come from tests, but he gives ALOT of extra credit."
590,1478876,1.0,3.0,"He's a nice guy and curves his tests in a way that makes it really helpful to pass. However his lectures are often pointless, as in he almost never discusses pertinent material, and always drifts off topic. If you have taken an AP Chem course in HS you will find this was more challenging than this class is."
591,1478876,4.0,3.0,A decent professor with a great curve on each exam. Offers assistance when needed and very helpful.
592,1478876,3.0,3.0,"He's kind of silly and gets off topic OFTEN during lectures. Honestly, you could skip class, learn the material on the practice tests on your own, and do fine. He was really nice and willing to help, but sometimes his help just confused me more. I enjoyed his class, but I probably wouldn't take him again."
593,1478876,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Davis is very intelligent which means sometimes you won't understand his lectures. Everything you need to learn will be posted on his webpage and if you do the practice tests you can make an A easily. He also offers ""challenge problems"" for extra credit that can increase your grade by 5%! I'd recommend getting a Chegg account for this course."
594,1478876,4.0,3.0,Very funny to listen to his stories. He gets off topic a lot and you may have to teach yourself stuff outside of class. He doesn't require you to even buy the book. Do all the optional homework and practice tests he posts online and you will pass easily.
595,1478876,3.0,3.0,"My man Davis has optional homework and weekly challenge questions. Both of those are worth a 5% each to your overall grade at the end of the semester if you complete a certain amount of them. This is an easy chemistry class, the reason I'm giving him a 3 is because it's not very challenging and I don't really want to be handed a grade."
596,1478876,2.0,2.0,His class is really easy. Only 4 tests. Make sure you do well on them. There is no homework. One bonus at the end of the semester. He's really sweet and funny but doesn't explain well.
597,1478876,5.0,2.0,"He's the man.  No attendance required, no textbook required, all lectures explained very well."
598,1478876,3.0,3.0,helpfull
599,2279646,5.0,4.0,He really cares about his students succeeding in his class. He will always meet with you and help you anyway he can.
600,2279646,5.0,4.0,"Homework can be harder than the material in class, but hes always open to help you outside of class, provided that you actually reach out to him. I met with him an hour every week for extra help, and he was always more than willing to help. Grades his test pretty reasonably compared to other professors"
601,2279646,5.0,3.0,"very nice and wants to help you pass! sometimes homework might be harder than lecture material, but tests are generally what you covered in class - not hard if you pay attention"
602,2783460,5.0,1.0,Professor Thorndike is very lenient with grading and cares more about students understanding the material. She is also very passionate and cares deeply about student success. 
603,2783460,5.0,2.0,"This teacher is very understanding and grades very fairly. Theres minimal course work and its very easy. If you show up to class and put effort into assignments and projects, you will get an A."
604,1444069,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful professor. She cuts through the BS and give you history straight. She is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Go to class, pay attention, and show interest. She is more than willing to help if you have difficulty."
605,1444069,5.0,4.0,just go to class and see her in her office after tests and papers and you will get an A.
606,1814764,1.0,5.0,"Not a teacher at all, she just teaches content unimportant to anyone and you have to teach yourself how to code. If you wanna spend 9k to teach yourself off google, then go ahead."
607,1814764,1.0,5.0,This is pt 2. Her programs are barely doable and her lab instructors have to teach you the material. The only reviews she gives are not beneficial at all. Even her TAs speak badly about her teaching. Please do not take this professor unless you 100% have to. All things aside she just is not a great teacher at all. No instructions for programs
608,1814764,1.0,5.0,I absolutely do not recommend that you take her for any class. I took her for what was supposed to be a beginner class and she assumed everyone was very knowledgeable in computer programming anyway. Her lectures are boring and all over the place. There are three tests and they are extremely tough material. This is part 1 of my review of her.
609,1814764,4.0,3.0,She is not the most approachable but she gives very clear and detailed assignment guidelines. If you keep up with the work it's hard to get lost. She is very helpful in office hours as well.
610,1814764,5.0,1.0,"SO EASY!!!! MADE A 98. Easy online elective. Some of the assignments can only be done on a PC so if you go to the library for those, you will 100% make all A's. Only 2 tests which she gives practice tests before. As long as you keep up with the work you will make an A."
611,1814764,5.0,4.0,Gives plenty of assignments to help bump up grades although your grade is still mostly reliant on tests. The tests are somewhat difficult but doing the online review helps tons.
612,1814764,1.0,4.0,She seems friendly but isn't and the book is useless so don't get it
613,1814764,2.0,4.0,She teaches like you've done some coding before so if you haven't I'd recommend someone else
614,1814764,3.5,4.0,"She is tough but also fair. if you read, pay attention to her lectures, and do your assignments well ahead of time, you will be fine. If you never have coded before, you might benefit from taking an easier class first to make your life better. She helps with assignments if you do it ahead of time and have seriously tried everything"
615,1814764,4.0,4.0,Instructor had mostly java based experience. This lead to comparisons with java and matlab which could be confusing at times. She was impatient with people that were unprepared. Come prepared or don't ask a question because of laziness on your part. Tough class but one where hard work pays off.
616,1814764,1.0,4.0,"She is heartless, she doesn't care about helping a student out. You uses the SAM computer program as a teacher and won't answer questions or help you out on any thing. This is suppose to be an easier 100 level class an entry level class, and she makes it so difficult."
617,1814764,3.5,4.0,"Pretty challenging class, but can get a good grade if you work hard. Just be willing to put the time and effort in. Mrs. Davidson is pretty clear in her teaching so just pay attention and ask for help."
618,1814765,4.5,1.0,Super easy grader. Put no effort into the class and made an A without a problem. Made an A on every paper too. Just do the work and you'll make an A. She will also freely give extensions on any assignment. Barely had to write papers.
619,1857774,4.0,4.0,"Good teacher, hard class, doesn't care who you are. Extremely knowledgable. If you're interested in history this is perfect"
620,1857774,3.5,4.0,"He is a great lecturer and professor but you have to be at every class if you want to pass! There are not many grades. He gives 2 papers and 3 tests. Those are the only grades you get so if you want to do well, you have to do well on all of his assignments. He does have a no technology policy so take good notes!"
621,1857774,4.5,4.0,"I loved this class.  Yes, this is not the easiest class; but he is a great lecturer.  He doesn't play games with his class; but you'll be rewarded if you do what's expected of you."
622,1857774,3.5,3.0,"Very, very clear on what he wants for assignments and tests.  If you pay attention and take very detailed notes, you should do fine on the exams.  But reading for this class is a must if you want to pass!"
623,1857774,3.0,5.0,"Very smart guy, which may be why he grades so tough. Knows his stuff and lectures are fairly interesting, but only a few tests per semester and they're essay. "
624,1857774,1.5,4.0,"Not many tests, Mid- term and Final are essay. "
625,1857774,2.0,5.0,"He's a very tough grader, and he doesn't give very much work, so the stuff that you do, you need to make it count.  "
626,1857774,2.5,5.0,"This guy obviously knew his stuff. During his lectures, he looks down at his notes MAYBE 3 times. It seems like no matter how hard you pay attention, and no matter how extensive your notes are, you still can't get the grade you want. He assigns readings out the wazuu, so brace yourself. He doesn't assign much work either, so if you mess up, its big"
627,1857774,2.5,4.0,Don't feel like the test are accurate assessments of the lecture material very few grades and tough class. 
628,1857774,2.5,4.0,"If your prefer lecture based teachers then you'll love this teacher.  He is very thorough, but you need to pay close attention."
629,1857774,3.5,3.0,"Not terribly hard, lecture based. Only a few grades so you have to do well when it counts. Mid term and final are essay format."
630,2418924,5.0,4.0,She herself is an amazing professor. She wants to help teach you the material and is more than happy to talk to you after class or during office hours. BUT she teaches a different way than other teachers and it makes it very difficult. You NEED to read the book and LISTEN to music. Go to her office hours a lot and ask a lot of questions.
631,1589489,5.0,1.0,The best professor ever!
632,2418930,5.0,3.0,Dr. Unger helped me with so much and was very helpful for first year students. He gives you so many chances to get the grade you desire as long as you are willing to work with him. Many opportunities to fix errors in papers as well and interesting projects!
633,2418930,5.0,3.0,What an amazing professor. He loves to talk to everyone in the class and he makes the subjects super easy to learn. If you have trouble writing (Like ME) he will help guide you to where you need to be. He gives amazing feedback on your ideas to help form your papers. If you can take his class DO IT
634,1589491,1.0,5.0,"Can't understand a word he says, his power points are just pictures so you can't study them, his study guide only covers a minuscule amount of the test, reading over the chapters will not help you. His tests cover stuff you might have never seen with questions extremely similar answers."
635,1589491,3.0,3.0,"His lectures are long and straight from the powerpoints that are posted online. His weekly quizzes are very easy, but the exams are pretty tough.  I could not understand his accent well though..."
636,1958133,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Labuda is a fine teacher and can adaquately teach the material for the course, the exams are up until the final reflected what was on the homework. The final exam she wrote was awful, nothing on it had been taught in class; one question from the homework was included. Held onto a B+ all semester and the final dropped my grade to a C."
637,1958133,3.0,4.0,"Though, though mostly because of the class. Lectures are fine; she seems to be rather helpful. Homework is plentiful and tests are tough."
638,1958133,3.0,4.0,"The material of Physics 214 is hard, so no matter who the teacher the material is difficult. She has a bad rep but I don't understand why. She is understanding and will help you if you ask her to. The tests are difficult, but the homework is online and fairly simple. She notices when you go to class and definitely is more likely to help if you do."
639,1958133,1.0,5.0,just no.
640,1958133,1.5,5.0,"Not a very good teacher. Very hard to understand, the assignments were really long and most of the time were not like the tests. Tests were extremely difficult. Be prepared for a tutor or be able to teach yourself, because you won't learn from her."
641,1626357,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Smith is a solid history professor. I currently have an A in that class. Weekly quizzes, test are typically based directly from quizzes. 3 book reports for the class. Multiple writing assignments. Overall a good class, just gotta put in the work. "
642,1626357,5.0,2.0,"Barely any homework but she tests on very specific facts that she mentions during lectures. You have to take good notes and pay attention during class, but if you do, you should be fine. "
643,1626357,1.0,4.0,"Awful. Reads off a 50 minute long script of a lecture while never reminding the class about upcoming work. Puts in very minimal effort to teach class. Lots of papers, quizzes, and hard tests. What to expect in the classroom: walk in, sit down, listen to monotone lecture for 50 minutes straight, leave class. Highly recommend not taking. "
644,1626357,4.0,3.0,"Lectures from powerpoint. Doesn't tell you about assignments in class, so you have to stay on top of that yourself. Quizzes weekly. No textbook but she posts things to read on blackboard. Tests comes from the quizzes though. Makes you read a few books and write papers over them which can be graded harshly depending on TA. "
645,1626357,1.0,3.0,puts in little work
646,1626357,2.0,3.0,"Lectures were very all over the place and very confusing. Overall very difficult to follow along with what was going on in class. Some in class assignments, mostly on Fridays, for points. If you show up, do your work, and study a little you should make a B. Can find all weekly quiz answers on quizlet, so use that to help you study after."
647,1626357,1.0,3.0,Took her iStudy course and it is the worst course I have ever taken. She expects multiple long essays per week that equate to 5-7 pages. On top of the essays you still have to answer other questions that require you to do the reading. Her syllabus is very unclear on what the requirements and expectations are.
648,1626357,5.0,3.0,"Easy going personality. Lectures easy to understand, obvious she's very knowledgeable. Answers every question. Homework is easy just be sure to keep up with deadlines. You have to pay attention, some of the tests are written answer. Surprise video quizes are great because - its a video, answer as you watch. But you have to show up."
649,1626357,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher, but LOTS of papers."
650,1626357,5.0,1.0,"She is an awesome instructor.  I took this online class with her, and I learned a lot by doing the required work.  She is COMPLETELY fair, and I respect her in every way.  I learned a lot from the books I read, and the exams fairly reflected the readings.  It is an easy way to get your required history class.  If you are an ok student, take it"
651,1626357,5.0,1.0,"Top quality teacher.  She knows the content well, and grades fairly.  The class is an awesome 300 level history to take.  She notes who participates, and really appreciate students who put forth effort.  You can easily earn an A if you choose to.  She is not one of those teachers who refuses to award AB+ grades.  Really a great teacher."
652,1626357,2.0,3.0,"Relies on blackboard a lot. Got a 4 on the Language & Composition AP and a 75 on an essay in this class, that was graded by a TA. Took every single practice test until I got a 100 3x in a row and got a 75 on the exam that looked nothing like any of the practice tests. If I could go back I'd take the course with a different teacher in a heart beat"
653,1626357,3.5,2.0,I am currently in her class. There are a few simple assignments to help you learn the material that take max 15 minutes &  are due before the class period that the topics are covered in. She is willing to help you if you are willing to do the work. Just have to stay on top of assignments.
654,1626357,4.5,3.0,Not as easy as you will think at first.  Tests have a lot of names and facts on them. Use the practice tests she uses questions from those a lot on the tests.
655,1626357,5.0,1.0,"Easy class, relaxed and willing to help everyone. Like a high school class, barely did the homework readings other than skimming the books and filling out the question sheets and still did great in the class!"
656,1626357,5.0,1.0,She was extremely friendly and easy.  The class felt like a high school class and sometimes like an 8th great class.  She wanted everyone to do well.
657,1116412,5.0,5.0,"Excellent prof, but he is leaving. Will be much missed :("
658,1116412,5.0,5.0,Excellent Professor
659,1116412,5.0,4.0,Excellent guy. take him if you want to learn
660,1116412,5.0,5.0,Dr. Govind is the best professor I ever had but he is also the toughest. I got so much from his class.
661,1116412,5.0,5.0,"The dude is great, perhaps my best ever. you do need to work your ass off though"
662,1116412,5.0,5.0,He is a great teacher but he makes you work your ass off. But he knows how to teach. do not take this class if you are not a marketing major
663,1116412,5.0,5.0,"Hard as a rock, but best I have ever had. Dont take it if you dont intend to work. But if yo udo, he will show you how to think; not something I can say about the rest of my professors"
664,1116412,5.0,5.0,He is the best I've ever had... and that is saying a LOT! More like an elder sibling you never had. His class is tough but he makes it soooo interesting
665,1116412,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Govind is not the easiest professor, but he is a great one. His lectures are clear and he's always available for help outside of class. The MarkStrat simulation is challenging, but if you work hard at it, you can learn so much more than a textbook can teach you. I highly recommend him if you are interested in more than just squeaking by."
666,2140414,2.0,4.0,"Writes notes on blackboard, tests and quizzes are on the notes. You'll never receive anything to study off of besides maps when they are on the test (guaranteed points if you study, but don't be fooled), and good grief is she a TOUGH essay grader. Plus all fill in the blank questions that are dates, names, places, events, anything. So hard."
667,2140414,4.0,4.0,"Sweet teacher but a tough course! she only assigns 2 tests, 3 pop quizzes (usually hints at these in class though) and a final. Test format is tough. 30 points go towards fill in the blank and a map while the other 70 go towards an essay portion. She gives essay prompts ahead of time but grades the essay the toughest."
668,573696,5.0,5.0,"Best teacher I have ever had! Once you make a personal relationship with him he will go out of his way to help you all he can. He does however not help people who just ask for help after the fail the class, he gives a quiz every class and only has a final, and he grades the class biased on the top few students. "
669,573696,5.0,4.0,By far the best professor at Ole Miss! Just make sure you are on time a read the material before class!
670,573696,1.0,5.0,"Always be ready for pop quizzes. Get familiar with the text book, that's what you'll be learning from."
671,573696,2.0,5.0,"emotional scarring may fade away, but that big fat D on your transcript won't"
672,573696,4.5,4.0,"It's been some years since I had classes under Dr Davis, but his classes did more to prepare me for the real world of accounting than any other teacher in my entire time at Ole Miss, both undergrad and MBA.  Tough, yes, but also very fair."
673,573696,3.0,5.0,You'll hear his voice in your head for the rest of your life....&quot;I don't give a HOTTY TODDY!&quot;
674,573696,1.0,5.0,"He is horrible. He has no interest at all in helping his students, he just wants to make fun of people and try to be funny."
675,573696,3.5,5.0,"Previous comment is correct, but he will certainly prepare you for the field of accounting.  Also, he can be VERY influential in getting you a job."
676,573696,1.0,5.0,He is an egotistical **** on a power trip from hell.  He attempts to make everyone as miserable as he is
677,2140418,4.0,2.0,"I really liked him as a professor, If you show up and do the modules every week and watch the lectures you will pass. His weekly modules are not hard and he doesnt grade them hard and he takes students concerns into consideration."
678,2140418,3.0,2.0,"Honestly quite a boring class, but Dr. Carlisle obviously cares about what he teaches and his students. I took his hybrid class, and it was probably one of my easiest classes all semester. As long as you put in the effort and study for the couple of tests, you'll make it out with an A. Worst part was having to go to two concerts to review them."
679,2140418,1.0,5.0,"Take theater instead. This man is a joke he takes his ONE HUNDRED level class way too seriously, expect to write a 300 word discussion + a response + a quiz + panopto videos + class participation EVERY WEEK. He's passionate about his subject but simply should not be a professor, working with young people is not his calling. &amp; he is rude."
680,2140418,4.0,2.0,If you attend his class and show you're putting in effort you'll end up with a good grade. There is one module a week and occasionally an additional assignment that takes less than an hour. He's a great teacher who is clearly very passionate about what he's teaching and responds to emails very quickly. If possible try to take mon-wed-fri.
681,2140418,3.0,3.0,"Don't take this class if you don't like music. While he doesn't make you write as many papers or do as much homework as other music classes, his lectures are usually long. He goes on tangents very frequently. Not too quick on input of grades. Overall, a nice guy but an average teacher."
682,2140418,3.0,3.0,lectures get boring. you need to have some care in classical music.
683,2140418,4.0,2.0,"gives credit for participation, missing class results in a 0 for the day. This is a hybrid half online half lecture class and online quizzes are easy but if you miss one it counts as an absence! super nice teacher but sometimes he rambles! he is super passionate and this is a great class!"
684,2158856,5.0,2.0,"A very intelligent guy, an engaging teacher, and really cares about making the class an enjoyable experience for you."
685,2158856,5.0,3.0,"Andrew Henning is one of the most genuine people you'll ever meet, and is an excellent professor. He truly cares about his students learning and doing well in class, and as long as you put forth an effort, he will help you get the grade you need. He makes the class fun and interesting, and explains everything clearly. I highly recommend him."
686,2158856,5.0,3.0,"I bounced around between many majors before trying CSci, which my parents wanted because of $$$$. I was lucky enough to have Drew, who made dull subjects interesting and convinced me that I had the ability level. Great teacher and terribly nice guy."
687,2681099,5.0,1.0,Such a chill professor. He makes it almost impossible to fail his class. There are weekly quizzes due on Saturdays and four exams. He even tells fun prison stories so 10/10 would recommend him. I took him for CJ 202 and I absolutely hate math but he makes it tolerable and easy.
688,2681099,5.0,2.0,He was an incredible professor especially for his first time teaching. My biggest thing was that he had the experience to back up what he was saying. H constantly found fun stories from his experiences to help his students better understand the material. He was always open to take questions and go the extra mile for his students HIGHLY recommend.
689,2681099,5.0,2.0,"Loved this class! He includes personal experiences which make it so much more interesting. If I could take him again in the future, I would 100%."
690,2681099,5.0,1.0,"Great professor, best one I've had so far for my first year. He's really chill and understanding and gives reasonable due dates and amount of work. Quizzes and tests are super easy, just use quizlet. He grades reasonably too. Long lectures though where he is almost reading off each slides work for word. Would HIGHLY take again if I could."
691,872715,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Moore was an amazing professor who did not mind speaking one on one with her students. When she returned papers to you, she gave feedback and great criticism to make it better for the next draft. I had to miss two weeks of this class to have my daughter and she was SO willing to work with me through the medical leave through email."
692,872715,5.0,2.0,She was awesome!
693,872715,5.0,4.0,Dr. Moore is great all around. Take as many classes from her as you can. She is fun and engaging and definitely knows the material. Just read what she asks of you and you will be fine.
694,872715,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Moore was awesome. She cared, really knew the material, and just was generally really cool. I learned a lot in her class. Also, I think she's pretty hot. ;*"
695,872715,5.0,3.0,She's absolutely spectacular!
696,872715,4.5,3.0,No Comments
697,872715,5.0,3.0,Made Shakespeare fun!
698,872715,5.0,3.0,Dr. Moore is awesome!  She was one of the few teachers that I actually enjoyed having.  She made all of the material interesting and class was always fun and entertaining.  I enjoyed her relaxed personality and the way she was very open to the class.  I would definately recommend her to anyone else!
699,1503502,2.0,3.0,"She is extremely hard to pay attention to and she just downright rude sometimes. I kinda deserve the grade I'm getting right now, but everyone in the class says that it is hard to follow her teachings and that she shouldn't be teaching the way she is. The book is actually worth reading and is not like a regular text on the subject."
700,1638673,3.0,5.0,"Used her study guide, answered all questions. Took all questions from textbook, answered them. 20 page study guide per test. What's on the test? Nothing relevant to her damn study guide. She makes Geo 101 a hard class, for no reason. Everyone I know in that class averages 60% per test. This is ridiculous. Take Kathy Grace."
701,1638673,5.0,2.0,"great teacher, go to class and do blackboard assignments and youll be fine! a must take class!"
702,1638673,5.0,2.0,"I hate geology, but Patterson makes me want to learn about rocks. She is so helpful and so kind. She doesn't give out extra credit unless no one is in class... SO GO TO CLASS EVERY DAY! Her lectures are interesting because she truly loves what she is doing, and wants everyone to do well.. if you go to class that is. Her tests are easy!"
703,1722644,5.0,3.0,Awesome instructor!
704,1880341,5.0,3.0,Willing to help you as long as you are putting forth the effort to go to class and succeed; well respected by students & peers; Doesn't cater to one learning style over another (teaches everything in such a way that everyone is able to understand);Helps students that are no longer enrolled in his classes with job placement & whatever they may need
705,1880341,4.5,3.0,"Mr. Williams expects a lot of his students; however, he also understands the stress that college brings students. He prioritizes student needs & concerns to make sure that students are confident in their abilities. He is a phenomenal professor & I would highly recommend taking his class. He wore Christmas sweaters to class near the holidays-SO FUN."
706,1880341,5.0,1.0,He is young and relatable. Knows most of his students won't be accounting majors so he is good at keeping it simple for business students.
707,1880341,5.0,3.0,Great teach
708,1722647,4.5,3.0,Good teacher
709,1722648,4.0,4.0,"Great professor. If you don't take notes, pay attention to lectures, and study you won't pass."
710,1722648,5.0,2.0,Wonderful sense of humor
711,796953,1.0,5.0,I would so drop this class if I could. I just needed a history and chose this randomly I'm REGRETTING it. I knew just from reading the syllabus that this guy sucked. He mentions how he thinks his students are idiots chance he gets. The reading is so hard to understand and his lectures sound like he's rambling and it's hard to take notes. DONT TAKE
712,796953,1.0,5.0,Literally the worst ever! Immediately looked for other classes in the first 15 min. Super boring and rude to students. He knows what he is talking about but does not stop to really explain. Confusing and hard to understand and expects students to know what he is talking about at beginning of class. #stayaway
713,796953,1.0,5.0,"He assigned over 1,100 pages of assigned reading, and yet he never provided more than two PowerPoint slides in any class meeting (lasting 1.15 hours.) He demands greatness from his students but returns almost no effort in return. No updates to blackboard and is a terribly boring lecturer. This professor is stuck in the stone age. DO NOT TAKE."
714,796953,1.0,4.0,"Avoid his classes if you can. He's clearly knows what he's talking about, but he moves quickly through lecture and expects a lot out of his students. Maybe that's a good thing, maybe not, but I like history as a subject and I generally do well with it, but I struggled with his class."
715,796953,1.0,5.0,"This is the worst teacher I have ever had. He definitely knows his stuff but is too arrogant to try to teach anyone who is struggling. I have never felt comfortable to participate. As an A/B student in ALL other classes, this is ridiculous. I chose this class because I was interested in the subject, but I would NEVER recommend this professor."
716,796953,3.0,5.0,"Very Nice man. Make sure if you decide to take his class to pay very close attention to the names of those you discuss, as well as the time period they came from. His class is definitely very difficult."
717,796953,1.0,3.0,"Well after the mid term I had the second highest grade in the class. Professor Field is very smart but he also is quite arrogant and doesn't believe he can be wrong. He falsely accused me of plagiarism, giving me an F on my essay that is 15% of the class grade. He also refused to meet with me to let me explain that I indeed had not plagiarized."
718,796953,1.0,5.0,"Field is a smart man, but his method could use some work. He uses words that an college freshmen would not know. He gives 4 grades the midterm, a paper, participation ( asking questions and coming to class), and the final.  If you just need the course find someone else.  If you are up for the challenge then  go for  it. Take Field."
719,796953,2.0,5.0,"Professor field is a brilliant man. If you are interested in pursuing a degree in history, or if you have a liking for it, do not miss an opportunity to take his class. However, if you are taking it because you are just required to take a history class, you may want to steer away from this. It is a lot of work and requires a lot of time."
720,796953,1.0,5.0,Depressing:( This class is going to bring my GPA way down. I started this semester with a 3.92 and I'm a junior. I currently have an F in this class. Do not take this class unless you have nothing but time on your hands.
721,796953,2.5,5.0,I read these comments before taking the class and assumed I would be alright considering I love history. They're a little misleading. I'm too intimidated to speak in this class because he'll tell you the sky is baby blue if you just say it's blue. If you don't speak in the class you get a &quot;C&quot; for participation. Nice guy. Hard to succeed in class.
722,796953,4.0,5.0,Dont take this class if you havent had both terms of freshman comp unless you know how to construct arguments.  This man is brilliant and helpful if you are willing to jump in to the material.  Staying on the outside will earn you a low grade.  He values participation and rewards by imparting his honey droplets of ubersmart.
723,796953,3.5,3.0,"I really enjoyed Dr. Field's lectures, but I always fell asleep being lulled by the tapping of his shoes, and he is the Platonic Form of peripatetic.  Very helpful outside of class--The Middle Ages would have been more enjoyable if I could have just stayed awake."
724,796953,2.5,5.0,"I have no doubt that this man knows his material.  However, he is a simply terrible teacher.  His lectures are absolutely NOTHING like the textbook and he uses vocabulary that is far too difficult for most college freshmen.  Do your best to get into a different section of this class."
725,796953,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Field knows more than any other man living.  He is THE oracle.  If I could screw up the courage to ask, I know he could tell me the meaning of life.  He has a pure, kind soul and will go to any lengths to help interested students.  You will work hard for him, but will better yourself in the process."
726,796953,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Field is going to be the father of my children.  He could father the master race.  Just kidding.  No, really I was not but I do not want my comment deleted.  Pure genius.  He has so much to offer interested and dedicated students. His class, however, is not for education majors."
727,796953,3.5,4.0,Dr. Field is a man of genius.  His flowing locks combine with the bountiful harvest of knowledge he imparts to his students to create an atmosphere of perfect tranquility.  Dr. Field knows everything.  Dr. Field is tough.  Dr. Field is fair.  Dr. Field is just.  Take him to determine how good of a person you are.
728,446747,4.0,2.0,"I had this prof a few years ago, and I really feel the need to write a review. Her class wasn't even that hard if you actually bothered to do the work and learn the material. You can't just put forth no effort and then call her mean and unhelpful when she holds you accountable. Plus, it's ridiculous how far above everyone else in that dept she was."
729,446747,4.0,3.0,"i took a class a couple of years ago and i did not find her hard, unhelpful, or unclear.  i found there were alot of whinney students who didnt want to do crap and just wanted to coast along"
730,446747,1.0,5.0,No Comments
731,446747,1.5,4.0,"basically, she sucks...shes rude, unhelpful, and doesn't give a crap about the students"
732,446747,1.0,5.0,"Possible the worst professor I have ever had in my 4 years at ole miss so far, she looks forward to making students life a living hell"
733,446747,1.0,5.0,No Comments
734,446747,1.0,4.0,"she sucks! she has a 50% failure rate, the highest in the department, and loves to fail people!!!"
735,2152732,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Forgette was such an amazing professor. I took her class in the hybrid format and there were days when I was the only student to show up to our in-person session and she would work with me one-on-one on my papers and was such a help. If you want to do well in this class and you show that to her this will be a great class for you.
736,2152732,5.0,3.0,She is very nice and very accommodating to students. If you do the work you will pass her class. She does grade tough on papers but have not received bellow a C.
737,2152732,2.0,5.0,"This professor might be a good teacher at a different level or in a traditional class but her grading standard is extreme for a gen ed freshman writing class. I would not recommend this professor compared to other ones, no reason to challenge your self when there are 50 other teachers for this course."
738,2152732,5.0,4.0,"Mrs Forgette is one of the best Writing 101/102 professors out there! She really cares for her students, but she will make you work for your grade. In all my time of knowing her for two semesters I have never seen her frown or show any emotion besides happiness and excitement for learning. Take her! Take her! Take her! You wont regret it."
739,2152732,5.0,3.0,"Outstanding and insightful teacher. Relatively tough class as far as work goes but if you do the assignments you should get a B. For just a writing class, she really makes you think. I would recommend 10/10"
740,2152732,5.0,4.0,She is an outstanding teacher and I would take her for every writing class if I could! She grades fair and is willing to help you through every writing assignment. She loves writing and genuinely cares about her students and their grades.
741,1630493,1.0,4.0,Grades are based off of 4 tests and a final. Test are difficult to understand and you must read the book along with knowing everything he covers in class. 
742,1630493,2.0,4.0,"His tests are very difficult and there are so many versions that they are also very inconsistent. The 4 tests he gives you in class determine your entire grade. The final replaces your lowest grade no matter. You can barely hear him in class even with a microphone. He is a nice guy, but not that great of a professor."
743,1630493,5.0,4.0,Really enjoyed taking Prof. Cousley. He is a class act. Very nice man that tells stories a lot about his family and ties it back into what he is teaching. A very underrated professor on here.
744,1630493,4.0,1.0,"Four tests, didn't have to go to class, and he gave extra credit.... easiest A I had all semester, and since I had an A before finals week, I was exempt from the final! Lectures are so boring so thank goodness he didn't have an attendance policy"
745,1630493,1.0,4.0,"Let me just tell you straight up, DO NOT take Sam Cousley. He gives different tests for each section therefore test difficulty varies per section. It is basically the luck of the draw. Also, marketing constantly evolves and his teaching patterns have not."
746,1630493,3.0,4.0,"Your grade is determined by 4, 100 point tests. Tests are textbook-based and very &quot;example heavy&quot;. His lectures are kind of pointless because they follow the textbook very loosely and are posted on BB. He is very old-school. The final (20 chapters cumulative) replaces your lowest test grade no matter what (even if you do worse on the final."
747,1630493,3.0,3.0,He is very nice and is very knowledgable about marketing. Show up to class and take notes and learn the material. Textbook is personal preference. Tests are a little hard because he gives a lot of notes which makes it hard to study that much material.
748,1630493,1.0,4.0,"Tests are hard. He doesn't offer much help or guidance. Very old school to the point of seeming almost detached from his students entirely. I received a C in the course, as did most everyone else in the course. I think his teaching style needs some adjustment."
749,1630493,3.0,4.0,The tests are tricky.  He's old school but if you work hard it will pay off.
750,1630493,4.0,4.0,Great Teacher! Very helpful
751,581918,4.5,3.0,"He's very clear about notes, and he is so incredibly helpful when you need extra help. This is a great experience for journalism majors. Just make sure to bring a caffeinated beverage, because the course content gets pretty dry sometimes. Loved this guy anyway. =]"
752,581918,4.5,2.0,"I genuinely like Mr. Russell. If you're a looking to pass Jour 102 with a teacher that's very, very upfront about what you need to know to get an A, he is the man. My only possible criticism is his class is part of the problem of allowing Ole Miss journalism majors that don't want to be journalists."
753,581912,1.0,3.0,"Wickham was extremely unorganized and constantly made mistakes that she'd never take the blame for. Her BlackBoard page was all over the place. For example, she'd have the same exact assignment posted in multiple folders with two different due dates. She made a ton of typos in assignment instructions and in emails. Etc. etc."
754,581912,1.0,4.0,"Before I say anything, I would like to state that I am a good student with over a 3.0 GPA. I have never struggled with any class until this one. Please hear me out when I say do not take this class. She is one of the most arrogant teachers at the university and you will hate yourself for taking it. I wish I could write more but seriously, just dont"
755,581912,1.0,3.0,"She is too old to be teaching this course. There was barely any relevant information for how to function ethically as a Journalist today and relies too heavily on her boring powerpoints. I feel that in the full semester class, there were maybe 3 useful lectures. I would never have taken that class with her if there were any other options."
756,581912,2.0,4.0,"I don't mind Dr. Wickham's extreme demands for out of class work, but don't understand how to accomplish objectives she refuses to clarify. I wonder if she knows her extremely subjective grading was a discussed heavily in my school's recent accreditation review. Still, I like her personally."
757,1071392,5.0,3.0,Dr. Barlow is a world-changer!  She is tough but makes the material enjoyable.
758,1071392,4.5,4.0,Absolutely fantastic math education professor.  Highly recommended.
759,796960,1.0,5.0,So I took this class because I had to have an art elective for my biology degree. (makes sense) anyway take anything other than this art history class. I was barely able to keep my 4.0 that I had by going to his office and telling him his key was wrong. Many questions were keyed wrong. Can't imagine how many peoples grades were incorrect.  avoid!!
760,796960,3.5,4.0,"Very nice guy, but the tests were ridiculous. They consisted of TONS of slides (which you were to memorize the (Era, Artist, and Work) and there were three of them, i think. The format was strictly slide memorization, and he would always put questions on the test that he did not even attempt to address in the lectures. I was very dissatisfied."
761,796960,1.0,4.0,I never received a syllabus. He assigned 5 books for the semester and never once gave us a reading assignment or told us what we should be reading. His lectures were barely comprehensible. He would send new information the night before a test. He is the most disorganized professor I've ever had.
762,796960,3.5,1.0,"He's a pretty nice guy. There IS an attendance policy now, but it isn't horrible strict. As long as you do the homework(Test questions come directly from homework) and come to class almost everyday, you should at least be able to get a B without any problems."
763,796960,4.5,1.0,He's extremely easy.  He's the nicest man on campus.  It's boring.  There's a fake attendance policy.
764,2693404,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Y is by far my favorite professor at UM. He is super enthusiastic about his material and is always willing to talk to you if you need help or don't understand. He teaches you what you need to know for the tests. Assignment sheets and labs can be demanding and require some &quot;out of the box&quot; thinking, but ultimately will prepare you very well."
765,315684,3.5,2.0,"Absolutely brilliant man. His only issue teaching is that he expects you to understand fundamental economics. Assuming you do, you will learn A LOT from his class. Your best bet is to remember the questions you have and talk to him one-on-one, which he is very open to doing."
766,315684,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I've ever had. Incredibly boring and not clear at all. Will just ramble on and on about things he somehow expects you to know. If you don't like political science, don't take the class. Never really understood the purpose of the lectures, I think he just likes to hear himself talk."
767,315684,1.5,3.0,do not expect help or support or fairness
768,315684,2.0,5.0,Was a very boring class

771,1962280,5.0,1.0,"Pretty easy class and easy to pay attention to, but that may be just because he is really hot lol. He makes the material fun and interesting too. "
772,1962280,5.0,2.0,"Fulwiler is by far the most incredible professor I have had in my two years at Ole Miss (not just because he happens to be extremely hot). He is kind, funny, entertaining, and definitely cares about his students. He made class fun and educational, without failing every student. Wish I could take his class again-most definitely recommend!! "
773,2455851,5.0,3.0,He was super easy and test questions came directly from lecture notes. His lectures werent as boring as others.
774,2455851,1.0,5.0,"The most nit picky and absurdly harsh grading professor Ive ever had. Dont take this, save yourself."
775,1964332,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor. Really helps you understand the material. Gives lots of opportunity for hands on learning in the clinic. Class does require some out of class assignments. She is always there to help.
776,1534270,5.0,2.0,"This is a requirement for the lower division liberal arts rec, and it is a good way to nab it.  He cares about what he teaches, and the plays that are taught are contemporary.  You can also pass all the quizzes with careful study of sparknotes :D.  Great teacher, and you are able to talk about cool contemporary stuff in class. Awesome."
777,129349,5.0,4.0,"I took Winkel's Judicial Behavior class 20 years ago. I now have three undergraduate degrees from NYU, Univ of Miami, and Ole Miss.  In a career, there are few professors who are remembered.  If you have the chance, take his class and listen well."
778,129349,5.0,4.0,"After attending The University of Mississippi for my undergraduate degree and a top international university for a graduate degree I can say with absolute conviction that Dr. Winkle is the best teacher I have ever had, hands down. He's brilliant, engaging and he deeply cares about his students. He will go out of his way to help you in any way that he can and constantly sacrifices to make sure that every student is given the attention they need. His classes aren't easy but if you work with him and let him know when you need extra help or are lost with a specific question you will absolutely be successful. Dr. Winkle is an inspiration and I credit my college success to his mentorship and guidance. "
779,129349,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Winkle is amazing! He's willing to help any way he can and he genuinely cares about his students! The essays can be difficult if writing is not your strong point, but he's there to help you through them. Make sure you do the reading and definitely take part in the class discussions!"
780,129349,5.0,5.0,"This was the first political science class I'd ever had; I am a history major.  I came out with an A, but I was one of very few. He's an amazing professor and I learned an unbelievable amount in his class, but it took a LOT of studying."
781,129349,5.0,5.0,"If you think you want to go to law school take him. It's hard, tons of reading maybe a couple hours a night, but that's what you're getting into with law school right&#63; His lectures are amazing and he's just an all around great guy that if you're interested in Law, you'll love him. Do not take 306/7 as an elective."
782,129349,5.0,4.0,"He's incredibly smart and a wonderful professor.  The only downside is the tests, which are pretty hard.  But you learn a lot in this class, and he's very helpful and patient.  A great professor."
783,129349,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Winkle is an absolute Political genius!! If you've ever been interested in Law, this is the undergrad class to take!!! He has been by far the most influetial professor i've ever had at the University."
784,129349,4.0,3.0,"Not an easy class, but not hard.  However, for those going into politics, Winkle is a great man to know.  make friends with him, and you will do fine in the class.  pretty much impossible to get below a c, but also very difficult to get an A."
785,129349,5.0,5.0,Best prof at Ole Miss. HARD class but you will learn SO much!!!
786,129349,5.0,4.0,"Tough but brilliant, and interesting.   Learn a lot from him."
787,129358,4.0,3.0,Liked the class she was a little strict about everything
788,129358,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Buchanan is a great teacher! She's really excellent with extra help, and if you're genuinely interested in the class, she will make it fun for you."
789,129358,5.0,3.0,"Do your work and come to class, which is required no matter which professor you take.  She is great!"
790,129358,4.5,5.0,"This class is difficult, but rewarding. She speaks almost exclusively in Spanish, which allows for a quick refreshing of the language. I found her friendly, perhaps a little strict, but professional."
791,129358,2.5,3.0,I took three years of Spanish in High School (all the other freshmen took four) and made a B in this class with a decent amount of outside work. She is all business so don't expect friendliness.
792,129358,4.0,1.0,"As long as you come to class on time she's really nice.  The tests are a variation of the homework, some questions have even been the same as the ones on homework.   It's a super easy class (if you pay attention), and she's really a nice lady."
793,129358,1.5,4.0,Very difficult.  I had no idea what was going on in the class half the time. hard grader.
794,129358,1.0,5.0,Definitely not a people person.
795,2296145,1.0,5.0,Very disrespectful to me in her class.  Shes rude to other students as well.
796,2296145,4.0,1.0,I did not like her at first but grew to love her. As long as you are not acting crazy and doing your work lulu are fine. She won't care about you if you don't care about the class. As long as u show interest and participate you are good
797,2296145,1.0,5.0,Awful teacher dont take
798,2296145,1.0,1.0,Super rude and does not care about students at all
799,2017620,4.5,1.0,"Course had a moderate workload, but grading was lenient. Very helpful instructor. Textbook is tough to get through, but useful. "
800,1624408,5.0,3.0,"He gets very excited when talking about religion.  He is very willing to help explain topics if you visit his office hours.  Relies pretty heavily on the textbook for weekly quizzes, but they are open book."
801,2486622,2.0,4.0,gives extremely vague answers to questions about material that was not explained thoroughly enough in the first place
802,1431903,3.0,1.0,"She is a good professor, but the issue is that the class does not talk much or enough about intersectionality and mostly just focuses on feminism. Female empowerment is awesome, but others need it too."
803,1431903,5.0,3.0,I love Dr. Dellinger's class!  She is one of the best teachers that I've had at Ole Miss.
804,1980769,1.0,4.0,"Do not take him. His handwriting is terrible, goes extremely fast, and does not follow the book. If you take this guy you will have to learn everything on your own."
805,1980769,4.5,4.0,Great professor
806,1980769,3.5,3.0,Economics is a tough course in general. He does a good job on the Power Points and you only have three exams the whole semester including the final. I would definitely take him again.
807,2435426,5.0,2.0,Professor Tonos is AWESOME! So passionate about IMC and treats you like a real journalist. Loved his class and would for sure take again.
808,2486629,4.0,3.0,solid teacher for Chem 105
809,2486629,3.0,4.0,Wonderful professor and very helpful. 
810,2486629,5.0,4.0,"Clear and organized lectures. Tough class, but she does a great job explaining the difficult material."
811,2486629,5.0,4.0,"I took her for both CHEM 101 & 105 and i loved her, she explains things in way that are easy to remember and does a lot of examples to make sure you have an idea of how to do it."
812,2486629,5.0,4.0,"Organic chemistry is a very hard class, you just have to at least read over the chapter you are on every day and practice the problems in the textbook. This is the only class where I have actually used the textbook. SI is very helpful, but do not go to learn, go to practice. Overall, Dr. Rowland is an amazing teacher that makes this class easier."
813,2486629,5.0,4.0,If you can take Dr. Rowland do it! She is an amazing professor who is fair and explains things very very well. This is a super hard class and she definitely made it worth while. She tries to get to know her students and is always there if you have any questions. Love her!
814,2486629,4.0,4.0,Decent teacher. Going to class and studying (and going to SI sessions) is how you'll pass and do well. I didn't do well cause I barely studied haha.
815,2486629,5.0,4.0,"She was awesome! Her attitude is great, and she really tries to make you understand the material even though it can be difficult."
816,2486629,4.0,3.0,Dr. Rowland was my favorite professor. She is easy to get in touch with &amp; is very helpful if you ask! She gives a lot of opportunities for bonus if you show up to class. The tests can be difficult but she is a good teacher!
817,2486629,5.0,4.0,"A very good teacher!!! The subject material gets difficult at times but she really makes the effort to help you understand if you ask questions - gives bonus points - in class, tells you what may or may not be on the test - gives lots of practice problems"
818,1849706,4.5,3.0,"She's a great professor! I had a different professor for ACCY201, and it was very hard.  Ms. Brenda made ACCY202 so much easier.  She's always willing to help and explain when you don't get understand something."
819,1849706,5.0,2.0,"Very clear and easy to understand. Just come to class, do the homework, and study a little and there is no doubt you can make an A. Take Mcvey!!"
820,1849707,2.5,5.0,"Very nice teacher but really hard class. The lectures and material are confusing and so are the tests.  But he will do a big curve so even though the class average is always really low, the whole class doesn't fail."
821,620908,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Wirth is the most brilliant and even-tempered professor I have ever taken. Disregard the negative reviews about his lectures; his insights are interesting and highly-relevant to thoughtful discussions. And although he assigns 7 books for the semester, it's a literature course, for heaven's sake! Put forth effort and you will learn and succeed."
822,620908,3.0,5.0,"His lectures are pointless according to the class. You have to read the books to pass, and you're assigned to 100 pages to read a night. GO TO SECTION. Quzzies weekly. He's very smart and memorizes the books word for word. I really wouldn't suggest it if you hate to read."
823,620908,2.0,3.0,Go to your discussion class and do all the readings. There are only 2 tests so study up. Tests are all short answer so you have no idea what to expect. His lectures are boring
824,620908,1.0,5.0,Easily the worst class I have ever taken.
825,620908,5.0,3.0,No Comments
826,620908,2.5,4.0,"His class is hard, but he is a very smart man.  However, his lectures were the most useless piece of crap ever given to a class.  I learned more in the separate section class with the TA than I did in Dr. Wirth's lectures."
827,620908,3.0,5.0,Very hard class.  Very smart man.
828,1343873,5.0,3.0,Mr. Boran is an amazing teacher!! He is very organized and clear in his directions. He is very responsive on email and is always willing to help. The amount of work is reasonable and can be done while working part time or with taking other classes. He lets you choose a topic based on your major which is awesome! Highly recommend. 
829,1343873,4.0,3.0,"He is always willing to answer any question, extremely helpful. He understands we have other exams so if you email him, he is able to extend your deadline. Really nice guy, however, he grades pretty hard so be aware of that."
830,1343873,5.0,1.0,Best teacher ive ever had. I took his online class. Cares about your grade and will help you as much as he possibly can.
831,1343873,4.0,4.0,"Took this class online, wasn't too tough as long as you turn everything in on time and keep up with deadlines!"
832,1343873,5.0,3.0,Very nice and out reaching. Gives nice feedback its positive and constructive. The class is hard to get behind in but no more than another class.
833,1343873,4.5,2.0,"no tests, just four projects that aren't very hard.  you read one book throughout the semester (A Whole New Mind - Daniel Pink) and it's interesting.  group discussion everyday."
834,2439561,5.0,4.0,"I have loved taking Latin even with it being hard to learn. Magistra gives lots of feedback and really cares about our performance, if you make less than an 85 on a quiz shell reach out to offer office hours and she just had the whole class retake a test. She reminds me a lot of a traditional teacher from when I was young, very familiar."
835,2439561,1.0,5.0,Knows the material and expects you to know it as well as she does. Her passion gets in the way of her effectiveness. Homework load is completely unreasonable (2-3 hrs. per class). She treats an intro course as if were a senior seminar class in your major. You absolutely can't miss a class without incurring her ire.. 
836,2439561,5.0,3.0,Fantastic teacher! Very passionate about the subject and is always willing to help. students if they don't understand the material. Homework every night and she grades it almost every single day. Tests aren't too bad considering she gives you a practice test before hand. You definitely have to show up and study since its a language course.
837,1274250,5.0,5.0,.
838,2019723,5.0,2.0,Loved her.
839,2019723,3.0,1.0,After going to class the first few days I soon realized I would not be showing up after that. She did not teach like at all. Every day we had a new person come talk to ur class which got old fast. She is super easy and I got an A for missing over 10 days of class but if you want a teacher who you actually lean from don't take her
840,2019720,1.0,5.0,She is not helpful at all.
841,2019720,3.0,3.0,"If you show up to class, participate and do the homework you'll do fine in her class."
842,2019720,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE HER!!!! She is literally the worst teacher I have ever had. If you miss more than 4 times for anything your grade drops a letter. She rambles on during her lectures and nothing about it will be what you have to write about. It is absolutely pointless. Not to mention she failed me on my final and didn't reply to my email asking why!
843,1735058,3.0,4.0,"She thinks she's funny, but she's not. She took TWO months to grade one exam! I didn't know my grade going into the final and I barely made an A. There were no clear grading guidelines for the research proposal, and the narrated presentation was graded by peers instead of her. Get ready to read because test questions come straight from the book."
844,1735058,2.0,5.0,She had a great sense of humor
845,1735058,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Scott is a very intelligent and good proffessor. If you are interested in Chemistry, take her. If not, take Wiginton. She teaches the material well and if you show up to class it shouldnt be too hard to obtain an A or B."
846,1735058,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Scott means business. Very good professor and also very busy. She is also very helpful (i.e. she schedules help sessions through the semester.) A bit confusing at times, but she will try her best to explain things via e mail or in her office hours. I would suggest taking her course."
847,1735058,4.5,5.0,"Loved this teacher, she tries so hard to make sure you get as much help as possible!"
848,1735058,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Scott goes well beyond her role as a professor.  She bends over backwards to make sure you understand the material.  She even hosts her own help session on Thursdays just for Q&A.  She is passionate about the material and doesn't cut breaks on tests, but she's fair. Does everything in her power to make sure you are as successful as possible"
849,1735058,1.0,5.0,"This might be the worst teacher I have ever had. You can't understand her, terrible attitude, and if you need help she refers you to the TA's. She uses Mychemistry for hw, and has made clear that she makes the homework too hard on purpose. I have A's in all other classes, but her's I have a C because of the hw. You WILL REGRET taking this women."
850,1735058,2.0,4.0,Terrible! I never knew what she was talking about or where she was going. She jumps from one subject to the next and totally looses me and my friends. We all bombed her test!
851,1229206,1.0,3.0,Lucy Leslie is rude and incredibly hard to learn from. she lectures for the sole purpose of hearing herself speak and to tell unrelated stories. she berated a student for leaving class early when his car was being towed and when one student asked for an extension she yelled at him about responsibility in front of the class. DONT TAKE HER CLASS
852,1229206,2.0,3.0,"Lucy Leslie is not a &quot;terrible&quot; teacher per say, she just LOVES the sound of her own voice. She talks the entire class time in a monotone voice which can become very annoying and boring after while. Her sarcasm level is on a new spectrum, but is hilarious at times."
853,1229206,2.0,2.0,"She spent the first week of school assigning seats and the class didn't learn anything. She is somewhat sassy and is snippy about phone usage, but delivers a very precise lecture that covers most of the stuff in the textbook. She gives a little bit of extra credit. Is actually more approachable than she seems."
854,1229206,3.0,4.0,shes hard around the edges but she is also a sweet lady
855,1229206,4.0,3.0,"Lucy Leslie is an interesting character. Shes definitely very egotistical, and can come off as someone you wouldnt like. However, she is very willing to work with students and is a very good professor. You might not like her, but she is a great professor."
856,1229206,5.0,3.0,"awesome teacher, really makes you want to learn, review is just like test, not much outside homework, go to class and youll be fine, lots of extra credit"
857,1229206,4.0,2.0,Great Teacher. Come to class and you'll be fine. Very understanding and kinda Quirky.
858,1229206,4.5,2.0,Do the work and use the study guide and you'll get an A. Go to class because it helps with your grade.
859,1229210,1.0,3.0,This professor was not at all helpful throughout the entirety of the course. Required ridiculous amounts of reading scientific papers without any good discussion points to make to the class. A real shame of a teacher.
860,1229210,2.0,3.0,The exam was not straight forward and random at times. There is pop quiz through out class. You are on your own in this class dont expect much input from the teacher. It is all power point
861,1229210,2.5,2.0,Goes through a powerpoint all class. Class is useless. Study the book and get an A.
862,2720159,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Irwin is by far my favorite teacher I have taken so far here. She gives amazing feedback on the two papers we had to do, like 2 paragraphs explaining what you did wrong so you wont make the same mistakes. She gives amazing lectures, and is really easy to talk too. Although, it is a lot of reading but it is an english class. Take Mrs. Irwin!!"
863,2021795,4.0,3.0,"Probably my second best Spanish prof I've had at Ole Miss. She gives nightly homework and a good bit of compositions but this gives you many chances to keep your grade up. Gives extra credit opportunities, explains things in English if needed, prefers if you speak only Spanish in the class, attendance is crucial, tests tend to be mildly difficult."
864,2021795,5.0,1.0,one of the best Spanish professor at Ole Miss highly recommend you take her class that's if you can get in her class usually fills up within the first day of registration.
865,2021795,5.0,3.0,She's a great professor and genuinely cares about her students. The quia workbook is a pain!
866,2021795,5.0,1.0,"In this particular class, Dr. Allen gave an assignment that I will be using in my own classroom soon!"
867,2021795,5.0,1.0,Dr. Allen is one of the most amazing professors and people at Ole Miss!!!
868,2021795,3.0,3.0,Great teacher. 
869,260515,5.0,4.0,overall great teacher
870,260515,3.5,3.0,"This class is very helpful and you will use a lot of things you learn in this class for the rest of your life. Dr. Littlejohn is pretty nice but as people have said before, she nitpicks to the extreme and is not afraid to make you look foolish in front of the whole class. Also, her tests include many multiple choice questions that are ambiguous."
871,260515,5.0,4.0,You'll really use the things she teaches you
872,260515,4.5,2.0,"This class is an obnoxious and pointless req. to fill before graduation, so despite the fact that she tries to be buddy buddy with students, be warned that this will still be a pain to show up for (she has a strict attendance policy).  VERY much in agreement about nitpicking - this is her life but she's the easiest drone teaching this class"
873,260515,4.0,4.0,No Comments
874,260515,4.5,3.0,"she's so helpful; she'll teach you so much.  however, be forewarned, she nitpicks."
875,2376101,5.0,2.0,Love her! Very straight forward and caring about her subject.
876,557478,4.0,4.0,Dr. Wilson uses the interteaching method in his class. It's a very nontraditional lecture. He is very knowledgeable and always willing to help students. The book is cheep but necessary. You do have to work with a partner and have homework everyday.
877,557478,1.0,1.0,He can be really arrogant and doesn't lecture so much as he does ramble for the entire class
878,557478,1.0,1.0,Man I love group projects! -said no one ever
879,557478,1.0,4.0,He's all over the place in lectures and hardly ever makes sense.
880,557478,1.0,5.0,He goes off on long tangents that don't make sense and is hard to listen to for 1hr 15min.
881,557478,5.0,2.0,He is a great professor. You won't be sorry you took him.
882,557478,5.0,3.0,he will explain anything you need and is very passionate about what he does
883,557480,1.0,4.0,"Definitely a difficult class for undergraduates. Tons of pop quizzes, and a difficult grader. I would not ever recommend this class."
884,557480,1.0,5.0,"Lectures are quite meaningless and perfectly useless for the exams; nevertheless, she collects and grades notes. Grading papers and exams seems way too harsh for an undergraduate class. Avoid at all cost."
885,557480,3.5,5.0,It was much harder than a 300 lev. class should be. More like a 500 lev. class. She was interesting to listen to but she needs to be more lenient with her grading. Most of the people in my class were taking it as an elective. I don't recommend if you want to come out with an A or B. I know about 4 people she failed half way through the semester
886,557480,4.0,5.0,"Class is difficult, but she will help you if you ask for it.  She grades hard."
887,557480,5.0,4.0,TA is sooooooooo fine love it
888,557480,5.0,3.0,This teacher was really great. She is highly intelligent and knows her stuff. The TA is great too- get a guy named Phillip if you can. I learned a lot of literary terms and how to think analytically in her class. Truly college level :)
889,557480,5.0,4.0,"this woman is an unbelievable teacher. i learned so much from her that it helped me get better grades in any class. if you can, take her. it's worth it."
890,557480,5.0,4.0,A wonderful teacher. She was the nicest teacher I have ever taken a course from. I wish I could have taken more classes from her. She is a facinating person and extremely pleasant and thoughtful.
891,2425257,2.0,4.0,"Not great, kinda nice so not too awful but not a good teacher. All her assignments/instructions are so vague and confusing and when you ask questions shes super judgy and acts like were stupid for not understanding her vagueness. Hated the class, just took it cause I had to. Not super hard but she makes it way more unnecessary then it needs to be"
892,2425257,1.0,5.0,The in person class is horrible. Essay guidelines make no sense. Shes super sweet but the class and how she teaches it is so confusing.
893,2425257,2.0,4.0,super vague and unclear. rubrics are confusing. makes you feel bad about asking questions. just the worst.
894,2085288,5.0,1.0,"The easiest class I've taken.  His test are multiple choice,true false, and some listenings.  He makes the test to where the student will pass the course.  He says everyone should pass his class with an ""A""."
895,2394537,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Hitch is a great teacher always willing to help! Don't be afraid to ask questions. She will always want to help during and or after class. Will help you with your papers even for her class and others!
896,2085289,2.0,4.0,Tests are much harder than his lectures would make them seem. A lot of what is on the test isn't talked about in class and must be self taught through homework and reading the textbook.
897,1892781,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Brady is an amazing professor. She is the best professor I've had at Ole Miss. She is so caring and encouraging. She is not a hard grader, and she is passionate about the material. The syllabus looked scary at first because she had so many books and so many assignments, but it was honestly the best class I've ever taken."
898,1892781,3.0,4.0,"Her quizzes are basically two lines from a reading and if you don't know it you're screwed. Great lectures, horrible quizzer. Never answered a single email I sent."
899,1892781,5.0,4.0,"Comes off as scary, but underneath, she's a caring and nice professor. She is passionate about the material, and if you show even mild interest, she will help you if you ask. I learned a lot of stuff -- most of which I won't use again -- but I did learn."
900,1892781,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Brady comes across harsh and Professor Umbridge-esque, but underneath it all, she is a caring and inspirational professor. She loves her content area. Her lectures are clear and direct, and the tests aren't bad if you actually read. "
901,1892781,1.0,5.0,Dr. Brady is honestly the worse teacher on this campus. She is not truthful nor helpful. She will change her mind in a heartbeat and completely make students hate their decision in going to school at Ole Miss. She has made me completely regret my choice and makes me feel like she doesn't want to deal with me. Honestly she hurt my feelings.
902,557486,5.0,4.0,"I dont understand why Dr. Mendolia is getting such bad reviews. Although her subject is difficult, shes always willing to help students as long as they put in the effort to do well in the class. Shes very patient and kind."
903,557486,2.0,5.0,Tests are very hard and she is difficult to get in contact with as an online student. The extra credit is the easiest way to secure an A despite the other issues with her class. Just take someone else.
904,557486,1.0,4.0,While she does give a fair amount of extra credit it feels as if she's trying to prove that the subject is difficult more than she is trying to teach it. Lectures are hard to listen to because she's incredibly monotone. The tests are wordy and difficult. There is no feedback. The only help other than lectures is youtube and useless concept maps.
905,557486,2.0,4.0,PSY 392: This class was extremely difficult and I really wish I would have known about her before I took this class. There are other professors that teach labs that I would recommend over her! She isnt the most helpful and her test are the most difficult tests I've taken in my three and a half years at Ole Miss.
906,557486,4.0,3.0,"People complain a lot about her, but honestly she gives so many bonus points and and opportunities to succeed (plus light grading) the only excuse for doing poorly is not trying. I came out with an A for what feels like very little actual work."
907,557486,3.0,4.0,"She uses a point system and didn't grade super hard so you can get a decent grade if you go to class and work for it. However, we needed  blue books for 300 level psych tests... need I say more?"
908,557486,1.0,4.0,She's not helpful at all and the tests are impossibly hard even though the material isn't
909,557486,1.0,5.0,overall worst n least helpful teacher ive ever had
910,557486,2.0,5.0,Lectures are long and boring and she's very demanding. Tests are impossibly hard. She's also not very helpful if you need help.
911,557486,4.5,1.0,"She is def concerned with experiment consistency and had a few odd rules but she really does care about her students and social psychology. You won't regret learning from her, and lab is pretty simple once u learn the script."
912,557486,2.5,3.0,Dayuuuuum!
913,557486,1.0,5.0,Social... very anal and weird.  Do not take her if you want a a decent grade in this class.
914,557486,3.0,5.0,No Comments
915,2376111,4.0,2.0,"She was very kind and very passionate about the subject. I could see it being difficult for students with no prior experience with music, but she was always very willing to help anyone that asked. Lots of opportunity for extra credit! Pay attention in class and study for tests and it's an easy A."
916,2376111,1.0,5.0,She was very condescending and never truly clear. Class was boring and I never felt like I was benefiting from what she was teaching. Grades extremely hard.
917,2836907,1.0,5.0,"She is disorganized and makes comments about how much she dislikes the ""younger generation"". Gets irritated when students get up to use the restroom, move around etc. Extremely lecture heavy and rarely helpful with assignments. Counts students absent if she feels they weren't participating and will not respond to emails even if you're persistent. "
918,1943986,5.0,1.0,She makes you actually work for your grade but is supper helpful and makes times for her students. 
919,1943986,4.0,3.0,"Really wants you to do well, but won't just give it to you."
920,2836915,5.0,2.0,GOAT.
921,2836915,5.0,2.0,"My favorite teacher I have had. He is eager to answer any questions you may have, and makes himself available outside of office hours. He genuinely cares about how you are doing in the class and how he can help you improve your writing. Gives useful feedback and is flexible with deadlines if necessary. I would take him every year if I could. "
922,1196477,5.0,3.0,10/10 recommend taking her for Spanish! She is super nice and understands that learning a foreign language is hard. Every time I have been confused she has helped me understand whats going on.
923,1196477,4.0,3.0,"great teacher, understands that it is hard to learn a foreign launguage, loves to have fun in class, but also serious about learning. easy to talk to and ask for help and willing to work with you if you need it"
924,1196477,5.0,3.0,"BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES - overall not a bad professor at all, make sure to do homework and put in the effort instead of using google translate and you should be fine - also gives a participation grade so you can't be afraid to talk - goes straight from the book every single day"
925,1196477,4.5,2.0,Very nice and quiet. Participation is mandatory and follows the book exactly in class.
926,1196477,4.0,2.0,"Nice lady, very quiet.  If you have problems, she is very helpful and tries to help the best she can"
927,1196477,3.0,2.0,No Comments
928,1302978,5.0,3.0,Hands down best professor Ive had in college. Every professor should be like this.
929,1302978,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor! No homework, just tests. He really makes the material interesting, highly recommend"
930,1302978,5.0,2.0,Goofy and down to earth. Real smart and doesn't peddle bull.
931,1302978,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor I have taken. Even thought his lectures are not mandatory and he doesn't take attendance, i found that it was the only class i was showing up for everyday because the lectures were fascinating. He's a relatable guy who isn't going to screw you over. My one complaint is he isn't really ever there for office hours."
932,1302978,5.0,1.0,"One of my favorite psych professors hands down. He's so funny and makes the course interesting. Attendance is not mandatory, but I would go on fridays because he will most likely give extra credit for just showing up."
933,1302978,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gustafson does not only teach psychology. He teaches world domination. By the end of this class, you will have a fully formed plan to make the entire world your slave army. He is neither good or evil, or else he would have overthrown the government by now. Instead he prefers to neutrally watch others as they either save or destroy the earth."
934,1302978,5.0,3.0,Dr. G is an excellent lecturer and always answers students questions. There is no attendance policy in his class but he does give extra credit pop quizzes occasionally.
935,1302978,5.0,3.0,"I changed my major to Psychology and this was the first class I took after doing so. I'm so glad I had Dr. Gustafson because he really cares about the class, is very personable, and made the material interesting. I wish he was teaching another class I needed because I would take him as many times as possible."
936,1302978,5.0,3.0,"this guy knows his psychology, but he's funny and relatable as a human as well. Make sure to read the book. He likes to use it for test questions, but he's great at explaining and simplifying material during lecture hours.  If you're taking any psych courses and have an option between professors and Gustafson is one of those options, take him!"
937,1302978,5.0,4.0,"Honestly, he's a great teacher. If you get easily offended don't take him because he doesn't have a filter, but I loved him and will take another one of his classes again. He gives extra credit on Fridays since no one ever comes to class. Just show up, listen and you'll do fine. Also, BUY THE BOOK. You will need it."
938,1302978,2.5,3.0,Seems like he cares more about being funny than actually teaching at times. Isn't the most helpful when you're lost either
939,1302978,4.0,3.0,He's a great professor and makes even the dull stuff interesting!
940,1302978,4.0,2.0,"Its pretty clear that Dr G is an avid larper, who spends much of his time prancing around the grove. Also he may or may not be a member of the Mississippi Brony fan club.  He even had the audacity to get a doffus looking hair cut the day of finals.   Dr G is hands down my favorite professor at OM. Take every class of his that you can!  Great guy!"
941,1302978,4.0,4.0,"i learned more in his class than in any other class I've taken so far. You definitely can't get away with not reading, but he is hilarious and his lectures are interesting."
942,1302978,4.5,3.0,"To say Dr. Gustafason is a professor would be an understatement.  He is a samurai of psychology.  If he were trained in karate he would be Bruce Lee.  If he were a prop comedian he would be of the ranks of carrot top.  This man could have been president of the US, but for the betterment of society he chose psychology and for that we thank you."
943,1302978,5.0,3.0,"Dr. G missed a week of class one time. Not many people knew that this week of his was spent coaching the Olympic tetherball team overseas in the great country of Lithuania. Though only receiving bronze in the end, his effort in and out of the classroom received gold in my heart <3<3<3<3<3<3<3"
944,1302978,4.0,3.0,"One day, Gustafson had a booger hanging out of his nose.. I couldn't even look at him while he lectured so I just let my eyes wander while I listened. Other than that one boogie, he's a pretty cool dude."
945,1302978,5.0,1.0,"On Fridays he has a ""quiz"". Asks bizarre questions. As long as you put your name on the top of the paper you get an extra 5points. One time he told the class (on a Friday) if you're just here because you want to take the extra credit quiz, go ahead and leave because we're not having one today... 75% of the class walked out and we took the quiz :-)"
946,1302978,5.0,4.0,I LOVE Dr. G!!! He is hilarious and can make any topic of psychology interesting!
947,1302978,4.5,3.0,"really great class, extremely interesting, and very nice professor. the tests are definitely difficult and require a lot of studying."
948,1302978,4.5,4.0,"Great guy who is really intelligent. He makes class interesting and fun to attend. He gives bonus quizzes to help people out when there are only a few people in class. At first he can come across pretentious, but is actually very nice."
949,1302978,5.0,3.0,"great teacher, makes it interesting and understandable and puts notes on blackboard! never takes role but does give extra points on occasion when not many people show up.."
950,2587077,1.0,5.0,It is hard to understand her and she overcomplicates all of the problems during the lecture. She does a test review 18 hours before the test is scheduled so if you have trouble on problems on the review you do not have adequate time to study for the test.
951,2587077,2.0,4.0,"This was a very difficult class, and what we do in class really has nothing to do with the homework or tests. So, you're really left teaching yourself. Luckily, I took AP Physics in high school so I had a bit of a background. I do have to take Dr.Gupta for PHYS 212 because she is the only professor teaching it. "
952,2587077,1.0,4.0,LOTS of homework!! Due every thurs/fri on top of Lab work and continues homework due on TEST DAYS!! Kind of hard to understand because she moves quickly and writing is hard to read!! Tests are hard so you better know your stuff and better know how to explain every little detail you did in your work!!!! DO NOT Reccommend!!!
953,2587077,1.0,5.0,"The only reason I passed this class was because of my intro to Physics in high school... if you have no Physics background, this class will be extremely difficult. Lectures are all over the place, professor moves very quickly, doesn't explain well at all. Not even worth asking questions or office hours because they will just make you more confused."
954,2587077,1.0,5.0,"I've taken a physics class before, and this one was just all over the place. Tests are extremely hard, first test was 8 questions and I got a 62 and studied for at least 8-10 hours. Would not recommend"
955,2181574,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, made French enjoyable to learn. She's still a grad student so I'm not sure if she'll be teaching this class again, but I'd definitely recommend taking her class. Her tests aren't too hard and she's good at teaching the material."
956,2818503,1.0,5.0,"Beware of a writing class with no name when selecting classes, it might be her. RUDEE. Does not believe in getting an A on your essay No matter how you put in. She is no help, her solution is to go to the writing center  SHE IS OUR TEACHER. She has a phobia of electronics, dont use them. Only reason im passing is because of rhetlab she doesnt grade"
957,2253256,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this man for physics. He is the absolute worst. I had him for both sems of physics and he found a way to make the second semester harder. Goes so fast in lecture, and his handwriting is horrible. For our final, he gave a test for the first 50 mins of ""new material"", gave us a 10 min break then gave us a cumulative final. DO! NOT! TAKE!"
958,2253256,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Quackenbush was a good professor.  His lectures sometimes rambled and were slow to move along, but mostly he was trying to make sure we all got it.  I thought he did a good job.  He didn't joke much but when he did I thought it was funny, he should do that more."
959,2077130,2.0,2.0,"The class kind of sucks. I took this class because I had to have a fine art, but I actually really love theatre. It was awful! The only good thing was that we only meet once a week. The rest of the class was done online through blackboard. I don't think  she really know how to use it. Overall it was really easy, but I would not take her again."
960,2146765,1.0,5.0,protect your mental health
961,2146765,1.0,4.0,If you do one wrong thing in this class she will hold a grudge and make you feel dumb and embarrass you in front of others. She is so passive-aggressive and if you ask a question she will make you feel dumb and she will talk down on you. And if you need help if your essay she will say its on blackboard or to just go to the writing center.
962,2146765,1.0,4.0,"Emily Cooley is not a good teacher, especially when it comes to do our essays. She gives an essay to write every single week.  She yells at the student and cuts them off when they try to talk. I would not recommend taking her. "
963,2146765,1.0,5.0,If you do one wrong thing in this class she will hold a grudge and make you feel dumb and embarrass you in front of others. She will make you cry and gives loads and loads of homework that is so unnecessary. You have a new essay due every single week yet when you ask for help all she says is to go to the writing center. AVOID THIS TEACHER.
964,2146765,3.0,3.0,"So nice and caring and wants you to succeed, but also TONS of busy work. There are these weird module things she requires that are so aggravating and not helpful but will boost your grade as long as you do them. A few papers based on how good it is, but multiple little assignments graded based solely on if you do it or not. Loves to meet outside."
965,2146765,1.0,4.0,This class is worse then any class I have ever taken. The subject of this course intrigued me and I wish I would have never signed up. She assigns peer editing that takes just as much time as the actual essay and is a horrible teacher. Has no heart and broke me down as a writer and made me feel like an idiot at least once a class. NEVER TAKE COOLEY
966,2146765,1.0,4.0,"This class is awful. Do NOT take her if you want an easy class, actually just dont take her at all. She gives at least 2 hours of homework every night and it is busy work. She is very passive aggressive and is not compassionate about anything. She talks down upon her students and does little to help. It takes a while to get grades back."
967,2146765,1.0,5.0,"When taking this class, you rarely get grades back in a timely manner. There is a lot of homework that is uncalled for and could be done without. She also never gives input, often says, &quot; just go to the writing center,&quot; and doesn't help when you have questions, often making you more confused than you were before. No sympathy whatsoever."
968,2146765,1.0,4.0,Don't take her. She overloads work and takes forever to give back grades. Didn't have any idea what my grade might be until final grades were posted. Hard to talk to. There is an attendance policy and if you don't come to class you won't pass.
969,2146765,1.0,4.0,Horrible teacher. Don't take this class period. You will hate your life. She gives more busywork than you had in all prior years of school combined and its not optional to do. She also requires peer reviews on papers which is good but she makes you spend absurd amounts of time on those also. It takes longer to peer review a paper than to write one
970,2146765,1.0,4.0,"DON'T TAKE HER CLASS! DON'T! She is rude, hypocritical, rudely sarcastic, judgmental and passive aggressive to the extreme. She gives endless busywork daily even work for the 3 days the class does not meet. Her homework is pointless and takes all of your time let alone her essays which are graded so hard and no grades are ever posted for you to see"
971,2146765,1.0,4.0,DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She makes you feel stupid if you try to talk to her and ask questions and is rude and hypocritical and passive aggressive. She gives ridiculous amounts of busy work as homework which will take all of your free time because she gives it 5 days a week. Her grading of papers is very hard and she enters no grades all semester.
972,2146765,2.0,3.0,"Professor provided no feedback on papers, just a letter grade. Rude to students that actually care and are willing to seek out help. Not accessbile at all. I would not take a class with her again."
973,2146765,2.0,4.0,She has not put one assignment in the grade book all semester. She gives so much extra and pointless work and you have to read a lot. She's really sarcastic.
974,2146765,4.0,3.0,"I don't know why people hate this class.  I showed up, participated and got an A.  If you are a good writer, you will do fine.  BE SURE TO PARTICIPATE"
975,2146765,1.0,4.0,Class is so unorganized w so many pointless time wasting assignments going on at once. Final is due tomorrow and only THREE assignments have been graded. Gave no feedback on essay just put letter grade @ the end. Doesnt teach at all but wont hesitate to call you out. Ran out of class time so she gave 2 full blown projects in the final 2weeks. AVOID
976,2146765,1.0,3.0,"EDHE is supposed to be an easy class for an easy A and good for your GPA. While I did get an A in her class, it was not easily done. If you don't have your book in class, she counts you absent. Invites discussion, but will 9/10 times tell you your opinion is wrong."
977,2146765,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE HER. You will hate yourself. It is past midterms and she has yet to post one grade. She assigns a lot of HW every night. You will be doing 7 different things at once. She does not have a syllabus, post schedule by day, no planing ahead. She encourages discussion but will straight up tell you your opinion is wrong, and make you feel dumb"
978,2146765,1.5,5.0,"Do not take her what ever you do. She is the WORST teacher I have ever had, she gives so much homework and busy work that is so unnecessary. I had at least 2 hours of homework for her class every night, if not more. Also, she gives you not enough time to write your papers, we had less than 2 weeks to write an 8 page research paper. DONT TAKE HER!!!"
979,2077134,3.0,2.0,"Class has quizzes every week and while they're online, she makes the questions very specific, so doing the readings and watching her videos are a must. Test were pretty easy. If you pay attention and do her weekly assignments class is really easy."
980,895442,5.0,1.0,"For bio recitation, Jackson is the best. The recitation should not be stressful, as the accompanying courses are hard enough. He doesn't take attendance and as long as you do the weekly discussion posts you will have an easy A. He's also very chill but still knows what he's talking about and answers any questions we have about the lecture material."
981,895442,5.0,1.0,"Very easy going. He has a British accent and goes over all the material fairly in depth. As long as you read every slide take notes and read the textbook to supplement the slides, you will most likely receive an A. It does take work but as long as you just read and take notes on everything you will be fine. Material is very easy it's just a lot."
982,895442,5.0,3.0,I would highly recommend Dr. Jackson for Bisc 160. He is great at making difficult concepts easier to understand. He is funny and seems to truly care about his students. And his tests come directly from his lecture slides (which he puts on blackboard) so you hardly ever have to open your book.
983,895442,5.0,2.0,"By far the best professor I've taken at Ole Miss. Dr. J actually cares about his students and wants them to pass his class. No text, but he basically provides his own text as a pdf. I only took micro because med schools suggested it, but I'm so glad I did. Great professor."
984,895442,4.0,1.0,"Dr. Jackson is easygoing and has a great sense of humor. His recitation made the stress of BISC160 a little more bearable. I did, however, feel bad at the end of the semester because my section rarely listened to him or tried to engage in the discussion. He was so chill that everyone got it into their heads that they could just walk all over him."
985,895442,5.0,1.0,Very easy recitation leader! You read and present an article once or twice the whole semester. You basically just have to show up and participate a little.
986,895442,4.0,4.0,"Weeder class for Pre-med. Probably one of the hardest classes offered. Luckily everything tested on is in his notes/lectures. Just be prepared, not just facts but application and in depth understanding."
987,895442,2.5,4.0,"He is an okay professor, tests are horrible. Can't wait until the next professor takes over."
988,895442,4.0,4.0,Don't let any one fool you he is hard. Although if you just take notes and study every night you should be ok to get a B.
989,895442,4.5,2.0,"As long as you write down every word and chart, you should be fine."
990,895442,4.0,2.0,My favorite Bio teacher at Ole Miss.  Class is very easy relative to most biol classes.  British accent.
991,895442,4.5,3.0,great teacher! the class is not too hard and you learn alot. lab is really interesting.
992,1825234,1.0,3.0,Did not teach what was tested; extremely unimpressed
993,1421787,5.0,3.0,"very straightforward, what he says in class and what is on power points are all you need to know"
994,1421787,2.5,3.0,"Go to class, write down all the examples he gives in class they are always on the test, and take notes"
995,2671072,2.0,4.0,Lectures are hard to keep up with because of the amount of material. Studying outside of class is usually just relearning the material and not a review. Go to class to get credit for quizzes.
996,2671072,1.0,5.0,"I have never seen a professor show such blatant disregard for the well-being of their students. Not everyone is blessed with stable internet connections at home, but when he insists we take an exam, even in the middle of an ice-storm, against the University's advisory, that spells just excatly what kind of a professor he is. Will revisit later."
997,913893,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Roy is funny and teaches the material well, but you really need to pay attention to keep up (she's a fast talker). I've taken multiple courses by her, and she's always eager to help if you fall behind or don't understand something."
998,913893,5.0,4.0,"Very organized and knowledgeable. Very approachable and does a great job preparing you for the exam, more than any other first year prof. One of the best professors here."
999,913893,1.5,3.0,"poor job of transferring the knowledge of a dry subject, contracts, on to the students. thrown in to drown instead of swim."
1000,913893,4.0,4.0,Very organized and helpful.  Obviously intelligent and knows the material.
1001,913893,5.0,4.0,No Comments
1002,913893,1.5,2.0,Very unclear. Never answered questions in a helpful manner. Exam was not comprehensive at all.
1003,913893,5.0,5.0,"The only contract that could hold her is the one that all lawyers sign with the devil.  No, really, her contracts class should be boring but is actually quite good."
1004,2687465,5.0,3.0,He is a really nice professor. Very willing to help whenever you're confused or stuck on something. He's respectful and clear about his expectations for his class. I would take this professor again.
1005,2687465,3.0,4.0,This class was very excell heavy. It was hard but he was willinging to help and responds to emails quickly.
1006,2058730,1.0,3.0,"She's just an alright professor with heavy lectures. As long as you do the TopHat questions and study her study guide she gives you, you will pass. Very oblivious, so you can scan in and leave."
1007,2058730,4.0,2.0,"She's very knowledgable about the material, but lectures are very boring. All her tests and quizzes are lecture based so getting the book is useless. Tests aren't too hard as long as you take decent notes and go over her powerpoints. Overall and easy class."
1008,2058730,4.0,4.0,"Dr Arizzoli is a great teacher with good lectures. If you go to class and pay attention to what she says, you can do well on the tests. English is not her first language so she can be difficult to understand at times. For AH202, an A is a 95 and above, which is not mentioned on the syllabus, so be aware that it is extremely difficult to get an A."
1009,2058730,2.0,4.0,"Her lectures are very dull, especially on the first day. She puts no emotion into them and is not that engaging to the class, not because she is French. Just scanned in and left as well, as long as you do the reading, homework and study for the tests plus the an easy museum paper, you can pass with at least an A to B. Textbook wasn't used at all."
1010,2058730,3.0,3.0,I scanned it and left or just did other homework. But if you do the in class participation and study the study guide you will do fine. Do the one easy project and extra credit paper.
1011,2058730,3.0,3.0,"Most people scanned in and left, came for review day and thats all. Same thing in the book are on the slides, if you pay attention in class you can pass."
1012,2058730,4.0,2.0,Class was pretty boring but I learned a lot. Very strict professor. Pretty much just show up and pay attention to pass the 4 exams. 1 very easy paper towards the end of the semester.
1013,2058730,3.0,4.0,"She's pretty boring, but she encourages class discussions."
1014,913898,4.0,4.0,"He cold calls; so read. The notes in the book are most helpful but know the facts of the cases in case he calls on you for it. Laptops are allowed in class and on exam. The final was about 40 pages long: long hypo, short answer, and multiple choice. It was tiring. He stands up and talks the whole time. Sometimes he scribbles on the board sometimes."
1015,913898,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pittman is a WONDERFUL professor. Truly cares about the student and their education. He is tough, but it is only because he expects the best from his students because he teaches with such merit. He makes the law practical so that everyone can understand it, however, he also draws complex connections that challenge you. Highly recommended"
1016,913898,2.5,3.0,"He can be really entertaining and intimidating when cold-calling. He will grill you! And he can be excruciatingly boring (like any other professor who lectures an entire class period). Doesn't like questions but always asks for them... (Yeah, I know.) Good guy outside of class. Talk to him, go by his office, he likes that. "
1017,913898,3.0,4.0,"Intense. Would prefer him to act more professionally and treat students like adults and abide by his own syllabus, but he will not. He will make scenes when he should just give absences. Talk to outside of class, he's practically a person!"
1018,913898,5.0,5.0,A great person who is very helpful to those who ask.  Taught me things about torts I still use now.
1019,913898,1.0,5.0,"I had him for a pre-trial procedure class.  He's completely unqualified to attend law school, much less teach at one.  Avoid at all costs, particularly in summer sessions."
1020,913898,5.0,5.0,"Great professor, genuinely cares about his students and subject matter.  Gruff on the outside but a truly good person.  Highly recommmended"
1021,913898,1.0,3.0,Ridiculous.
1022,913898,4.0,4.0,a George Cochran Jr.  Seems intense and intimidating at first but very good teacher.
1023,913898,3.5,5.0,Pittman is interesting.  He tends to deviate into the notes and hypotheticals so do not get lost!  And all those little deviations will be on his test.
1024,913898,5.0,5.0,Dr. Pittman's class is the highlight of my week.  Brilliance like his is the reason that we have tort reform.
1025,913902,5.0,2.0,"Interesting discussions. Not a lecture, more of an open discussion. He assigns a good bit of reading but you can fake it through the discussions if you forget. Really enjoyed this class and would definitely take it again. Had to write 5 papers total, but half were 1-2 pgs so they don't really count. Graded on papers and participation, no tests"
1026,913902,2.5,4.0,"Tough to get through. Doesn't cold call, so you you have to will yourself to stay awake."
1027,913902,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Hoffheimer is really great. For Conflict of Laws, be ready to make regular presentations to the class. At first I hated this, but it really helped when the exam came around. Don't be late to class."
1028,913902,5.0,3.0,Great teacher! Loved the class! Very friendly and helpful! Highly recommend!
1029,913902,5.0,4.0,Awesome!
1030,913902,4.0,2.0,Its Conflict of Laws... tough to make it super interesting.
1031,913902,4.5,4.0,He's very nice and knowledgeable.  Strict with the rules though.
1032,913902,4.0,4.0,Great Jokes!!!
1033,913902,4.5,2.0,The best!

1035,913902,1.5,5.0,He's a great teacher!
1036,913902,3.5,5.0,"Presentation of criminal law can be a little dry.  He also goes out of his way to make a big deal about it when students go to the bathroom -- is that really necessary&#63;  We're all adults.  He's very clear about the law, however, and is a smart guy."
1037,913902,3.5,5.0,plays a mean ukelele
1038,913902,3.5,3.0,Amusing and uninhibited
1039,913902,5.0,5.0,great!  good musician!
1040,913902,3.0,4.0,"He is fairly clear, but can be a little rude to students in class.  Not a guy you would want to have a beer with."
1041,913902,4.5,3.0,fun fun!
1042,913902,4.0,4.0,"Overall, good professor, but seems hostile when students ask questions."
1043,913902,5.0,4.0,Awesome

1048,913902,5.0,1.0,Hi
1049,913902,5.0,5.0,Hoffheimer's the man
1050,913902,5.0,2.0,Great fun! Love the fiddling!
1051,913902,5.0,4.0,Please have him sing to you! His musical talent is the punctilio of the highest order!
1052,913902,5.0,4.0,No Comments
1053,913902,5.0,4.0,Professor Hoffheimer is probably the best professor at Ole Miss law school!
1054,913902,5.0,5.0,Civil Procedure is never going to go down as someone's favorite class but Dr. Hoffhiemer does his best just to get us through.
1055,1346032,5.0,3.0,"He explains things very easily and I took him again for 108. GO TO CLASS. Bonus point opportunities every day. I didn't do it, but it's possible to make a 115 on each test because of bonus points. Also he's very caring and great at lectures and answering questions."
1056,1346032,1.0,5.0,"The worst professor you could ever take. I took him for Phys 211 and it was the worst experience of my life. He taught concepts in class yet tested you on the ability to solve word problems when he doesn't teach you how to solve them. Similarly, he's a super tough grader. Shows no mercy. If you take him for Phys 211, good luck. You're gonna need it"
1057,1346032,4.0,3.0,"Attendance is optional, but there is a five question quiz each day of class, and you get extra points on your test even if you just write your name on it. GO TO CLASS, you will get the extra points and it is necessary to pass the class. Study sessions are very helpful. The lab grade is combined with the lecture grade, which can be helpful."
1058,1346032,4.0,2.0,Go to the study sessions. Study for the quizzes. Entertaining.
1059,1346032,2.0,4.0,This class was definitely harder than I expected. He goes into great depth about physical science and it sometimes unclear. His study sessions are extremely helpful and he will give you lots of extra credit points for the quizzes he gives everyday. 
1060,1346032,4.0,2.0,Extremely good at explaining tough subjects. Offers a lot of extra credit. Participation attendance is a must but you will get an A if you do.
1061,1346032,3.5,4.0,GO TO THE TEST REVIEW SESSIONS AND STUDY EVERY QUIZ. Quiz questions make up the test. You also get one drop test grade which is nice. Lab is also important but the lab final is impossible. 
1062,1346032,4.0,1.0,"He's competent in particle physics but seemed disinterested in teaching.  His apathy I think diminished my zeal.  His mood was up and down.  Often, at the beginning of class he seemed irate, e.g. redshot eyes, angered by questions, but didn't say anything impolite.  And by the end of class, he was always in a cheery mood.  Perhaps b/c he is Irish."
1063,1346032,3.0,2.0,"While he's a very good teacher and explains things very well, he can be difficult to deal with outside of class. But overall, he treats GenEds like what they are... classes that no one wants anything to do with including himself. He's a good professor overall, but he seems disinterested which makes his students less interested."
1064,2165233,5.0,3.0,She is always willing to work with you and her lectures aren't boring. Show up to class and take notes from her powerpoint and you will be just fine. She doesn't upload her PowerPoints to blackboard so you have to show up if you want any chance of a good grade.
1065,2165233,5.0,4.0,"(1) Show up to class. Every. Day. (2) Be an active listener and take GREAT notes. (3) Read the book. This class is extremely fair. If you do the above, your chances of an A are high. Miss Jourdan is young, but genuinely cares about you learning psychology. She is very knowledgeable, so ask questions. Few teachers, if any, care as much as she will."
1066,2165233,5.0,2.0,"She keeps us interacted in the material, which makes the time go by faster.  She is super helpful inside and outside of class.  She makes psychology fun and interesting.  Reading the slides definitely helps for her tests."
1067,2165233,1.0,1.0,"Obviously is very new to the teaching/ lecturing gig. At times is almost too timid to address the class and teaches as if we (the class) are 8 years old and has us repeat (verbally) information she presents on a powerpoint, which ill add has no warming substance other than definitions that she loves to read. I rely on the text."
1068,483826,2.0,2.0,"The prompt for his final paper is almost in comprehendible without clarification. He requires 4 scholarly sources on works that are so obscure there are no sources for them. He refuses to grant excused absences for valid reasons. He is passionate about the course material, but this does not translate into explaining the importance of these texts."
1069,483826,4.0,4.0,this my guy.. won't regret taking him
1070,483826,4.0,4.0,"Great Teacher learned a lot about a subject that I was not particularly interested in. Has a great understanding of the literature read in class. Definitely a hard teacher because of the emphasis on the midterm, paper, and final but be ready for constant quizzes."
1071,483826,1.0,2.0,"Alabi gave us 30 quizzes over the semester.You need to expect a 10 point quiz every day.. which is frustrating because it's only 10% of your grade. Midterms and finals were difficult. He expects a lot from you. A LOT of reading. But if you get a good TA, you'll be alright. Couldn't understand a word he said.. Nigerian"
1072,483826,1.0,2.0,"Alabi gave us 30 quizzes over the semester.If you read a short story, you need to expect a 10 point quiz the next day.. which is frustrating because it's only 10% of your grade. Midterms and finals were difficult. He expects a lot from you. A LOT of reading. But if you get a good TA, you'll be alright. Couldn't understand a word he said.. Nigerian"
1073,483826,3.0,4.0,"Good teacher overall, but expects a ton of work from his students. Through the course of just one semester we were assigned 3 novels as well as 35 poems or short stories. He has a tendency to not answer questions or answer them incredibly indirectly. Entertaining in the classroom but if you don't love to read you may want to consider an easier prof"
1074,483826,4.5,3.0,he's a very good teacher
1075,483826,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting class and not overzealous with the assignments.  Grading system seems a little arbitrary, but not too difficult.  Seems to work very hard to form an interesting reading list."
1076,483826,1.5,4.0,Agree with everything said. Also very hard to understand sometimes.
1077,483826,2.0,5.0,DO NOT take this class if you want to have any free time This man is just unreasonable in his grading and gives quizzes on the most minute details
1078,1716724,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. Always willing to help students outside of class. Has high standards but I learned a lot by sticking with the class.
1079,983541,3.0,2.0,No Comments
1080,1427965,4.0,3.0,"Go to Class. You will need the points, there are not that many. There are 3 exams.there are also quizzes and. Not that hard, but you need to go to class."
1081,2630142,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Cromwell is extremely knowledgeable and great at asking questions that facilitate genuinely interesting conversations in class. He is super easy to work with if you are having problems finishing an assignment and need help. If you keep up with the reading and participate, this will be one of your favorite college courses."
1082,2630142,1.0,2.0,ugh too much work thinks he knows everything. I had to take this class for my schedule. thought his class was everything during the pandemic
1083,2630142,5.0,4.0,"He was so nice and understanding throughout the semester. His class is set up in a unique way that holds students accountable to the grade they choose to receive. Overall a great professor who cares about his subject and students. 10/10 would recommend, especially if you love history!!"
1084,2630142,4.0,4.0,"Good prof, lots of reading and writing for this class. No tests though so thats good. Just make sure you do the reading."
1085,2439678,5.0,4.0,"The critical reviews on here are ridiculous. Physics is hard and it takes practice to master. The homework is the right amount, and her lectures make the material very easy to understand. There is no better physics professor than Dr. Meyer. "
1086,2439678,5.0,3.0,Dr. Meyer is the best math-physics professor I have had so far. She makes the material very accessable 
1087,2439678,5.0,4.0,Professor Meyer is the best professor for this material. She takes very complicated concepts and makes them easily digestible.
1088,2439678,3.0,5.0,"She is a decent professor, but this class is ridiculously hard. Go to as many SI's as possible. Go to every class. This class was harder than Organic chemistry in my opinion."
1089,2439678,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TURNED IN SO MANY ASSIGNMENTS 30+ THAT DID NOT GET GRADED FOR MY FINAL GRADE. NEVER answered emails, did not show up to zoom office hours, and brought up the election in class?????"
1090,2439678,1.0,4.0,So. Much. Work. Honestly was just confused on what to do this whole course. Its like one day we were learning one thing that needed a couple of days to learn and she just skims over it in 10 minutes and makes the whole test about it. Not sure what her teaching algorithm is.
1091,2439678,5.0,3.0,"Very good lectures with exams that never felt unfair or overly difficult. The only complaint I have with Dr Meyers 211 is that the online homework can sometimes take several hours to do, but overall this is the best possible teacher to take in my opinion. Very helpful and knowledgeable."
1092,2439678,4.0,3.0,"She's a really understanding and great professor! She knows how to get the point across without sounding like a know-it-all. However, she has only four tests and homework once a week, as well as online homework. Overall, the lecture is decent, it's the lab that gets you! Choose your TA wisely!!"
1093,1249794,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Lowery is AMAZING!! She always has fun activities to teach us about strategies for connecting with students. She is sweet and cares about her students. Definitely not one of those teachers who brags about their fail rate. Her tests and assignments are easy but informative. If you have the chance to take her class, DO IT."
1094,2173462,4.0,4.0,Solid Prof. Graded hard on the papers but gives 25% participation if not more along with extra credit
1095,2173462,4.0,3.0,He was good! He lectures very heavy and has quizzes everyday. You will do well if you go to class all the time. He does provide extra credit and take good notes! He isn't a harsh grader on essays.
1096,2173462,3.0,3.0,"Pretty easy class if you show up. He makes his lectures interesting by asking students questions and engaging the class. Grades are mostly made up of participation (daily quizzes on new material), essays, and 4 big quizzes. Does not do tests. Literally gave us the final and essay prompts before the test day. Does have pretty strict attendance."
1097,2173462,1.0,4.0,"His tests did not match the lectures AT ALL!!! His lectures were scattered all over the place. He literally spoke with the softest voice that he sounded like a kitten and I was on the front row. He was always booked for appointments to meet with him, so you really could not hear him. He gave a quiz every class period and on BlackBoard every week."
1098,1321495,5.0,3.0,Very fun class
1099,1321495,1.0,5.0,just dont 
1100,1321495,1.0,5.0,Can be funny at times but teaching is not his calling. Take online if you want an A
1101,1321495,4.0,4.0,"The tests are extremely hard however Flautt is a great guy, super funny. Tries his best to make the lectures relatable to college students however, if you have the option to take BLAW online as a web course, you have a extremely better change of getting an A"
1102,1321495,5.0,4.0,Great teacher and class
1103,1321495,3.0,5.0,Attendance is mandatory period. The class is mostly bases on 2-3 tests. If you fail one test you are likely screwed. Great guy but not the best teacher. Very knowledgable but teaching is not his calling. Talk to him and participate. Lecture and reading heavy. He does not give you much so take great notes and pay attention. Its a harddddd class.
1104,1321495,3.0,5.0,"Flautt is a great guy, he's really funny and knows what he's lecturing on. The hardest part of the class are the tests. He doesn't give you a study guide so you MUST read ever textbook chapter as they are assigned or the tests will be impossible. He gives practice tests on Blackboard which you can use to see what you need to study."
1105,1321495,5.0,4.0,Great teacher
1106,1321495,5.0,4.0,"Great guy, Great teacher!"
1107,1321495,3.5,3.0,he talks a lot but if you take interest in subject you should make a decent grade.
1108,1427995,4.0,3.0,Mrs. Varnell is very nice and she is willing to work with her students. Extra credit is offered some and there are a couple assignments that are easy test grades. Not a hard class.
1109,1427995,5.0,1.0,"Excellent professor. Fun, easy lectures. Class isn't crucial so missing isn't a big deal. Gives extra credit at the end of the semester for attendance. Loves what she does. "
1110,1427995,3.5,3.0,"I did not like her at all. I would have gotten an A in the class if it were not for a resume project. I have an award for best resume and she gave me a 30 on it... a 30!! Because I did not follow exact instructions about putting it in a folder, my bad! This ruined my grade. I did well on everything else and ended up with a B, I will not take again!"
1111,1427995,5.0,2.0,ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS I'VE EVER HAD!!! seriously take Mrs. Varnell. She cares about her students and wants to help them succeed. I can't wait to have her again.
1112,1427995,4.5,1.0,"Very easy class, but she gives lots of homework, but it is all really easy. Do the homework, even if you turn it in late she'll still give you an A if you're a good student."
1113,2716193,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Winburn is a decent professor. He cares about students and does not try to trip you up. Some of the content can feel a little remedial, however, but look forward to a fun Freudian analysis of Groundhog Day."
1114,2716193,5.0,1.0,"Overall, best teacher I've ever had. He is so cool, nice, and understanding. He doesn't show any bias with his opinions when talking politics. Lectures are interesting and he gives lots of opportunities for missing, late, or bad grade work. Wish I could take his class again."
1115,2716193,1.0,2.0,"If you're looking for an easy (yet boring) class, this is it. However, Winburn often allows his personal opinions to pollute discussions. He also commonly uses profanity to attack figures that he does not like. I always feel uncomfortable discussing my thoughts, and, if I do share my stance, Winburn encourages other students to attack me."
1116,2716193,4.0,2.0,"He's super chill. Attendance isn't necessary but there's extra credit if you do come. His lectures can get boring but he throws in short quips that make it pleasant. Grades are composed of online quizzes and a few exams. Exams are pretty hard, the average has been a 70 on all of them. He talks about real-world issues making the class insightful."
1117,2716193,3.0,2.0,Winburn is ok. Sometimes he lets his personal opinions hijack discussions.
1118,1886755,5.0,2.0,Wonderful professor with real world experience.
1119,1886755,5.0,2.0,I love Ralph! He is a great teacher and will actually work with you. I needed a 100 on the final to get an A in the class. I went to his office hours and we went over my tests and I ended up getting a 97 on the final and he bumped my grade to an A. He knows what he is talking about and class is actually interesting. I recommend!!! Easy A or B
1120,1886755,4.0,3.0,Really nice and helpful guy. Hard to understand sometimes. Tests are difficult. Average grade on the tests is a C.
1121,2232872,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gala is amazing and I am so happy to have had her as a teacher. She really cares about her students and wants everyone to understand and learn. The class is normally really engaging with a mixture of powerpoint lecture and activities to &quot;act out&quot; what we just learned. Take her if you get that chance, you won't regret it."
1122,2109994,4.0,2.0,"Cooper is incredibly clear. He has a fair note-card policy where you throw your name in the hat in order to be called on and are rewarded in points at the end of the semester. The subject of Legal Profession does get boring, but he does his best to add elements to excite when possible."
1123,2695723,5.0,3.0,"The textbook is provided and so are all of the other supplies. Brooke is an amazing teacher, and I would 100% take her again. My drawing skills improved significantly, and I was always able to ask her questions or talk about my concerns. She was so helpful!"
1124,612907,2.0,4.0,I absolutely despised this class.
1125,612907,5.0,3.0,"He is a fantastic person. Easily one of the most caring professors I've had. His lectures are hard to keep up with, but he has no problem answering questions. He is a great professor, and I would highly recommend him. The class is difficult, but if you apply yourself and talk to him about what you don't understand, you'll be just fine."
1126,612907,5.0,4.0,"An absolutely amazing professor. Don't listen to the negative reviews - while he teaches a hard class and may be a little rough around the edges, he is an absolute genius when it comes to knowing and explaining Roman history, and is a fair and just grader. If you do everything you're supposed to, you will pass AND learn a ton about Roman history."
1127,612907,1.0,5.0,awful
1128,612907,1.0,5.0,"A 2006 review said &quot;When he has a bad day, students pay for it and he has a lot of bad days.&quot; which is STILL true. Don't expect to learn anything from him. You teach yourself. Do good on tests or else. He is unorganized, rude to students, and doesn't do his job (emailed on exam week &quot;Please just do not ask.&quot;) He truly ruined Latin for me."
1129,612907,3.0,4.0,"A difficult teacher until you understand the way he works. He's more understanding than people realize. Put yourself out there and you'll do fine. Don't even think about cheating, he cares a lot about academic honesty. Offers extra credit though. Makes himself accessible to students which is nice."
1130,612907,2.0,4.0,zzzzzz get ready to read and teach yourself the material
1131,612907,3.0,4.0,"He was hard and had poor people skills (read: could be a jerk). I believe he did care, however, because he requested we have a conference when I wasn't doing to great I'm his class. I ended up making a C. I don't blame him, but he didn't make the learning experience very enjoyable."
1132,612907,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lobur honestly doesn't get enough credit. People get the wrong idea about him but he honestly loves the material and wants his students to learn. Personally, I find his teaching style refreshing.  Allow yourself to get to know him as a professor, and you'll have a better appreciation of his love for Classics. In return, he'll respect you, too."
1133,612907,2.0,5.0,not fun at all
1134,612907,4.0,4.0,"He's very knowledgeable and taught the class well.  His class was harder compared to the other Latin professors I've had.  And, he can be a real jerk at times."
1135,612907,3.0,5.0,He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo
1136,612907,5.0,2.0,Very interesting lectures
1137,612907,2.5,3.0,"When he has a bad day, the students pay for it (captive audience)..and he has a lot of bad days."

1140,612909,3.5,3.0,"Kind of seems preoccupied outside the classroom, but cares a lot while in the classroom setting. He pushes you, although sometimes it comes off borderline condescending. The exams involve going into a certain amount of detail, so it motivates you to study harder. I still think I'll benefit from having him as a professor."
1141,612909,5.0,5.0,Great teacher
1142,612909,4.0,4.0,"I had him when he taught a semester at Michigan State. Very helpful and clear, and he held review sessions before every exam. His tests were very specific. You had to know what you were talking about to get the grade. Not a blow off professor."
1143,612909,4.0,4.0,"Nice guy, but can be condescending at times"

1146,2695726,4.0,1.0,"Some of the projects instructions and such were a bit confusing at time, but she always cleared anything up as long as someone asked about it. The class is super easy and really fun."
1147,1557042,4.0,3.0,Dr. Centellas is a good professor and the class is really interesting if you lean into the material.
1148,1557042,1.0,5.0,"She came across as very disorganized and a little almost cocky at times. My biggest problem is that during the pandemic she claimed to be really considerate, but she still gave grades that were beneath us. It is very frustrating when you have an A until the very end and she drops it to an A- due to participation during a PANNY."
1149,1557042,3.0,3.0,"Heard a lot of great stuff about her but was Underwhelmed, by a lot. Her lectures are alright but condescending, and her group work often is a waste of time. Not challenged to think outside of my normal confines at all and we even watched &quot;Crash Course World History&quot; IN class. Course is interesting but not as good as it could be. Reading heavy."
1150,1557042,5.0,3.0,Dr. Centellas is very knowledgable about the subject she teaches. You will need to read the assigned material to be able to participate during in-class discussion. She has undoubtedly been one of my favorite teachers here at Ole Miss and I highly recommend taking any course from her.
1151,2228786,4.0,3.0,"She did a great job of explaining the material, and seemed to care a lot about the success of her students. She moved fairly quickly through her powerpoint lectures, but would slow down if a student asked her to go back a slide."
1152,954934,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Hayes requires 3 books to be read throughout the course, which is impossible considering the shortened semester. She rambles during her lectures which makes it hard to really analyze any text. She also is an incredibly tough grader. The course is too fast-paced, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
1153,954934,2.0,4.0,Took her as a freshmen and honestly hated it. Her lectures are fast and often hard to follow. Pop quizzes are the reason why I struggled so hard. Most of the text is not in modern English terminology and she does not provide proper translations that often.
1154,954934,4.0,4.0,She cares about the subject and makes lectures interesting. The discussion portion of the class will boost your grade a lot.
1155,954934,2.0,4.0,She rambles on a lot and the lectures in her class are so boring that you really have to fight to stay awake. Is not very clear on her grading style. For the midterm half of what I was marked off for was right but when I addressed it they seemed annoyed. Also you have to have a scantron on you at all times because likes to give random pop quizzes.
1156,954934,1.0,5.0,"You will have no idea what she expects and she's one of those teachers who grades based on how much she likes what you wrote and not how much effort you've shown, or progress you've made. There are very few guidelines for any tests or papers so this is a real issue. And as the other person said, she does ramble on and on and on and on and on..."
1157,954934,1.0,4.0,Did not like whatsoever. She rambles for a thousand years and none of it seems to connect. It was difficult to make good grades on her papers because she seems incapable at enunciating exactly what she expects (or really even what the prompt is). Never again.
1158,954934,3.5,4.0,"SHe knows her stuff, but is difficult to understand at times. She is also overly enthustiastic"
1159,954934,5.0,3.0,"Really interesting.  And she does give her students a lot of time.  She will help you out, especially at paper time. Not easy, but she explains the texts well."
1160,954934,4.0,3.0,Dr. Hayes is hot and keeps my interest on subjects I couldn't care less about.
1161,954934,5.0,3.0,Dr. Hayes cares so much about her students and her subject matter.  She isn't easy but gives students more time than any professor I've had. It's adorable how excited she gets talking about  witchcraft...plus she's really cute.
1162,954934,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Hayes was so energetic and funny even at 8 in the morning (even though she is not a morning person). Of all the profs I've had, she obviously likes students the most. The time of day really sucked. Some of the readings were boring but she managed to make them more interesting. If you need to take this class, she is a good choice."
1163,954934,5.0,4.0,I loved Mary's class. She is so funny and really listens to everyone.

1166,2835001,5.0,3.0,"Professor Nicholson is soft-spoken but his lectures are interesting and intriguing. While tests are mainly your only grade for this class, he provides a clear study guide that if taken advantage of you should do well on all his tests."
1167,2357818,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Allen is hilarious. Although she is humorous, her classes are generally difficult. She grades midterms and exams hard. And she often doesn't lecture. She likes to show videos / Ted talks / in-class debate / case study / class game about the material. It's a good break from class but she doesn't give much lecture and notes."
1168,1255993,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors you can take. He really cares about what his students are learning, adjusts if he needs to, and is quick to answer back to emails. He's very funny and makes lectures fun and entertaining. 100% would recommend him!"
1169,1255993,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Noonan is an amazing teacher. He really knows his stuff and is very helpful. If you have the chance to take him, you really should."
1170,1255993,5.0,3.0,dr. noonan makes difficult concepts crystal clear. he is very helpful and keeps the lectures interesting. attendance is never taken.

1172,1256006,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I've had at Ole Miss. The tests are so poorly formated that they're a mind game. He will test you on minuscule details that he may have spoken about once. Jumps all over the place during lecture so it is hard to understand the train of thought. You will not get back your test you probably failed to see what you got wrong.
1173,1256006,3.0,4.0,The class has a bad rep and if you go into it thinking you aren't going to pass- you won't. Just pay attention during lectures and make sure you comprehend the material. Not impossible to make an A.
1174,1256006,5.0,4.0,"If you pay attention and learn every single thing he says, you pass. Its that simple! most people just come into his class and expect to get by knowing 90% of the material. If you do that, you fail. You have to know everything. But it's so worth it as you come out well educated in the body's functions. "
1175,1256006,1.0,5.0,I dont wear my seat belt driving to school because I want to die before I can make it to this class. 
1176,1256006,1.5,5.0,"This was by far the hardest teacher I have ever had at Ole Miss. His test averages were consistantly failing yet does not believe in implementing a curve and he is very rude when you go to see him. If you can avoid him, do it! "
1177,1256006,1.5,5.0,"One of the worst experiences I have had at Ole Miss with a biology teacher. His tests questions are very vague, however he counts off points for every little detail. The average of the tests are a failing average, yet he won't look at the source of the problem, HIM! I would advise anyone to NOT take him for physiology."
1178,1256006,2.0,5.0,By far the most difficult Biology class at Ole Miss. The class size dropped by 50% after the first test. Tests are nearly impossible.  Lab is not any easier than lecture- it actually LOWERED my overall grade.
1179,1256006,2.0,5.0,He is extremely hard. The class could be a lot easier but he makes it hard. His test are multiple choice but they have multiple answers. He doesn't care about his students because there are so many people in the class. He just teaches his way and that's how it is.
1180,1417800,5.0,3.0,"The only grades are three tests, but he gives study guides and goes over them the class before the test. No attendance policy but he gives scenarios that will show up on the tests and aren't on the study guides. Pretty funny guy"
1181,1417800,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gross is a fantastic professor. He is so funny and is very experienced in the field of abnormal psychology, so he has a lot of lecture relevant stories. I typically have trouble paying attention, but he is very engaging. GO TO CLASS. Your grade is based off 3 exams only, so if you fail one, good luck doing well."
1182,1417800,4.0,2.0,"A funny, quirky guy. Only grades are tests and there were three this semester so make sure you do well on tests. Tests weren't proctored. Textbook isn't required but I recommend since he doesn't lecture out of the book but puts stuff from the book on his tests."
1183,1417800,3.0,3.0,"He gives study guides, but the tests also have a lot that isn't on the study guide. Sometimes it feels like he doesn't teach you what you need to know. Lectures can be either really entertaining or super boring."
1184,1417800,4.0,1.0,"Easy class if you show up and take notes. He gives very detailed test reviews, if you understand everything on them, the tests are fairly easy to get A's on. Your grade is made up of 3 tests and that's all, but none of them are too bad. No attendance policy either, but you should definitely go to class, tests are from the lecture. Don't buy a book."
1185,1417800,2.0,1.0,"He occasionally tells a funny story but is usually boring, but the class is easy. Don't buy the book you'll never use it"
1186,1417800,2.0,1.0,He's boring and monotone whatever you do DON'T BUY  THE BOOK!!
1187,1417800,4.0,3.0,"He's really intimidating on the first day of class but he's probably the best teacher I have ever had. The first test was hard sine you're not sure how he's going to test, but when he repeats information that means it's going to be on the test. He's very straightforward with what he expects, he's hilarious, and going to class is actually fun. "
1188,1417800,5.0,2.0,"Gross may seem intimidating at first, but he really cares about his students deeply, is hilarious, and an all around 5 * professor."
1189,1417800,5.0,2.0,Excellent 
1190,1417800,5.0,2.0,"He can be kinda scary because he comes off as kinda grumpy, but overall cares about the class and students. Recommend"
1191,1417800,4.0,2.0,Great guy. take him
1192,2728520,4.0,2.0,"Took her twice. Older lady with hearing issues, but super understanding. A lot of the class is discussion based and she grades for participation. Really easy grader on journal/essays. A lot of articles and other books outside of class, but it's not too bad and you don't actually have to read them. Two 3 page essays and a research paper."
1193,2728520,4.0,2.0,I wish I was able to take Professor Pulliam's class again but those who take it should know that it is an easy course with a heavy emphasis on discussions. Extensions are allowed as long as you ask and Professor Pulliam is very considerate. Fair warning that she does have bad hearing issues but she is overall a pretty fair grader and professor.
1194,2728520,5.0,1.0,Shes a super easy professor and is very understanding and willing to give extensions. It is lecture/participation heavy. There is also extra credit opportunities. Overall decent teacher who made me giggle even when she had her moments of inconsistency.
1195,1278541,5.0,3.0,he is the number 1 of economists!!
1196,1278541,5.0,2.0,"He is the best!!! Very helpful outside the class. Asks bonus questions for extra credit. He doesn't take attendance, but classes really help."
1197,1278541,5.0,4.0,The best class in my first year. You'll learn a lot if you attend the class and do the homeworks. Class is difficult but he rewards hardwork. He presents lots of real world examples and his lectures are not boring at all. I will take his international trade class next semester.
1198,1278541,4.5,2.0,"One of the most helpful teachers on campus, he really cares about his students. He wants you to do well in the class so he will do a lot for you. Also, after taking this class I can finally say an Economics teacher that actually talks about topics that you can relate to and see the results. Take him if you have the chance."
1199,2433620,1.0,5.0,Test has nothing to do with class material!
1200,2433620,5.0,3.0,Great instructors! Passionate about the material and made class a great experience!
1201,1737303,5.0,2.0,"He's really nice, and he is good at teaching the class. He is also very confident in what he is saying; he is a quiet talker which can be a problem if you can't hear well. Besides that, he is just a good and kind teacher. "
1202,1737303,5.0,1.0,"Absolutely love him. One of the best professors at Ole Miss. If you have the chance, take him!!!!!!"
1203,1737303,5.0,1.0,Easiest class I've ever taken but still really interesting. He talks really softly so sit in the front if you have a hard time hearing.
1204,1737303,5.0,1.0,Roy is the most chill and easy professor I could ask for.
1205,1737303,5.0,3.0,A revolutionary and one of the best profs at Ole Miss.
1206,1737303,5.0,2.0,Excellent class!
1207,2562648,5.0,1.0,He is so caring and kind. I highly recommend taking a course with Dr. Felber. He makes the content enjoyable and gives no tests besides the take home midterm. Take his class.
1208,2562648,3.0,1.0,"He does not take attendance and told us on the first day the as long as he knows your name by the end of the semester we should be okay. He enjoys class discussions and likes when the class is more involved. Lectures are kind of boring. There is a paper due at the end of the semester and it is kind of confusing, but he grades pretty easy!"
1209,2728536,5.0,3.0,"Highly recommend! She has like five degrees, so trust she knows whats worth doing and whats not. Theres not a lot of bs in her class, its very straightforward. Attendance isnt required but on the days that I have went she makes it interesting."
1210,1890906,4.0,4.0,You'll never have a professor go more in depth than Nowlin. Sometimes to a fault as you know it all cannot possibly be important for the future let alone the exam. He's always at your disposal for any help you may need though.
1211,1890906,5.0,1.0,"I'm not sure what my law comment would look like without Prof. Nowlin, but it would not be great. Nowlin not only permits, but insists upon individual assistance outside of the class. Easily one of my top three professors at U. of MS."
1212,1890906,5.0,5.0,"Scary smart. Quick as whip.  Intense.  You will get sucked in. You will leave dazed but then realize, My god, how did I learn all of that in one semester?"
1213,2345576,4.0,3.0,"He is over the chem labs, but I don't think I saw him once during Chem115/116. The TA is the one who teaches and grades your work, so they make the class. Overall though there are a lot of points available for the class, as well as one drop lab, so it isn't too hard to do well. The prelabs and postlabs can get a little confusing, but Chegg :)"
1214,1823337,5.0,3.0,"Amidon is awesome! I have always hated math and I assumed I would dread this class, but now that it is over I am wishing that it wouldn't end."
1215,1823337,5.0,2.0,Amidon is an amazing teacher!!! I was so interested in his class I never missed a day. He always had ways to keep everyone involved. Everyone knew each other and knew we could count on one another at the end of the semester. I will miss taking this class just because Amidon is so AWESOME!!! If you have a chance to take his class DO IT!! :D
1216,2583152,3.0,2.0,"She means well, but her lectures only made the content more confusing. I had already taken a calculus class in high school, so I did not attend class, but others had difficulty learning topics in her class. She would give wordy definitions for mathematical ideas that could easily be communicated through practice problems. "
1217,2583152,2.0,1.0,She is young and means well but does not know how to teach. Uses very wordy definitions to explain mathematical concepts. Oftentimes still have to teach yourself the lesson even if you go to class. Homework and tests online on Hawkes. Class doesn't meet on Fridays which is a perk. The content of the class isn't too difficult though. 
1218,2036340,4.5,2.0,Really clear in what he expects from the class. As long as you take notes and look over the study guides then tests will be easy. I would definitely take his class again.
1219,2241145,1.0,4.0,"Josh's syllabus manages to find just about the most boring material available for European studies, a subject whish should be pretty interesting. The books you will read in class will put you to sleep, and every week he assigns 5 hours of work usually due on a Saturday. To his benefit, he seems to care about his students. Wait for another professor"
1220,2241145,2.0,5.0,He gives you at least 3 hours' worth of homework before every class. He is extremely subjective on his papers and some of his criticisms just come across as petty as if he is heavy-handed on the red ink. His final was ridiculous based on sheer amount of time it took and the amount of essays. Honestly just wait until a different prof. teaches it
1221,2241145,1.0,4.0,Hard class and grader
1222,529019,5.0,2.0,Very fond memories associated with Dr. McCoy. He was the only saving grace of the Theater faculty. Always a gentleman--kind and compassionate. Wish the other (past) professors had half the dignity of this man. Always helpful...kind-of gruff and fatherly. A lot like 'Mr. Grant' from the old Mary Tyler Moore show.
1223,529019,1.0,4.0,"This guy is aweful. Most boring class of all time. My only advice, RUN far away"
1224,529019,1.0,5.0,There was not one study guide or review before any of the test. He used no handouts or outlines. Students are required to see plays but they are very talked about. He managed to suck all interest and fun out of all the activities. There was a student teacher for the 150 students who's soul purpose was to take attendance. DON&quot;T TAKE IT!!
1225,529019,1.0,5.0,Terrible class
1226,529019,4.5,3.0,Knows his stuff better than any teacher I had at Ole Miss.  Great guy.
1227,2357883,2.0,4.0,"I did everything this professor asked to do and still got a D in the class. Really dont understand how, because I completed all of the assignments and made decent grades throughout. The class was online and her lecture videos did not explain concepts well at all. I basically had to teach myself. I would highly recommend taking another professor."
1228,2044540,1.0,4.0,"Avoid at all costs. Awful handwriting, very hard to understand when speaking. His lectures ALWAYS run 5-10 minutes longer than the allotted class time. Overly tough grading on tests. Online homework problems sometimes had the wrong answer in the answer key."
1229,1172100,4.5,4.0,"You learn a lot, but will work hard to get a good grade."
1230,1172100,5.0,5.0,"Very good professor that knows the material inside and out.  Also, he goes above and beyond his teaching duties to help students out."
1231,2134660,1.0,2.0,This class had a lot of unnecessary work. An interesting class made uninteresting. Not like crazy hard tho tbh
1232,2134660,3.0,2.0,"She cares about her students and the class is not super hard. Her modules are set up complicated though and there is lots of work. It was frustrating to deal with. Overall, not too bad. Be ready to write and do busy work. I was in 311 but that was not an option here "
1233,2134660,5.0,3.0,"She is so organized and uses stories to teach most of her lectures. Everything she explains makes sense. She is work heavy so be prepared, but you learn a lot in her classes. Most of her classes are organized the same way and vary a little some aspects. She works with you personally if needed."
1234,2134660,3.0,4.0,"I've taken Dr. Dowling twice now and overall I think she's a good professor. The only thing I don't like is that she is SO particular about your answers to open-ended questions, and if you don't have exactly what she expects, she does not give you full credit. Also, there is absolutely no leeway when it comes to turning in late assignments."
1235,2134660,5.0,3.0,"In Dr. Dowling's Psy 301 course (Developmental), she has enjoyable lectures and creates an environment conducive to learning the fundamentals of developmental psychology. She plans the course out extremely well, in a way that students who are fine with b's and c's can attain, but it is not impossible to get an A for students who put in the effort."
1236,2134660,3.0,4.0,"Don't be fooled, this class is tough and there's lots of homework, but Dowling has enthusiasm and passion for the material which makes it worth the struggle."
1237,2134660,5.0,2.0,What a great professor! Very helpful and thoughtful. Her lectures are very enjoyable and informative. If you attend classes it wouldn't be hard to get an A. She is absolutely the best professor. The way she teaches and behaves towards her students are just amazing. There are readings and quizes in each class. Would take any class from her of possib
1238,1960582,3.5,2.0,"Lecturers are long but they are good. Mostly  tests and one project.  He cool. Its watered down since its a 101, "
1239,420485,1.5,5.0,"Not a terrible teacher per se, but her class was very jumbled. It was hard to figure out the point of any of it. Worst part however was her insistence on basing 40% of your grade off homework, and being extremely unclear about due dates and criteria. We're in college, not high school. Grades should be primarily exams and papers, not stupid homework"
1240,420485,1.0,4.0,awful. awful. awful. She does not have a clue.  Don't take any of her classes if you want to maintain your love of French.
1241,420485,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoy Dr. Quinney's class.  She has definite opinions on politics and gender roles, sure, but what college professor doesn't&#63;  Dr. Quinney is a great teacher, one who challenges us with her grading and assignments.  She rocks!"
1242,420485,1.0,3.0,"This woman HATES female students.  If you are a guy, you will get an A, unless you speak better French than her, in which case she will accuse you of plagarism.  She has no business teaching pedagogy, she should be in some dark library reading Lacan."
1243,135817,1.0,5.0,If you are a good test taker you will do fine but if not do not take his class because he only goes off test and test questions are all multiple choice and difficult.
1244,135817,4.0,4.0,"If you attend class, pay attention and take good notes during his lectures and actually read the dang textbook  you will do well. If you rarely come to class, doze off during lectures and procrastinate studying until the night before an exam, you will not do well. Dr. Nordstrom gives great lectures and encourages questions, take advantage of that!"
1245,135817,4.0,2.0,pretty easy
1246,135817,4.0,5.0,"He's not just hot, he's HAWT.  Great professor who cares about students.  Don't ever get into a goldschlager war with him at City Grocery."
1247,135817,4.5,4.0,"Class title &quot;Intl conflict&quot;, had hoped it would be about current conflict,was instead, was about theory and conflict history.Surprisingly, I enjoyed it.Texts and lecture put theory (can be dry)into understandable historic perspective.Took as Online course, Nordstrom was organized,responsive to Email,seemed like a interesting,quality Prof.Recommend."

1249,135817,5.0,2.0,He knows what he's talking about and he notes are straight forward. Make sure you study LITERALLY EVERYTHING before the midterm and final.
1250,135817,1.0,4.0,"Boring, BORING, BORING!, and god he's a tool. He has a huge ego and really doesn't like people to mess with his opinions. His final is worth 50 percent of your grade and you have to take 4 map quizzes of the different continents. GOOD LUCK!"
1251,135817,3.0,3.0,tool
1252,135817,2.5,4.0,BORING.
1253,135817,5.0,3.0,All Around awesome guy!!
1254,2497163,5.0,1.0,best teacher in the education dept!!
1255,2245259,4.0,3.0,As long as you take notes in class and read the articles she gives you its an easy class. She's not a hard grader at all.
1256,633486,1.0,5.0,"She is a teacher who strongly believes in interteaching, a peer-based teaching method. So don't go to this class expecting to be taught, because she will not teach. You must teach yourself with a partner. She will do a &quot;clarifying&quot; lecture the next of what you learned the previous day - which isn't very clarifying at all."
1257,633486,1.0,1.0,She's weird and likes to be difficult af for no reason and she doesn't even teach instead uses inter-teaching which is a waste of time
1258,633486,1.0,1.0,"Interteaching isn't helpful at all, nor what I took the class for!! I don't want to learn from some random person I'm partnered with, I want to learn from a professor!!!"
1259,633486,1.0,1.0,I spent all that money on tuition so I could get an A in busy work! Thanks Kate Kellum!!
1260,633486,4.5,2.0,Material is somewhat difficult but get points early in the semester. Don't get discouraged by all the confusion at first. She is great at helping anyone who is willing to come into her office. I would suggest this class to anyone who isnt a good test taker because there are none.
1261,633486,4.5,2.0,This class is very different from any class I've taken before. It can be very fun. Get all of your points as quickly as possible; don't miss too many classes & always remember to do your Blackboard assignments.
1262,2497167,4.0,3.0,Musgrove is a lovely teacher who cares about her students doing well. As long as you go to class and pay attention this should be an easy a
1263,2497169,4.0,4.0,Corey is a great teacher! He not only teaches ASL but he also teaches the importance of understanding deaf culture. This class takes some work and dedication but it isn't too hard if you're interested in it. He's hilarious and makes class fun.
1264,2497170,5.0,1.0,Dr. Prior is the best professor I have ever had. She cares about her students and you can tell how passionate she is about teaching. She comes to class everyday with full energy and gives 110%. The work is not hard and I asked her a million questions and never felt stupid or discouraged by her. Take her class even if it's early in the morning.
1265,2497171,4.0,3.0,"Burchfield is a great professor. She does give a lot of quizzes and is a super strict grader, but she really makes sure you understand the material. She can seem a little cold at first, but she actually cares about her students. I would definitely take her again."
1266,2497171,4.0,1.0,"Burchfield is a great professor! She wants you to do well. While attendance is not mandatory she counts it for a grade so don't skip class! She always emphasizes what she will be looking for on tests. Test format is long answer but she gives you the prompts ahead of time. If you show up and listen, it's an easy A."
1267,1847955,5.0,4.0,He is so hot and a great teacher
1268,1847955,5.0,3.0,Jake does a great job.  Enthusiastic.
1269,1847955,5.0,3.0,Great teacher
1270,2593431,1.0,4.0,"Corona forced us to move classes online and it became unbearable. There were so many communication errors that we didn't know when the final was or how to complete projects worth half our grade. She is nice, but truly believes that she is your only class. So many mistakes were made on her end that effected us and no extensions or grace was given."
1271,2437787,5.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed this class. This was our macro class, and she did not have a lot of hands on experience with this type of sw I feel. However, she did do all that she could to help us learn about this branch of our major. She made the class feel that it matters, which can be difficult at times."
1272,2437787,5.0,3.0,"This was an amazing class. I feel that we got so much from taking this course, and not just the stuff we were required to learn. The firsthand experience that was offered to us was something that could not be replaced. This was one of the few classes I had that I looked forward to, and that helped me solidify what I wanted to do in the future."
1273,1950364,5.0,3.0,She gives you extra points just for showing up sometimes. She's super sweet and all about her extra credit.
1274,1950364,5.0,2.0,"Tests count 80% of your final grade, but she does let you drop one of the 5 tests. Really enjoyed her in-class examples and activities. She goes over all the info in class, so attendance isn't mandatory, but important. Really cares about her students. Tests are easy if you actually study and go to class."
1275,1950364,3.0,5.0,"This is the hardest class I have ever taken, but she gives a bunch of extra credit to make sure you can pass."
1276,1950364,2.0,2.0,"So. Much. Busywork. Seriously, take someone else because she floods you with meaningless assignments that don't help you learn"
1277,1950364,5.0,1.0,attendance is not mandatory but is part of daily grades . SO GO To Class . Eassy class lots of extra credit . Supper nice teacher :)
1278,2378404,5.0,2.0,Great professor. Very passionate about the subject.
1279,1827492,5.0,1.0,"399 is a service experience type of thing, and she is really accessible.  She made an error on my grade midway through the semester, yet fixed it really quickly.  I was pretty intimidated because it isn't a traditional class, but she makes it fair, and you should be able to earn an A.  Get all of your volunteer hours early!"
1280,2052775,1.5,5.0,Does a poor job of explaining the material. Notes do not help for online homework.
1281,2052775,1.0,5.0,Not a very good teacher. Doesn't know how to communicate with students. Would highly recommend NOT to choose him as your teacher.
1282,2153127,2.0,1.0,"Took him for online intro to government. Simultaneously one of the easiest classes I've ever had and one of the rudest professors I've ever had. The fact that he is easy kinda makes up for his snark, but it doesn't make it pleasant."
1283,2153127,5.0,3.0,"He was an awesome professor. If you do what is asked and show up to class, you would really have to try to not get an ""A."" If I could take him again, I would."
1284,2153127,5.0,2.0,"By far one of my favorite teachers at Ole Miss. Whenever the class had low attendance, he offered extra credit assignments that would be due the next class period to award you for showing up to class. Test review sessions are exactly like the test and he made a very boring class into something I enjoyed going to. Take this professor if you can!"
1285,1180334,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely loved this professor, he is super straight forward and makes assignments easy to understand! I had him for the first semester that was fully online because of covid and he was always extremely helpful regarding homework problems. The set up of the class is super simple as well homework heavy but he shows you what to do step by step."
1286,1180334,4.5,1.0,Great guy. Helps you on whatever you need and if you go to class you will get the grade you want. HOTTY TODDY
1287,1180334,4.0,1.0,"Very easy to get an A in MIS 309, just go to class and he will tell you what you need to know."
1288,1180334,1.5,5.0,"Lets see, what can I say&#63; I took his MIS 330 class and when I was taking it made it hard. He would give you programs and give you basically no help on it. He has become a bit more relaxed after I took his class and easier."
1289,1180334,2.0,4.0,If you had my 280 class!
1290,2615983,4.0,3.0,"Shes a great professor, and I absolutely loved her class. One thing is she doesnt like blackboard so she didnt update our grades often so I was always confused about where I stood exactly grade-wise."
1291,1712816,3.0,4.0,A difficult class with a difficult professor but definitely do-able with time and effort. SI sessions were a big help. Tests are open note but you definitely need to know what's going on beforehand to do well on them. I heard a lot of people struggled with this class but I also know a lot of people who ended the class with an A.
1292,1712816,1.0,5.0,"At the beginning of the semester, I had Jones and, while boring, he was bearable. Halfway through, we all switched to Dr. Symula. The entire time she was really boring while being super tough. The class got exponentially harder when she took over."
1293,1712816,1.0,4.0,Worst teacher at Ole Miss
1294,1712816,4.0,4.0,"Symula gets a worse rep than she deserves. Yes, the class is very hard. There are also over 600 students in the course, so she can't be the most attentive to every single one. She does care, and gives an extra credit opportunity to add 5% to your total grade. This class is for science and pre-med majors so it is just preparing us for the future."
1295,1712816,4.0,4.0,"Not gonna lie, for an entry bio this class is hard. That said, she is a great professor. She knows what she's talking about and if you take good notes in lecture, go to office hours, and go to SI you will be okay. You definitely have to work for your grade, but she does give extra credit assignments and the class is not impossible to do well in."
1296,1712816,1.0,3.0,Symula is never available. She does not respond to emails. She is often late to class and her notes and teaching are disorganized at best and incoherent at worst.
1297,1712816,4.0,4.0,"People that fail this class do it to themselves. This class is VERY difficult and requires good study habits and interests. It's a required premed class, and you will not survive if you party constantly and never try. Dr. Symula is very nice and helpful outside of class during her office hours and she really does care as long as you put in effort."
1298,1712816,1.0,5.0,"I got thrown into the deep end with this class. I was mistakenly guided into her class by my adviser and could not drop because of hours. I still tried hard, reading and really taking thorough notes in lecture. Still failed EVERY. SINGLE. ASSIGNMENT. was NOT accessible during my free time. rude and mean. always been a good student but this sucked."
1299,1712816,4.0,5.0,"I think people are way too hard on Dr. Symula. Bisc160 is a very challenging class, but if you take good notes on her lectures, you have all the information you need to do well on the tests."
1300,1712816,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Symula's class is one of the more challenging classes that I've taken, but she does her best to make sure we understand the material and she gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit. She is a very good lecturer. She explains the material very well and always stays on topic in class. I would take Dr. Symula again."
1301,1712816,1.0,4.0,"This class has been the worst class I have taken at Ole Miss. She simply does not teach what are on our exams. Most of the tests consist of things we do not go over in lecture. There have been chances for extra credit after 90% of the class failed an exam, and even when she tells us what will be on the extra credit opportunity, most fail that."
1302,1712816,1.0,5.0,This class has the highest fail rate at the uni. The professor does not make it any easier. I do not know anyone who has gotten higher than a C on any of the tests so prepare to be getting D's. 50 minutes to submit 40 questions that take longer than the time given to answer. You feel rushed. Everything else is easy. But it is a test heavy class.
1303,1712816,1.0,3.0,She does not care about her students. Her tests are rife with errors--which she admits to in emails--but does not give points back. Simply a bad teacher. High school caliber.
1304,1712816,1.0,4.0,I hate this class. She is mean and rude. does not care about her students. Yells at us for no reason like were children. Terrible lecture slides. Spends half her lectures fighting with her ipad . doesnt test on what she lectures on. Exam questions have no correct answer- which she admitted to in an email- but doesnt give us points back. Hate her sm
1305,1712816,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Symula is extremely helpful outside of class, especially if you regularly attend office hours and SI sessions. Bisc 160 is a challenging class no matter what professor you have: the material in this class will make you cry. But Dr. Symula breaks down concepts and thoughtfully explains all of the answers to my questions whenever I have them!!"
1306,1712816,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Symula is by far the worst professor I have this year. She is never available and is unable to competently answer even the simplest questions. As another reviewer previously noted, my high school bio teacher was better suited. Is this the best the University of Mississippi has to offer? Disgraceful."
1307,1712816,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Symula would rather focus more on outside things rather than teaching the class examples: pointing out masks every 3 seconds, pointing outside conversations that aren't distracting until pointed out, and overall focusing more on what other students are doing rather than teaching the class. Also, lectures do not help with any of the exams."
1308,1712816,1.0,3.0,"The class isn't that hard. If you read the textbook, you can scrape by with an A or B. But Symula is of no help to her students. The fact that my mediocre public high school biology teacher was better is very telling."
1309,1712816,1.0,4.0,Dr. Symula's lectures are not particularly helpful - largely just reads off slides. What's annoying is that the exam material is not representative of what she says in lecture or what the textbook contains. It's not clear what should be studied to be prepared.
1310,1712816,1.0,5.0,This class was tough. The tests require much more than what is given by Dr. Symula or her team. The extra work was miserable and the professors were not accessible. Fails a lot of students.
1311,1712816,1.0,5.0,Worst teacher ever. She is the only teacher for bisc 160 and 162 so get ready to fail every test. You can study for hours on her material on everything and still fail. I was a straight A student.
1312,1712816,1.0,5.0,I have had her for 2 classes Bisc 160 and 162 and she is the only one that teaches it here. She is by FAR the worst teacher I have had. She is a sweet lady but cant teach her on test. Her test are impossible to pass. I was a straight A student. Get ready to cry every night.
1313,1712816,2.0,5.0,"Very difficult professor. Must study and read the textbook. SI sessions are very helpful, but not helpful enough. Multiple choice question exams are overwhelmingly hard even after studying and reading the textbook. Also, there's only 4 exams the entire semester. Take the extra credit quizzes !!!!"
1314,1712816,2.0,5.0,"If you had anything resembling a decent bio education in high school, you will probably be fine. If you never had AP classes or got a poor bio teacher in high school, honestly, its not worth it. You need to have a strong foundation of knowledge going into the class. Otherwise, you wont be able to catch up."
1315,1712816,2.0,5.0,"She is a good person, but she is just not a very good teacher. This class is very hard, and you need to study every day to make an A in the class."
1316,1712816,2.0,4.0,Just hard.
1317,1712816,5.0,3.0,SHE GIVES SUCH HARD EXAMS! But you can defiantly make an A in the class if you try. A lot! Go to office hours because she is really helpful and is honestly really nice! She doesn't put anything on the exam that she doesn't go over or tell you to read about so you just have to make sure to do the things she recommends.
1318,1712816,1.0,5.0,I was enjoying bio until our professors got switched halfway through the semester and I got Smyula. I studied hours upon hours for her test and thought I knew everything until I looked at her test questions...
1319,1712816,4.0,4.0,"Many believe you shouldn't take Symula, but thats because they don't look at the bigger picture, they're looking for an easy A. But Dr. Symula is one of the smartest women I have ever met. The class is difficult but only if you don't apply yourself. All her tests are based off of her lectures so if you go and take notes/record her, you'll do fine"
1320,1712816,1.0,5.0,"This is one of the hardest professors I have ever taken. If you do not read and study and you will fail. Symula loves biology, but not her students."
1321,1712816,3.0,5.0,"very good teacher, but do not take this class if you do not have to. Tests are extremely hard and require lots of prep time before. This is a weed out class to see who is actually good for pre med type majors. Go to office hours, as much as you can. They help a lot."
1322,1712816,4.0,4.0,"People are honestly was too hard on Symula. Her class is difficult and its a lot of material, but if you put in the work you can pass. She is really understanding when it comes to being sick too. I was out for a week and 1/2, and she pushed back my test, made sure I had recorded lectures, and put me in touch with another student to get her notes."
1323,1712816,2.0,4.0,"The class itself is difficult and she is rather difficult herself. Must read, must go to office hours, and must do any extra credit possible."
1324,1712816,4.0,5.0,"This class is HARD and I hated it. That being said, Symula really does know what she's talking about. Lectures heavily from the book so read it. Take advantage of the tutoring sessions and extra credit. It's possible to make an A, but she makes you work for it."
1325,1712816,5.0,4.0,"Many people don't like Symula because of the intensity of the course, but she was positively one of my favorite teachers. She always knew what she was talking about, even if she was going fast. But, you can still pass the class with an A if you really put in the time &amp; effort &amp; have good studying &amp; note-taking habits. It's worth it."
1326,1712816,1.0,5.0,One of the worst professors I have ever had. This class by itself is difficult but with her teaching it you are screwed.
1327,1712816,5.0,4.0,"Everyone is harsh to Dr. Symula but only because she gives a crap about what she's teaching. Don't  come in wanting an easy Biology or to become a doctor or nurse or whatever by sliding by. But if you want to learn how to study and completely understand the material, Symula will get you there. Just STUDY and stop expecting college to be like HS!"
1328,1712816,3.0,4.0,"First off, Symula is awesome. This is an extremely hard class, and you are expected to work hard. A lot of people fail this class, but it's not from Symula. Bisc 160 and 162 offers plenty of opportunities for students struggling. Take advantage of the SI sessions, extra credit quizzes, and office hours. This is a hard class but it's not impossible."
1329,1712816,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Symula is really good at explaining concepts and is very accessible.  However, her tests are literally impossible.  The average was a 70 and on one it was a 50.  The wording is confusing and there are multiple right answers.  If you took AP Bio or a lower level bio class, you will probably do okay because you're familiar with the content"
1330,1712816,3.0,5.0,"The tests are really difficult, prepare to study weeks in advance."
1331,1712816,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Symula gets a bad rap. Yes, her class is challenging, but she is not the uncaring, cruel teacher that many students make her out to be. She genuinely cares about her students and schedules ample office hours. Her tests are hard, but if you study a week in advance, you will do fine. Do the work! She's also had some extra cred for few tests"
1332,1712816,1.5,5.0,"The class itself is grueling enough but having Symula made the semester infinitely more stressful. Nothing she said in class was of use, and listening to her only confused me more. Ironically, the less attention I paid to her lectures, the better I did on exams. I stopped going to class at all after the second exam and ended up with a B. Self-study"
1333,1712816,2.5,5.0,"Hardest class I have ever taken but with that being said it is not impossible. If you put in the work and the study hours you will be successful in the class. Record lectures because she talks fast, go through her lecture slides again, and read/take notes from the book. Good luck!"
1334,1712816,2.5,5.0,"I can say she was hard all I want but at the end of the day you must take her in 162. So why not start out with her so you don't have to adjust?? I've never given so much time to anything but I wanted an A and received it. Go to office hours EVERY single one of them. This class is humbling be ready for a rude awakening, but never give up."
1335,1712816,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Symula, although a very controversial biology professor, has been great for me this semester in BISC 160. Although I haven't had the chance to visit her office hours, her lectures are very easy to grasp, uses great examples, and makes sure you understand the information. She's not out to fail, but genuinely wants students to understand biology."
1336,1712816,5.0,4.0,"The best professor choice for Bio 160!  Precise, well-delivered explanations, but you had better be good at taking notes from verbal lecture, because her powerpoints only show terms and lack details.  She may not be an easy teacher, but it's the nature of the material that makes it difficult.  If you don't like biology, change your major."
1337,1712816,2.5,4.0,"She's tough. There for you if you need help, go to office hours, she's nice but a tough grader. Record lectures, test questions are tricky. Study study study, from day 1 if you want to do well."
1338,1712816,2.5,5.0,"i asked her a question in class and she was rude about it, as in she talked down on me and made me feel dumb in front of other people"
1339,1712816,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Symula's class is very hard and fast-paced. You have to keep up on your notes and reading to get even a decent grade.  And waiting until the night before is a big mistake.  I never went to her office hours, but she is a very nice lady, regardless of the other nasty comments.  Just very straightforward and a tough teacher!"
1340,1712816,2.0,5.0,If you don't go to her office hours then it may seem like she's no help but she really is a good teacher. This is just a difficult class and you have to actually study. and go to her office hours
1341,1712816,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE!!!! Worst teacher I have ever had. She does not care about the class or her student's grades. She is very smart but cannot teach at all. If you get stuck with her then read/ study your book before you go to lectures and prepare to have no life outside of her class.
1342,1712816,3.0,4.0,"This is a very difficult class. I never went to help sessions or made the effort to ask Dr. Symula for help, so I don't know how helpful she is. This is called a pre-med weed out class for a reason. There is no way around it, you cannot use AP credit from high school. Come prepared and be prepared to spend numerous hours studying."
1343,1712816,1.0,5.0,"Horrible teacher. Shes very smart but not very nice. Doesnt really help when it is needed you just pretty much get the ""why are you asking this"" look. Expects you to know everything about Biology before the course even starts. Any student who has taken her will agree. Save yourself from the horror. DO NOT TAKE HER"
1344,1712816,1.0,5.0,HORRIBLE DO NOT TAKE! She has no communication skills whatsoever! Save yourself from failing!
1345,1712816,1.0,5.0,This professor is ridiculous. You can tell she's really smart but she's not so great at helping us understand as well as she does. She speeds through lectures and doesn't care if you understand or not. I don't recommend taking this class with her whatsoever. Try to take it somewhere else and transfer the credit. Or take it during the summer.
1346,1712816,2.5,5.0,VERY DIFFICULT CLASS. She one of those people who's really smart but really crappy at communicating that intelligence. Take this class over the summer or transfer it in if possible
1347,1712816,2.5,5.0,Really hard class. Make sure you read from the book every night and do all the homework/quizzes. The quizzes will help your final average.
1348,1712816,2.5,5.0,"You can tell she's extremely smart and loves biology. The problem is, she doesn't help you learn the material. She basically just speeds through all of the lessons and hopes you caught all of it! This class is extremely difficult."
1349,1712816,1.0,5.0,She is the worst teacher I have ever had. I am an A student and I got a D in her class. She talks way too fast and you can't understand anything that she is saying. On one of her tests the average was a 40 and no one got an A. Do not take her unless you want to fail.
1350,1712816,5.0,3.0,Really enthusiastic about the class. She made it quite fun.
1351,2466482,5.0,1.0,He's the best! Just watch movies almost every class and he is such a nice guy
1352,2466482,4.0,3.0,Really nice guy! If you ask him for an extension on a paper he will give it to you. A lot of annoying reading assignments but nothing too hard.
1353,2466482,1.0,1.0,"If you want a writing teacher that expects you to think outside the box and care and try on essays, look somewhere else. Professor Inman restricts his grading to a very narrow set of criteria which will, if you want an A, leave your brain confusingly numb after writing one of his essays. Never had a writing teacher care so little about writing."
1354,2615982,2.0,3.0,"Busy work, busy work, busy work. Despite the assignments being very simple and easy they are ABSURDLY long and will make you feel like a zombie clicking away at your lap top. I would not recommend unless you have a strong interest in theater."
1355,2615982,5.0,1.0,This professor is what an actual professor should be. Was always ready and had the answers to all questions. Class itself was very easy if you pay attention and actually put in effort. Very good class and Professor.
1356,2615982,5.0,1.0,"This class was by far the easiest class I have taken. The quizzes give you one chance to check each answer before you submit it, and there were only a few very simple 300 word essays. Professor Wood is also very relaxed &amp; understanding and gave extensions to the entire class numerous times throughout. You also get many extra credit assignments."
1357,2615982,5.0,1.0,honestly the easist class i have ever took. if you do the homework you will pass. there was like three 300 word papers through the semester but sooo easy. he offers 80 points extra credit and i loved the class
1358,2615982,2.0,1.0,"This class is easy, but it is all textbook work and rarely him. So if you do not like a lot of online work stay away."
1359,1686199,4.0,3.0,Tests are straight from his online quizzes. Do the quizzes and youll get an A on every test!! Very good teacher
1360,1686199,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Centellas was more than understanding that I'm also a parent. He gave me the option to bring my daughter to class with me when my baby -sitter cancelled. He responds to emails promptly, if you put in the effort it will be duly rewarded."
1361,1686199,2.0,4.0,Extreme amount of group projects which were all very difficult. Many  assignments were unrelated to his class lectures. He tried to make this course a stats/methods class when it was titled Democracy in Latin America.
1362,1686199,2.0,5.0,"You have to read the textbook, take notes, make flashcards,  and interact in class to pass. He also is super vague."
1363,1686199,3.5,2.0,Very interesting class. Notes not required. Tests are on completed online quizes.
1364,2685628,2.0,3.0,This teacher can be extremely rude to her students. She is not very lenient about late work even if you are very sick at home. I do not think anyone has an A in this class and our final is tomorrow. She follows the textbook and can be a good teacher at times but the class is basically a review of the homework that was assigned the night before.
1365,2685628,5.0,3.0,"This is the best professor to take. She is quick to help with anything you need help with. There is a lot of homework but they are easy A's. Participation matters. There are only about 5 quizzes total, 3 exams, and a final. As long as you show up and participate, you will do fine! If you want to learn Spanish and have a good time take her!!"
1366,2685628,5.0,2.0,"Professor Landa Vera was a great teacher. She is very understanding and does not overload her students. She is easy to understand and very willing to help her students out. Participation is important and you will need the textbook, but I really enjoyed the class and would definitely take her again!"
1367,1843901,2.0,5.0,"I'd have to say that neither me,  nor my friends enjoyed her. She's very hard to deal with. She was the only teacher I did not enjoy while at Ole Miss."
1368,1843901,2.0,4.0,"Hard grader, loves to give C's"
1369,1843901,5.0,3.0,"Great professor! A bit strange, but really friendly once you get used to her. It's a typical essay-focused class - do the readings and if you're a decent writer you'll make it through."
1370,2474686,1.0,5.0,Tests are ridiculously hard for no reason. Even after studying math lab for days and hours at a time and making A's and B's on the homework the tests are nowhere near similar. Do not take this class.
1371,2474686,5.0,5.0,"Calculus is hard! You have to really think about the concepts. I usually fail the first three tests then bring my grade up to a B by the end. Ask questions!! Thats the best way he teaches, answering questions. Gives fair tests, will be questions youve seen before. Practice, practice, practice, and dont give up. Hes a good resource, use him!"
1372,2474686,5.0,3.0,He is a great teacher. Very understanding and willing to help. Ask all the questions you want he does not mind repeating himself. He posted lots of videos on youtube that helped a lot. Just practice and you will do fine.
1373,2474686,5.0,3.0,"The professor isn't hard, but the material is. It definitely a class you have to put effort in, unless you're naturally gifted in math. His test are pretty straightforward, and he won't test you on anything y'all didn't go over in class. Do the homework and the practice test."
1374,2474686,1.0,5.0,Hardest teacher Ive had at ole miss. If you have the choice do not take him. Everyone that sits around me has failed the first two tests. I have never gotten below a B in a class and in cal 2 with Wimberly I currently have a 64. The tests are ridiculously hard. DO NOT TAKE HIM.
1375,131776,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this professor. I have never failed a class in my whole entire life, and this was the first one. He assigns piles of homework that take 3-5 hours to complete. Pop quizzes almost every class. Extremely hard tests that you can't even finish because they're so long. I studied for weeks for each one and still failed. My career is over now."
1376,131776,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Shaw is great, but you need to work hard to do well in his class. You have to show up to class, work problems when you can (not just before exam), and it helps to participate. You need to know every concept he's gone over in class because he will exploit your knowledge gaps. Take this class if you want to learn and work!"
1377,131776,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Shaw is the best professor I've ever taken. He is tough but beyond reasonable and will always help. He gives you every opportunity to succeed and is very clear about what will be on his exams. Luckily I've taken him for 303, 304 and will be taking him for tax 2 next semester. I've learned more in each of his classes than all others combined."
1378,131776,5.0,4.0,"I've taken Shaw for 202, 303, 304, and 509. The classes are really tough, but you will actually learn the material. (That's what your there for, right?) He doesn't tolerate laziness and takes an interest in each of his students to make sure they succeed. Yes, the tests are long and exhausting, but it builds your endurance for the CPA (4hr) tests."
1379,131776,5.0,4.0,Great at accounting AND teaching. Personable. Has personality and will not put you to sleep.. People are more intimidated by the class than they should be. It is DOable. Do not waste time reading textbook.  Memorize how to do the problems. Learn to do problems and reference text. Do better than average on tests & be in top 45% of class.
1380,131776,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Shaw rightfully bears the title of THE hardest teacher to take for intermediate accounting. You CAN do well in his class, you just have to put in the work. Read before class everyday, work problems, and, like he says, study about 4 hours a day, and go to see him once a week. You can get an A, you just have to be willing to work for it."
1381,131776,1.0,4.0,"Don't take Shaw unless you absolutely have to! Going to class is pointless bc his lectures aren't useful, just show up on quiz days and get ready to teach yourself"
1382,131776,4.0,5.0,"He has very high standards. Everyone will tell you his tests are difficult as hell, but don't let that scare you: it is possible to do well in his class. It requires hard work. See him in his office if you have questions; he is helpful outside of class.  I found it best to come to class having read the day's material a couple times already."
1383,131776,2.5,5.0,hes a great guy but a super hard teacher. the tests are freaking impossible. i wouldnt take him as a teacher for any accounting classes.
1384,131776,4.5,5.0,"If you want as easy way out, do not take him. He is a great teacher and if your interested in thoroughly learning the material he is the guy.  The tests are HARD!"
1385,131776,4.5,5.0,Fun. You would enjoy going to class. But Tests KILL. It seems easy yet outcome is A shock !!
1386,131776,5.0,5.0,You'll love him everday but test day
1387,131776,4.5,4.0,"Fun teacher, keeps the class interested, but very difficult on tests."
1388,131776,5.0,2.0,awesome at teaching math.
1389,1618628,5.0,3.0,"Loved taking class with prof bailey. Funny, cool, and well versed in the subject. Midterm and final can be tricky however time management is key. Accessible and willing to meet with you at any point and time. Recommend using office hours because you gain a lot of insightful info. Grades fairly easy and lectures are always interesting and unique."
1390,1618628,1.0,4.0,Makes things more difficult than they need to be. Marks unexcused absence for texting and not taking notes in class. Gave me a zero on a paper for being twenty words under the limit despite the rubric saying it was required to be APPROXIMATELY 950 words. Also lectures extremely fast and refuses to let us use laptops to take notes.
1391,1618628,1.0,3.0,all this woman talks about is race and nothing else. We didnt even go over the industrial revolution in order to go over civil rights more.  If you are Conservative do NOT take this class.
1392,1618628,2.0,3.0,"If you show up to class and talk,text, or decide not to take notes she writes down your name and gives you an unexcused absence."
1393,754375,1.0,5.0,"I agree with the last person! He's rude, inconsiderate, intolerable, and he does expect you to read his mind in order to pass the class! What I learned in his class&#63;&#63; The definition of facetious!!"
1394,754375,1.0,5.0,Probably the rudest teacher i've ever had.  Whatever you do DON'T argue with him...he is always right (or so he thinks).  He is extremely unorganized and expects you to read his mind when it comes to completing and turning in assignments.  My experience with his class was extremely unpleasant
1395,754375,4.5,5.0,Real life kinda guy...I would take him again and he is so hot!
1396,754375,4.5,5.0,Difficult..but worth it
1397,754375,4.5,5.0,Its hard...but worth every minute...
1398,754375,5.0,5.0,A very difficult class but I have learned alot. The tests are difficult but fair-they are not unknown because the prof gives a very comprehensive study guide. I recommend him to anyone interested in putting in the time to learn whats on the edge of marketing
1399,2009801,5.0,3.0,"I love Dr. Freiwald. Ive had her for three classes and would take more if she taught more. She is disorganized and a little unclear on directions, but she is very understanding and often gives extra time to turn in work. She is super passionate about archaeology and it really shows in her lab and lectures."
1400,2009801,4.0,1.0,Her class is very interesting! She gives a lot of points to her students who just show up. Movie sheets and in class worksheets make up most of your points. There are a few assignments that take thought and hard work but overall nothing too difficult!
1401,2009801,4.0,3.0,Awesome class and teacher! Her lessons are interesting and would bring in bones and other artifacts into class
1402,2009801,2.0,3.0,"Her final is absolutely ridiculous. The study guide covers nothing on the actual exam, and she takes off for absences. She makes a lot of questions based on the reading and the dates she gives are important, but confusing to study."
1403,2009801,4.0,2.0,awesome teacher I barely tried and got a B 
1404,2009801,4.5,2.0,"Carolyn is a not only a great professor but also a great person. She is always in a good mood and goes out of her way to help you learn the material. The only con is that she can be very scatterbrained and unorganized. That being said, I would take her again."
1405,2435787,2.0,5.0,If there is another teacher you can take then take them!! I've taken her for 2 classes and both times I was practically failing the entire semester. Her tests are always hard especially the MC. She's a kind lady &amp; love the material but the way the tests are worded is beyond confusing. I felt like I read the whole book and still learned nothing.
1406,2435787,1.0,5.0,"There's a difference between a difficult professor and a terrible one. Dr. Shaw is difficult but I made A's in his classes. I barely have a C in here. She wastes her lectures being rude and condescending, and if you go to her office hours she is rude, waste of time. Still don't know what the tax forms are. Didn't learn anything, studied 50+ hr/test"
1407,2134732,5.0,4.0,"He was very good at teaching a usually boring subject. Professor Allen used really good stories and analogies to explain what we were learning about. There is plenty of opportunities to get extra credit or help if you need. If you pay attention and go to class, you will get an A most likely."
1408,2134732,2.0,3.0,He puts me to sleep
1409,2134732,2.0,3.0,He's a good guy but his lectures are hard to sit through bc they're so boring
1410,1637072,5.0,2.0,Amazing. Great online teacher
1411,1637072,5.0,4.0,"Great calculus 1 teacher. You have to study and practice to do well in this class, but his instruction is very clear and his grading is fair.  Tests are easy af as long as you study for them by doing practice problems. Wish I could take him again for calc 2."
1412,1637072,3.0,2.0,"SCROBER is legit do the HW, the tests arent easy but arent hard either just do the work. probably the most nervous teacher ever but its funny. good guy nonetheless"
1413,989907,1.0,4.0,"Clearly a genius, but lectures are filled with rambling detours, pontifications on irrelevant matters, and generally feel like you're wiretapping into the inner dialogue of the most ADD constitutional scholar in the country. His exam is awful and tests more for bizarre trivia rather than application of the law, unless he's changed his exam style."
1414,989907,2.0,1.0,"Hate to do this, because Green is a really nice guy, but his class is OUT OF CONTROL. I didn't think that was possible in law school. He has almost zero management skill. You don't really need to read or pay attention either. Super easy class, but not what I really came to law school for."
1415,989907,5.0,2.0,Some people did not like this professor because he taught more from theory than from blackletter law but I really enjoyed the class.
1416,2226910,5.0,2.0,Literally gives you so much helpful information. Never thought math was so easy. HIGHLY recommend.
1417,2226910,4.0,5.0,Business Cal teachers are all super similar but he is a good teacher that is legible and understandable and easy to talk to. Attendance is not required but unless you are a math wiz you better go. Do the homework and practice tests. They're optional but can get you 8% bonus on your overall grade and if you do them learning is a lot easier
1418,2226910,4.0,4.0,Business Cal teachers are all super similar but he is a good teacher that is legible and understandable and easy to talk to. Attendance is not required but unless you are a math wiz you better go. Do the homework and practice tests. They're optional but can get you 8% bonus on your overall grade and if you do them learning is a million times easier
1419,2226910,4.0,2.0,No class on Fridays. Homework is extra credit.
1420,1217253,5.0,3.0,"I took Math 513, Number Theory, with him. He is the best professor and, any class you take with him will possibly be the best math class you ever take at Ole Miss, at least for me it was. He really wants students to understand the material. Think about the best qualities you want in a professor, and that's Dr. Milinovich."
1421,1217253,5.0,3.0,"If you can take Micah, do it! He's the absolute best and made cal 3 a lot easier than most profs. Always gave back test in a timely manner. He doesn't give test reviews but he tells you exactly whats going to be on the test so its not that bad!"
1422,1217253,5.0,3.0,"Excellent teacher!  He was alays willing to help me with my homework.  He writes all his notes on the board, and you can actually repeat the problems when you follow your notes.  Great teacher.  Take him for any math class he teaches."
1423,1217253,5.0,3.0,My favorite teacher freshman year. He's literally always willing to help and makes Calculus 1 very easy to understand. He's obviously very intelligent and it shows when he teaches. If you get a chance... seriously... seriously take calculus from him. Plus he's precious.
1424,1217253,5.0,3.0,He was a nice teacher and was easily approachable.
1425,1217253,5.0,2.0,No Comments
1426,1327847,5.0,3.0,He does a great job explaining the material very passionate
1427,1327847,4.0,2.0,Best out of 3 Spanish teachers I have had at ole miss.
1428,1327847,3.5,4.0,He's very patient and willing to help if asked. All you have to do is do your homework and kind of participate in class to pass. He is really good at explaining things to get the point across.
1429,1327847,2.0,5.0,"He is a hard teacher but he wants you to pass. Sometimes he can seem a bit harsh. If you ask for help he will definitely help you anyway he can, but ultimately it's up to you if you want to pass."
1430,1327847,1.5,5.0,He is horrible and mean. He will call you out and he is extremely RUDE. He makes Spanish harder than it has to be!TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!!
1431,2081511,1.0,3.0,didn't learn anything from her as she's a terrible lecturer
1432,2081511,4.5,2.0,"A lot of people give this teacher poor reviews, because her class isn't an ""easy A."" If you're truly interested in the field, then, she's a great teacher. She has the most enthusiasm out of all the professors I've taken. Her tests are open note/book, but it's essential to pay attention in class. Take notes on what she says vs. the PowerPoints."
1433,2081511,2.0,5.0,"The tests are open note & open book, but you have to know the material ahead of time or you will run out of time taking the test bc they're in depth. Also, she gives irrelevant ""practice day"" assignment that she grades tough even though you're new to each ones material with no prior experience. "
1434,762600,4.0,2.0,Lecture heavy but very understandable. Fairly easy class.
1435,762600,4.0,2.0,"At first it can be really boring because he has a monotone voice, but he's easy to understand. He would work through the material in class for the online homework and explain it in the simplest forms."
1436,762600,2.0,3.0,had him for 201. it sucked. especially for a class that you're only taking to get your art credit out of the way. multiple chapters of homework due every Sunday.
1437,762600,5.0,3.0,"Had him for 267 and 268. Really liked him, always willing to bump up your test grades if you go and see him and show that you know the material. All homework is extra credit. Easy A"
1438,762600,3.0,5.0,He is okay. There are better options. He is nice but not super nice. Very boring but understandable and teaches ok. Moves a little too fast. He is not bad just not the best option.
1439,762600,5.0,2.0,"Enjoyed the class. He can be a little monotone sometimes, but he tries to explain concepts, unlike some of the other math profs. It's an easy class though and he doesn't try to trick you."
1440,762600,4.0,2.0,Easy A if you show up to class and take notes. Homeworks/practice tests are bonus points. Attendance isn't mandatory. He makes math easy to understand and follow and he's really nice.
1441,762600,5.0,2.0,"He's a great professor! He made MATH 267 very easy and clear. Homework is only for extra credit. Attendance isn't mandatory, but obviously you're really only hurting yourself by not attending."
1442,762600,4.0,2.0,Easy A if you come to class and take notes. He does the practice homework as his lecture so the homework/quizzes/test are all a breeze. Highly recommended!!
1443,762600,4.0,2.0,"He's a really nice guy and explains each type of problem in class but it's up to you to kind of teach yourself and practice for the tests. Hawkes is a really annoying program that the math department uses but it can be helpful if you're lost. All the tests, homework, and quizzes are online. The homework counted as bonus points when I took the class"
1444,762600,2.5,3.0,He is a very nice guy. The class is relatively easy. They expect you to learn it on the essential calculus application though. The material is not really taught in any of the math classes. They more just expect you to learn it yourself. Nice guy though and is definitely willing to help if you ask.
1445,762600,3.5,1.0,"This guy is awesome! Go to class and you'll be golden. The tests are pretty easy, just learn the material when he teaches it to you and it'll be super easy!"
1446,762600,4.5,1.0,"This was by far my favorite class. I took this class as a Freshman and I loved it. He is super nice guy and definitely knows what he is doing. He is always willing to stop what he is doing and help someone.  He goes over problems EXACTLY like they appear on the tests. Pay attention, take notes, ask questions."
1447,762600,4.0,1.0,Mr. Hunt is a great teacher. He's kind of quiet but super helpful if you need it. There were many times when he'd stay after class if anyone needed help. Just do the practice tests and you'll be fine for the exams. GREAT TEACHER!
1448,762600,1.5,4.0,he sucks. i have never been in more boring class. all you do is listen to him lecture then do a bunch of hawkes. easy math only if you pay attn in class but its so boring no one goes. hawkes is hard..not the same as what he teaches in class.
1449,762600,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Hunt is a great teacher. He is pretty shy, but he is so helpful. He stayed after numerous times and wouldn't move on until everyone understood the lesson. The best math teacher I've ever had!"
1450,762600,4.0,2.0,"not a hard class, get to know him and he will help you out."
1451,762600,4.5,3.0,No Comments
1452,2226929,5.0,1.0,"BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!! Literally so easy, I cannot recommend him enough.  "
1453,2226929,5.0,1.0,Easy class. Doesnt take attendance so you can literally just get notes from other people to study for the tests. The first test quite literally covers mean median and mode. He does a great job at simplifying the harder stuff though. Take him if you want an easy A.
1454,2226929,3.0,3.0,"He's a good professor. I will say that I studied the test reviews he gave us for two tests. However, when I got to the tests it was NOTHING like the reviews. I still feel betrayed. Just go to class. Make sure you do well on all the tests and remember that you still have a drop test. 7/10 would take him over McGinness."
1455,2226929,5.0,1.0,Very easy class. Straight to the point lessons. He is also full of jokes!!!
1456,2226929,5.0,1.0,"He is such a nice and fun teacher! Cares about his students. Show up to class, take notes, and you will pass. Notes are straight forward. Study notes and study guides and you will do well on tests. Attendance isn't mandatory but you will not pass if you don't go. Textbook is not needed either."
1457,2226929,4.0,1.0,"Easy. No attendance and class it out of total points (5 tests). Gives study guides that are exactly like the tests. At least go on review days before the test and you should be fine. Very good professor who gets straight the the point and almost always out of class in 30 min, never stay the whole time!"
1458,2743028,1.0,5.0,"this was by far my worst teacher. He fails to explain rubric criteria in a fashion that is understandable and will outright stop what he is doing and get side tracked. He will rarely give you an explanation that makes sense and will always say ""does that make sense"", with most of the class saying no. highly recommend never taking him."
1459,2743028,1.0,3.0,So passive
1460,2743028,1.0,4.0,Supposed to be an easy class. Super strict on masks (threatened campus security if it fell below nose). Not allowed to drink water in class. Very confusing teacher overall- the more I payed attention the more confused I would get. When the class collectively tells him he's not making any sense he gets mad. Was always late. I could go on and on
1461,2226930,3.0,4.0,"Heavy readings before every class, which is frustrating when you have a heavy course load and no time to sit and read a book. Doesn't use blackboard, so you can't see your grades for participation, attendance, etc, and the only way to guess how you're doing through the semester is the 3 papers. The final is also worth 40% of your grade. "
1462,2226930,3.0,3.0,"She is not bad, but her grading is kinda harsh and she uses the +/- grading scale. I was never given higher than a 92-93 on a paper even though I fulfilled all requirements and she said they were great, so that made it nearly impossible to get an A over an A-. Also, the final project is worth 35% of your grade so its hard to know how you're doing."
1463,1645307,3.0,5.0,"Helps you review papers, gives you low grades. Impossible to make a B. Has a habit of giving 69s and 79s, never that extra point. Nothing is worth the extra point."
1464,373505,1.0,5.0,I would rate 0 if it would let me. The worst professor at this University expect him to be rude in emails and not answer at all and you will be blindsided on every test about half of the class fails each semester
1465,373505,5.0,4.0,"Okay Dr. Robinson is difficult, but if you actually go to class and study pulling out a good grade isn't so difficult. Dr. Robinson is a great lecturer and is very willing to help if you go to see him in his office. This is one class where I actually left feeling like I learned something."
1466,373505,2.0,5.0,Lectures are BORING AF and he's just difficult to deal with overall. The class is crazy hard for no reason
1467,373505,4.0,4.0,"I will not lie and say his class was easy, but he is the absolute best teacher I have ever had. I loved that class so much. I learned more from him than any other in college and he kept my attention the entire time. I actually looked forward to his lectures. However, he is very challenging. He forces you to learn. If you don't, you'll fail. Easily "
1468,373505,2.0,4.0,His test were pretty hard and often times the multiple choice questions or answers would be to vague for me to know much answer to mark. If you disagree with a question on the test that he marked wrong you have to fill out an appeal to him and he rarely gives points back even if you have solid reasoning on why you marked an answer.
1469,373505,2.0,5.0,test are ridiculously hard. gives no partial credit. only 3 tests and one final. there are no other grades given. class is mandatory. 5 points are taken off final grade every time you miss a class.
1470,373505,5.0,5.0,Hard teacher but you will learn alot.  Tape recording his lectures will help alot.

1472,373505,2.0,5.0,he sucks  bad tests are hard as crap do not take him get out while you still can
1473,1839878,5.0,2.0,Super easy class with not many papers 
1474,1839878,5.0,1.0,Lectures can drag and he can ramble on but an easy class. Only 2 tests and a few papers the entire duration of the class. Super nice guy and very understanding. 
1475,1839878,5.0,1.0,The GOAT
1476,1839878,5.0,2.0,"he's awesome!! so chill, super easy grader, its really hard not to get an A in his class and he really doesn't care if you don't show up to class. You only have like 3 papers the whole semester and he is just an absolute gem. I would take him every semester if I could."
1477,1839878,4.0,2.0,"Very laid back and understanding. Lectures can drag on a little without much structure, but an easy 101 class that will improve your writing. Great guy that makes class fun."
1478,1839878,5.0,1.0,Very understanding about missing class and not getting homework in on time. My favorite professor all semester. Very laid back and resourceful. Would recommend to all incoming freshmen.
1479,1839878,4.0,2.0,This teacher is very laid back and easy to talk to. When I got COVID and wasn't able to go to class in person he made all resources VERY accessible and did a one-on-one Zoom call with me to catch me back up. I would recommend taking this course 100%.
1480,1839878,5.0,1.0,Super laid back and is willing to help you if needed. If you stay on top of the journals and papers you should be fine.
1481,1839878,4.0,2.0,"Pretty much your normal 101 class, he's a good lecturer and helps if you to write a good essay."
1482,1839878,3.5,2.0,"I enjoyed his class.  His lectures can be a little long and dry, but he is helpful.  The class is relatively easy, but I still feel like I learned from it."
1483,1839878,3.5,2.0,Professor McGinn is a very easy teacher. He mainly lectures about readings which are the only assignments besides the essays. All assignments are done out of class and the only quizzes there are are from the readings which are only 5 questions long.
1484,1839885,2.0,1.0,She is easy but she is just so boring. So many videos. Her test can get oddly specific though so pay attention. Does not seem passionate about what she does at all.
1485,1839885,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Robinson is awesome and keeps class very interesting. She requires class participation, and many of the grades are based off of talking about your assignment. She has 2 online, in-class quizzes that are easy. Everything else is project based. She gives excellent feedback, so getting A's on these assignments is easy. DONT SKIP CLASS"
1486,1839885,3.5,2.0,"Ms. Robinson is a pretty good professor. Her lectures follow along with the textbook precisely. She lectures off of PowerPoints and moves fast, making it hard to take notes (bring a laptop). Quizzes are once a week and don't require much studying. Projects, you'll get a 100% if you follow the criteria. It's basically a high school Marketing 1 class"
1487,1002258,2.5,5.0,Makes you do a ton of work. Not an easy a
1488,1002258,2.5,1.0,"i went into this class thinking it would be an easy A, and the **** made me do work!"
1489,1002258,4.0,4.0,"Excellent knowledge and expereince, dedicated, willing to explain and clarify.  Class was a bugger- research and stats.  Made data analyses interesting."
1490,1002258,5.0,3.0,"A truly &quot;righteous dude&quot;.  Teaches by example, not just textbook."
1491,2691863,5.0,1.0,Has weekly quizzes - but all open note and book. All quizzes/tests are open note but timed. Homework is minimal and fairly easy. Posts powerpoints of the lectures and attendance is not mandatory I think but I would show up anyway as he is an interesting professor and not boring.
1492,2691863,1.0,4.0,He #sucks don't take this unless you want weird due dates and him deleting assignments before they are due!
1493,1841944,1.0,4.0,"guy grades every single piece of work you do for his class based on your groups peer review, even the proctored tests that were taken individually. dropped me from an A to a B after the final because of a peer review. tests are also 100 question/1 hour"
1494,1841944,1.0,3.0,Just do not take him
1495,1841944,3.0,2.0,"Lectures for the entire class. Not good at responding to questions in class or by email. Tests are similar to speed flashcards, you have one hour for a 100 questions test. Group work was decent. The guy is honestly pretty funny though."
1496,1841944,1.0,4.0,"Not real specific, and does not teach the things on the test"
1497,1841944,4.0,3.0,"Class is super boring but over the course of the semester I ended up liking professor frink. He's a really nice guy and actually cares about HR. Some people complain about the group quizzes and group work, but it really helps your grade out because the tests are pretty hard. I had no clue what I was doing in this class and still managed to get B."
1498,1841944,1.0,4.0,"Horrible teacher, very spiteful, rarely follows his own rules on his syllabus, quizzes every day for participation. his tests are hard unless you have test banks, even then you won't get over a 75. Cool dude, bad teacher."
1499,1841944,5.0,3.0,He uses group work but is a great teacher
1500,987930,1.0,5.0,"She's not helpful at all, never organized and takes forever to give anything graded back to you n the year long group project is a complete joke"
1501,987930,1.0,5.0,"She doesn't really listen to students. When you ask a question she will just reiterate what you already found confusing until you get too frustrated to get clarification. I once saw a kid get so angry with her he almost got up and walked out of class. Very arrogant, never been in business."
1502,987930,1.0,4.0,"She is has no understanding of the business world. For a communication teacher, she doesn't know how to communicate. She is rude. And she is not helpful even when you go out of your way to ask questions. The class work doesn't even correlate with the test. She is also very moody with grading. Do not take her! "
1503,987930,4.0,3.0,"She's a decent teacher but can be rude sometimes. I was in her only class on MondayWednesdayFriday so she made us stay the full 50 minutes every time because ""it was a waste of hair and makeup for her"". She will help if you need it, but she could have kept some of her comments like that to herself."
1504,987930,1.0,5.0,"Ms. Davis is bar none the worst teacher I have ever had. She has little knowledge of the business world, yet is arrogant enough to believe that she is some omnipotent goddess of business communications. She successfully turns what should be an easy class into a difficult one by assigning work that has little to do with the tests given. DO NOT TAKE!"
1505,987930,2.0,5.0,"Worst professor I have ever had. She is a nightmare to work with. She contradicts herself and the book constantly. She refuses to admit when she is wrong. Her tests include lots of questions that as which of the multiple choice answers are the ""best"" which makes them unnecessarily difficult. Avoid her at all costs. "
1506,987930,2.0,5.0,This Woman is absolutely insane! She has no idea what the real world is like. Busy work during every class. She has this idealistic view of how businesses work and yet she's been an educator her whole life. Thought it would be a very simple class and it turns out she is a complete nightmare of a teacher. Be warned and stay away.
1507,987930,3.0,5.0,Professor Davis seems to have a consistent record of turning a puff class into a nightmare ordeal. She gave a group a 0 for incorrect citation on a report which made up 25 percent of the total average. The most important lesson business communications taught me was how to fill out busy work while at the same time dealing with a overbearing teacher whose self image and sense of worth is beyond overinflated
1508,987930,4.0,3.0,"She's pretty intimidating but she's actually nice. She tries to make the class harder than it needs to be. It's one of those classes you think will be a GPA booster, but you actually have to work for your grade. Lots of busy work too."
1509,987930,5.0,2.0,shes a great teacher super sweet. just go to class and you will be fine
1510,987930,3.0,2.0,Comes across as a nice caring person. BE WARNED!! She nitpicks at everything and does not take students circumsntances into consideration. Good at turning a pointless requirement class into a painful GPA hurter.
1511,449308,3.0,4.0,"D'Surney is a really nice guy. He comes off as being kind of arrogant in class, but if you talk to him before/after or in office hours, he's really nice. He really knows what he's talking about. The class is difficult, but it would be with any professor. I didn't like him at first, but he's grown on me."
1512,449308,1.0,5.0,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROFESSOR... I'M PRE MED MADE A'S AND B'S UNTIL THIS CLASS IN MY JUNIOR YEAR...  I HAVE NEVER STUDIED SO HARD AND NOT COME OUT WITH A GOOD GRADE..  THIS GUY DOESN'T TEACH... YOU WOULD BE JUST AS GOOD BUYING THE BOOK AND STAYING AT HOME TO READ IT.. LECTURES ARE POINTLESS AND UNHELPFUL...  THE TESTS ARE DO NOT TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1513,449308,1.5,5.0,This teacher is seriously the worst teacher I have ever had in my college career. He is a complete jerk and doesn't care about his students. The first day of class he said Welcome to Hell. He makes it clear if he doesn't like you he will fail you. I took a diff teacher and received a B easily. This shows his unfairness. Both classes were = hard.
1514,449308,1.0,4.0,This man has no soul.  I still have nightmares about him.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
1515,449308,4.5,5.0,"Everyone on here is an idiot.  I only had to take the class once.  The grade you make on your final is your grade in the class.  All you have to do is get a study for the final.  I had a D and I ended up with an A, because I made an A on the final.  Plus, he's a good teacher.  Just because the class is hard, don't knock the prof."
1516,449308,1.0,5.0,"Is this guy still alive&#63;  Took him back in the late 90s, and he sucked then as well."

1520,449308,2.0,5.0,The average student has to take this class twice to get a satisfactory grade.
1521,449308,2.0,5.0,he is CRAZY!!!!
1522,449309,5.0,3.0,Most of the people on here leaving negative comments are just dumb-asses that failed the class. It's basically this guys duty to weed out about half the class- because not everyone should be a doctor! In hindsight this was a really good intro to biology class.
1523,449309,3.5,4.0,"Not so much a hard professor as it is a hard class because it's a pre-med class and it's meant to be a weedout and give a LOT of info at once.  Take notes, record lectures, study old tests to reimburse the big concepts, and know all the important (and even some nitty picky) concepts.  Lago knows his stuff and if you put in effort you'll learn a lot"
1524,449309,2.0,5.0,Horrible professor! Never understood a thing he said. He made me fall asleep in class and i sat in the front! Tape recorder would be a good investment for his class. Never miss a class. Take good notes. Read the chapters and ask him questions. Really geeky! Likes to weed out the weaklings
1525,449309,2.5,5.0,"I found the class boring. It has helped me in upper level biology class so it's a good thing to pay attention. I found it annoying that we &quot;never had enough time&quot; to cover material for the exam, yet we were constantly being told cheesy stories. Exams are tricky. Study small small details."
1526,449309,2.0,2.0,He taught a class on bugs.  Never fails to surpise me that all these environmental do gooders make grown men and women do a bug collection.  Why don't we do a bird collection while we're at it&#63;  Or maybe would could pin up all of the Tiger Swallow Tails we see for a summer so there aren't any next summer.  We've seen bugs before.
1527,449309,1.0,5.0,Gets off on bugs.  Horrible tennis player.

READ the text book!!! I don't think i've ever really read text books, but you really need to in this class. Good luck!"

1534,449311,3.0,4.0,If you do not attend class you will not pass. Her lectures are a majority of the test so it is imperative to take notes on her slides and what she says. This is not a class that you can miss or you will get very behind. Usually only 2-4 assignments a week and majority of them are credit no credit.
1535,449311,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Goulet is my favorite professor ever! She truly is incredible. I am a junior, and this was my favorite class of not only my semester, but of my college career! The class was fascinating, but Dr. Goulet really is a fountain of information. Make sure to go to office hours, ask questions after class, and go to exam reviews."
1536,449311,1.0,3.0,"Heads up - you're going to take everything via little devices called ""clickers"" - tests, quizzes, you name it. Absolutely hated using these, because you had no control over whether or not your clicker decided to input answers incorrectly. If she ditched the technology and graded like a normal professor, then I would have given her an average score."
1537,449311,2.0,4.0,Boring and unhelpful lectures are accompanied by impossible tests
1538,449311,5.0,3.0,"I had Dr. Goulet in 2009 for Symbiosis.  It was the first year the class was offered, and we all enjoyed it thoroughly. I recommend her and this class to all biology students."
1539,449311,1.0,5.0,"Avoid, avoid, avoid. The class is crazy hard and will smash your GPA! He doesn't care if you do well, and the lectures aren't helpful at all"
1540,449311,1.5,5.0,She was very rude and confusing when you asked her to explain something. 
1541,449311,3.5,3.0,"She's very knowledgeable about her subject and she's really good at explaining it. She doesn't try and cram you with a whole bunch of superfluous notes, and her tests come directly from the notes and the book! I would highly recommend studying though!"
1542,449311,1.5,5.0,she doesnt put anything she tells you that is going to be on the test actually on the test.
1543,449311,1.5,4.0,"Extremely difficult class considering it is for non-bio majors.  I feel that she purposely made the class way more difficult than it should have been.  Her notes are extremely confusing and choppy, and some of the questions on the tests have literally nothing to do with what we are covering in class. "
1544,449311,4.5,1.0,"Dr. Goulet taught one of the most interesting classes I have taken thusfar at Ole Miss. I thoroughly enjoyed class every day. The tests were very, very easy. She encouraged group discussion every day. I would definitely take any other class she teaches!"
1545,449311,3.0,4.0,"She is very interested in her subject, but she is so boring.  The lecture is boring and hard to take notes.  The test are awful. Some of the questions are not even relevant to the chapter. When I asked for her she sent me to the TA. She will not help you."
1546,449311,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Goulet does not come across as careless about her students as many said before, but her class is very hard. Her lectures are terrible and her notes are very choppy. She does not provide study guides and is very unclear about the info on tests. Attendance is mandatory to receive daily credit as well. Overall, an extremly boring teacher."
1547,449311,1.5,4.0,Doesn't care about students and makes tests on things that weren't completely covered in notes. Go over book a ton before tests. Gives some extra credit.
1548,449311,5.0,3.0,I had a TA for my lab! The lab is long but the lab is every other week. The TA's are wonderful. Study for the quiz (maybe 30 min at most) and do the homework/worksheet in class and you have an A!
1549,449311,5.0,3.0,Dr. Goulet is very invested in the success of her students so as long as they are willing to work hard. She is very willing to explain things and take time out of her very busy life to increase understanding. I would recommend taking her class if only for the writing aspect as I increased my writing skill thanks to her class.
1550,449311,1.5,5.0,"horrible teacher, makes me happy to be leaving ole miss, can't believe the school would hire a teacher that would let so many fail, also makes you feel incredibly stupid during horrible office hours"
1551,449311,2.0,5.0,"AWFUL teacher.  She doesn't give a crap about you.  Quiz everyday using the clicker things.  Find another teacher.  Also, make sure you don't get her husband."

1556,1663785,2.0,4.0,"If math is your world and or you can teach yourself this is your man. I only missed two classes, but found his class lectures useless and boring. He reports attendance to justify how many people do poorly in his class."
1557,2497322,5.0,3.0,"I'm in love w this professor, not in a romantic way but in a way where I would give him my soul if I could bc he deserves it. First class I took w him I thought &quot;wow this is so great, this feels like therapy, I should be paying for this&quot; took me a second to remember that I am paying thousands of dollars for this."
1558,2147116,5.0,1.0,awesome teacher. tells you what will be on the test with great study guides. easy A if you study. you have one project that he gives 100 on as long as you do it. great guy and funny
1559,2120496,5.0,3.0,She is a great teacher and actually answers the questions asked. Give extra credit. don't miss her class tho since tests are lecture based.
1560,2120496,5.0,2.0,"I need more than 350 characters to talk about how AMAZING she is. Best class i've taken thus far. She's fun, energetic, passionate, and completely understanding. I don't understand the whole &quot;she's biased&quot; thing. IF you leave any prejudices at the door and open your mind, she will have no problem with your views. I'm so glad I took her class."
1561,2120496,3.0,3.0,You need to put in the work but shes a good teacher and is entertaining during class
1562,2120496,5.0,1.0,You need to participate in class.
1563,2120496,1.0,4.0,Never again. Heavily biased. No one takes her seriously because she cant be fair and balanced. Actually punishes students for speaking against her views in class. Avoid at all cost.
1564,2526002,3.0,5.0,"(For FIN351-didnt give the option) Charles is very nice, helpful, knowledgable, and responds to emails quickly. But his lectures are very difficult to understand- constant backtracking, using abbreviations without explaining, etc. Tests are awful- 20-30 single spaced pages of notes and dozens of formulas. Good guy, okay teacher, impossible class.  "
1565,2526002,3.0,4.0,"If you struggled in accounting, be ready to struggle again. It is a difficult class and there is no time to fall behind. He does a good job in teaching but makes a lot of simple mistakes when making homeworks or in his lecture videos."
1566,2399030,2.0,2.0,She teaches from a projector so get ready for some 6th flashbacks
1567,2399030,3.0,2.0,shes chill but older style of teaching.
1568,1823545,5.0,2.0,"I really loved this class. He's witty and his lectures were rarely dull. I didn't have much of an interest in media law before I took this course, but I am now. After taking this class I decided to take more law classes and even changed my minor to legal studies. Thanks, Charlie!"
1569,1823546,5.0,4.0,"Amazing teacher! He really cares about the material and does a great job teaching about the inequalities in education. This class involves a lot of writing (short answer tests/essays), but it is worth it. He's also very accommodating if you are struggling in the class. As long as you are trying, he will work with you! He practices what he preaches."
1570,1823546,5.0,4.0,"I love love love Dr. Nylander, I can not say enough good things. His class is always so interesting and I catch myself applying what I learned to conversations outside of class. His class is lecture-heavy with few essays, no extra credit. He's very attentive: one time he stopped class because he felt like we were too stressed/tired from exams."
1571,1823546,5.0,4.0,"I highly recommend taking Dr. Nylander for any class! Although I didn't get the grade I wanted, he's a great great great professor who genuinely cares about his students. He is super fair and makes class interesting. If you take him you won't regret it. He also lets you argue for a better grade (which is super cool)."
1572,1823546,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Nylander was a great teacher for my Soc 101 class. His lectures were engaging and interesting. Not only did he take the time to get to know his students, but he genuinely cares about them and is understanding and willing to work with you. This was his first year so he's still getting the hang of blackboard and stuff, but he'll figure it out"
1573,1807173,5.0,3.0,"Professor Yenter is the best! He truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. You need to participate and prepare for class to get the most out of it! If you do this, youll be fine."
1574,1807173,5.0,4.0,Great guy ole miss is glad to have him. Go to his office and he will make you feel really comfortable asking questions if you didnt understand something
1575,1807173,3.5,4.0,you have to work hard and read and go to class to do well
1576,2140998,1.0,5.0,"Absolute worst teacher I've ever had. She wants everyone to write to her liberal views, and if you differ she will give you a bad grade. She is extremely unorganized and has no clue how to run a class. She has favorites, and definitely name grades. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."
1577,2140998,1.0,1.0,"Do not take this teacher. Unorganized. Turn in all of your assignments five times, because she'll ignore your first four emails. She never sets a deadline for anything, and then she'll tell you you're late. EXTREMELY biased. Never available out of class--she requires you to come to office hours and then cancels them. Makes excuses for herself."
1578,2011975,1.0,4.0,"If you experience technical issues with Blackboard, then do not expect any assistance from her.  Her version of teaching is assigning reading and videos.  She does very little of the instruction.  "

1582,2292558,1.0,5.0,"Terrible professor, would not recommend taking. Expects an ungodly amount of work for a 101 class to the point to where I changed my major for Jour to IMC just because she ruined it for me."
1583,2292558,2.0,4.0,THIS CLASS WAS TOO MUCH FOR AN ONLINE CLASS. Like I had to watch hours of videos and read stuff. But the exams weren't that bad.
1584,2292558,4.0,4.0,"If you apply yourself in this class, you will pass. It is an easy A if you put in the work. She also responds to emails/questions quickly."
1585,2292558,1.0,3.0,No. Dont take her.
1586,2292558,2.0,2.0,There is a lot of writing that goes into this class. Discussion posts each week that is 400 words. Grades pretty tough and does not put due dates on most stuff I had to ask her a lot of questions that I felt should have been already mentioned in directions.
1587,2292558,3.0,2.0,She can be tough if you dont follow her rules. Most of her assignments a pretty straight forward. Can be at times a tough grader but pretty easy and laid back teacher she just expects a lot. She gives out a weekly assignment a quiz for each week.
1588,2292558,5.0,2.0,"Okay, so her in class lectures are usually spent re-explaining the assignments she's give you, but the work you do for her class is none the less actual journalism. Sure it might just go on Oxford Stories, but hey it makes you get out there and do some stuff. I had her for 102 &amp; 271 and she really does care about and will work with her students."
1589,2292558,2.0,4.0,"Expect due dates to change. She does not stay on schedule and changes the assignments regularly with almost no warning. She acts like she is particular about details and will give you a 50 if you miss anything from your projects because it is only &quot;half done&quot;, yet her website is riddled with errors."
1590,1919837,1.0,3.0,Don't go down this road. Take Mattern.
1591,1919837,2.0,5.0,"This professor was very unclear in his expectations. While it is true that most questions are similar to those found in the book, he takes very specific questions that are not very relevant to the material. He can also be very rude during office hours and gets angry quickly."
1592,1919837,4.0,5.0,Great professor. Youll get out what you put in. Dont expect Free points.
1593,1919837,5.0,4.0,"His complete understanding of the world of Chemistry and how to teach it simply, taking a complex subject and make it understandable! Wish my advanced math professor had his talents."
1594,1919837,5.0,5.0,Great professor but course is challenging. Rumor is there will no longer be extra credit given in his course.
1595,1919837,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Delcamp had the same mentality as his Chem 221 with his 222 class. That is, his test questions come straight from the book. Even with Orgo 2 being a challenging course, Dr. Delcamp explained the books concepts very well, and my resulting grade does not reflect his teaching ability but speaks to the difficulty of the course and its material. "
1596,1919837,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Delcamp may ""have taught straight from the book"" but with concepts as complex as Elementary Organic Chemistry, the books examples were spoken in ""plain english"" and became much more tolerable. He highly encouraged reading the sections before lectures, and sadly I did not pick up on how useful this was until Chem 222 with Delcamp, but it helps. "
1597,1919837,4.5,3.0,"For this being one of the hardest pre-req courses at the university, Delcamp does his best to keep the class up to par and understand the material.  He's wicked funny and tries to keep the difficult class as light-hearted as possible. Very easy to understand and always has homework recitations to help."
1598,2204511,5.0,2.0,One of the best and most personable professors I've ever had. She is very caring for her students and passionate about her job.
1599,2204511,5.0,3.0,"Yelena is a really great teacher, and makes sure you understand what she is teaching. She won't put anything on her exam that she has not taught you in class."
1600,2204511,4.0,3.0,Was very specific in using examples
1601,2204511,4.0,2.0,Ms. Yelena is a great teacher for it to only have been her first time teaching. Lectures are sometimes boring but she makes sure she throws in a couple jokes related to lecture to keep us interested. The only negative thing I would say is she goes a little fast with PowerPoint slides so pay close attention other than that she's GREAT!
1602,2204511,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher, would highly recommend. Makes lectures easy to understand and relateable,"
1603,2204511,5.0,3.0,Lots of memes in the slides
1604,2204511,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed taking this class, I learned so much and you're a great teacher."
1605,2204511,5.0,4.0,Very helpful and easy to related and listen too Makes lessons and topics interesting
1606,2290530,2.0,3.0,"For college algebra, everything is on hawkes, an online math program where you do all of the tests and homework. In class, Hill assumes that students have more prior knowledge than they actually do, and when students ask questions, he is not always the best at answering them."
1607,2290530,3.0,2.0,Everything you can learn online. Very easy class just do all your homework online. Practice tests are uploaded for extra credit which is very helpful before tests! Ask him questions in class he knows his stuff but will just assume everyone understands unless you ask questions.
1608,2243434,3.0,4.0,"Although Professor Estes is difficult, if you come to class and do what is asked, you will succeed. She uses AP style writing, so familiarize yourself with that. She is willing to help and will definitely give you constructive criticism, but she can sometimes be condescending. Listen to her feedback, though, and you will do well."
1609,2243434,1.0,5.0,"She is extremely passive aggressive towards everybody. Even when the librarian came in to talk to us, it felt awkward because she made remarks that were kind of rude towards him. I just got my first essay back after almost a month, and got a 65 with stupid reasoning all over it. You cannot use your own writing style in this class, it will hurt you."
1610,2243434,1.0,4.0,The worst professor I’ve ever had at ole miss. She is hateful and doesn’t care about her students except to treat them poorly. 
1611,2243434,1.0,4.0,"I would highly recommend never taking a class from this professor. For starters, she is very rude and quite spiteful for whatever reason. On the other hand, she is not only a tough grader but an extremely subjective one as well. She will call you out in class for zero reason and won't even respond to emails unless formatted PERFECTLY 0/10 reccomend"
1612,2243434,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I have ever had. The class was enjoyable and I learned a lot however the professor made it near impossible to get above a C. She graded harshly, for example if you had size 14 font instead of size 12, it was an automatic fail. Along with many other instances such as those. Do not recommend this professor, you will get screwed over."
1613,2243434,1.0,5.0,"IMC 205 would have been a much more enjoyable, easy-going course if it wasn't for the professor. Her expectations are almost unreachable and she doesn't seem to ever be pleased with anyone's work. I believe in constructive criticism, but there was hardly any positive reinforcement. Highly recommend a different professor."
1614,2243434,1.0,3.0,this teacher was awful took sides in an obvious manner and made it clear who she was going to be easy on and hard on from the start. DO NOT RECOMMEND TAKING THIS CLASS GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN.
1615,1649514,4.0,3.0,"I found fletcher an easy choice. Many think low level history teachers should be easier, but class was typically interesting and fun. His assignments are very clear, but there arent many of them. Take really good notes the whole time and never skip a day and you will be set to prepare for all 5 assignments/tests. highly recc. to good note takers."
1616,1649514,1.0,5.0,Lectures are long and boring. Do not take him if you want to pass this class. There is so much reading and none of it relates to class. He is a very tough grader and in class is so repetitive that it is tiring. There is so much reading to sort through that it is almost impossible to retain any of it for tests. Papers are long and pointless.
1617,1649514,1.0,5.0,"Terrible teacher. Horribly repetitive, lectures do not make any sense, spent 2 days lecturing on farming equipment and nothing else. His tests are written in the worst possible way and it's almost like he wants kids to do poorly. DO NOT take this class as a freshman and CERTAINLY do not take it if you hate history"
1618,1649514,1.0,4.0,"Not sure how he has a good rating. Not trying to be rude, but right to the point, one of the worst professors I have ever had. Get ready to take useless notes and write papers on Old English reading that are very lengthy and hard to read. The notes taken in class come in handy, for the one test you have on them. He fails over half of the class."
1619,1649514,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed History 331. Although he can be a difficult grader, it was the most interesting class I've taken. You get an absurd number of absences, but I didn't like missing class because the lecture was so interesting. It's two tests and one research paper, really isn't bad. I would recommend this class! Very nice man, willing to help."
1620,1649514,2.0,4.0,"Do not take this class. The lecture are long and boring. Only the midterm and final relate to the lecture material. You have to read 4 books (they don't even relate to the class), take 2 quizzes, and write 2 six page papers. He grades very strict. Its supposed to be a history class, not a writing/literature class."
1621,1649514,3.0,4.0,"While he is passionate about what he does, I think he is confused about this being a 100 level course. There are 2 book papers (8 pages each) you have to write with over 63 ""guidelines"". I've seen people FAIL good, solid papers because they weren't up to his frankly nonsense rules. This isn't an English/Writing class and I didn't sign up for one."
1622,1649514,3.0,4.0,you have to read 4 different books. you take a quiz on 2 and have to write a 6 page paper for each of the other 2 books. his lectures are horrible and boring. DON'T take him
1623,1649514,2.5,4.0,Wow this class has turned into a monster. The last day to withdraw was the first test in the class. So how can you determine to stay or go? Three weeks later and we still do not have our midterm grades. I've spent almost $100 dollars in the library just printing for his class. Wish I had never taken this class.
1624,1649514,2.0,3.0,"Be prepared to have 500 pages of reading a week, sometimes a little less. He does not use blackboard to post selected reading materials. So you have to check out stacks of course reserves and then make an ungodly amount of copies. This class seems less like history and more like gender studies. Not impressed so far."
1625,1649514,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher! Very enthusiastic!
1626,1649514,4.0,3.0,talks very fast. likes student participation.
1627,1649514,5.0,4.0,"HARD TEACHER He seemed pretty easy at first and is a great teacher but is difficult. You get exams, map quiz's, regular quiz's, and papers to do every other week. I enjoyed his lectures but his notes were hard to write because he jumped around. He allows many unexcused days but takes attendance every day! If you like history take him but he is hard"
1628,2202479,5.0,4.0,"participation isn't required, but it helps if you ask questions."
1629,2202479,5.0,4.0,Awesome professor
1630,2149232,5.0,5.0,she is sorta hard but worth it
1631,2149232,1.0,4.0,"If you are slightly bothered at all by the excessive use of ""um,"" do not take her. Excessive is an understatement- I have to try and actively not hear her in class. She uses a very unorganized system for class and lecture, nothing is ever very clear."
1632,2149232,2.0,5.0,"She covers way too much way too fast.  I took History 102 with her and it was more like History 400.  The tests were crazy hard, the lectures were pictures of art on the board and you had to just listen or write which is very difficult for a visual or kin-esthetic learner like me.  do. not. take."
1633,2149232,4.0,3.0,"Very, very intelligent. Although it is a 100 level class, I put in a lot of effort, more so than my 300 history classes and managed to only get a B, her TA's can be difficult graders. If you go to lecture and actually do the readings, you'll be fine. She's extremely passionate and a very nice person."
1634,897905,1.0,5.0,"Do not, choose this professor. He has an extremely thick accent, so it is hard to understand him. He forgot to tell us to start using scanners for attendance after he stopped taking it manually, and left the class with four unexcused absences. He is very rude. His tests and quizzes are different from lectures. You WILL have to teach yourself."
1635,897905,1.0,4.0,"Please do not take this class if you are just looking for a liberal arts credit. Professor Dor does not know how to use technology and is also afraid of paper. He is extremely rude to students, unhelpful, and condescending. His class has been one of my worst experiences."
1636,897905,1.0,4.0,"He talks in a thick accent about the most boring things all day long and does not know how to use any technology whatsoever. His powerpoint are random words in other languages all disorganized, so it is impossible to take good notes. Yet, he tests on the most random details. He doesn't know how to use Blackboard, so you never know what to do when."
1637,897905,1.0,5.0,"This professor is one of the most unorganized lecturers that I have ever had in my 4 years of college. He is racist, sexist, plays favoritism, and is absolutely impossible to deal with. Sadly if you are music ED it is a degree requirement. Just hoping the right people see this and can do something about it for the students"
1638,897905,2.0,5.0,"I did not care for this class or for George either. In addition to having very unclear expectations and unrealistic expectations from students, he had a very condescending demeanor. If you just need a Fine Arts credit, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."
1639,897905,2.0,3.0,"If you don't do the reading before class, it is very difficult to understand the content. He also tests on small details, so you have to study everything. He grades essays easy, but the tests are difficult."
1640,897905,2.0,4.0,"Way harder than you'd expect, make sure you read and go to class or ur gonna be in trouble"
1641,897905,3.0,2.0,"It will take you some time to get used to Dr. Dor's accent, but just pay close attention the first couple of weeks and you should have no problems. He can be a bit demanding if you're not that interested in the material. As far as taking notes - his lectures come straight from the book so just highlight or underline and you won't have to write much"
1642,897905,2.5,3.0,Dr. Dor is obviously passionate about music and it shows in his lectures. The only problem is that he may be too passionate for those students taking intro to satisfy a liberal arts credit. This class ain't just an easy A.
1643,897905,3.0,3.0,"I liked the instructor, but I wasn't interested in the material. I only took the class because it was required."
1644,2229104,1.0,5.0,she thinks were dumb very bad attitude
1645,2229104,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Rizzi is one of the most intelligent profs I've had. Even though it was a 9am class, I was always excited for her lectures. She's makes American history feel fresh by giving different historical perspectives. I almost considered switching my major to history because of her!"
1646,2229104,5.0,3.0,"A great professor, super understanding and caring, she truly wants you to succeed and do well :)"
1647,2229104,1.0,5.0,made me hate history. not a nice person. very rude.
1648,2229104,3.0,4.0,Strict on turning assignments in and late grades. Assignments have to be turned in exactly correct or you get major points off. Also her notes are powerpoint that are mostly pictures and she lectures fast. It is hard to get all of the information.
1649,2229104,5.0,4.0,Christine made history feel easy to me and I hate history. As long as you study and take good notes you can pass.
1650,2229104,5.0,4.0,"TAKE HER CLASS!!! She is an awesome teacher and an awesome person. She is super busy but always makes time for her students. Just make sure you actually go to class and take notes (if you do this, you will get an A). Her tests come straight from the notes she gives in class."
1651,1012599,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bussade is a great professor! She is caring, funny, and makes you want to learn the material. Take her!"
1652,1012599,5.0,4.0,"She is simply the best language professor ever! She explains well, is a fair grader and gives credit for when you try. "
1653,1012599,5.0,3.0,"Take her Portuguese class! She is smart, funny, and loves her job."
1654,1012599,5.0,3.0,Ms Bussade is the best language instructor I have ever had. She cares about all her students.
1655,1012599,5.0,2.0,WONDERFUL!!! BEST SPANISH TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD :)
1656,197495,3.0,5.0,Only a few grades and very difficult concepts. 
1657,197495,1.5,5.0,"This teacher was absolutely  the worst teacher i have ever had. My friends and I had him for 221 world literature and you could not understand a word he said. honestly, the class should not have been that hard. It was like taking a graduate class. i am sure he is a great graduate teacher but not a world lit teacher. trust me.  "
1658,197495,1.5,5.0,"In my opinion he is not organized and I cannot learn by the way he teaches.  Worst experience in my life at Ole Miss. I am not an English major, but this World Literature class does not have to be this difficult. After a month of turning in a midterm and a 5-6 page essay, I still have not received an average. I have no idea where I stand. Pitiful! "
1659,197495,4.0,3.0,Heyworth's British literature class uses books that are all sparknotable. I had a very good TA and thats honestly what the class is all about. Only 2 or 3 papers and a midterm and final.
1660,197495,5.0,4.0,"Heyworth is a FANTASTIC teacher. He makes uninteresting books become suddenly delightful by explaining them charismatically and with humor. There is never a dull moment. He is absolutely brilliant as well. Do not miss a chance to take him class. Even if you don't need it, take it. I can promise you won't regret it."
1661,197495,5.0,4.0,By far the best professor I've ever had. Makes every class interesting. He could make paint drying interesting
1662,197495,5.0,3.0,"English 225- VERY handsome. Class was fun, and I really enjoyed going, he is hilarious and inspiring. Sort of intimidating with two tests and two papers. But if you go to class, take this class. He's not an easy A if you don't attend lecture, but he is one of the few prof's at Ole Miss worth the tuition. Take him if you want a great experience."
1663,197495,5.0,5.0,great looks
1664,197495,5.0,3.0,"He is the most delightful man--young, brilliant, kind and passionate.   If his assigned reading doesn't inspire you (but it should, it's great), he certainly will."
1665,197495,5.0,3.0,Dr. Heyworth's accent haunts my dreams but in my worst nightmares I am playing him in trivial pursuit.  This class was amoungst the best I ever took in college.  The subject matter is wonderful and his passion is the stuff of fantasy.

1669,1760121,5.0,4.0,"By far one of the sweetest most caring professors I have ever, & will ever have. She truly cares about her students & their well being. Always came into class with a positive attitude & a smile on her face. She is amazing at explaining formulas & equations. I could not recommend a better professor for this class."
1670,1760121,5.0,3.0,"I may not have passed the class, but I fell in love process. She is the sweetest and most charming teacher I've ever had. Unfortunately, this angel teaches calculus. She's clearly very intelligent and will happily give detailed explanations when prompted."
1671,1760121,5.0,1.0,Awesome teacher. Very clear and made Calculus 1 a breeze.  Tests were straight forward and I was really prepared for the departmental final. Get her if you can!!
1672,1760121,5.0,2.0,Really nice lady explains things very well. Things on tests are from the study guide. Do the study guide and homework and you will be fine.
1673,1760121,5.0,2.0,Math 125. Great teacher. Explains the work really well!! Will help during office hours. Just do study guide and homework and you will pass.
1674,1760121,5.0,2.0,"Super sweet and very helpful. Although I dislike math, I didn't mind going to her class."
1675,1760119,5.0,2.0,"If you do your work, you'll pass. It is attendance mandatory, but it's really just one point taken off for every absence you have that's unexcused. All the work is online, and you can easily make an A without ever going to class. She is also very caring and very funny. If you have something come up, she is very understanding. 100% recommend. "
1676,1760119,5.0,1.0,"A super easy intro to sociology class, almost everyone takes this class. It was mostly online for us, due to her having some family issues. She would cancel almost every Friday when it was in person, and always let us out early. Easy A!"
1677,1760119,2.0,1.0,Not accepting at all. I did all of my assignments and kept up with all of my work for her class. My internet got kicked off during the storm and did not save my progress for three assignments and I begged her to reopen them to at least get half credit back. She does not care at all even if you work hard. So her class was my only B... thanks Lindley
1678,1760119,5.0,1.0,"She was a great professor. She would cancel class sometimes but the class was also not mandatory. We walked in on the first day and she said ""you can not come to class every day and still get an A"" She gives lots of opportunities for extra credit. "
1679,1760119,4.0,1.0,Her class was mostly online last semester due to family stuff. She usually lets out class early and just goes over a PowerPoint that has little to do with the actual test/homework. A fair amount of homework but it is always due like every 3 weeks. easy - just 10 question online quizzes and one free-response question that is a participation grade.
1680,1760119,5.0,1.0,This class could not be any easier. Lindley is chill and great. Def take this class.
1681,1760119,5.0,1.0,"That most amazing professor ever!!! So so easy!! She cancels class most Friday's if there is a home-game or big away games / she even cancels just because. All exams are online and very easy. Depending on grade level, attendance isn't important but she just goes over her powerpoints during class. She is seriously the best and easiest professor."
1682,1760119,3.0,2.0,"She's a good teacher and its an easy class, but she just so you know I had an 89.4 and she wouldn't round it at all even after I had gone to all her office hours etc. So if you take this class just know she will not help you!"
1683,1760119,5.0,2.0,I would recommend her to anyone who is going to take sociology. One of the most reasonable professors I have had. She is very understanding and easily accessible with any questions or concerns
1684,1760119,5.0,2.0,"She is really awesome!! The class is not hard and she is very understanding and approachable. She was really good about telling you exactly what will be on the tests, makes it easy to get an A if you put in a little effort. Highly recommend her to anyone!"
1685,1760119,5.0,2.0,"BEST PROFESSOR EVER. She is so nice and she is a wonderful teacher! I took her for Sociology 101 and I enjoyed it immensely. She has an attendance policy only because she has to, so the number of classes you're allowed to miss is pretty high. She does use the textbook but if you don't have it you won't crash and burn. I would recommend to anyone."
1686,1760119,5.0,1.0,Ms. Lindley is in the top tier of professors at Ole Miss. I took her SOC 101 class during Wintersession and it was the greatest class I have ever taken. She is very easy to understand and will go out of her way to get you an A if you deserve it!
1687,1760119,5.0,1.0,Nicest woman ever and super easy class. She'll jump through hoops for you. She's also hilarious. Take her class! You won't regret it!
1688,2276221,5.0,2.0,literally never went to class and ended with an A. take her
1689,2276221,5.0,1.0,"She is an amazing teacher, very easy to get a hold of and truly wants everyone to succeed. Her tests are super easy and the homework is super easy. Class is not mandatory but I recommend going just so you can keep up with homework assignments. All tests and quizzes can be found on quizlet!"
1690,2276221,5.0,1.0,"She is a funny down to earth teacher. Not a ton of work, and you get a ton of extra credit points just for coming to class. 10/10 if you have to take a science take her biology class for sure."
1691,2276221,5.0,4.0,"Eden Johnson is awesome! She's hilarious which makes her lectures easy to pay attention to. But, go to class because clicker questions count for a lot of points and do the homework. Her tests are kind of difficult, but her SI sessions help."
1692,2276221,5.0,3.0,A lot of online homework normally due every week. But she is super funny and somehow makes biology somewhat interesting. Definitely cares about her students. Tests are somewhat difficult. She doesn't post her power points so you have to show up to get the notes.
1693,2276221,5.0,4.0,"Eden Johnson is a fantastic teacher. I have always struggled with Biology, however, this is the first time I've actually understood science in my entire life. It is important that you go to class since she explains things in a way that is really easy to understand. Overall, highly recommend her."
1694,2276221,5.0,2.0,"I absolutely loved this class. SO interesting and she's very funny. The content can be tough, just the time and do all your homework and you will pass. Study groups or SI sessions could be really helpful for tests, I never went to any and still had an A. Love Eden!!"
1695,2276221,5.0,2.0,"Ms Johnson is a great teacher!! Very funny and cares about each individual student. She gives out a lot of bonus if you attend class and bring your clicker. If you attend class and do your homework, you will make an A"
1696,2276221,5.0,1.0,"No attendance policy, but if you show up and take notes and answer clicker questions, you'll get an A. She has awesome lectures and gives a ton of bonus points."
1697,2276221,4.0,3.0,"She's really great and I wish she taught 104. I was lucky to get a B- in Bio on high school but I have a 105% in bisc102. Her lectures are great and she really reinforces what you need to know for the test. So many opportunities for bonus points and extra credit. If you show up to class, do the clicker questions, and do the homework you'll do good."
1698,2276221,5.0,2.0,Do the online homework and have the notes from lectures and you'll get A. All test questions are from lectures. Lots of bonus points too.
1699,2597759,5.0,2.0,He made class super fun an easy! Truly cares about his students and wants to build relationships with each one! I highly recommend taking his class!
1700,2460542,1.0,4.0,he sucks big mumbler
1701,232321,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful person, extremely knowledgeable, and dedicated to her students. Well organized but flexible and willing to adapt to the needs of the production."
1702,232321,4.5,2.0,"I've taken a number of classes from Prof. Aubrey and have been working with her for more than a decade.  What she lacks in organization, she makes up for in knowledge, enthusiasm, and genuine care for her students.  People get caught up in her organization without realizing how amazingly intelligent she is.  She's a truly worthwhile professor."
1703,232321,5.0,3.0,"To tell you the truth, I was a little uncertain of doing an opera for the summer.  However, it was an awesome experience.  Mrs. Aubrey combined the original dialogue with current language and comedy.  The music was fun, and the plot was hilarious.  It was a stretch, but it really made my summer, and I hope to do it again next year!"
1704,232321,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher!  If you listen, don't act like you know everything, quit complaining, and grow up (unlike some of my peers), you will find that she is one of the best professors at the University, and one of the most informed in her field."
1705,232321,2.5,2.0,"Nicw woman, but let's just say you won't be missing anything if you skip this horribly unorganized and under rehearsed production.  She should really be embarassed."
1706,232321,1.0,1.0,the most unorganized and uneducated &quot;professor&quot; I have ever encountered.  Why she feels qualified to instruct the doctoral students is beyond me.  She clearly doesn't have a clue as to what she's doing.  Terrible.
1707,232321,1.0,1.0,Just awful.  She wastes a lot of time and the finished product looked real bad.  I was embarassed to be in this endeavor and I will not be doing it again!
1708,1555325,4.0,3.0,I had him at PVAMU for the second history. He's a really nice guy and if you build a relationship with him he will work with you. Lots of notes and they are kinda all over but he will help you no matter how much he tells you he won't if you show up.
1709,1555325,3.5,4.0,Dr. Robison was a little scatter-brained with the way he gave notes. To do well on tests you must read the book and outside readings that he puts on blackboard. He counts attendance and participation also. He's a really nice guy and he doesn't grade papers very hard. ALL tests were online although it was a lecture/classroom type class.
1710,1932167,4.0,1.0,"I took her for Psych 201. It was so easy, all the notes are online, and the quizzes and tests are a breeze. She is really willing to help and gives a lot of chances for extra credit."
1711,138120,5.0,1.0,"She is very nice and helpful. The online homework was a pain, but that is a departmental requirement. Show up and participate, even if you are wrong she will give you the point for trying."
1712,138120,4.0,2.0,At the college level its pretty hard to come across a professor thats not a native speaker which makes mrs sisson so great.  She is funny and nice and speaks spanish so you can understand her and explains a lot in english and doesnt just leave people confused.
1713,138120,4.5,1.0,"Spanish is hard for me but she made me actually understand it. She's very friendly and always willing to help students learn. Her classes are harder to get into because she's so good but if you can get her, make it a point to take Sisson for Spanish!"
1714,138120,5.0,1.0,She makes Spanish easy when it was IMPOSSIBLE for me before!  I owe her so much :)
1715,138120,4.5,3.0,"Talks too much about nonsense and keeps the class over time.  She is very nice, but frusterating to deal with."
1716,138120,5.0,2.0,Mrs. Sisson is AWESOME.  a pleasure to have her for a teacher.
1717,138120,5.0,3.0,great teacher very accessible
1718,138120,5.0,1.0,"Such a nice teacher, really entertaining and helpful."
1719,639887,4.5,2.0,Amazing!
1720,639887,5.0,3.0,AMAZING TEACHER. I'd recommend her to anyone

1722,138128,5.0,1.0,BE SURE TO TAKE THE SELF PACED CLASS. IT IS SO MUCH FUN AND YOU LEARN WAY MORE.
1723,138128,3.0,1.0,"If you take the time to study, its an easy A. It involves a lot  of studying, however it isn't to bad since you don't even go to class in the first place. It nice being able to do the whole class at your own pace."
1724,138128,5.0,1.0,TAKE THE SELF STUDY CLASS. IT IS SO MUCH FUN AND YOU LEARN ALOT AND FINISH EARLY JUST LIKE I DID :)THEN YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT FOR THE NEXT MONTH OF TWO.
1725,138128,3.0,1.0,"Super easy class, but boring; no lectures, no discussion, just reading and taking quizzes; easy way to get credit, but take something else if you are actually interested in the subject/you want more than just an easy A"

1728,138128,5.0,2.0,"Very intelligent, accessible, nice to students"
1729,2675601,2.0,5.0,Does not explain concepts well and gets upset when you do not understand. Very harsh and unfair grader.
1730,2675601,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sumali Conlon is an amazing prof, she has inspired me to another level! She is tough, but only to get you ready for the real world and push your intellectual boundaries to a new normal."
1731,2675601,5.0,2.0,"You need to go to class to be able to do the homework. Beyond that, one of the most caring and understanding teacher's I've had. I meet with her outside of class time to ask questions and she has always let me have an extension when I needed it. Homework is explained in class so very important to attend lectures."
1732,2722709,1.0,4.0,Just all in all a terrible professor. HIGHLY recommend not taking her for anything
1733,1635222,2.0,4.0,"I would not advise taking this professor if you want to pass your speech class. She does not explain assignments, but when you bring her your work she will criticize it and then not explain what needs to be corrected. I almost failed her class even though I did my assignments."
1734,1635222,1.0,4.0,"She literally is so bad at explaining things and answering questions. She'll make simple assignments way harder than they have to be. She'll make you feel small when you ask questions and like you weren't even paying attention. DON'T TAKE HER! but if you do, create a GroupMe. It saved us."
1735,1635222,4.0,4.0,Great teacher
1736,1635222,1.0,4.0,Don't take her. Period. She will ask you questions but make you feel stupid about your answer. She's just all around rude and unclear in her instructions. She doesn't prepare you well for speeches and will call you out in front of the class if you are nervous. 
1737,1635222,1.5,4.0,Worst Speech Teacher. Just take someone else.
1738,1635222,1.5,3.0,She isn't helpful to her students. She will make you feel dumb and she doesn't answer the question that is being asked. She'll say 2 other things but will not answer the question. Take her if you like to chance your grade because she doesn't prepare you well for any speech you give in her class.
1739,1635222,5.0,2.0,awsome!!!
1740,1635222,1.0,5.0,.
1741,914328,4.0,2.0,Mr. Rosenblatt officially retired.
1742,914328,4.5,2.0,"I highly recommend to take Mr. Rosenblatt for Political Science. He tries to make the class interesting. He is strict on attendance, but his test are very easy. He requires everyone to take a quiz every week. PRINT OFF THE QUIZ. The questions will be on the test. He is funny and knows that his class is boring so he tries to make it fun for everyone"
1743,914328,4.5,1.0,Easiest poltical science teacher. Loved him!
1744,914328,4.5,4.0,No Comments
1745,914328,4.5,1.0,Very interesting. Easy class. Take it.
1746,19353,4.0,2.0,"Cool prof.  Also used youtube to help at the beg. ""webster academy accounting""."
1747,19353,5.0,2.0,shes a wonderful teacher. she will make sure you understand everything
1748,19353,5.0,3.0,Excellent teacher. Very helpful and encouraging. If you do not do well in this class it is because lack of effort
1749,19353,5.0,3.0,Probably the easiest accounting teacher
1750,19353,5.0,3.0,"The ice breaking to accounting.  Suzanne does a great job teaching the text, and is somewhat liberal with homework.  The tests will get you, so you had better study.  Other than that show, cause the material covered in class is essential."

1752,19353,5.0,3.0,"don't get behind, and you'll be fine"

1754,19353,1.0,5.0,She's a cool prof with a hard ass class
1755,138139,4.0,4.0,Dr. Lake is very understanding and will do the best she can to make sure you succeed in her class. Her lectures are kind of boring but it's a good class to take.
1756,138139,1.0,1.0,"I've never hated going to class as much as I did this one, especially for such an easy A. She's insanely boring y'all."
1757,138139,2.5,3.0,"Easy class, but incredibly BORING!!"
1758,138139,4.0,4.0,"Family & Marriage. Sounds easy but she makes it complicated. Discussions in class are actually interesting though. Overall not a bad class, but be prepared to study."
1759,138139,4.0,1.0,"Excellent study guides, very knowledgeable, but the class is boring, needs spice"
1760,627615,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Bates is the most infltential professors I have ever taken.  He prooves that History can be just as sexy as either Math or Science.   I have taken him for five classes so far and I have  thoroughly enjoyed every one of his classes, he has become one of my role models for teaching History because of his passion for the subject."
1761,627615,5.0,4.0,"My favorite teacher ever. I take him for his extensive knowledge in US and Latin American relations. This man knows what he's talking about, and has a true appreciation for history. His appreciation is intoxicating. With my sites set on business in Latin America, I can truly testify that his classes have given me an upper hand in my job search."
1762,627615,5.0,4.0,Most influential teacher that I have ever had. He really makes history fun and you learn facts that you have never heard before. Toby illustrates a love for teaching and history. The class is not easy and will require focus and determination. I have graduated and would like to go back to school for one semester only to have him as my teacher again.
1763,627615,3.0,2.0,Great teacher! I felt like I learned a lot after taking his class. He really cares about his students and wants you to do well. Definitely go to every class...he loves people who take attendence seriously and he adds a lot of points to your final grade at the end. If I could take the class over again I would!
1764,627615,5.0,3.0,As smooth as Elvis....
1765,627615,4.5,5.0,He is an awesome professor but not easy. He makes the learning material interesting and fun. Be sure to take alot of notes in lecture because the exams are difficult.
1766,627615,5.0,4.0,he was awesome! he made it so easy to understand!
1767,627615,5.0,4.0,"He is a wonderful professor. you get study guides with 4 essays, 2 of which will be on the test. If you do one essay a day, using the book for help, you can get a high A out the course"
1768,627615,1.0,1.0,"horrible professor. the class is not hard so if you want an easy grade...take him, if you actually want to learn history...RUN!!!!!"
1769,627615,1.0,1.0,One of the worst history professors I have ever taken and I love history. he barely knows what he saying. Most of what he said was just WRONG!!!!!! Run if you truly love history.
1770,627615,5.0,2.0,He was totally cool. Kept me awake and on my toes at 8 am. I am NOT a morning person either :) I really enjoyed his love of teaching and wonderful personality. TAKE HIM
1771,627615,1.0,1.0,take this class for the theatrics.  no real history being taught hear.
1772,627615,5.0,4.0,"Very enjoyable class. Almost completely essay test format, but not too bad. He can make boring subjects not boring."
1773,627615,5.0,1.0,He makes leatning the material al ot of fun.  I his a great teacher
1774,627615,4.0,3.0,DONT TAKE IF YOURE SHY
1775,627617,5.0,3.0,Hands down best professor Ive had at Ole Miss. She is how every professor should be. She cares deeply about her students and is always open to questions or to help. 10/10 recommend
1776,627617,1.5,3.0,"She's so scattered and disorganized all the time. The grades on her projects are based on her opinions of your ""multicultural"" experience and not on some firm grading rubric"
1777,627617,1.0,1.0,Worst class ever!
1778,627617,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, take her as much as possible!!!"
1779,627617,2.5,2.0,I had her for my Liba 102 class which I expected to be pretty basic. I actually really enjoyed her class. She is a little disorganized and all over the place but it is part of her charm and personality. She is very easy to talk to but also expects you to talk a lot in class. Very cool person in general.
1780,627617,1.0,2.0,"Not helpful, hard to understand. Disorganized and not prepared for class. Doesn't seem interested in material or the students."
1781,627617,3.0,3.0,Really good at culture psychology but horrible at statistics.
1782,627617,3.0,1.0,Loves to call on students...but not a hard class.
1783,1932204,5.0,1.0,"Awesome Teacher. So entertaining in class and is very easy to get off track. If you don't want to do stuff, you could have him talking the entire period. Gives good feedback and is super caring."
1784,1932204,5.0,2.0,So quirky but awesome teacher
1785,1932204,5.0,3.0,"Great Instructor, readily gave aid to students who needed it. Kept class entertaining while informational."
1786,2401200,3.0,4.0,"This class is just vey hard in general, I wouldn't say she's a bad professor. She sent a lot of questions that are similar to the questions on the test out for us to study so it helped a lot."
1787,2401200,2.0,4.0,So so so many assignments quizzes and homework that it is a hassle to turn in. I failed because of how many assignments were due per week. She gave awesome study guides for the exams and I got an 88 on the final but failed the class because of the assignments. I don't recommend if you don't like Turing in 8 assignments that take over 5 hours to due
1788,2401200,2.0,4.0,Lots of reading and teaching yourself
1789,2401200,2.0,4.0,the information was easy to understand and apply but the test just seemed complete 180&deg; from the quizzes and homework
1790,2401200,1.0,4.0,the absolute worst professor i have ever had. DO NOT take this class if you aren't already good at economics because she is not going to teach you AT ALL. good luck if you're stuck with her.
1791,2401200,1.0,4.0,"I honestly don't know why she's listed as a professor for this course because she doesn't teach a single thing. Everything we learn is through a program made by McgrawHill-no content is hers. Several students have emailed her struggling with some concepts this semester and rather than teaching or giving advice, she told them to drop the class."
1792,2401200,4.0,4.0,"She's very nice and responds to emails quickly, but overall economics is hard. But not impossible to pass, I never got above a D on a test and still made a B in the class because there are many many many homework and quizzes in the course. I recommend"
1793,2401200,4.0,3.0,Class is outlined very clearly. No lectures just connect and learn smarts every week. Pretty easy if you just do your work.
1794,2409392,3.0,3.0,"Pretty good teacher, explained things weirdly. I took calc in high school so it was easy, but I think I would have been confused otherwise. If you've taken calc before this class should be a breeze. Lots of online quizzes, tests were straightforward. Not the best at explaining new concepts but still definitely a doable class."
1795,1954739,1.0,5.0,"The only class I didnt do well in this past semester. He does not have any grades except for tests and he doesnt take attendance, missing a day will have you discombobulated. Above all that, hes super obsessed with covid, which most normal people would rather go about their day without hearing about. Also advised us to get booster shots. 1/10"
1796,1954739,2.0,4.0,"the only things in his grade book are tests - tests which he doesn't tell you what to study and almost all the questions are not what he teaches. Taking this class is like setting yourself up for failure. The only good thing is he doesn't take attendance, but if you miss one day, you will be so lost."
1797,1954739,4.0,4.0,"Very cool guy and very clearly passionate about politics. Loved him as a teacher, he would always add 10+ points to tests which was great. On the other hand, there was a LOT of material to learn so 10/10 would recommend staying up to date on the reading."
1798,1954739,1.0,4.0,"Greg Love is definitely passionate about Latin American politics, but it is obvious that he would rather be in Latin America researching than teaching a class room. He simply regurgitates information at you the entirety of the class expecting you to learn what took him years to gather in the period of a couple months."
1799,2124721,1.0,4.0,"Horrible. Graded everything extremely hard and expected way too much out of a 100 level class. Worked so hard in this class when I'm usually an A student, and ended up with a low B. Do not take if you're trying to get a 4.0, she will ruin it for you."
1800,2124721,3.0,4.0,I would definitely agree with the other responses about her being very passionate and firm about her class. She goes in depth about all of the material and suggests that her students get into study groups outside of class. She does make the class a too hard to be a 100 level course but she is fair. If she see's that you're dedicated she will help u
1801,2124721,2.5,5.0,Just got out of this class. Don't take her. Please whatever you do. I worked my butt off and still did terrible. This class isn't worth using freshman forgiveness in but I have to now. Find an easier teacher!!!! History 106 shouldn't be hard but she made it hard. She's passionate about her job and history but very very hard.
1802,2124721,5.0,4.0,"She is actaully very into what she teaches and if you want help she will meet with you. But, she rules her class room with a dictators iron fist. She is very strict on rules do not play on your phone and do not do anything but take notes. Hard but fair teacher."
1803,2350005,1.0,5.0,He's a typical self righteous PhD flaunting English professor who thinks he knows everything. He does not work with you on anything and everything absolutely has to be his way. You basically have to memorize his exact views on everything to pass. You can't have opinions of your own about anything you learn. He tries to brainwash you.
1804,1635257,5.0,2.0,So sweet.  Try your best and act like you care. You will get an A
1805,1635258,3.0,4.0,The class included a lot of writing and during class she talked a lot and not all of it was necessary to help with the assignment. if you listen and go off the models she gives you will get good grades. after reading the past reviews i was scared for the class because i dont like writing but it honestly wasnt that difficult if you do the work
1806,1635258,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Bowers could be a good professor, but not for me. She didn't teach, you were just expected to know what to do. She is very condescending and has an entitled personality. She is very quick to place blame on you for not completely understanding assignments. She goes on tyrades to answer question instead of a simple yes/no. DO NOT RECOMMEND"
1807,1635258,5.0,4.0,"Had her last semester. This class has a bad reputation for being a lot of writing, and it was. Dr. Bowers was patient though and explained things a lot. she would go over drafts with you and spend hours if you needed it."
1808,1635258,2.0,4.0,"Took Proficiency in Writing (English 101). Tough grader, not enough feedback on how to fix things, makes you feel stupid. Worst/ hardest class I have taken so far. I am not the only student in the class that felt this way."
1809,1635258,4.5,3.0,Required course. 
1810,1635258,4.5,4.0,"Lots of writing but she will help you  do a lot of the work in class. She's friendly and not hard to look at,  either!  Kinda hard but pretty fair in grading."
1811,1635258,4.0,2.0,"I have her now and she is okay.. It seems like she thinks she knows more than she does. But hey, she's an easy grader so hotty toddy."
1812,2528187,1.0,5.0,Gregg Davidson is the worst professor at the University of Mississippi. He won't even let you look at your weekly quizzes to study for the exam until the DAY THE EXAM OPENS. Students have complained countless times about him but he is tenured so he gets away with everything. He never responds to emails nor do his tests cover the material in class.
1813,2528187,1.0,5.0,I cant express how bad this man is. Class averages never exceeded 75% and he never curved a single exam for us. He is the Dean of Geology so he makes his tests extremely hard. Every test is different so its luck of the draw and he will never respond to your emails. Worst professor at the university.
1814,2528187,1.0,5.0,"Quizzes are impossible. Questions are ridiculously hard, especially for an introductory course. All of my friends who have other professors say geology is really easy. DO NOT take it with Davidson. I know so many people besides myself who have dropped his class as well. Really annoyed and disappointed."
1815,2528187,1.0,5.0,I had to drop this class because of how difficult it was. I always emailed and asked questions and he was no help. Biggest waste of time and money.
1816,2528187,1.0,4.0,This class is so difficult and I have such a hard time understanding anything. I contacted the prof because I was struggling with the basics and he was absolutely no help. He didn't seem to care about students actually trying to understand the material. The exams are so hard and there are no other assignments to help you learn and study.
1817,2409401,5.0,2.0,"Easy class, straightforward notes and test, fairly interesting. McCook is clearly passionate about biology. Caring, approachable, and willing to help. She explained things well and very clearly. Very little hw. Thought it was an easy class but I took McCook for honors bisc 104, so it was a smaller class which might have made a difference."
1818,1264571,5.0,3.0,"He is great!  I've taken him for micro, macro, and stats II.  He is great and as long as you pay attention and take notes, you'll be good to go.  He is a really good guy, and I would definitely recommend taking his classes!  One of my fav professors I've ever had.  Take his classes!!!! :)))))))))))))))))"
1819,1264571,1.0,5.0,This is the worst professor I have ever had. His lectures are way too broad and are no help at all. If you want to succeed in this class you need to learn all of the material outside of class on your own. The homework is on mystatlab which is such a bad piece of software. The problems on that website are a lot different than the ones in class.
1820,1264571,4.0,3.0,he maps out exactly what you need to do to succeed in his class
1821,1264571,3.0,3.0,"Attendance is optional; however, bonus points are given if you attend class. Furthermore, he lectures from PowerPoints, and what he discusses in class are on the tests, so going to class is extremely helpful."
1822,1264571,5.0,3.0,"He's a great teacher. If you do the homework and show up to class it should be an easy class. He explains in class what will be on the class and how a problem would be worded. He really wants to make sure students understand the material, not just memorize formulas."
1823,1264571,4.5,2.0,"I don't know why these people gave him a bad review.  If you go to class and listen to what he says, it's an easy A.  His finals are always optional and are usually copy and paste from the previous tests.  However, he doesn't let you take the tests back so try to take pictures of the tests before the final.  EASY A"
1824,1264571,1.0,5.0,bad teacher.
1825,1264571,1.5,5.0,He barely explains anything. Almost 50% of the class failed and had to retake. He reads strictly from a powerpoint and does not offer good examples. I would not suggest him if you have not taken a previous econ class  
1826,1264571,4.5,3.0,"He and economics go together like peanut butter and jelly. Enjoyed the class. Required average study time. Attending class did the most for preparing for the hw and test. Mr. McGinness was well prepared with power points, and very knowledgeable on the subject."
1827,1264571,4.5,2.0,"I had him for econ 202 and 203. people complain but its just because they don't come to class.  If you come to class, do the minimal homework, and look over your notes, you can make an A. He's willing to help and easy to understand. I recommend him."
1828,1264571,2.0,3.0,hes a terrible teacher but gives a great curve.
1829,1264571,4.5,2.0,"Very good teacher, take good notes and you'll barely have to use the book, I've had him for 3 straight semesters."
1830,2409403,4.0,2.0,"Wishon was a visiting Prof at McMaster and while he had a little bit of a hard time adjusting, he was a great prof for a course like metaphysics. He really knew what he was talking about and it was great to listen to his lectures and be able to speak up when given the chance. He really encouraged us to give our own thoughts. Hope he comes back soon"
1831,2409403,5.0,2.0,Good Dude 
1832,2409403,3.0,3.0,Very strict attendance policy. Sign in class not scan in. Tests are fairly easy and straight forward from the study guides. If you aren't willing to study don't take his class. He gives reading quizzes at random times that are only out of 2 points and those can kill your grades.
1833,2409403,4.0,1.0,"Took wishon for hon phil 101 so it was a smaller class which might have made a difference, but it was super easy. Had some required reading but if you forget its easy to fake it through the discussion. Straightforward notes and test. Interesting class that I ended up really enjoying. Some short writing assignments but they were graded on completion"
1834,2241484,2.0,5.0,"the worst part is she does not enter grades or give feedback until the last second. If you are doing anything wrong, and believe me you will, you won't know until it is too late. In addition, she has turned people in for plagiarism when they did not plagarise. She is sweet, but gives too much work considering she doesn't grade it on time."
1835,2241484,5.0,3.0,"Dr. V really does care about the students and if youre understanding the material; she wants you to pass. She is very helpful if you schedule an appointment with her. She isnt that hard of a grader, and if you study, you will pass the two tests that are required for this class."
1836,2241484,2.0,3.0,"She's Bulgarian. She has no clue what she's talking about 98% of the time. Talks to us like were in 5th grade no joke, ""if your rich do you have a lot?"" Makes everyone feel very uncomfortable. If you wanna do good with her you're gonna have to read the book your self. She has an attendance policy and pop quizzes so you can't miss."
1837,2739149,1.0,4.0,"Possibly the worst professor at Olemiss. This class is a hilarious waste of time and money, especially with an terrible professor like her.
"
1838,2739149,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class but don't take it if you don't like talking in class or struggle with writing. All the tests are essay-based. It is an AP exam, so the documents are given to you. Do the lectures and TALK IN CLASS. If you do not like being involved or writing this class is not for you, and she says that at the beginning of the semester. "
1839,2739149,1.0,5.0,"Just don't take this class. The grading is extremely difficult. There are no traditional tests, they are all papers with unnecessarily hard prompts that are confusing and almost impossible to answer. I asked the teacher to help me with my paper and how to do better in the course and she refused. terrible awful class."
1840,2739149,2.0,4.0,You are only graded on essays and attendance. The prompts for the essays are unnecessarily confusing and don't make any sense. The TA grades extremely tough and the essay difficultly should not be given at a 100 level history class. I would not recommend this class to anyone unless. I spent over 8 hours on each essay and still only ended with a B.
1841,2380752,5.0,4.0,Creativity matters and counts. This was a really fun class. Make sure that you take notes in this class and ask questions.
1842,2380752,4.0,4.0,"A really good class, I learned a lot from Dr. Foster and it's clear from day one that he's passionate about the class and the work he does. Would recommend everyone takes his class."
1843,2380752,4.0,2.0,He is a great professor. I learned a good bit of information in his class. On the first day he describes the class as &quot;black as hell&quot; meaning it only focuses on Black American struggles. My only problem with the class was that I never felt comfortable to speak up in class because I felt I could not fully relate to the material.
1844,1846226,5.0,2.0,"Take him. He is always willing to help if you're confused. He is very fair when grading tests, and is so nice. I learned so much from him"
1845,1846226,4.5,1.0,"Take him for Math 261. He's very smart guy. He is always willing to help after class, during office hours. He will answer questions during class. Go over topic again if your unclear on it. He's very fair. Holds review sessions for test,basically tells you whats on it. He goes at a slow pace, which bothered me, but it might be good for you. Take him"
1846,2644950,2.0,5.0,Test are super hard and insanity spread out.
1847,2644950,4.0,2.0,"I did not get to know Vanderford very well due to the online format of the class, but she would always check up on her students via email. The weekly plan of the class was simple: Watch lectures, quiz after the lectures, take a test on the material. I personally enjoyed the lectures being videoed because I could rewind stuff that confused me."
1848,2560984,4.0,3.0,This was a great class. Lots of reading but most stories are online so do not feel the need to buy the book. The teaching assistant grades your work. Only two exams and a paper so make sure you read!
1849,2560984,4.0,2.0,Obvious he's passionate about his subject. Pleasant and sweet. An easy grader and an easy class. Only two in class examinations and one paper but quite a bit of reading.
1850,2560985,5.0,3.0,"Very passionate about what he teaches, makes it funny because he goes on long rants sometimes. A charismatic, funny guy. Young so he can easily relate to his students. Beyonce fanatic. Was very lecture heavy but he changed it up sometimes by playing a Doctor Who episode or something else."
1851,1491931,4.5,2.0,"Charles Miles was a good professor. If you don't know much about music (I didn't) then you will think sometimes he gets too far ahead. But that's only in class- on the tests it will be the notes you took. He is very helpful and always willing to do what he can for you to succeed. Also, he likes to get to actually know his students."
1852,1491931,4.5,1.0,"Great teacher! Very easy, but his class is interesting and if you just print out the notes for class and study them, you will get an A! Very easy! And such a nice teacher!"
1853,2690014,5.0,2.0,Reading from both textbooks is absolutely essential to pass. Class isn't very difficult to pass if you show up and do the readings. She makes the material fun and interesting. Very engaging lectures.
1854,1985503,5.0,3.0,Good Lectures
1855,2747365,5.0,3.0,Fier is a phenomenal professor. He isn't an easy teacher but if you come to class and pay attention you'll most likely get an A. The only homework he gives is a 10 question quiz every week. Offers a ton of extra credit and drop grades as well. He explains concepts well and I would highly advise you take him if you have the opportunity.
1856,1532902,5.0,3.0,Sallie is smart and excited about her material. She makes difficult texts easy and fun.
1857,1070053,5.0,2.0,"He was very understanding when it came to students and our everyday lives, I really enjoyed his class and loved the technology he uses and the way he teaches."
1858,1070053,5.0,1.0,Great teacher
1859,1070053,1.0,3.0,Never met a more disrespectful teacher in my life. Absolutely no sympathy for his students and very rude. Makes me sick to my stomach to think the university might keep him around longer just so he can ruin the days of other students. He should be very ashamed of himself.
1860,1070053,3.0,3.0,"He posts the test bank on blackboard. You can skip every class and get an A if you lock that down. Not afraid to get political. Almost like he wants to get fired. Hates Republicans, openly. Good stories about his career in law that actually help you understand some things. Overall, ehh. Material is boring, he can be entertaining some days"
1861,1070053,1.0,3.0,Curves grade a ton at the end of the semester because everyone is failing the class. I should have gotten a C but got curved to an A. Tests are impossible and he's rude.
1862,1070053,1.0,5.0,"He was probably one of the worst Professors I have ever had to learn from. Incredibly rude and knows it, thinks it's funny. Quite sexist when meeting him in private, a very uncomfortable person to be around. Grades hard and does not offer much outside help if you ask. Would not recommend, grab literally any other professor and you will be fine."
1863,1070053,2.0,3.0,Pretty funny to smoke before class and just pretend Danny Devito is doing stand up for you.
1864,1070053,3.0,5.0,The hardest class I have ever taken.  I put the time into this class and only came out with a B because of the grading curve he uses.  Do not go into this class expecting it to be easy because you WILL be sadly mistaken!
1865,1070053,4.0,4.0,"He is an amazing guy!! He is so helpful and will teach you so much about the Business Law and regulations.. If you do not show him interest or respect he has nothing for you, Do not beg for better grades, because everything you need the class is available!!!!"
1866,1070053,5.0,2.0,"He was such an interesting professor. He's a retired lawyer, so learning about legal business was really interesting because he had a lot of stories and examples. You have to get to know him to understand his way of teaching. His office hours were extremely helpful, creating a relationship with him is very helpful. Tests are easy. Curves at the end"
1867,1070053,3.5,4.0,"By far my favorite professor ever. He challenged me, made me a better student and person. He teachers three classes at ole miss, i have finished two and I'm going back for his third class. He is a hard teacher, but if you take a minute to get to know him and see why he does the things he does, you really learn to respect and appreicate him."
1868,1070053,3.0,3.0,"If you can find study guides or study questions online, the tests are pulled from a lot of online test banks, but he changes some of the info in the questions. He ended up curving our class at the end."
1869,1070053,1.5,5.0,"Awful professor. Had him last year. He enjoys failing students, his lectures don't help you for the tests, and he talks in a very condescending way to students (especially when they ask him questions in class). By far the worst professor I have had at Ole Miss. Do NOT take his class (unless like you being frustrated and failing)."
1870,1070053,1.5,4.0,"Very rude during his lectures, tests are impossible. He'll give you 100+ questions to study for a 40 question exam. Very tough, find another teacher. "
1871,1070053,3.5,4.0,"Schafer is extremely entertaining during his lectures, and you can tell he is very passionate about what he is teaching. His tests are very challenging if you only use the book and your notes to study. Most of the test questions are taken from his test banks and the online homework. Learn the answers from those and you will do great on tests."
1872,1070053,4.5,4.0,"Very tough tests, but still the best teacher. Funny guy, very entertaining. But you will have to study. Online home works are extremely helpful."
1873,1070053,4.0,4.0,Mr. Schafer is one of the best teachers in the business school at Ole Miss. His class is very hard but then everything is. If you put in the effort and work hard you will succeed. You can't expect to just get by in this class with no work ethic.
1874,1070053,3.0,3.0,"I came out with an A in this class my first semester of college.  I did study and do the homework, but I didn't think it was as bad as everyone says. He curves enough to make it fair, so even if you don't ace the test you can still have a good grade.  Put some effort in and it's not awful."
1875,1070053,2.0,5.0,"His class is very hard, pretty impossible to do well on his tests, doesn't prepare you well for anything, and doesn't care about anyone except himself. This coming from a 4.0 student...."
1876,1070053,1.0,5.0,This guy is a an ****. You will not pass his class. The points you receive are from 4 exams he give you. The lecture he gives in class has total no relation to the question covered in the test. He give out test banks with 200 questions with not answer. He claims the questions in the exam are different from the test banks.
1877,1070053,3.0,5.0,Very hard class and he has to Curve alot in order for whole class not to fail every test.
1878,1070053,1.0,5.0,"The only people that passed cheated, otherwise he was so hard that it was impossible. FYI, in my other classes i got A,A,B,B and a D in this jerks class."
1879,1070053,4.5,2.0,Great teacher. Really cares about the student
1880,2356202,5.0,4.0,Professor Parsons is top notch. He gives clear and feedback on papers and is very helpful in the revision process. Hes incredibly insightful and very willing to help students improve both their writing ability and critical reading skills
1881,2356202,5.0,4.0,"Parsons is amazing, one of my favorite teachers of all time, but if you dont care about literature or writing dont waste your time on this class. Hes hilarious and makes the class worth your time. Super smart, but serious about his work. So if youre not willing to come to class or put in the time to write good essays then this isnt your class."
1882,2728940,5.0,3.0,Amazing teacher and very nice woman. Class is easy if you go to class and take notes but she posts the notes online as well. Best teacher Ive had here
1883,2728940,5.0,2.0,"There's weekly HW online that is 15 problems or less. It's for completion. There are no quizzes. Tests are every few weeks, taken at the Jackson Ave. Center on computers. Goes over the lessons then goes over practice problems that are from the homework. She posts notes and example problems on Blackboard. Nicest woman ever, wants us to do well!"
1884,2257903,5.0,2.0,Johnson is one of the best professors I have had. You get to learn about the subject while also having a good laugh. He is easy to work with and a very understandable professor.
1885,2257903,5.0,3.0,Has the funniest personality! Looked forward to his class every week. Never had so much fun in a class before!
1886,2632688,5.0,1.0,"Take this class! There is only one test on all the chapters but it's common sense. You just have to give speeches, turn in outlines, and evaluate yourself after. The hardest part is dressing ""business casual."" She knows students are nervous and doesn't punish for that. Turn in your stuff on time, show up, and try your best and you'll be ok. "
1887,2458608,5.0,3.0,"Very easy professor, loves what he does and does a very good job explaining it. He is a very easy and understanding professor. I had 5 papers and they where all easy and he lets you resubmit essays."
1888,1627128,4.0,2.0,Very easy and laid back. Recommended
1889,1627128,4.0,2.0,He's a graduate student and he always tells a random math fact at the beginning of class that's pretty pointless but the class itself isn't bad at all. And we usually get out 10-15 minutes early. He tries to be funny. I recommend taking math 121 from him!
1890,760826,2.0,5.0,Very picky and hard to please professor
1891,760826,1.0,4.0,"Monotone lectures. Impossible to pass the exams without finding quizlets online.  Lectures do not follow the book, and reading the book won't help with the exam.  Does not answer questions clearly at all.  Mandatory attendance. There were no assignments, only exams. "
1892,760826,2.0,1.0,You will do better on the tests by just looking up the quizlets and only studying those.
1893,760826,1.0,5.0,"I have bad test anxiety so I emailed asking for tips to help prepare for our upcoming test. I said I read the chapters but they're lengthy (it isn't required, 100 pages long, & I'm in 5 other classes.) he proceeded to say I have ""weak reading skills"" and he isn't surprised I'm not doing well. Makes me never want to ask a teacher for help again. "
1894,760826,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Fenno is a tough teacher. He teaches this 100 level class as if it were a 400 level. Quizzes and exams have 10-15 answer choices per question. Online lectures are monotone and boring, which makes it even harder to engage with the material. "
1895,760826,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Fenno seems like a great guy and he is very enthusiastic about what he teaches. No graded homework, just watch the lectures and read the textbook. There are 6 short tests that were easy and you could take them twice, and he dropped your 2 lowest test scores at the end. If you know a decent amount of mythology the class is a breeze."
1896,760826,3.0,4.0,"Professor Fenno's course was pretty interesting but also difficult at times. If you have prior knowledge about Greek myths then the materials shouldn't be too hard to understand but the last few units were pretty rigorous. I wouldn't say this class is an easy A but studying helps. Also, tests were not bad and you could take them more than once!"
1897,760826,1.0,4.0,Very hard as an online class
1898,760826,4.0,3.0,"Enthusiastic, knowledgable, Helpful, Funny"
1899,760826,5.0,4.0,"Class is really slow-moving, kinda boring but Dr. Fenno is very helpful and a fair grader"
1900,760826,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fenno has a brilliant mind and will spend as much time with you as you need.  He is wise and good.  No other professor has taught me half as much.   Take his class!
1901,760826,5.0,1.0,No Comments
1902,760826,3.0,4.0,kinda boring. makes you come to class when you don't have anything to do. harsh critiquer of papers (but in all fairness he thinks he's helping). enthusiastica about the subject.
1903,760826,1.0,3.0,"boring and not fun.  I am rarely not interested in a class, and he successfully made me not want to come to class.  He is also unforgiving and stodgy; has no sense of humor."
1904,760826,5.0,4.0,"Towering intellectual, enthusiastic about the material, and will make you a great writer.  Fenno is the best professor I have ever had."
1905,2632699,5.0,1.0,"Very easy if you go to class. Professor is really nice and cares about the students. Participation heavy, got to participate everyday. But overall a good class that should be an easy A if you give any amount of effort."
1906,2632699,5.0,2.0,"Small, fun class, but was also able to learn a good bit. Easy A if you show up to class"
1907,1627132,1.0,1.0,Hes a Marxist anti-white racist who talks about arresting whites for having an opinion against authority.
1908,1627132,1.0,5.0,Only professor i've had that makes you take notes after a test. Lectures are very full every time.
1909,1627132,2.0,4.0,"Don't show up to class.. you will not get some questions on the test. Test is all short answer & can be very specific going back to a lecture example. But that sucks, because I found him so annoying to listen to. He grades VERY specifically on the test. The reading every week can be a lot & the weekly online quiz is based on his opinions. Have fun."
1910,1627132,4.0,4.0,Tests are hard but if you show up and take good notes it's very possible to get a good grade in the class. Dr. Johnson was a great professor. He is very passionate about his subject.
1911,1627132,4.0,3.0,"I do not understand why he has such bad reviews on here. Johnson is one of the only professors I have had who actually WANTS to teach. No, you will absolutely not pass if you  don't attend class... he warns everyone of this the first day. He makes lectures interesting and note- taking is a must. Easy A if you simply attend class."
1912,1627132,1.0,5.0,"This was by far the WORST class I have ever taken in my entire life. His test are extremely difficult. They are all short answer test, if you do not sum them up to the way he believes they should be stated, he counts the entire question as incorrect. NEVER TAKE HIM.. I MEAN NEVER!!!!!!"
1913,1627132,1.0,5.0,"Seriously the worst teacher I HAVE EVER HAD, i have never made a C in college and this was my first ever D in my entire life. His tests consist of short answer questions that are basically impossible. AVIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1914,1627132,3.5,3.0,Tests are hard!! He is eager to help you learn but you HAVE to go to class and take notes.
1915,1627133,1.5,4.0,"Should be an easy &quot;A,&quot; but it's not! He takes half off a lot. I hate how he grades. Not fair at all. The first day of class everyone except 3 people couldn't get their online codes to work but he didn't care and said if you didn't have it done by the end of class he was still taking half off. He's very frustrating and hard to understand his accent."
1916,963579,2.0,4.0,"she's a really nice teacher, but I don't think I learned a single thing. I took Procurement with her and she could never instruct without the whole class lecture derailing to something ridiculous. Don't let her personality fool you either, her tests can be hard. However, she is a very nice person and cares about her students!"
1917,963579,5.0,2.0,Best Teacher ever! She's a wonderful human being and also really cares about her students.  She makes class fun and interesting! Take her if you can!!!!
1918,1076227,5.0,5.0,A brilliant man that appreciates effort and hard work! 
1919,1076227,1.0,3.0,"He does not teach, only rambles. He doesnt use any examples from the text book, but for some reason he tries to make up hypotheticals and messes them up 80% of the time. He is completely out of touch with modern teaching methods. If you do end up stuck with him, bring a set of headphones and look up &quot;Farhat intermediate accounting&quot; on youtube."
1920,1076227,1.0,5.0,He's hard to understand n his lectures are not helpful
1921,1076227,3.5,4.0,If you read the book and pay special attention to the powerpoints (especially on the material not in the book) you will do fine. Presentations are fairly straightforward and the material was of interest to me.
1922,1076227,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Lawrence is difficult to understand in class, but if you need help, there is usually tutoring sessions. He also helps you out if you are having trouble in any area. You just have to work hard to earn your grade. Welcome to Ole Miss Accounting."
1923,1076227,2.0,4.0,He doesn't actually teach. He makes you have to teach yourself. Will also test on material that hasn't been assigned or reviewed in class. Makes the tests way to difficult considering the lack of effort he gives.
1924,1076227,5.0,5.0,Great teacher but tests are crazy. If you want a good grade definitely take someone else.
1925,1076227,2.0,4.0,Sorry professor. Doesn't do a good job explaining the material. Doesn't make out own test. Gets questions from publisher's website. Do not take him! You have to teach yourself...
1926,1076227,1.0,5.0,I withdrew with a passing score in order to move out of state.  He deducted points from my grade after I withdrew to give me an &quot;F&quot;. I was passing before I withdrew.  He is the only professor to do that.  My GPA dropped to a 3.18.
1927,2284557,5.0,1.0,"Loved this class! Would definitely take again. Tests and quizzes are based off of the poems, short stories and novels, so if you read them you and understand the texts you will be fine. There are weekly quizzes that have unlimited attempts and 3 exams including the final."
1928,2284557,5.0,4.0,"Very passionate about her job and makes it a fun atmosphere overall to learn in. I enjoyed the class over the course of the semester even with a loaded schedule, and shes very caring and will work with you if you are struggling."
1929,2284557,5.0,3.0,Im not a huge fan of English but I loved her class. I know how to understand poetry better now and dont hate having to read as much. Her lectures are very entertaining and you can tell she loves what she does. 10/10 for sure.
1930,2284557,4.0,2.0,She's really passionate about what she teaches and it makes the class more fun. She's also really funny. Make sure you bring the required texts to class or she'll mark you absent. Other than that 10/10 would recommend.
1931,2006029,5.0,2.0,Take her class
1932,2006029,5.0,3.0,Miss Loria is fun and easy as long as you go to class. But you defintely have to study
1933,1338383,4.0,3.0,"She's not the best professor. But as long as you show her respect, you'll be fine. Her tests are 4-5 chapters at a time. She provides a very test accurate study guide. Which you can find the answers in the notes. She doesn't post her notes, but will slow down and repeat if you need her to."
1934,1338383,1.0,5.0,This class was awful. Grade was dropped after two absences not justified by a doctors note. No electronics in class and she goes to fast to copy all the notes. The notes were also not posted anywhere. Her test were on 4 chapters at a time with a 20 page study guide. Only pro is she only pulls questions from study guide and she has a few bonuses. 
1935,1338383,3.0,3.0,"She puts her opinion on the vaccine in almost every lecture, she really presses it on the class and shes very strict with masks. The lectures are easy to understand if you take good notes. The tests arent hard you just have to put in the time to study."
1936,1338383,2.0,4.0,She talks about her opinion on the vaccine a lot and isn't very helpful. test are really hard. She is a nice person but I wouldn't take her class again
1937,1338383,1.0,5.0,"She was not good in my opinion, I struggle with any type of science and she was very unhelpful, I had strep and flu this semester and she did not care and counted me absent. She is a health freak and cared a lot about attendance. her study guides are very lengthy and she doesnt give the answers so you can check your work. overall not good"
1938,1338383,4.0,2.0,"she can be strict and intimidating but is very thorough with her content and teaches it to us like we are in 1st grade. Her teaching is very understandable, even for someone who is terrible at biology like me. Tests are easy if you look over your notes. I thought bio was the hardest thing ever in HS and then got an A in her class."
1939,1338383,1.0,5.0,"Idk what everyone else is on, but this teacher has been a nightmare all semester Constantly complaining about people not having mask on There is no late credit at all on homework automatic zero Test are hard and the study guide is just lengthy questions with no answers Lectures are very boring and she doesnt post the slides or let people take pics"
1940,1338383,4.0,3.0,Some people dont like her. I do like her. If you are someone who doesnt want to have to study quite a bit before a test dont take. Not hard material just a lot at once.
1941,1338383,4.0,4.0,"Good, solid teacher with clear and understandable lectures. Exams are difficult if you don't complete the study guide she provides. Make sure you do your homework or it will hurt you. Don't take if you're trying to get an easy A with minimal work. It's not hard homework at all but you need to be doing the work."
1942,1338383,4.0,3.0,Dr. Bensen is a really great teacher! She gives bonus point opportunities every day of class! She is a very clear teacher and the study questions she provides at the end of each chapter guarantee you a B or higher on her tests. The homework takes under thirty minutes &amp; are easy A's. The only downside to her course is the two absences limit.
1943,1338383,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher. She's very passionate about biology so you'll be taking lots of notes because there's TONS of material. Tests can be difficult if you don't prepare yourself and study your notes from the chapters. There's lots of bonus points that really help your grade, so even if you're not good at biology there's still hope. Go to class and study."
1944,1338383,4.0,4.0,"Ms. Bensen was an awesome teacher. She knows what she is talking about; however, you will not do well in her class if you do not pay attention."
1945,1338383,3.0,4.0,"If you don't go to class you won't get participation points which is a major part of your grade. Lots of online assignments that are worth a lot of points. The tests are hard, but if you study a lot you should get a decent grade. She doesn't really take that many questions in class but if you go to her office hours she will answer any questions."
1946,1338383,1.0,5.0,"This lady does not  need to teach college level courses. She stopped class on multiple occasions when 1 student would be on their phone, or if someone was asking a question demanded the entire class go totally silent. Very much a control freak and should teach middle school or elementary level education. Oh and quizzes are everyday (seriously)."
1947,1338383,1.0,5.0,If you want to fail and want to punish yourself for a semester take this class............ If you are not in love with science or a bio major don't take this class!!!!!!
1948,1338383,3.5,4.0,"I loved Tiffany! I don't know why she has negative reviews. If you go to class, you can miss 2 times without being punished, and do the online assignments and only till you get 100 points then you automatically have a 42 in the class... Yes her tests are somewhat difficult but she gives them back so find someone with an old one and u will b fine."
1949,1338383,1.0,5.0,She is very boring. Went to a SI session and the TA had last semesters test to study only reason I made a good grade on the last test.
1950,1338383,4.0,5.0,This class was hard for me. I know many people that did really well in that class. Very boring class. Get MWF because its only 50 minutes. If you have never taken Biology before (in high school) wait a semester or two. She expects too much and it can be overwhelming.
1951,1338383,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Bensen's class isn't too hard if you take good notes, pay attention in class, and do the homework assignments. She gives you lots of ways to earn points besides exams, such as online assignments and participation points. She also gives you time to take notes from her slides. The material can be overwhelming, but studying lots will get you by!"
1952,1338383,3.5,4.0,"I think her tests are fair compared to the material she goes over in class,but I believe she gets way too detailed for a non-major biology. She will never let you out early but she is easy to get in contact with. Fair teacher but strict."
1953,1338383,3.5,4.0,"impossible. so hard and she makes it so much harder than it needs to be. especially for a non major class. she's really nice and will try and help you if you go talk to her one on one, but the class itself is so hard."
1954,1338383,1.5,4.0,"This woman is heartless. I was very ill on the day of a test. I could barely get out of bed, but I went to her and gave her a doctor's note, hoping she would let me take it at another time, but she said she didn't care if I was sick. I still had to take the test. Very pro-woman and health freak. Just awful."
1955,1338383,4.5,3.0,"She is a great teacher. Make sure you go to class and answer the clicker questions. As long as you do that, and do all of her study questions, you will do well on the tests."
1956,1338383,5.0,1.0,"She is a good teacher. Some people cant get past the fact that she will never be hopping around, making a theatrical scene for biology 101. She is serious, but she is helpful. She makes her best effort to get to know her students. If you pay attention, answer the clicker questions, take notes its really easy to make good grades."
1957,1338383,2.0,5.0,Quite hard and not very helpful.
1958,1338383,4.0,4.0,"At first I thought she was going to be a terrible teacher, but after a few classes I changed my mind. She isn't the most entertaining class and it can be a hard class if you don't pay attention. But she's very helpful if you ask questions and she's willing to work with you if she knows you're trying. If you just make sure to show up to class every day, she counts off for absences, and pay attention to her lectures you should be fine."
1959,1338383,3.0,5.0,"So HARD, and boring as hell, she expects wayyy to much out of her students. The final is impossible, and if youre not ready to commit all your time to this class dont take it."
1960,1338383,2.0,5.0,She is one of the most BORING teachers i have EVER had. she thinks that her class is the most important class on campus (she said so herself) and she just sucks as a teacher. she has one monotone voice and will keep you until the very last second of class. don't bother being late to class cause she's been known to call people out on it.
1961,1338383,4.5,4.0,"hard tests, participation points via clickers. if you come to class and do her study questions, its fairly easy to make a B"
1962,1338383,4.0,4.0,"Hard class but you can do well if you attend and pay attention. Gives 5 points everyday you attend. Clicker is needed for daily quizzes.  Doesn't matter if you get the quiz wrong, only used for participation."
1963,1625106,2.0,3.0,Rushes through the material. Not accessible outside of class. Will move forward even though the whole class is lost. Not a great experience. You will have to teach yourself the material and concepts.
1964,1625106,5.0,4.0,Prof. Percy is great! Very kind and approachable. This lady really knows her stuff and teaches extremely well.
1965,1625106,5.0,5.0,"Civ Pro II is a nightmare course but Prof. Percy keeps it lively, well organized, and understandable.  Plus she has the best ""baby lawyer"" stories ever."
1966,2356243,5.0,4.0,Very nice lady and great teacher. Read your textbook and attend class. She is very good at explaining things. Great with real life examples. Would take her again.
1967,2356243,5.0,2.0,"It's an easy class if you aren't stupid. Overall, a very good teacher"
1968,2356243,1.0,5.0,Save yourself shes a terrible teacher. Awful.
1969,2356243,1.0,3.0,"Extremely nice lady, but CANNOT teach! Learned way more about her backstory. She's from tn and worked as a financial analyst at a midsize bank. She also drives a volvo... What did I learn about accounting??? Maybe how to make a t chart, a 201 topic........"
1970,1942549,4.0,3.0,Dr. Yasarer (Dr. Y for short) is a laid back teacher with a kind disposition. Pay close attention in his class because it is vital for quizzes and exams. Willing to answer questions in and out of class. Lab projects were especially fun.
1971,1942549,4.0,2.0,Professor Yasarer is a great teacher that want to make the students interested and prepared for more difficult classes. The key is to show up to class and solve the homework problems on your own. They are not usually long so by doing the homework one will save a lot of time studying for the exams.
1972,1942549,3.0,3.0,"Is a good teacher. Previous tests do not help. you have to understand the material for yourself. Get a seat in the front, take notes, and GO TO CLASS. quizzes are hard if you copied homework"
1973,1625110,2.0,3.0,"Professor Case is far too concerned with his Twitter fame and popularity to be a good Professor. He is condescending, rude, and is wildly distracting in class. He knows his material, but he does not explain it in a way that is understandable. Further, he expects the law to be analyzed from his point of view. He also picks favorites."
1974,1625110,4.0,4.0,"Great professor and proud nerd. He gives it to you straight. 1Ls who are lucky enough to take him for Contracts, get ready to learn ALL the Restatements he mentions in his PowerPoints, and even some of the ones he doesn't.   Generous with absences, but don't be an idiot. "
1975,1625110,4.5,4.0,"Professor Case is a great instructor but he expects a lot out of you.  He explains property law really well, but be careful on the exam, he hates ""conclusory"" statements.  Always explain EVERYTHING."
1976,1713174,4.5,4.0,Very clear speaker and is more than willing to repeat herself. Her tests are all paragraph form so ou better know your stuff. You have online timed quizzes and if you don't study you will fail.
1977,1625111,5.0,2.0,"Interesting discussions. Not a lecture, more of an open discussion. He assigns a good bit of reading but you can fake it through the discussions if you forget. Really enjoyed this class and would definitely take it again. Had to write 5 papers total, but half were 1-2 pgs so they don't really count. Graded on papers and participation, no tests."
1978,1625111,2.0,4.0,"Excruciating at times. It was his first year teaching Property, but it did not go over well. Pay attention to zoning?"
1979,1934358,5.0,5.0,Very talented and enthusiastic while teaching
1980,1934358,4.0,3.0,"Good teacher! She does have a bit of an accent, but it isn't awful. Also, if you work hard and show up she will give you the grade."
1981,1934358,1.0,3.0,"She was a nice professor; however, I couldn't quite understand her... I even sat in the front. The tests weren't terrible, but I felt like I was teaching myself most of the material."
1982,1934358,1.5,4.0,"you honestly can't understand her half the time. she also doesn't really answer your questions and makes you look stupid when she does answer them. I would avoid her if possible, it's for the better."
1983,1934358,3.0,3.0,"Well if you speak English like I do then this will be your first problem with her. Her accent makes it extremely difficult to understand what she is trying to say sometimes. Yes, stats is easy, but it could be even easier if she was able to explain the concepts much more clearly than she actually does. Try taking another stats teacher if possible."
1984,2835482,5.0,3.0,"Its very apparent that he genuinely cares about the success of his students not only just in his class but also the rest of their collegiate careers.
- Very constructive and gives good feedback on your papers. 
- Willing to help and improve your writing
- Understanding that you have other classes and that life can be chaotic"
1985,2638871,2.0,5.0,"DO NOT take this class with this teacher if you have no music background, I was told I didn't need any type of music background that is not the case. I got criticized and made fun of every class because I did not know the material. His tutoring sessions do not help and I left them more confused than I started."
1986,2638871,1.0,5.0,If you do not have a music background DO NOT TAKE this class. He excepts you to already know music. Not helpful and difficult to understand. Constantly felt judged in this class.
1987,1934364,2.5,2.0,"We barely ever had class, he cancelled regularly (good for extra sleep, not good if you need help with a paper) He is super nice and understanding but horrible at responding to emails. He was hardly ever in his office. I made an A in his class, but if you struggle with writing, you may need someone a little more helpful. Good guy though. "
1988,2747423,5.0,3.0,"Hes literally such a good professor, very funny. Barely any work outside of class, but youre graded on very few things so put forth your best effort when completing assignments. Really interesting class I definitely recommend."
1989,2747423,5.0,3.0,Fantastic teacher with mostly optional but incredibly interesting and insightful lectures. Very heavy on reading content (though a majority of it is for context and not particularly necessary). Grades very fairly and provides useful in-depth feedback.
1990,1031201,5.0,3.0,"One of the best teachers I've had at Ole Miss.  Not only did he help me with my cal questions, but he also helped me with other classes.  He is awesome!!!!"
1991,1031201,5.0,2.0,"Awesome prof, very clear and teaches what he tests.  Pretty nice to look at, too:) Makes going to class a little easier."
1992,1031201,5.0,1.0,He has every good thing.
1993,1031201,5.0,2.0,"awesome guy, great teacher"
1994,1031201,4.5,3.0,No Comments
1995,1031206,2.5,4.0,"Nice person to students that's passing. There are 5 tests,3 papers thats stupid, the test is based off her powerpoints and lectures ( like a person suppose to remember what she say) she do gives a review before the test, but when you take the test it's nothing like the reviews its very tricky and I hated this class. Hated it."
1996,1031206,5.0,3.0,No Comments
1997,1031207,4.5,4.0,"Hustwit is awesome.  Very helpful, funny, and friendly.  Looking forward to more upper-level classes with him and this great department."
1998,1031207,4.5,5.0,"Hustwit genuinely likes the subject material and knows his stuff.  If you need to improve in the class or really want to learn how to write, just ask.  He always makes time to talk.  Awesome shoes and socks."
1999,1031207,2.5,5.0,"PIcky grader. If you are not good at writing you will struggle in his class. Not very helpful when you ask for help, if you are not interested in his course."
2000,1031207,3.0,5.0,"He is the toughest grader I have ever had.  If you aren't good at writing essays, you're screwed.  You have to read a lot too! 4 books. not fun. hes a cool guy though."
2001,1031207,5.0,4.0,"He's very interesting and engaging. Unlike most history professors at Ole Miss, he really talks to the students and he TEACHES you instead of forcing you to memorize dates and names from a boring textbook. Also, if you're struggling with essays (he's a picky grader), then email him your draft and he'll talk through your issues with you."
2002,1031207,4.0,3.0,"Hustwit is a very engaging professor and obviously knows his material very well. However, he comes across as very abrasive to a lot of people and will not hesitate to embarrass you in front of the whole class."
2003,1031207,3.0,5.0,"Hustwit is a cool guy, but he doesn't require you to get a textbook. He teaches from lectures, and all of your exams are essay forms. He doesn't give you prompts before so you have no idea. His Final exam is comprehensive and you only have your notes to study. You also have to read 5 books and write a 3 page essay on each. He's tough but enjoyable."
2004,1031207,5.0,2.0,"He's a great teacher and a good person. He's always really engaging and makes sure that he gives lots of chances for you to do well. Take good notes and you won't have any trouble. He can be a little picky with essays and challenges you to do your personal best, but it's all worth it."
2005,1031207,5.0,2.0,"He's a wonderful professor. Unlike most professors, he speaks TO the students, instead of AROUND them or over their heads.  He's very nice and explains material really well.  If you take good notes, tests aren't too hard."
2006,1031207,4.5,3.0,Relates to students unlike many professors
2007,1031207,3.5,3.0,his quizzes come only from the book and he does not refer to the book in lecture
2008,1031207,5.0,2.0,"Great class. As long as you go to class and actually take notes, there's no reason why you should even have to study to make an A."
2009,1031207,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher! Genuinely loves his subject and does an awesome job teaching it.  I dreaded learning history before I took his class.  The course work is minimal.  You write 3 papers based on good novels you read, a midterm and a final. As long as you go to class and take decent notes you do NOT need the text book. I never opened mine and got an A."
2010,2245675,5.0,1.0,TAKE THIS CLASS IF POSSIBLE. Interesting and if you do the work it is an EASY A.
2011,1913899,3.0,3.0,"He is a very nice guy, definitely knows alot about this subject but is extremely boring. Attendance is mandatory but i wanted to fall asleep in every class he also does a poor job of telling you what will be on exams and the notes are not always helpful for the exams so they are difficult. Must study to do well on exams and quizzes.  "
2012,1913899,5.0,2.0,Professor Bos is absolutely amazing! For an introductory class I learned so much that I never even knew about on my own religion and more! He is super caring and as long as you go to every class and take super good notes along with reading the powerpoints you will do exceptional! Quizzes and tests have info that come straight from the lecture! LOVE
2013,1913899,4.0,4.0,Weekly test on reading from the week before but most of the answers are on quizlet. Weekly journals take a lot of time and you have to read to do well as well as occasionally doing research outside of the book. There's only 2 tests and 1 paper which is nice but tests and papers can be tricky.
2014,1913899,3.0,3.0,"Lecture based, hard to follow &amp; confusing (coming from someone who likes note taking). You have to write a lengthy current events paper and be the expert of the day for one class. HIs tests are multiple choice, short answer, and essay. Gives essay prompts ahead of time, but multiple choice is hard. He is pretty bland/boring, but is reasonable"
2015,1913899,2.0,4.0,Very difficult class. Bos expects you to do lots of outside work to earn a high grade. Weekly quizzes as well as exams every other week. Quizzes and exams are on lecture material as well as textbook material (which he does not go over in class) as well as stuff he just casually mentions. Also a few papers!!
2016,1913899,5.0,5.0,lots of reading and understanding concepts/differences between religion but dr bus knows this info very well so he's great at teaching it
2017,1913899,4.0,2.0,"Really good professor, it's clear that he enjoys the subject matter and wants you to pass the class. Lots of multiple choice quizzes, 3 multiple choice exams including a non-cumulative final. Easy essay grader. Offers 1% extra credit for attendance. Try to sit near the front. Highly recommend Rel 103 w/ Dr. Bos to fulfill Humanities requirement."
2018,1913899,5.0,4.0,"I took him for honors religion and couldn't be happier with a teacher. He grades your work fairly so don't try to bs it and READ THE TEXTBOOK. Still, he has been the best teacher I've had at Ole Miss."
2019,1913899,4.5,3.0,He is one of the best professors. I really enjoyed being in his class. He takes the time to learn his students names and who you are. His test are easyish if you study.
2020,1913899,5.0,2.0,"Wonderful teacher. Has a incredible expertise over the subject matter; really a great resource outside of class, as well. But the classes themselves were so fun! Learned more from Dr. Bos in one semester than most of my other teachers in 12 years of school. Take him for sure, you'll have a blast and learn a lot about religion."
2021,1913899,4.0,4.0,The honors class has been really interesting with an equal balance of lecture and group discussion 
2022,1913899,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Bos really goes into depth in the lectures. The exams are pretty straightforward. However, you will REALLY need to know the material for the final so take good notes. Also, I suggest sitting near the front of the class because he doesn't talk too loud. He's always willing to help out during office hours or after class if you have any questions."
2023,2360365,5.0,3.0,"He lectures everyday from beginning to end but extremely approachable. Have to write a few papers throughout the semester but only 2 tests all year (midterm and final), about 5 quizzes, and learning curves which are easy 100%s. I hate history but really liked him. just show up"
2024,2360365,1.0,5.0,"If you're not a history person, you won't enjoy this class. This is basically just a lecture class with lots of online homework THAT YOU SHOULD DO, and online quizzes. Even though they're online, they're timed and difficult to pass. There's about 3 or 4 papers throughout the semester and 2 tests. I don't recommend this teacher."
2025,2360365,2.0,4.0,He will lecture non stop each class. He also loves to jump around from president to president. He makes certain things overly confusing. He is extremely bias in his lectures. He skips the &quot;fun&quot; parts of history. His class is just boring to say the least. The TA is an extremely tough grader and won't change his mind on anything. I would not take.
2026,2360366,2.0,5.0,Very fast when it comes to lectures. Does not take many questions. Large amounts of homework. Exams are rather difficult. Doesn't have patience for people who don't understand the material or concepts.
2027,2360366,4.0,4.0,"Professor Dass LOVES chemistry. Due to that, he wants you to love it too. He will call on you all the time in class and frankly, that terrified me into reading the heck out of my book every night so I don't embarrass myself in class. Hard tests, hard class, but lovely professor"
2028,2360366,2.0,4.0,Awful professor. Tests are super hard those are the only things that are graded other than homework which is only 10% of the final grade. Is very rude. All of thehomework is in the textbook so you have to waste the money from the textbook. If you do not study you will not pass. The extra credit he does is three points on the test which doesn' help
2029,2360366,5.0,3.0,"He lectures for most of the class, and at the end of the week there is usually a quiz(they don't mean much). Drops a test at the end. DO YOUR HOMEWORK! It will help you in the end. He's pretty funny too, and if you put forth an effort to go well he will notice. He also does help sessions every week. I recommend him."
2030,1838125,4.5,3.0,"Great class, he's a funny guy and an entertaining teacher. It's a challenging class nonetheless; I took German in high school and I'd say we covered the first year and a half of high school classes in the first semester."
2031,1838125,5.0,4.0,He makes learning a difficult language interesting and fun. He seems to be interested in using technology while teaching and he is very helpful. I didn't realize how fast I could learn a language! I will try to take as many classes as possible with this teacher.
2032,1729595,1.0,3.0,Lectures are off topic and impossible to keep up with if you are taking notes. TAs have no idea what is going on in discussion courses. Instructions are vague and unclear and if you ask for clarification her emails are patronizing and unhelpful. I do not mind her as a person but her course for Eng224 needs a massive overhaul.
2033,2165825,4.0,1.0,"Easy class, if you show up and study a bit you will easily get an A. Fairly interesting. He gives you the powerpoints. Also if you dont skip class you get like 3 grade points added to your final grade. Will exempt you from exam if you have good grades and dont skip class. Would recommend."
2034,2165825,4.0,3.0,"I loved Dowling! I am not a Political Science major, so his class was not my favorite subject, but he is informative and passionate. Furthermore, he switches it up every semester as to whether he requires attendance or not, but either way he posts the PowerPoints online. He also gives a study guide and does a review day before every test."
2035,2165825,4.0,3.0,Good teacher. interesting class. Three assigned 3 page papers. pretty easy grader
2036,2587714,4.0,4.0,"I showed up to lectures because attendance was mandatory. I never took notes or paid attention in class but before tests, I had to go over all of the material and teach myself. The practice tests given through the textbook helped prepare for tests A LOT! She's a good teacher and funny! I'm just not the best student."
2037,2630723,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Fransee is amazing in quite literally every way possible. Take every single class she offers; she is an actual angel. You learn so much from her and you can tell she's incredibly intelligent. She has also been one of the very few teachers who offers feedback in the course, and I adore her."
2038,1416259,3.5,1.0,Easy A! A lot of memorizing though! She may be a little rude but very easy A.
2039,1416259,1.5,3.0,"She's never very clear on what she wants you to do. When you ask her a simple question, she's very very rude. I would never suggest taking her."
2040,1416259,4.5,1.0,EASY A
2041,1416259,3.0,2.0,"She was really easy, but she wasn't very nice. She acted very snobbish. I personally didn't like her."
2042,1416259,1.5,3.0,She is always pmsing... She is not a good teacher. Always in a bad mood...
2043,1416258,1.0,5.0,I wouldn't recommend this professor. He is usually very unclear and confusing and I struggled with his course (while I had the highest GPA in both sections of my previous English class).
2044,1442889,1.5,3.0,It's fairly obvious from her attitude in class that she could care less about the subject or about fulfilling her role as a teacher. Don't take her if you enjoy professors who are passionate about their field.
2045,1442889,4.0,4.0,"This class is very demanding.  Midterm and Finals are both essays that are expected to be four pages.  Very helpful, but not a teacher you would want to have."
2046,2624584,1.0,1.0,"I had to take PHCL course with Dr. Shariat-Madar as part of the curriculum. Although, I had been warned by other students about him, but when I took the course, he was even worse than what I thought. He always had bad attitude in class and not explain the course well at all. He is a shame for OleMiss. I would never take any other courses with him."
2047,2624584,1.0,2.0,"I have the same experience as other students, I took PHCL443 two years ago though with Dr. Shariat. He was so terrible and awful, I can say he was the worst teacher that I ever had in the entire undergrad and grad school. Some of the classmates and I got together and formed group study which is how we learned the materials and passed the course."
2048,2624584,1.0,3.0,"I took this course (Basic and clinical pharmacology) when I was at second year (PY2) with Dr. Madar. What a waste of time! Don't get me wrong, the concept of this course is very important, however, unfortunately, Dr. Shariat-Madar did not teach and explain the course well at all. I ended up reading the textbook by myself and that's how I learned."
2049,2624584,1.0,1.0,"Dr. Shariat-Madar is very unresponsive and disorganized, always mad with short temper. He treats his students very badly. He has negative attitude that students would not even stop by his office for course-related questions. He has poor judgment along with lacking in classroom management and commitment. I can't believe they let him teach at school."
2050,1995851,5.0,4.0,Awesome 
2051,1995851,5.0,3.0,Mr cimon is straight up a chili pepper
2052,2475083,1.0,1.0,"She did not give any classes. Never teach, never respond, never grade. The only difference between taking her class and self-learning is that her class wastes more time and money. She is not well educated in terms of helping others to learn. Teaching is different from uploading materials and assigning homework - educational operations can do that."
2053,2475083,2.0,4.0,No feedback on papers so you won't know how or what to improve on your next paper. Assigns a lot of busy work. I have not improved as a writer at all since taking this class.
2054,2475083,3.0,3.0,"Assigns a lot of busy work and reading assignments that didn't help me become a better writer or understand things at all. If you miss class, she'll assign in-class participation grades if she notices that a lot of people are absent. She takes ABSOLUTELY NO late assignments, it's an automatic zero. Be on her good side. Lots of tedious citing."
2055,1442893,4.5,3.0,"Tests are difficult, especially the listening sections. Way harder than I expected, but still not too bad. You don't really have to do much reading, just pay attention in class. He's really cute and friendly."
2056,1442893,4.5,2.0,Very helpful. Answers emails relatively quickly and is overall very friendly. I would recommend this course to others.
2057,1442893,3.5,4.0,"He's very patient about explaining concepts more than once. Tests were only slightly more difficult than I expected. Make sure you keep up with the assigned listenings and readings, or you'll end up cramming the night before."
2058,2233426,2.0,4.0,He knows a lot about the subject. Which make his lectures all over the place. Do not take if you are not familar with astronomy. Lectures are very very very unorganized. Also super hard to follow. He offers some extra credit. It is really hard to finish.
2059,2233426,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Hill is a very nice and caring professor. Take it if you aren't good at science but need science credits. His test bank is made up of the quizzes for each week, make sure you don't forget the quizzes!!! Extra credit is offered and is pretty simple. Labs are usually short & easy but some are confusing and not always well explained by the lab TA."
2060,2233426,5.0,2.0,"Professor Hill was a really good professor. He seems to care about what he teaches a lot and has been teaching for so many years. His course is not too demanding and you don't have to read the textbook unless you want more clarification. Just pay attention to the lectures, read the notes, and you should be fine. Also, remember the quizzes!"
2061,2233426,4.0,2.0,Mr. Hill is a great teacher and has been teaching for a LONG time. You can tell that he really cares about his job and loves teaching. As long as you pay attention to the lectures you should be fine. NO homework just 2 mini quizzes every week and all answers are simple and talked about in class. Easy A. I bought textbook and we don't really use it.
2062,2233426,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Hill is a very nice guy. Homework  easy google search. All the extra credit he gave made up for the fact I'm bad at math. Keep up with your own grade in the class independently. Sometimes his T.A's that do the Scantrons mess up, but he's very open to correcting it. Tests multiple Choice. Lectures fun. People that complain didn't go to class."
2063,2233426,1.0,4.0,He is a really tough grader.
2064,2835540,1.0,4.0,"Avoid taking this class if possible. All they did was read off the slides, and I was always needing to find outside help. All my friends agree as well. I learned more by teaching myself compared to her being the one supposed to teach me.  "
2065,2835540,1.0,2.0,"This professor just reads off her powerpoints. Reading the textbook was better for me than listening to her lectures. She has daily Inquizitives and biweekly modules, and they aren't very hard, but annoying. However, she snaps if class packs up one minute before class ends and calls people out who are ""disrupting"" her class. Avoid if possible."
2066,1602650,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely love Carey. So so so nice, and helpful in office hours! I've taken two classes with him and I thoroughly enjoyed both of them."
2067,1602650,1.0,4.0,"He is the worst professor I have ever had in my entirety at Ole Miss. Not only are his lectures incredibly boring, but his feedback makes zero sense, and he offers little help. I have never made a B in my entire life until I took his class because his grading is ridiculous, and I am a history major. I would avoid him like the plague."
2068,1602650,3.5,4.0,really good class and really good teacher. he is definitely there to help you and wants to make sure you succeed in his class. he is very helpful in office hours. 
2069,1602650,4.0,2.0,"Easy teacher, all lecture."
2070,1602650,4.0,2.0,"Great teacher, only lecture. easy"
2071,226397,2.5,1.0,"His lectures can be unclear and repetitive, but if you find good study buddies, you should be able to piece it together. If you're late to class or if he catches you texting, he'll chew you out, so be careful. Other than that, he's fairly easygoing."
2072,226397,5.0,4.0,"My favorite teacher! He comes off as intimidating, but he really is awesome. I have learned so much from him. If you put in the time and effort you will get a good grade."
2073,226397,3.5,5.0,Dr. Long gets a bad rap. He's a good professor if you play by his rules. Come to class (he says it's not mandatory but he KNOWS who's there) and pay attention. Don't sleep or read the DM. DON'T bring your cell phone. He lays out on the first day EXACTLY what he wants of you. I took him for every class he taught and made A's
2074,226397,1.5,5.0,Very boring and unclear. Only four people in the class and we were all lost. Avoid like the plague!
2075,226397,3.0,4.0,"He'd tell you you were wrong, opinion-wise, then explain to you exactly why you were wrong. Five minutes later, he'd say exactly what you were saying only worded slightly different. Happened to everyone."
2076,226397,1.0,4.0,"Very arrogant.  Knows Sociology, but not near as smart as he thinks he is. Definitely NOT good at explaining things.  Tries to prove how smart he is by purposely speaking over your head.  Take Grisham instead!"
2077,1555550,5.0,3.0,"Safo is the most caring professor. He always answers everyones questions in depth, and he is always in his office willing to help. If you put the time into Organic Chem, you will get what you receive. He hosts help sessions weekly, gives you a study guide for every test, and gives practice exams from the Summer session. 10000/10 recommend him! "
2078,1555550,4.0,4.0,"This class really prepared me for Chem 105. Dr. Safo is extremely caring and thorough with his lectures. If someone asks a question, he will make sure the question is answered and the asker understands before moving on. If you can work hard and care about your grades, you will be just fine! Please do not be afraid to ask questions!"
2079,1555550,2.0,5.0,class bout killed me so hard to understand
2080,1555550,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Abouku was amazing. I had him for chem 101. He teaches by example. Don't stress about the homework because it is lots harder than what we do in class so it takes some time. The tests look like the examples in class NOT the homework. We did have a couple pop quizzes but he also had extra credit. Overall, great professor, highly recommend."
2081,1555550,1.0,5.0,"He is the worst prof. I have ever had. No personality. He will talk to you like an idiot (Including the TA's and tutors at the chem help desk--you basically are on your own.) His accent is nearly impossible to understand. He makes the homework harder than what he teaches us in class. This class was supposed to help me understand chem, it didn't."
2082,1555550,3.0,5.0,"textbook doesnt help at all with tests. Nice professor but even though you understand the concepts, you can still fail the tests. the same percentage grade in this class will be an entire lower letter than another class do to his specific grading scale."
2083,1555550,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Safo explains things well but only once. ASK QUESTIONS. He will always re-explain if asked. He also holds a help session once a week for students to ask more questions after class. A lot of homework which I never found helpful, and hated. He gives practice test &amp; post answers outside his office, USE THIS. His test are hard, but always similar."
2084,1555550,4.0,3.0,I did enjoy the class overall. His accent was very much an obstacle. I had to teach myself many things in the class. His class control is very little. a very nice and approachable professor. WIlling to meet anytime the student can.
2085,1555550,1.0,4.0,"don't take his class, I could never understand his accent, had to learn everything on my own, SOME HOMEWORK DUE ON SATURDAY NIGHTS"
2086,1555550,4.0,4.0,"Have really enjoyed how he breaks things down to the simplest points ,really cares about his students making it to Chem 105, and writes notes on board at a very reasonable pace. Have enjoyed chemistry much more than high school with him! He does give pop quizzes and make sure you have a calculator!"
2087,1555550,4.0,3.0,"Took a different professor and it sucked, but Safo is the best. Most of the stuff you learn in lecture. he doesn't expect you to know everything so he will stand and explain every step if he needs to."
2088,1555550,2.0,4.0,"very hard teacher, hard to understand, hard test, hard everything. do not recommend for chem 101"
2089,1555550,4.0,2.0,"Safo is a very wonderful professor. Sometimes it is difficult to understand what he is saying, but if you are ever unclear on any of his lectures, he was very approachable and helpful! I have been very pleased with this class and having such a great professor!"
2090,1555550,3.0,5.0,"He is nice, very tough!"
2091,1770591,5.0,2.0,"Porter lectures and from those notes, you'll do well on the exams/papers. We had two exams and he gave possible essay topics beforehand. We also had two essays to write. If you use your lecture notes and be sure to cite from the sources, you should make a B or higher. Porter is a nice guy and is willing to meet with you outside of class as well."
2092,2702434,5.0,3.0,"It is not the easiest class that I have taken but I learned a good amount of stuff, which is harder to say in an online class. Great guy and would take him again."
2093,2118758,5.0,3.0,"Idk why you'd take anyone else for Psy321, Dr. Lair is the best!"
2094,2118758,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lair is the best! She def puts time into making her lectures and really cares about her students! if you have the chance, TAKE HER!!"
2095,2118758,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Lair is amazing at explaining stuff! If you have the chance, take her!!"
2096,2118758,5.0,4.0,"She can be tough, but is ALWAYS willing to help her students. She really understands how to explain hard concepts during lecture and is awesome!!"
2097,1516657,5.0,1.0,"This class was very easy for me and I would 100% recommend. Just go to class and take notes, he is very clear on how to do the problems. Printing out the notes will save you so much time. It is easy to stay along with with what he is doing. DO THE TEST REVIEWS!! This class will not be hard if you just put in the tiniest bit of effort."
2098,1516657,2.0,5.0,I am so defeated with this class. I have been going to tutoring three times a week for 2 hours + since i started this class and have a 50 right now. Ive never been good at math but Im really trying and i thought an online class would be better cause i dont do well in classroom. I know nothing and feel so stupid. Please avoid getting him!!!
2099,1516657,2.0,1.0,"Math 167 as a whole was an unnecessary course, especially for students who have taken Statistics and/or up-to Pre-Calc in high school. Professor Azlin only read over notes that he also sent out and class time did not add much. However, attendance is not mandatory after the first two weeks so take that as you need. The textbook content is online."
2100,1516657,1.0,5.0,"Professor Azlin knows math, his lectures go fast, theres limits to questions. He is rude and assumes all students are cheaters because he has all exams in a signup format to a laboratory and you surrender your phones, calculators and notes. Its overwhelming and causes anxiety. Theres no partial credit, its all or none. Not for non-math majors."
2101,1516657,1.0,5.0,He was not helpful or approachable. Worst online class Ive ever taken in my life.
2102,1516657,5.0,3.0,"Tells you exactly what you need to know for homework, quizzes, and tests"
2103,1516657,4.0,2.0,"If you do the online homework, the quizzes and tests will be easy"
2104,1516657,1.0,3.0,"Everything is online. Homework, tests, quizzes. He is NOT approachable at all. Always asks the class if they have questions.... I asked a question one time and he was very rude back and told me &quot;If I didn't have an exact problem I wanted him to do he couldn't do it&quot;."
2105,1516657,4.0,1.0,"The class is easy, show up to lectures and do the homework. Also, he gives plenty of extra credit opportunities."
2106,1516657,5.0,2.0,really good teacher. homework and practice tests are extra credit and can add up to 8% to your grade. do the homework and you'll probably get an A
2107,1516657,5.0,1.0,"here is the thing. I made an 100 in this class but I understand math by seeing someone work it out. If you can not learn with watching examples over and over again this class isn't for you. But if you can somewhat and do the online practice, quiz, and extra credit homework/ practice tests you are fine. Everything is extra credit."
2108,1516657,1.0,3.0,Azlin stands at the board and does practice problems the entire time.... not helpful at all
2109,1516657,3.0,3.0,"Mr. Azlin offers a ton of bonus points! Plus, he provides optional practice tests which are for bonus points, and the test questions come directly from the practice tests."
2110,1516657,1.0,4.0,Goes too fast in lecture and does not give enough examples. When I take the quizzes I have no idea what to do because of the few examples given to study with. He also clearly gets mad when you ask a question during lecture.
2111,1516657,5.0,3.0,"Just finished his summer algebra and I hop I can take him for calculus in the fall! If you pay attention to him, there is not an excuse to make an A."
2112,1516657,5.0,1.0,A great teacher. I never had an issue in asking him a question in class or in his office. He is more than willing to help.
2113,1516657,1.0,5.0,Hes terrible at lecturing or explaining concepts. Take someone else
2114,1516657,2.0,3.0,"Mr. Azlin made me afraid to ask a question in the remainder of the college classes I took after his class. He becomes obviously annoyed if a student asks a question during his lecture, even if he explicitly asks ""Any Questions?"" before the question is asked. He swiftly works out the problem, after making it clear that it was a huge inconvenience."
2115,1516657,5.0,1.0,Enjoyed his algebra class and am taking again next semester for calculus.
2116,1516657,5.0,2.0,Awesome!
2117,1516657,1.5,4.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFFESSOR. He is literally the worst teacher I have ever had. He makes you feel like an absolute idiot for asking questions and offers no help at all. 
2118,1516657,2.0,5.0,Do not enroll is you aren't already familiar with algebra. If you enroll go to class and take good notes and study at least three hours a day if not you will fail. I didnt really understand his teaching. I had to go to tutoring. 
2119,1516657,4.5,2.0,"Great class, although the software could use a little work.  "
2120,1516657,1.0,5.0,"Horrible teacher.  Tests are taken on a software in the math lab and requires a certain way of inputting answers, yet he teaches it an entirely different way in class.  Lectures are extremely boring"
2121,1516657,1.0,5.0,"Worst Teacher ever. Did not know how to teach, I would learn more online then in class. Avoid if possible"
2122,1516657,2.0,3.0,Rude when you ask questions
2123,1516657,1.0,4.0,Azlin is completely worthless if you ask him a question and doesn't want to work with you at all on what you need help with. Do NOT take him.
2124,1516657,1.5,3.0,He doesn't know what he is teaching. He gets lost in his own work and relies on students to help him. Everyone learned how to do it off of the homework
2125,1516657,1.0,4.0,Does not know what he is teaching. you can't ask him a question without making you feel like a complete idiot. Messes up problems in class all the time and has to rely on students help to correct it
2126,1516657,5.0,3.0,He actually expects his Calculus students to know Algebra...what a refreshing concept.
2127,1516657,1.5,4.0,he is a terrible teacher and gives test problems that know one has seen examples of
2128,1516657,3.5,2.0,"Takes role everyday, overall pretty easy class. He has a tendency of making you feel dumb for asking some questions."
2129,1516657,4.5,2.0,Lectures well. Overall good professor.
2130,1516657,4.0,1.0,Really easy class. sometimes class is mandatory but he will tell you if the next class is or isn't. homework isn't due until right before the test. he posts web tests in advance that are identical to the actual test. I highly recommend this teacher!!
2131,1231985,1.0,5.0,"Horrible professor. Grades everything like you are a PhD candidate in history. He issued 7 pg papers frequently on just lecture and a book, which was hard to fill up"
2132,1231985,3.0,3.0,"Very interesting Civil War class! The grading policy confused me a bit on the essays. A good tip for getting a better grade on the tests is to learn the &quot;totally useless facts&quot; that he gives out like, who was the captain of the Merrimac&#63;"
2133,1231985,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely wonderful professor.  I had him for Civil War, and he made the class interesting for everyone, whether or not the student was interested in the topic originally.  Most of the grades were obtained in essays, which he didn't grade too hard."
2134,930944,4.5,2.0,"Yes, she is boring. However, she is very nice and all you have to do is attend class.. take good notes and then study your notes. EASY A."
2135,930944,4.0,4.0,just go to class and take good notes and you will get a good grade
2136,930944,2.0,5.0,she spoke in a monotonic voice and seemed like she hated her life and everything in it.
2137,930944,4.0,3.0,"Ok instructor, better than others forthis course (gulet)."
2138,930944,4.0,3.0,"Didn't really want to take this class but had to. Miss Jackson was OK, made dull material pretty interesting. You do have to work though."
2139,930944,1.0,5.0,Guys if you want to take a class where the teacher test you on totally random material that has nothing to do with biology and is not in the book. Or if you would like to completely waste a semester of time being bored out of your mind then definitely take Ms. Jackson's class.
2140,2743426,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, would definitely take this class again. The material is great and easy to understand. "
2141,2743426,5.0,3.0,"The class is lecture heavy but he uses slides and will give you time to write them done if you need extra time, and the lectures are pretty interesting. There are no homework assignments but there are weekly readings that you will have a quiz that is 1 short answer question over each week. I would highly recommend taking this class if you need to."
2142,2204803,1.0,3.0,"I took her class as an 8 am, and I regretted it all semester. She doesn't focus on our understanding of the material, she just wants you to memorize formulas. I learned more from the online homework than I ever did sitting in her class."
2143,1154181,4.5,1.0,"Cuilan Gao is a sweetheart. With that said, she is willing to work with students so that you may get the grade that you want. She doesn't openly advertise it, but she will accept test corrections if you go to her office hours and ask her, ""Do you do test corrections?"". Be nice to her and she will raise your test grade accordingly. GPA booster"
2144,1154181,2.5,2.0,If you have any sort of issues with language boundaries then DO NOT take this lady. That's all I can say. Pretty easy class if you do all your work and study of course.
2145,1154181,4.5,1.0,She is great! explains everything so well! i am NOT a math person and had close to a 100 average! LOVED her. English is sometimes hard to understand but you will get used to how she says everything quickly.
2146,1154181,5.0,1.0,Great professor!
2147,1154181,5.0,1.0,fg
2148,1154181,3.0,2.0,Speaks good english for it being her second language. does a good job covering topics. homework is done online and is a gimmie. very helpful.
2149,1657992,5.0,3.0,Makes lectures extremely interesting
2150,1657992,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Haymans does a great job using hilarious real-life experiences to teach material. Very memorable class, but still requires a bit of studying. "
2151,1657992,5.0,3.0,Go to class. He tells you everything you need to know! Easy class if you pay attention &amp; go to class!
2152,1657992,5.0,3.0,Haymans is easily one of my favorite professors I've had. He's very personable and uses real world examples for terms. He pretty much reads through the book in class and tells you what you need to know. Go to class and read through the book and you'll be golden. He does give add an extra 3% to your overall grade if you never miss.
2153,1657992,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Very knowledgeable about law. Can exempt the final if you ace the first 3 tests.
2154,1657992,5.0,3.0,Great teacher! HARD CLASS
2155,1657992,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, should be voted teacher of the year. Only teaches MWF at 8AM, but it is totally worth taking this class. If you read the book when he says to read, it's an easy A."
2156,2000012,2.5,5.0,Nice guy knows his stuff but doesnt know how to teach class average on the test were 50s.
2157,1975437,5.0,3.0,"Shes literally so amazing. Passionate about what she does and wants to see students succeed. Would take her 100 more times and love her, 100/10"
2158,2563214,5.0,2.0,He is easy. Do the work. Go to the concerts. Study. you will be fine. he makes the class fun and gives it a modern twist. all you have to do is the bare minimum.
2159,1774736,5.0,2.0,"I had him on Zoom and it was sad because no one would step up to answer his questions besides one other person and myself. He is so sweet and tries so hard to help everyone. His midterm and final were extremely easy if you actually listen to him when he lectures. He always answered emails and gave credit where credit was due. Great class, easy A."
2160,1774736,3.5,3.0,"He's pretty easy for calculus I. I took him in an honors section. The tests were pretty easy and straight-forward. Go to class and keep up with the notes. If you don't understand something, get some help and learn it way before the test. He spoke good English which is rare for the math department. Good to take for pre-med."
2161,1774736,2.5,4.0,Math 305 is very different from past math classes since its an intro to proofs and logic rather than problem solving. The tests and weekly quizzes can be worded weird. The class is fairly difficult because its so new and different. There's no curves or dropped grades in his class. His explanations can be confusing also. A whole lot of self learning
2162,1774736,3.0,4.0,"Poor communication. If you didn't take Calculus in high school, stay away. He will expect that you've already learned the material. Isn't afraid to make you look like an idiot in front of the entire class."
2163,1774736,4.0,2.0,"He has a slight accent, but I never had trouble understanding what he was saying. He clearly has a clear understanding of the subject matter. He is a great teacher that goes back to basics to teach you the why behind the how of math. The only thing that bothered me was that he would post online assignments (that were short and easy) with no notice."
2164,2759825,4.0,3.0,"He's an easy guy to listen to, and a cool guy in general. Exams are relatively difficult, but get easier as the year progresses. His offered extra credit is what saved me in his class. I had a C at the time of Thanksgiving break, but ended the course with an A-."
2165,261266,3.5,5.0,"The most impressive man I've known. Love him still, 23 years later"
2166,261266,4.0,3.0,Great Professor his exam was not that hard if you just memorized the cases.
2167,261266,3.5,3.0,"Classic law school Con Law professor.  I feel as if I  am part of history by having taken his Con Law course over the summer at Fordham.  Still remember some of his phrases to this day, ""That's what you get from an 80 IQ City lawyer"" and  ""Citing what?"" Will destroy you if you are unprepared or say something dumb."
2168,261266,5.0,5.0,Still remember the class 30 years later.  Made me think and want to learn.
2169,261266,4.5,5.0,You haven't had the full law school experience until you've had Prof. Cochran. Amazing professor and person.
2170,261266,3.5,5.0,"Not for the shy and sensitive, but he is a great teacher. He will make you think like a lawyer. Test is very challenging - yes, you really will need to know the holding for 700+ cases."
2171,261266,4.0,5.0,"Good 'Ole George Cochran. Although harmless you better have you're unprepared sign up if you don't want to get tore up. Favorite quotes: &quot;Caves, is this case giving you puppies&#63;&quot; &quot;Remember anything outta Louisiana is squirrelly.&quot;"
2172,261266,4.5,5.0,"The Man. The Myth. The Legend. Until you have him, you don't understand. Enjoyed his class."
2173,261266,5.0,5.0,great socratic method
2174,261266,4.5,5.0,Best class I've taken.  Challenging and difficult and invigorating.  No one knows Con Law better than Cochran and his students.  Stern in class but a great man.
2175,261266,4.5,5.0,"Unless you have had him, you will just never know."
2176,261266,5.0,5.0,"The most scary teacher I have ever had.  However, when you finish the class you will feel like you can do anything.  Amazing man."

2181,261267,5.0,1.0,Wonderful teacher!  Fun and interesting but EASY class!
2182,261267,5.0,3.0,Best in at the law school.  Truly the most caring professor.
2183,261267,4.5,4.0,Great teacher...Best in school!

2190,261267,5.0,3.0,"SO sorry if you are not in Derrick's class. Everyone else sucks!!! However, you should be able to find him at City Grocery if you would like to chat. Great guy all around and an excellent LRW professor."

2193,2319504,5.0,3.0,"Attendance is not mandatory but gives bonus points. Tests are difficult, group projects are big."
2194,2563215,5.0,3.0,"Her class was one of my favorites. She was a great professor, and she was super nice and understanding. If you participate in class, some days she will give you bonus points after class. For every test, you can get five bonus points with an extra credit assignment. Those never took more than maybe an hour or hour and a half. 10/10 professor."
2195,2563215,4.0,3.0,"This was my favorite class of the semester. Dr. Skipworth is very sweet, and it is obvious she wants her students to succeed. You can't skip if you want to pass, but the lectures really aren't all that bad. The curriculum is super test heavy, but she always offers extra credit and gives great study guides. Would definitely take it again."
2196,2563215,4.0,2.0,"Gives you a study guide for each test. Lots of multiple choice. She tries her best to make it interesting and allows lot of discussion, which is fun."
2197,1868953,4.5,4.0,"Don't take his class if you want an easy A. You don't need the book in class but you have to read it all on your own. He is a very nice teacher and passionate about music. He always plays cool, entertaining videos before class. He is a really good teacher but his tests are really hard. You have to study A LOT"
2198,1868953,3.0,4.0,I would NOT recommend taking him if you are looking for an easy Fine Arts credit to fulfill. You will have listening journals and discussion boards due every friday and sunday which are usually 250+ words. You have to study a whole lot for his tests in order to get a good grade. The whole class wasn't ever thrilled to be there.
2199,468125,1.0,5.0,"She will give you a test on things that were barely covered. The assignments and study tools given will not have things from the test. Her test are incredibly hard, and she doesn't curve. You will have to teach yourself everything and if you email her, she's going to give you a snarky response. My biggest advice, take it at a community college. "
2200,468125,4.0,2.0,"I actually took BISC 310(Human Anatomy). All you really need to do is read the power points. All of the study materials are on Mastering Anatomy; just go to the study area. She tells exactly what you need to know. I studied about 6 hours/week. You don't have to go to lecture to pass. For Lab, I don't recommend giving much thought to Body Viz. "
2201,468125,1.0,4.0,"YOU TEACH YOURSELF EVERYTHING. Take it from me, someone who got an A, I spent about 7-12 hours (depending on when the test was) doing assignments and studying for this class our of lecture. Lecture is so unhelpful. Also, when you email her, she is very sassy. I feel bad for her because you have to be really miserable to be this bad of a teacher."
2202,468125,1.0,5.0,Britson seriously tries to make this class signifcantly harder than what it needs to be. I understand that it is a complex subject but she spends too much time talking about irrelevant content and as a lecturer she is boring and uninspiring. Britson sucks the life out of the course and the tests are very difficult and almost impossible to study for
2203,468125,1.0,3.0,"She is the worst teacher I've ever had. She spends about 15 minutes of EVERY class talking about random thing about how many kids fail. It gets old after the first couple lectures. Maybe if she taught more instead of talked about how many people failed, less people would fail. You can learn what you need to know from the book."
2204,468125,1.0,5.0,"If you're not married to this class DO NOT TAKE IT. Britson's tests are almost impossible to do well on. I have taken her twice and the highest test score I ever received was a 74. She gets off topic easily and rambles during lecture. Lab is decent, practicals can be tough. Test reviews are always much simpler and easier than the actual test."
2205,468125,1.0,5.0,"Britson is the worst teacher you could have for a subject like this. She expects way too much for this to be an entry level class. It is nearly impossible to pass, therefore, if you are an A student get ready to lower your standards. Get ready to dedicate your entire life to this one course, because that is what she expects you to do."
2206,468125,1.0,4.0,The worst teacher I've ever had. For a class that hundreds have to take to graduate she makes it IMPOSSIBLE to feel successful in the class. She gets off topic during lectures and spend most of her time in lectures telling her class what they're doing wrong. Tests are impossible and homework is heavy. She does not care about her students success
2207,468125,1.0,5.0,"She gives a lot of homework, which could potentially be good, but it is usually 2-3 assignments each night, which consumes A LOT of time. Her tests are ridiculously hard. The only good thing about this class is that lab isn't a nightmare. She gets really off topic and doesn't seem to care about her student's success very much. Buckle down with Brit"
2208,468125,2.0,4.0,Lectures tended to stray off topic on a daily basis. Dr. Britson frequently got on a soap box and started ranting about philosophical things instead of actual subject material.
2209,468125,2.0,5.0,"I took this course as a Junior. By far the hardest class I have ever taken, and I've taken Organic I &amp;II. She's very monotone. Her tests are stupid hard. She lays out everything you need to get an A (or even just pass), but what that includes doing means you can't do anything else. ALL SEMESTER. She knows what she's talking about, but still hard."
2210,468125,1.0,5.0,"The lectures do not correlate with the textbook or laboratory material, the exams are unnecessarily difficult (purposefully designed to fail), and the instructor lacks sympathy for many struggling students. This course is basically a &quot;weed out class&quot; for students who are unable to treat it as their main and only priority. Take Carla Car if you can."
2211,468125,1.0,5.0,"-tenured -zero empathy -extremely hard tests contain subjects from lecture, but the applications of subject which she never goes over, you must figure those out on your own, knowing definitions and relationships of anatomy are not enough, you must understand function, lapse of function, and then know what physiologically happens in that instance"
2212,468125,2.0,5.0,"Her job is basically to give you the bare minimum and it's a weed out class so she is not much help. Don't bother trying to create a relationship with her, she has no sympathy and lacks social awareness. Very smart though. Study your ass off"
2213,468125,3.0,4.0,"She is such an amazing teacher. A very hard class, but lab is fun and she makes the lectures interesting and funny. Sure, it can be boring, but it was my favorite class. Make sure to get the book, you're gonna need to read all of the pages for tests and quizzes. You have to work hard for your grade. Best class I've ever taken. "
2214,468125,5.0,1.0,"Very easy recitation leader! You have to read some books, but they are about health care and are pretty interesting. If you are pre-med, you should definitely take her!"
2215,468125,2.5,4.0,"She's really into this subject, but super boring to sit and listen to. It sucks that they only offer the course at one time and that's 8:00 am. The class is challenging; you definitely have to study if you want to pass."
2216,468125,2.0,1.0,"Her test policy screwed my grade because she would not let me take an exam I missed because of car issues after I had already missed one due to car issues.  I offered documentation for each instance and each time she informed me that I would have to rely on the Make-Up Quiz online at the end of the term. Unfortunately, it only replaces one exam."
2217,468125,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Britson is a good teacher, and is really passionate about biology.  If you take her biology class, make sure you read the chapters as well as your notes and you should do fine.  I started back to school straight out of the Marine Corps and got an A.. It is definitely possible"
2218,468125,3.5,1.0,"A little foggy to understand, but pretty easy and very nice."
2219,468125,1.0,3.0,"I found the solution to this class. What you do is sneak in to the room 15 minutes before class and leave a voice activated recorder on the chalk holder of the chalkboard.  She talks extremely slow for an hour.  You come back after class, get the recorder and listen to it on double speed.  This way she talks normal speed and class only lasts 30 min"
2220,468125,1.5,3.0,Her notes are only an outline of the chapter even though she expects you to know all of the details in the book...read the chapter and take your own notes during class..theres no point in listening to her teach
2221,468125,4.0,3.0,Good teacher. You just have to study for her tests! She will be glad to help you also.
2222,468125,2.0,3.0,she talks wayyy too slow
2223,468125,2.0,5.0,This is the hardest teacher in the world. It sounded like she is talking to astronauts
2224,468125,4.5,2.0,"the class is rather easy, she has a theory that no one should ever make a 100 on her test, but she does curve... her tests are pretty much straight from the book, notes in class do help and give you something to study by. she makes random statements and is overall a good professor."
2225,468125,3.0,5.0,"She's a very good teacher, just makes it difficult to understand what she's teaching."
2226,468129,5.0,2.0,Nice Guy
2227,468129,5.0,1.0,"He is a very good teacher, and it was a very easy class. Be sure to go to class & take good notes!"
2228,468129,4.5,3.0,No Comments
2229,468129,4.5,2.0,It's pretty easy if you already have some sort of background with algebra.  He teaches it well and is willing to help.
2230,2540716,5.0,4.0,"Had him for southern history. Great guy and hilarious for a early class. Very interesting topics and relates it to the present. a lot of reading but its not a freshmen class. Have to come to class, participate and lead discussions but not hard. Turn in reading notes snd write three papers."
2231,2540716,2.0,4.0,This professor makes you study over 100 terms and then tests you on 7 of them on the exam. Brutal. 
2232,2540716,4.0,3.0,-Took his class via remote and it was an easy class. -As long as you do the work you will do well. - Mainly based off of reading and watching material. -Have to write 1 page papers but they're super easy and he doesnt grade them tough. -Very easy to email and will respond almost immediately. -Very willing to work with students and is nice
2233,2540716,5.0,5.0,You wont pass if you dont show up! But worth taking with him!
2234,2540716,3.0,5.0,"Attendance isn't mandatory, but you have 0 CHANCE of passing if you don't attend every day. Get ready to take notes by hand. He puts a detailed &quot;course pack&quot; on Blackboard, but it's only good for organizing the notes you take in class. No recording or electronics in class. 3 500-wd essays, 3 non-cumulative exams, 0 curves. YOU'VE GOTTA G R I N D."
2235,1707181,1.0,4.0,"This is not an easy A class. Excused absences still count toward your total absences unless you have covid. So if you have more than 5, you drop letter grades. Assigns WAY too much reading. The quizzes aren't hard, but there is so much reading to do that you have to read everything to do good in this class. He takes this class way too seriously."
2236,1707181,5.0,3.0,a wonderful man and a wonderful prof
2237,1707181,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Gussow is one of the smartest professors I've ever had. I'm not going to lie and say it was easy, it maybe was the hardest class I had that semester. That said, he knows what he's talking about and he really cares about his students, especially if you talk in class and show you're trying. If you make it clear you are trying, he'll grade easier."
2238,1707181,2.0,4.0,If you love yourself then don't take his Southern Studies class. This is the worst class I have EVER taken. Be ready to read at least 15-20 pages a night at a minimum for this class. Do. Not. Take. This. Class.
2239,1707181,1.0,5.0,"Most likely the most boring class I have ever taken. I took this class expecting it to be a joke but it was very hard, he made us do so much work. He holds you over every day. I do not recommend taking this class with Gussow at all."
2240,1707181,3.5,3.0,"Professor specializes in African-American literature, along with blues material. Interprets this into most of the lectures. Overall, a class that brings about creativity. hard work gets a B+. An A is very difficult. Overall, a good experience, not to difficult."
2241,2047151,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Not difficult if you put effort into the class. (Reading is important -- you might get called on if you aren't participating.) There's no textbook, just novels and a few nonfiction books. Professor Atkins is accessible to students and a very interesting person -- he spent years as a journalist, covering politics and labor unions."
2242,1979568,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lantagne has been one of my favorite professors this semester. She is very knowledgeable and interesting, and I would definitely take her again. There aren't many assignments and as long as you participate in class, you should be fine."
2243,1979568,5.0,2.0,"I absolutely loved having Professor Lantagne for Honors 101. If I could take her again, I would do it in a heartbeat. She was so kind and actually cared about her students' success. She is also very understanding. She doesn't assign a ton of assignments at all, but make sure you complete them on time. She is one of the best professors I've had."
2244,1979568,4.0,3.0,She loves Intellectual Property and the like areas. She articulates concepts very well and has great slideshow presentations. You are expected to read a lot of text. She is able to get through it. She does cold call but the cases are usually clear and she only expects you to know the basics.
2245,1979568,4.5,3.0,She is funny. She is specific. She writes interesting exams. She has a real-world approach to everything and brings old cases to you with a modern scope.  She also writes fantasy novels and exams will reflect this.
2246,2155697,5.0,2.0,"Lectures are quite amusing. Tests are fair, while quizzes are somewhat questionable; however, still easy (and rather pleasant) A."
2247,1848499,5.0,2.0,"Very easy class. You will learn a lot from Nadia. She's funny and interacts with the class. Put an hour into studying for test and you will Ace it. Don't buy book, you won't use it. All notes are on Blackboard. Highly Recommend you take her. Shes great."
2248,2155700,5.0,2.0,"Exceptional lectures, clear explanations and examples. Tons of bonus points, almost always dismisses early."
2249,2155705,4.0,3.0,"Took Moen for Econ 202. Class was mainly lecture focused, with no homework, 3 tests and a final. Very laid back and does his best to make it interesting by making up real examples of microeconomics in effect. Come to class and you will do well."
2250,2155705,4.0,3.0,"Very good. Took him for Econ 202, which is basic micro. He seems to be more sophisticated for such an entry level class and caught himself getting into higher course material often. Very laidback and let us keep notes on the whiteboard during exams."
2251,2155705,4.0,3.0,"Never cares about attendance, yet you have to be in class every time in order to pass the tests, since the textbook is perfectly useless. Lectures are clear and useful though. Grading is hard, yet fair. Never returns emails and almost impossible to get in touch outside class."
2252,1559737,5.0,1.0,She was very scary the first day but she's super nice! We watched the Social Network and the Office in class. Her class is really fun and easy. Take her!!
2253,1559737,4.0,1.0,"She is a great teacher, and doesnt have require much homework at all. Always willing to help, and easy to understand. She either love or hates you."
2254,1557691,5.0,3.0,Writing this way after my years there so I couldn't remember the course code. I had her for ecology and I took her entomology class. She is great! Very funny but she is particular. She likes things to be neat when turned in and values professional work. She was my advisor as well. Just get to know her and she will help a lot through your schooling.
2255,1557691,2.0,2.0,"Kind of rude and a little scatterbrained. Best bet for the tests is to memorize the bold terms in the book and look at the pictures. Test covers 4 chapters. Attendance mandatory, assigns last minute homework in class. No quizzes."
2256,1557691,3.5,3.0,She's funny
2257,2155707,2.0,2.0,"Very sweet man, but very difficult to understand during lectures. His accent is not that bad, but he does not explain the material well and is very all over the place during class. Tests are very similar to the practice tests. I only passed this class because I took calculus last year. Do not recommend if youve never taken calculus before!"
2258,2155707,5.0,3.0,I learned a lot from this professor. I had some worry before I took it since I am not good in math. But he made it quite clear. I do not hate math that much any more
2259,2155707,4.0,4.0,He is an excellent instructor
2260,2155707,3.0,3.0,"90-100% of his tests were multiple choice. His teaching style isn't favorable, but if you have decent background in math, the class if fairly easy."
2261,2155707,1.0,4.0,"His English (was it English?) is impossible. Lectures are mess, can't answer most questions. Tests were designed for another class with different timing. Gives some curve while grading though."
2262,1979581,4.0,1.0,A lot is boring to sit through. It feels like she is trying to teach you how to use Google. There are some gems hidden in there and she's extremely helpful.
2263,574654,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2264,2182335,1.0,5.0,"She is a very nice teacher, but tests are very hard. Quiz's were not difficult, but tests were virtually impossible. She is good at working out problems in class, but the test questions are completely different. If you can take this class with another professor do it. Avoid her at all costs!!"
2265,2182335,4.0,1.0,"Super sweet and really cares about her students! Show up and take notes, class and tests are difficult though."
2266,2182335,2.0,5.0,She's really nice but her class is difficult if you don't have accounting experience. She doesn't explain things very well. Homework is due every class and there are quizzes in class occasionally.
2267,2018493,4.0,3.0,"This was his first semester at UCONN. Very knowledgeable and not afraid to tell it like it is. Online homeworks and quizzes were tough and time consuming, but doing them made tests easier. A few group projects, but nothing too difficult. Very accessible and flexible."
2268,2018493,5.0,5.0,"There needs to be more teachers at Ole Miss like Dr. Miller. His expertise in his study is extensive and impressive and I am very glad I had the pleasure of being able to take his course. I am sad to see Dr. Miller leave Ole Miss but I know he is meant to do great things. Congratulations and best of luck in your new position, you will be missed!"
2269,2018493,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Miller is one of the greatest professors in the accounting school at Ole Miss that I have had the pleasure of being taught. His teaching skill and style is equally matched with his outgoing personally and ability to connect with his students. Simply put, Dr. Miller made attending his class an enjoyable experience that I will always value"
2270,2018493,5.0,3.0,Dr. Miller has been by far one of my favorite professors I have had. He cares about his students and if you work hard in the class it will pay off!!! Not only is he a great professor but he also cares about his students success in real life. TAKE THIS PROFESSOR and LISTEN to his advice.
2271,2018493,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Miller is a fantastic teacher! He helps you out if you need it, and he really wants his students to do well in the class. He makes the class fun, which makes it easier to learn. He is very funny, and I would definitely recommend taking him if you get the chance!"
2272,2018493,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I had this semester.  Maybe the best accounting professor I've had at this school.  If you get the chance to take his class, I would highly recommend.  Good teacher, very relatable, & genuinely wants his students to succeed in & out of his classroom.  Plus he's a funny guy & makes lectures entertaining."
2273,2018493,5.0,4.0,He is the best teacher I have ever had!!!
2274,2018493,5.0,4.0,"He is a hilarious teacher. He makes you work for your grades, but makes sure you understand what is going on in  class. I would recommend all students to take him."
2275,2018493,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Miller is one of my favorite professors I have ever had.  He truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed inside and outside the classroom.  His class was very informative, and he is very helpful when it comes to giving advice about future career decisions."

2277,2018493,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Miller is one of the best professors I've ever had. Very challenging and informative class. Always willing to answer questions about class topics or other accounting related topics. Always had a great way of connecting how what we are learning now, will help us in the professional side. Any school would be crazy not hire and/or give him tenure."
2278,2018493,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Miller's class is challenging as it should be, but he goes the extra mile for his students. He treated us like young professionals in class & showed us how Cost Accy is applicable for the future & the CPA Exam. He takes the time to get to know his students during the semester & he wrote me a rec letter for a senior scholarship which I received!"
2279,2018493,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Miller is awesome! He will go the extra mile for you. If you don't understand something, ask questions! HE WILL HELP. He is also willing to help with any of your other classes. He is an excellent example of how all professors should be. Oh, and he holds review sessions. I know y'all don't mind some extra help before an accounting test.."
2280,2018493,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Miller was hands down one of the best professors I have ever had. Apart from motivating you to learn the material for the class, he strives to help students find and maximize their potential as students and as professionals. If I could take him for every class I have from here on out, I would. Dr. Miller is a 10/10."
2281,2018493,5.0,4.0,Fantastic professor - truly cares about your future in school and career! Highly advised to attend class to understand the material as well as read the book.

2284,2018493,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Miller is there for you in and out of class to help you with your studies. He mixes in real world news about accounting, which is really helpful. His lectures were clear and easy to understand, his tests were manageable if you did the homework and came to class. Overall one of the best professors I've had at Ole Miss, definitely recommend."
2285,2018493,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Miller was one of the best teachers I had. He was flexible with his schedule to go over homework problems, test questions, and help in general. I had to work hard, but he helped me in the long run not lose any motivation to pass."
2286,2018493,5.0,3.0,Dr. Miller has been one of my favorite accounting professors. As long as you attend class regularly and keep up with the assigned homework/readings you will do well. During his lectures he makes sure that all his students understand the material before moving on to the next problem. He truly is a professor that wants his students to succeed.
2287,2018493,5.0,4.0,This is the best teacher I've ever had! Not only does he care about your grade but he cares about you!

Not only was he an excellent teacher, he cared for his students ability to learn the material and was available to help any time you needed it. Dr. Miller taught me how to study and succeed in difficult classes. I genuinely enjoyed attending class, he made accounting fun to learn."
2290,2018493,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Miller cares about his students learning, not just passing exams or getting through a class. He puts cost accounting into terms very relatable to college kids. (He's hilarious.) He only gives HW to help your learning not as busy work. His tests weren't too difficult, bc he always prepared you for what would be on there. Overall great professor."
2291,2018493,5.0,3.0,Always knew what would be on the test. Great teacher really learned the materiel.
2292,2018493,5.0,3.0,"Great professor; goes the extra mile for all his students- even after the become an ""alumni"" of his class; truly goes above and beyond the normal realm of what the average professor does; university is extremely lucky to have him"
2293,2018493,5.0,3.0,"Here's a guy who gets it. He really wants to teach and he wants you to learn. DO NOT miss a class!!  He is by far my best professor in college. Buckle down, study and pay attention in class, and  you will walk away with a great understanding of accounting. I would definitely take any class this guy was teaching. "
2294,1832130,5.0,4.0,"Professor Feng is very devoted to her students and does her best to make sure that we learn this extremely difficult material. This is another Flagship level class, and  professor Feng works diligently at making sure that every student thrives and offers time outside. She is so nice and so much fun, but we still learn a lot. The best Chinese teac"
2295,1832130,5.0,4.0,An amazing women with an amazing talent for teaching a foreign language to students who have little to no experience prior to her class.
2296,1832130,5.0,4.0,"Feng was the most cheerful and enthusiastic instructor I have ever had. She made me incredibly excited to be a part of the Chinese program. Absolutely amazing... if you are on the wall about it, she will make you love being there and studying Chinese."
2297,1754312,4.0,4.0,I love Dr. Becker! She is so sweet and helpful. I am so happy to have her as a teacher and will take her again. She truly cares about you and your success if you put in the work. I have fallen in love with Latin and Classics because of her passion. 
2298,1754312,4.0,3.0,"Great instructor, so sincere and passionate"
2299,1754312,5.0,2.0,SUPER sweet and helpful. Loves when students come to office hours. She's sometimes kinda awkward but a very very sweet and helpful person.
2300,1754312,5.0,3.0,A wonderful teacher and person!
2301,1754312,4.5,3.0,I love Dr. Becker. Yes you have vocab quizzes every other day but you learn the material and she really is interested in you getting it. Her enthusiasm for Latin is absolutely contagious and even on your worst mornings she can make you crack a smile!
2302,1754312,4.5,3.0,Warning: Dr. Becker's enthusiasm is contagious. She is also just a wonderful person.
2303,1754312,4.5,3.0,Super enthusiastic about Latin. SOOO helpful if you ask. You NEED the book she tells you to get. You literally cannot survive without it.
2304,1338569,4.5,4.0,"Her class was one of my favorites, and I did not expect to like a Spanish class. She was very patient and fair, but not boring. I learned more than I expected."
2305,1338569,4.0,4.0,Ms. Schimmel was a great teacher.  It was my first time taking a foreign language and she was very patient and helpful.
2306,1338569,1.5,5.0,took this class because of need to move along in Spanish requirements...she expected you to know Spanish before coming to the class...after a week informed class that she will no longer be speaking English...thinks because she studied abroad and speaks fluently that you should be able to also...shes a grad student and wants you to know it....avoid
2307,64715,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Lawhead is the best teacher. He has perspective and I never felt overwhelmed by his class. Even though class is mostly based on participation, he doesn't really penalize you if you don't like to speak out in class. There are papers, but he is a fair grader and the only other work is discussion questions each class. Took him for 101 and 102!!"
2308,64715,4.5,3.0,great
2309,64715,5.0,4.0,lawhead is the man. he is smarter than you. and anyone youll ever meet.
2310,64715,5.0,3.0,You do not know but he is independantly wealthy and does not have to teach but God gave him a task.
2311,64715,3.5,4.0,"liked the class, was semi-hard, but enjoyed his sense of humor"
2312,64715,5.0,2.0,good class
2313,64715,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lawhead earned my devotion and respect by going out of his way to help me when he didn't have to, and when I didn't really deserve it. On top of that, the class was interesting and stimulating."
2314,64715,3.0,3.0,"I have to echo boring boring boring below.  Perhaps it was the time of day I had class... draining... Often we wouldn't have class, though.  Thought that was cool at the time."
2315,64715,5.0,3.0,Great class.  Everyone should take it.
2316,2723020,4.0,2.0,she was amazing! everyday she would make us laugh. homework was easy and she graded things very quickly. 
2317,2723020,1.0,4.0,If you expect to learn anything from this professor you are wrong. On top of constant mistakes and errors made in class she jumps around and gets into weird tangents completely irrelevant to math. There is a fine line between trying to be a funny relatable teacher and actually doing your job. 
2318,2723020,3.0,3.0,She can be confusing
2319,2723020,3.0,3.0,"Take full advantage of her office hours. I honestly didn't learn anything from her, I got a tutor and taught myself the material off Hawkes, everything she does is through Hawkes learning site. If you don't understand something Hawkes while it is a pain, is very resourceful. Some people love her, some don't, she's not bad you should pass."
2320,2723020,3.0,1.0,"Julie is literally so insane. Like. I taught myself the entire course but that's because I go really fast. She's a fine teacher she just goes off-topic the entire time. You never know what's gonna come out of her mouth. She's hysterical in the most randomized way possible. Class is really easy though. We learn about mean, median, and mode."
2321,2723020,3.0,3.0,Sometimes goes off topic in lectures. Homework is weekly but most of it can be done quickly. You can honestly teach yourself if you do the practice before the certify. My big issue is that she doesn't enter grades into Black Board which makes it difficult to track your progress. Tests are never multiple choice so you need to know the material
2322,2723020,5.0,2.0,"SHE IS THE BEST!!!!!! I am so sad I can't take her again. She is so funny and really like to joke around but also a good teacher. As long as you do the homework and do the practice test you should make an A no problem! She can be a little all over the place at times, but it's funny and she is awesome at her job!!!!"
2323,2045133,5.0,3.0,"He is easily my favorite professor. He is from Sicily, but his English is good, although he does not know any slang, and he will sometimes use the wrong word which can be hilarious.  He is a generous grader, but we have homework every night (completion).  Its easy to keep an A if you work hard, but if you don't work it's an easy class to fail. "
2324,2723023,5.0,1.0,"So sweet. Really like her, but she takes the EDHE class more serious than it seems it should be, but as long as you do the things she assigns, which is not difficult at all, you will an A."
2325,1752270,5.0,1.0,"Simply the best, and totally hot. Tells great stories. "
2326,1752270,5.0,1.0,"Great professor, very interesting and hilarious.  Realistic about expectations and an expert on his subject of teaching."
2327,2233554,5.0,3.0,"Literally the best professor in the entire school, if not the world. Great teacher, great person, super cool."
2328,2233554,5.0,3.0,Total eye candy. Study the PowerPoints and you'll do well on the tests. Really nice and makes it easy to meet with him if you can't go during his office hours.
2329,2233554,5.0,3.0,He enjoys teaching and gets along with everyone. Makes good connections so you can understand the lectures. Plus nice eye candy to look at!!
2330,2233554,5.0,3.0,"Solid professor all around. Was laid back and easy to work with but doesn't accept late work. Pretty funny guy, kept the class interested in what he was talking about. One of the best professors I've had since I've been at Ole Miss."
2331,2233554,4.0,3.0,"Super chill, loves to make movie references and south park. pretty lax on attendance but assignments are due on the set date. no late work"
2332,2178259,5.0,1.0,"Bailey is truly the greatest teacher I have ever had at the University! He makes the lectures so interesting. Attendance is not required, but notes are very important to have. No tests, only papers for midterm and final. All papers were directly from the notes that I took in class. THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!!!!!"
2333,2178259,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite Professors. Although I already love history, Professor Bailey found a way to make it better. He keeps lectures entertaining and does a great job of keeping personal biases from altering his teaching. Expect to write a lot but you won't have any tests besides an easy 10 question quiz once a week."
2334,2178259,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Bailey was a good teacher, just a lot of papers. Lectures are kinda pointless as you are never tested on the lectures expect for weekly 10 question quiz. The TA does not provide feedback on the papers you turn in, nor does he tell you why you made what you did on that paper."
2335,2178259,4.0,3.0,"Matthew Bailey is a really goofy guy and he's great. Heavy on lectures and zero tests. All main assignments were papers. The worst part about the class was the TA though, he graded really hard. Other than that great class."
2336,2178259,2.0,4.0,"There are multiple papers throughout the semester that you will have to read books for outside of class. There are also journals all the time. For a history class there is heavy writing. 1-2 lecture quizzes every week that are easy if you go to class. He does not cut slack for late assignments, even if your grandma dies."
2337,2178259,5.0,2.0,He's awesome. Literally do the bare minimum by attending class and paying attention and you will get an A. He is lecture heavy but entertaining and grades by weekly quizzes and a few essays.
2338,2178259,1.0,1.0,"I had strep for the first two weeks and emailed him about it. He told me that the only exception he makes for absences is for students with covid because the university policies require it, so I wouldn't recommend it if you plan on getting sick at all."
2339,2178259,4.0,4.0,Entire class time was just lectures so take really good notes and youll do fine on the quizzes. Midterm and final exams are papers. Some of the assignments were annoying but overall not that hard of a class. Hes also a really funny guy
2340,2178259,5.0,3.0,"great lectures with weekly open note quizzes to boost your grade. I enjoyed going to each of his classes even at 9 am. beware the only way to get the answers for these quizzes is to go to class because there's no book. there's also no big exams, just papers which is great. he's a blast, take his class!!!"
2341,2178259,4.0,4.0,Dr. Bailey's lectures are great. He takes attendance 95% of the time. Don't take this class if you don't like writing. Midterm and final are papers. No homework besides weekly lecture quizzes and usually journals about every other week. 3 other average sized papers due within the semester too
2342,2178259,4.0,1.0,Pretty easy going teacher and a very easy class. Don't be stupid and you will get an A
2343,2178259,3.0,4.0,"Took him for Mississippi History. The class itself is really interesting and the material is easy to learn but, theres one problem, he doesn't test on the material learned in class!! Each grade is a paper about books you must read outside of class. Not a single test on the info learned in class. Whats the point of going then!"
2344,2178259,4.0,3.0,Attendance is mandatory but once you get there you don't really have to listen. There is four grades the entire class and they are based off of outside readings. He can be a tough grader on papers but if you send it to him before he'll give you feedback to improve your grade.
2345,566500,4.5,3.0,Wonderful teacher 
2346,566500,4.5,2.0,She is seriously the best professor that I have had at Ole Miss. Knows the subject matter very well. History is supposed to be a flunk out course at Ole Miss but she makes it easier. She will work with you as well. The only down fall to her class is the extra reading that you have to do & weekly writing assignment. I think her tests were easy.
2347,566500,5.0,4.0,"She is a great lady and really knows her field.  She was nice enough to do an independent study over summer term, which most professors would not do.  She is truely superior."
2348,566500,3.5,5.0,Good teacher but has really hard tests
2349,566500,3.5,5.0,She really knows the material that she is teaching and is very nice. The exams are almost impossible and cover way too much material. You have to come to lecture everyday and take notes from beginning to end in order to do well on the exams. Whatever you do DO NOT get Katrina Sims as your TA she is horrible.
2350,566500,5.0,5.0,Dr. Skemp is very approachable after class and in her office hours. She is very friendly and helpful. Someone said she was not approachable and I just find that hard to believe. I think you just need to get to know her and you will find that she is actually quite approachable.
2351,566500,4.5,5.0,Very difficult but not impossible.  I learned a lot.  She was extremely helpful outside of class to me.
2352,566500,5.0,4.0,Good professor -- knew her stuff
2353,566500,3.0,3.0,She is somewhat animated.  Very focused on women's rights and a strong liberal political view that comes out in every class.  Knows her stuff but fairly unapproachable and unfriendly.  Don't expect anything from her after class.
2354,566500,1.0,3.0,Stay away from her classes.  If she had not had a TA I would not have learned a thing.
2355,2438376,1.0,4.0,He is one of the hardest professors I have ever had. His work load is a lot-- I would not complain if it were not a 100 level class. He does give a lot of extra credit and is a picky grader.
2356,2438376,5.0,4.0,Lots of readings but is an easy grader. kind of spacey. i learned a lot tho. he knows his stuff id take his course again
2357,2632939,5.0,3.0,"The best professor that I have had at the University of Mississippi by far. His class is the perfect balance between having a relaxed, easy paced schedule that you can get an A in while also being able to learn Arabic. Would strongly recommend!"
2358,2632939,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic teacher, very funny. A bit frustrating that he assumes we know dialect nuances sometimes but overall super easy class. Barely any homework and he makes it really enjoyable."
2359,2632939,5.0,4.0,Literally one of my favorite professors ever. Really engaging and super helpful. Does make you do a lot of homework though and you definitely have to pay attention. Can be a bit blunt at times but all around a great teacher.
2360,1344750,5.0,1.0,Great instructor.
2361,1344750,1.0,3.0,Does not seem to know what she is doing most of the time.
2362,1344752,2.0,3.0,No Comments
2363,1754359,5.0,4.0,"I love Dr. Holt. She is so sweet! I had her for Shakespeare, Literary Criticism, and Introduction to Film. She works with her students and is highly intelligent."
2364,1754359,5.0,3.0,"She's pretty amazing! She has the patience of a saint, and gives great feedback. Just an excellent teacher."
2365,1754359,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Holt is hands-down one of the best teachers I have ever had. She is incredibly passionate about what she does. She works with every student to help them succeed. Her lectures are thoughtful, insightful, and easy to listen to. I would recommend her to anyone."
2366,1754359,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Holt can make Literary criticism interesting! She is organized, and everything you need to be successful is ready the first day of class. She is not critical, but helpful, and always willing to take the extra time to help students. She uses media, film, and texts to help students get the most out of class.  Interesting & fun, she is great!"
2367,1754359,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Holt brings great enthusiasm to all of her classes! She helps the student understand the material and learn to apply the critics' theories to literature. She rights extremely well, and expects the same, but goes to great extreme to teach the students what she looks for in papers. She obviously loves her work and is excellent at it!"
2368,646394,5.0,3.0,"Such a sweet professor. It is very evident that he cares about his students and their wellbeing. Although his prompts can be a little confusing at times, he is super willing to help you and gives good feedback. If he can tell you're putting in effort, you'll do completely fine. I plan on taking him again in the future for sure."
2369,646394,5.0,3.0,"Professor Dolan is SO great. He's passionate and awesome! He's not SUPER difficult with assignments or grading. His prompts can be a little confusing, but he is awesome for the most part!"
2370,646394,5.0,4.0,Great class!
2371,646394,5.0,3.0,"Amazing man. He can sometimes be vague, so be prepared for that, but other than that he is one of the most caring professors. He wants to know you and watch you learn. Definitely participate in discussions, you'll get brownie points that way. He's an okay grader, but gives good feedback if you make mistakes. Seriously an amazing, sweet man."
2372,646394,5.0,3.0,Sweet sweet man
2373,646394,4.0,3.0,No Comments
2374,2057466,5.0,2.0,I loved this class and I loved Professor Hobbs. She's the most relaxed professor on the UM campus. She gives great feedback on your stories. All you have to do is make sure you WRITE your stories and have them turned in on time and there won't be any problems.
2375,2303228,1.0,4.0,Horrible. History labs are a pain in the ass and take really long. Exams are written essays and graded by a TA. When one of my friends went in and talked to him about the grade he got on one of his exams he said &quot;the TA must have missed it.&quot; Totally disagree with his way of teaching and giving exams. Choose another professor.
2376,2303228,2.0,4.0,"Only assignments are two essay tests, a project, and a final essay. He provides the prompts for the tests about a week in advance but then his TA (not him), grades the papers. Extremely hard grader, and if you end up messing up on one paper, you will have to make A's on everything to save yourself. I definitely recommend any other professor."
2377,2303228,2.0,4.0,I love learning history from this era but the lectures are not engaging and all of his test are writing assignments are graded by a TA not the professor which I totally disagree with
2378,2303228,1.0,3.0,"Awful experience. Teaches an era I love from very warped perspectives. That's fine and all, where it is inspires us to dig in deeper. I find it repulsive to be held to write papers in a way that support views of history that I don't agree with. That's BS and feels like an effort to convert! Shouldn't be penalized because I disagree with him!"
2379,2303228,1.0,4.0,the papers will kill you :) like what even is a history lab?
2380,2147581,5.0,3.0,"Attendance isn't mandatory, but she won't post her power points so people will come and you NEED the information on the power points for the tests. The only time I used the text book was to check on diagrams and figures she referenced in lecture. All the homework and quizzes are online, but there's quite a few of them."
2381,142590,1.0,5.0,most unpleasant person i have ever had contatct with. if you can take this class with someone else do so immediately. she is terrible at giving help or any sort of slack when it comes to hard assignements. her t.a. even tried to get her stop being so hard on the class. shes terrible all around.
2382,142590,3.0,5.0,This is a weed-out class.  Dr Lawhead is very to the point and unfriendly and will advocate changing your major if you can't figure things out on your own.  Don't bother asking her for help unless you're willing to do the work to figure it out on your own
2383,142590,3.0,4.0,"I had her for Computer Languages.  It was a very difficult class, straight from the book, but she doesn't play around.  Not a pleasant woman."
2384,142590,4.0,4.0,"Good teacher, she doesn't give you answers, she helps you, but makes you figure it out for yourself. It's a tough course. I got an A in her class, and anyone who did poorly in her class either didn't do the work, or just wasn't smart enough."
2385,142590,1.0,5.0,This class is hard and she's the worst teacher ever.  Change your major to MIS!!!
2386,2458884,3.0,4.0,"3 Exams: matching the people to def 40%, 12 events: you need to describe 6 of them with time, people involved, and significance. 3 Source Analysis: 3 articles, 2 questions each, free response, graded hard so make sure to answer the questions clearly with detail Class: take notes by listening, titles and pics on slides only 3 blue books big"
2387,2458884,1.0,4.0,Worst class ever. Cancelled class like everyday and got mad we didn't know the material. Only thing that saved my grade was getting a new teacher. Thanks Beth Kruse.
2388,2458884,3.0,4.0,"Use your laptop to take notes, you won't get all the info writing them he talks fast. He is a hard grader, the more in depth you go, the better. Gives extra credit on tests, its usually putting 5 events in order of occurrence. Study for his tests three days prior! On tests 12 events given and you write about 6 of them &amp; there's matching"
2389,2831621,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher! Super funny and really engaging. He really makes an effort to create good relationships with his students. Tests are pretty average, but they can be hard to study for."
2390,2831621,5.0,4.0,"By far the best professor Ive ever had. He truly cares about his students. I was struggling and he made sure to accommodate to me and help me. He doesnt give study guides which makes studying for the test a little hard. However, he wants you to succeed. 10/10. Wish there was more like him"
2391,2475268,5.0,2.0,"Super chill guy, super easy class, he's super passionate about what he teaches and gives good lectures. Just show up to class and study the study guides before the tests and you are golden. Tests are all multiple choice. Lecture slides uploaded on blackboard. 10/10 an Easy A for a social science credit."
2392,2792711,5.0,4.0,"Serrano is my favorite professor I have ever had, and I've had some great ones. I was dreading the class since I've never taken Spanish, but he cared about how we all did understanding it individually. The class is fast, just like all the other sections. TAKE HIS. I like him as a professor, but even more as a person. DO THE HOMEWORK for any prof. "
2393,294152,1.0,4.0,don't take this class
2394,294152,1.0,4.0,He just lectured all the time and our only assignment was very unclear and impractical. also did not answer questions well in class. :(
2395,294152,2.5,3.0,"Not a hard class, but extremely boring. You can pass this class easily if you never show up as long as you read the book and view his powerpoint online. If you go to class don't forget your DM, the crossword puzzle will get you through."
2396,294152,4.0,3.0,"He is a good professor, but sometimes it can get a little boring.  He is very knowlegeable, it is amazing how much he knows."
2397,294152,3.0,1.0,good prof even though he is hard to understand he is still really easy
2398,294152,2.5,3.0,"Pretty nice guy, class is not too difficult, just sort of boring. He is very organized, everything is on powerpoint and he posts it online. Would be a much better class if there was any interaction at all to live it up a bit. He is nice, though."
2399,488712,4.5,2.0,great teacher but he said he was going to hong kong for next 10 years.
2400,488712,5.0,4.0,"From Homer, Aelfric & Apulieus to Dante, Omar Khayyam & Rumi, this was one of the best online classes I’ve ever taken - Robinson is quick to respond to queries & generous in grading, but impatient with dogmatic statements and lazy work.  He challenged us to support statements with fact, not opinion.  Lots of reading and writing, but a great class!"
2401,488712,1.5,4.0,Tries to push his views of religion and sex on his students.  The class was world literature and all he talked about was religion and sex. Falsely accused students of plagerism.
2402,2059528,3.0,4.0,"Considering this is a entry level class, her tests are very specific and ask about nitty gritty details. She gives a lot of extra credit but it does not seem to help your grade. She is really young and excited to teach but the difficulty of her tests and quizzes is just annoying."
2403,2059528,4.0,2.0,"Tonya was a great professor and gave many chances for extra credit. This is an easy A class as long as you go to class, take good notes, and do the homework. She kept lectures interesting and the tests came directly from the notes so not a lot of textbook reading was necessary. She is young and very relatable and truly wants you to do well."
2404,2059528,5.0,3.0,tonya is the best! she keeps lectures interesting and she's young so she relates to students.  I actually learned a lot in her class and it was one of the rare classes that I didn't dread going to
2405,2059528,4.0,2.0,"Great instructor who really knows how to make material relatable and interesting. Her slides are always nice to look at, and her tests are very fair. Rewards for good attendence."
2406,2059528,4.5,2.0,"She was a really good teacher who knew her stuff. The class was easy and she went over the difficult parts for everyone. On rainy days, she gave out extra credit for those who showed up and coming to class really helped. She uses real world examples like clips from popular movies and funny pictures to help get the information across."
2407,2059528,4.5,3.0,"Tonya has been my favorite college professor yet. She is young and relates to students. Not boring- lots of extra credit. She gives a study guide online before every test which helped me so much. Attendance is not mandatory but she gives extra credit to those who do not miss. Loved her class so much, she made me like psychology. Would take again!"
2408,2059528,4.5,2.0,"fairly easy class, tests take some studying, but not ample amounts. very clear teacher and is very helpful"
2409,2059528,4.5,1.0,Fun teacher! She makes the class relatable To your life.
2410,2059528,4.5,3.0,She is very nice and helpful. She wants you to do well.
2411,2059528,3.5,2.0,"Do the work, research hours, study for the test, Read,Read,Read, look at PowerPoint, and ESPECIALLY EXTRA CREDIT"
2412,2059528,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Vandebrink is a great professor for freshmen.  She is very helpful and offers ample opportunities to boost one's grade.  If you apply yourself, you will no doubt get an A in this course.  Her lectures also include a lot of pop culture references that I found funny."
2413,2059528,4.5,2.0,"Was an excellent teacher, and the most attractive professor I've had at Ole Miss so there is that. Easy to pass as long as you actually study for the tests. Don't think you can go into the tests just off of her lectures, studying needs to be done."
2414,2059528,4.5,3.0,"She speaks very fast, but is always willing to repeat. The quizzes were the worst part  because you don't really get a lot of time to answer. Attendance wasn't mandatory but if you don't miss a class you get 4 extra points on the final.  She was really good a relating the material to relevant things, which made it easier to learn. "
2415,2059528,3.5,4.0,Students were given a pop quiz every week and they were difficult. The questions would be put on the board one at a time and you had to respond using your clicker. This was hard for me because you are pressed for time and you can't go back and change an answer. Homework was always due at random times online. The class was way harder than necessary.
2416,2059528,5.0,1.0,"Tonya is SUCH a kind and easy-going teacher. The work itself is enough to make sure your grades weigh out in the end but so much that it gets in the way of other classes. It's also really nice taking a class with someone closer to our age and in turn can relate more to the students as well as us to her. Overall, I really enjoyed this class!"
2417,2059528,5.0,1.0,I really enjoyed the class and had no problems with the teacher. Stay on top of homework because it is easy to forget and can bring your grade down if you don't do it. 
2418,2059528,3.5,3.0,Do your homework and take good notes and study
2419,2059528,4.0,3.0,"She's easy to talk to and eager to help. The class isn't particularly difficult, but you can expect homework and quizzes every week."
2420,2059528,3.5,4.0,The pop quizzes were the only horrible thing about the class.
2421,2059528,5.0,3.0,She makes the class interesting and it was good to use the mastery training. The only thing that I think the teacher should do better is to talk about the research studies at the beginning of the semester because the slots got full quickly and it was hard to find time when I could go and participate. She should have said it earlier. 
2422,2059528,5.0,3.0,"Personally, I loved this class and teacher. Mrs. Vandenbrink is super approachable and I never felt uncomfortable asking her to repeat something in a lecture or explain something I didn't clearly understand. Her tests are entirely lecture-based, so make sure you regularly attend class and take notes to do well. I would strongly recommend this class"
2423,711948,5.0,3.0,"Wow. Best professor I have ever had in my life. Her passion is second to none and she has such a God given gift to teach. What an incredible human and teacher. If every professor and teacher was like her - the world of education would be so much more wonderfully different. If you have the chance, TAKE HER."
2424,711948,5.0,4.0,"Love this woman! She is so enthusiastic and her passion is contagious.  She's very practical and informative.  She tells you what you need to know and she's always willing to help you outside of class.  Be willing to put the work in though - the research cases are great ways to learn, but can take a lot of time."
2425,711948,4.5,3.0,"Tax I - This class is not hard, there's just a LOT of information thrown at you.  Homework is important; it will help your overall grade and help you learn the material for the tests.  She likes to collect HW on days when you least expect it or have something else due."
2426,711948,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2427,711948,5.0,3.0,Excellent teacher!  Wish more were like her.
2428,1824005,5.0,1.0,his tests are 100% test bank
2429,1824005,1.0,2.0,Doesn't explain anything clearly. However the material is really easy if you learn it yourself or get a tutor.
2430,2204944,2.0,4.0,"She goes way too fast during her lectures and doesnt slow down for anything. Pay extra attention to when she teaches and writes stuff on the board because if you ask her questions, she gets mad and makes audible sighs at you. If youre gonna show up for class make sure youre on time because she gets noticeably mad when you walk in late."
2431,1907991,5.0,3.0,"Best teacher I have ever had. She makes her assignments clear, she is extremely encouraging and helpful, and responds immediately. She truly cares about her students and being a teacher. I wish she could teach every class I needed to take."
2432,1907991,5.0,3.0,She made the class fun.
2433,2055448,5.0,3.0,Mr. Milligan was a great teacher if you do your work and go to class and participate you should pass.
2434,2055448,4.0,3.0,"I had him for writing 101 and he was a pretty east teacher considering! We wrote four papers total, and I made decent grades on all of them! He's a fair grader, but not a super easy grader. I would definitely recommend his class! He's really easy going and understanding!"
2435,2055449,3.0,3.0,"She's a decent teacher for this class! She never cancels class and won't  ever let you out even a minute early, but I would take her again if I had to! She works examples and takes question about specific problems! The class in general is kind of boring, and she's a little quirky, but I'd recommend this class!"
2436,23832,4.0,4.0,"Raber is a great teacher, but I wouldn't recommend taking her if you want an easy A. She's no-nonsense, but she knows her stuff and will help you if you make the effort to go to her office hours. People that don't like her class are usually people who don't want to put in the effort to read the material."
2437,23832,1.0,4.0,"Ok, I want to start by first admitting that Dr. Raber is intelligent, and quick witted when she wants to be. However, I find her word choice and personality to reflect that of someone who is a narcissist (I'm a psychology major). She is incredibly rude (I wrote a complaint to the Uni about that incident) and will grade you out the ass."
2438,23832,3.0,4.0,"She is great at giving you all the necessary info to succeed in her class. Her lectures are where most test info and essay prompts come from, so good note-taking is imperative. Her exams where poorly written, however, and she liked to go on bizarre tangents every now and then."
2439,23832,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Raber for HON 101 and 102. Passionate, enthusiastic teacher. FUNNY AS HELL. Very understanding. Picked great texts. We only wrote papers for this class and she's a pretty tough grader, but if you use enough quotes from the book to support your argument, you'll be fine. I plan on taking everything she teaches, she's that good."
2440,23832,4.5,3.0,I originally had Ivo (EVIL) Kamps for Shakespeare and left his class crying several times. I took Raber to get the F from Kamps class off my transcript. Raber's not easy but she does encourage participation and makes Shakespeare more interesting than I thought it would be. I liked her enough to take her 2nd Shakespeare class. Made A's in both.
2441,23832,4.0,4.0,She is not an easy teacher but she is extremely intellegent and good with communication.  She also is understanding but if you hate reading do not take this class. The exams are difficult but the papers are an easy &quot;a&quot; and they definitely pull your grade if you put time into writing them.  Dr. Raber is not strict on attendance.  Great teacher!
2442,23832,2.0,3.0,Avoid this teacher like the plague.  She is simply impossible to please.  Every single person except for i believe 10-15 out of 70 people failed our first test.
2443,23832,4.5,3.0,She's great!  She is so funny and brilliant
2444,23832,5.0,3.0,"challenging, smart as hell, and hilarious to boot. take anything and everything she teaches."
2445,23832,1.0,5.0,"horrible teacher, this is the hardest class i've had in college, and i'm about to graduate with a 4.0 and a double major in mis and accounting in 4 years"
2446,23832,3.5,4.0,No Comments
2447,1830170,5.0,1.0,"Literally the love of my life. He is so chill and down to earth, cares about you and your mental health. He will joke around with you. He is a great prof who CARES which is rare. He will work with you on attendance and grades if you need it."
2448,1830170,5.0,4.0,"I've taken a couple of classes with him, and the big thing people mess up on is not reading. The book is where the test is going to really come from, the lectures are there to fill in the blanks and inspire students. He is a really awesome guy and cares about his students. Definitely take, but seriously, if you dont read you wont pass."
2449,1830170,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Schulenberg is a really nice guy, but his lectures are quite boring. I learned a lot from the class, but did find it difficult to sit through 3 days a week. He has a tendency to ramble about things that aren't really necessary or relevant. Otherwise, he is wonderful and really cares about his field and his students! Would recommend!"
2450,1830170,3.5,3.0,"Positive Psychology (PSY 430) is his passion, and it shows in his lectures. He's an excellent lecturer; but his tests are 50/50 lecture and reading from the textbook. He does NOT cover the material from the text in class at all. His tests are VERY detailed, and if you watch a documentary, MEMORIZE quotes and names. Great class, but not very easy!"
2451,1830170,2.0,3.0,Boring and not clear at all during lecture
2452,1830170,1.5,3.0,He's very arrogant and thinks WAY too highly of himself. Thinks he's an expert on everything which he isn't. His tests are harder than they should be. Don't take him.
2453,1830170,1.0,3.0,Lectures are long and boring. He's not very approachable outside of class and can be rude. His lectures don't seem to be related to test material at all.
2454,1830170,5.0,2.0,Best psychology professor I've had at Ole Miss. He is very nice and helpful and also makes the class interesting. I highly recommend him.
2455,1830170,5.0,2.0,Excellent professor. Really cares about his students and facilitates great discussion. Very helpful. Overall interesting class. Would definitely take a class from him again.
2456,2723103,5.0,4.0,Best teacher for 105 and 106
2457,2723103,1.0,1.0,NOT GOOD
2458,2723103,5.0,2.0,There is so much extra credit. She cares about her students. Take this class!
2459,2723103,5.0,4.0,"While the class was difficult, Dr. Tanner was absolutely my favorite professor of the semester. She has a service dog, whom she sometimes brings to class. We used the CHEM101 app, which was intuitive, and very useful. Her lectures were fun and helpful. Go to class, and office hours, and you can definitely pass."
2460,2723103,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Tanner does an amazing job at doing whatever she can to help her students understand chemistry, even extending office hours before text days. Lectures are interactive allowing students to better understand the content of lectures. Uses an app that lets you have multiple attempts on homework and participation and is willing to help you!"
2461,2723103,5.0,4.0,Best chemistry teacher I have had
2462,2180389,3.0,3.0,He seems to enjoy the subject matter of hormones and behavior. Can be difficult.
2463,2180389,5.0,4.0,Dr. Leary is a great teacher. He holds multiple opportunities to meet for office hours. He will stop at any point in class and answer questions.
2464,2180389,4.0,3.0,"This class has the highest fail rate on campus, but it is possible to do well. He is a great lecturer and is always open to stopping to answer questions or clearing things up. He is also willing to help during office hours. Overall the course is hard but he makes it bearable. "
2465,2180389,5.0,3.0,The papers were a lot but Dr. Leary made it very informative. Learned a lot.
2466,2180389,5.0,4.0,Dr. Leary is probably the best bio professor at Ole Miss. His class is by no means easy but if you need a 300 level bio class with a lab I would definitely recommend this class. Exams are straight forward and you really just need to memorize the slides from the lectures. Only difficult part of the course is the lab/ lab exams. TAKE THIS CLASS!!
2467,2180389,5.0,2.0,Dr. Leary is awesome. The weekly paper isn't that bad as long as you set aside time to do it.
2468,2409766,5.0,4.0,"Hard class, but you learn so many skills and use a lot of programs that are helpful for the IMC career! You usually have to go to class to know what's going on and use class time for projects... Might also need to work on projects outside of class. But a really great class with a great professor!"
2469,1621287,1.0,4.0,"He's an idiot savant. He's obviously brilliant, as he can perform long division in his head & recite the answer to the 10th decimal place faster than you can turn on your calculator. However, his communication skills are atrocious & he is totally incapable of discussing econ...those are his own words. Give your answers in HIS words or it's wrong."
2470,2493737,5.0,4.0,She is great professor and I've learned alot!
2471,2485545,1.0,4.0,She gave nearly half of our class below a 70 on a paper worth 30% of our grade. Even in perfect papers she would not issue a 100 but rather a 99. In the midst of a pandemic and remote learning she graded harder than any TA I have ever had.
2472,2485545,5.0,4.0,I have had Dr Wyant twice and both classes were great. Alot of work but if you go to class and read youll be fine. She lectures alot but it is very interesting. She knows lots about international relations and really likes it so her lectures arent as boring as others are. I wish she was teaching this semester because I would take her again.
2473,2485545,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Wyant is one of the best professors I have had in college so far. She is clear in her syllabus about what she expects from you and when things are due. All of her test for 103 are essays but they are very clearly laid out about what to write about, and very easy to piece together from your lecture notes. She's the best please take her!"
2474,339248,1.5,4.0,"I really like Barnes my first semester, but second semester was downhill. It's like he's some kind of mad scientist that hides in his office watching nature videos."
2475,339248,4.0,2.0,No Comments
2476,339248,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Barnes is so cool! He juggles in class, and he took us on a field trip."
2477,339248,1.5,4.0,No Comments
2478,339250,3.0,4.0,She is incredibly soft spoken. She is incredibly meticulous. Do the problems in the book and you'll be prepared for the exam.
2479,339250,5.0,4.0,No Comments
2480,2417971,5.0,1.0,She is the best writing professor I have ever had. There were not many papers. The topics of the papers were mostly up to us. She takes you step by step on how to write a strong essay. Her lectures are short and easy to follow. I had her two days a week and I never dreaded going even though I had the class at 8am. I loved the class!
2481,1393974,1.5,2.0,"She is the worst. However, her class is really easy. She is rude and isn't willing to help."
2482,2729275,5.0,5.0,One of the nicest and most understanding Professors I have ever had. There is homework every night but it usually is only a few quick worksheets. You have to participate in class and if you dont she makes you. There is a lot of extra credit opportunities. If you dont practice the language on your own as well as the class you will not learn it.
2483,1033541,1.0,1.0,"People love him or hate him. I fall into the latter. He talks about himself constantly -- he told 5 different (loooong) stories about going to MIT in one class. He talks and talks (and talks) even when students have their hands up to comment. SO FRUSTRATING. But if you go to class, you'll have an A. Honors 101 is super easy, but don't take him."
2484,1033541,3.0,3.0,"Cut and dry topic so it was a solid class. He DOES cold call though he claims not to because he does not like students participating twice. He does not expect you to master the cases, but you need a general ""I read"" knowledge or he'll get on your case."
2485,1033541,4.5,3.0,"Incredible professor. I came to ole miss majoring with the intentions to attend med school. Because of him, I read daily for fun, I can not wait to attend his class, and Im going to go to law school. This professor is life altering. I am transferring schools next year, but I would've done it this semester only I want another semester with this man."
2486,1033541,5.0,4.0,"I've had him for Civil Procedure and Secured Transactions - two excruciatingly boring topics - yet he found a way to breathe life into them. I suspect he's a genius (literally), and I suspect he'd make it as some kind of entertainer. You'll get a lot of substance in a palatable package. I highly recommend him."
2487,1033541,4.5,2.0,"An awesome professor.  Engaging discussions, very lenient, extremely reasonable.  Probably the best Honors teacher here."
2488,2618701,5.0,3.0,Easily the best professor in the film department. Gives great feedback on projects in and outside of class. Has really engaging lessons and assignments.
2489,1846610,5.0,3.0,"I loved taking her for EDHE. My parents forced me to take EDHE, and she actually made it bearable. She's super nice and hilarious; so don't feel scared to approach her!"
2490,1846610,5.0,1.0,"Jenna Arts was a GREAT professor. She is very helpful in all aspects- school and personal life. She is intrested in learning about her students and helping them with anything. The class I took was a freshman based class. Power points everyday with a fun story behind it, then a quiz over the chapters. Very easy and fun professor!"
2491,834901,1.0,5.0,"worst teacher i have ever seen, ole miss needs to seriously consider cutting him loose he is a waste of space in the accounting department"
2492,834901,1.0,5.0,I took ACCY online and he is one of the worst teachers ever. The only material there is to go off of is a 3 min youtube video that you can barely hear and that's it. then you have to go into doing your homework and take a quiz. I have emailed him but he only responds with one sentence and that one sentence is usually very condescending and rude. 
2493,834901,1.0,5.0,Literally the worst professor I've had at Ole Miss. Lectures are vague at best. Study materials and test subjects do not line up. Has a very rude and condescending tone.
2494,834901,1.0,5.0,Rude &amp; moves fast. If you ask questions--he will answer you with &quot;that should be self-explanatory&quot;. Started class a week late w/ dean approval due to emergency and he told me he would fail me. To try to ensure this-would mrk Q's incorrect on my test he gave others credit for. Can't take test w/ u so no proof. Ole Miss worships him. Dean no help.
2495,834901,2.0,5.0,"Very hard tests.. not very personable with his students,, can come off as rude. If you do not study every day and do your homework you will not do well. Very homework heavy as well. Speaks very fast sometimes and handwriting can be hard to interpret."
2496,834901,5.0,4.0,"I can understand why some of the others on this page are upset with him--he often gets up and walks out of class with no explanation of where he's going, and the tests are sometimes difficult. However, he is smart, and there are no surprises on his exams. Just what he says and pay attention; he works through many helpful examples in class."
2497,834901,4.0,4.0,"Doesn't explain in class very well, definitely go to his office hours."
2498,834901,3.0,4.0,"I love Dr. Nichols.  This class is very hard, but it's managable if you study hard and show him that you are trying.  Dr. Nichols gives you the grade you've worked for.  I will definitely take him again."
2499,834901,1.0,5.0,"Useless in terms of communicating how a student is doing...just a grade no comments. The book is very bad, and yet he was a contributor for an award winning distance education method teaching accounting and doesn't use it/ Grad students apparently do all his work. Completely unimpressed."
2500,834901,5.0,4.0,Dr Nichols was so cool!  I really learned a lot even though I didn't want to take his course
2501,834901,1.0,4.0,"not helpful, not excited about accounting, lazy, doesn't explain well, doesn't seem to know the material very well"
2502,834901,3.0,2.0,No Comments
2503,834901,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2504,834901,4.5,3.0,"I have heard he is the easiest out of the other 2 that teach this course, but I think its the course that is hard and not the professor! Tests consist of 12 multiple choice & rest 12-14 problems-- it is too lengthy!"
2505,2604377,1.0,5.0,"This may be the most difficult and pointless class I have ever taken. The material was disorganized, and amounted to completely random and insignificant trivia and minutiae. There was no learning or application. It was entirely memorization of pointless material that I forgot almost immediately after the lab practicals.

"
2506,2604377,3.0,3.0,"It's really your TA that makes or breaks your lab, I didn't see Mrs. Lewis once taking these courses. One thing to be warned of is that Bisc161 is mind-numbingly easy, like high school biology activities, and then 163 is full of heavily detailed memorization of things like bacteria, phylogeny, anatomy of different organisms, etc. Big adjustment."
2507,2604377,1.0,2.0,Mindnumbingly boring class. The assignments felt like junior high busy work.
2508,2604377,1.0,3.0,"The class is poorly structured. The TA frequently provided wrong information and generally confused students even with relatively simple topics. Much of the material feels like busywork. Additionally, Lewis forces you to by a &quot;textbook&quot; she wrote - which is rife with grammatical errors."
2509,2000221,4.5,2.0,"Great professor! Gives good feedback, and makes it easy to get the required credit - like it should be.  I felt like I actually learned the material just by taking the notes and studying them. Tests are pretty spot-on."
2510,1293662,5.0,3.0,Made me want to change my major to art. :)
2511,1293662,5.0,4.0,"inventive, helps according to your need, allows creativity and growth"
2512,2835809,1.0,5.0,"Heavy accent, standoffish, not understanding. Covered important alphabet and grammar rules too fast. Not enough time to build a strong foundation. Calls on students randomly. Struggle with pronunciation, not helpful and will laugh at you. Final- 8 minute story in fluent Italian. Harsh grader. Online workbook is the worst. Wanted to love this class."
2513,2835809,4.0,3.0,"Be prepared to study (daily) if you want to excel in this class. Italian is not an easy language. Professor Scontrino does a fairly good job of teaching the material, but you are going to have to put in work, too. Overall, I recommend the class and Professor Scontrino. He is a funny guy and is willing to help if you need it."
2514,2835809,1.0,5.0,"If you want a will to live do not take this class. If you just need a foreign language credit, do NOT take this class. This class had me fighting for my life, like unless you are Italian or your degree/life is revolving around Italian I would not recommend taking this class. But if you want to enjoy your life- don't take it. Im on antidepressants."
2515,1717602,1.0,5.0,"Very monotone and boring lectures. Will publicly humiliate students in front of class for making a mistake. Easy homework, but exam's are worth basically the whole class. Super strict on attendance. Overall awful professor. Do not take this class."
2516,1717602,2.0,4.0,"I think that if you are really passionate about religion then she would be a good choice, although the homework load is easy to knock out it's very reading heavy and no real conversation, basically just reads off of slides. She does provide a study guide for each exam to be filled out before test day."
2517,1717602,1.0,5.0,Literally do not take this class. Her exams are worth 60%
2518,1717602,1.0,3.0,"Don't ever take this class. She places too much emphasis on attendance. Every absence after 2 results in half of a letter grade taken from your overall grade. RIDICULOUS for an INTRODUCTORY class. Stupid, Stupid policies from a power hungry, Eastern religion spreading nutcase."
2519,1717602,3.0,4.0,"This class is discussion based, so there was rarely any lectures, but lots of reading and writing. The class was called Film and Religion, but it's misleading because the only religion we talked about was Hinduism."
2520,1717602,3.0,3.0,Dont do it!
2521,1965412,5.0,1.0,"Awesome class and an easy A if you need a 300lvl history or a non Western history.  1 term paper, 3 short assignments, and three tests.  He clearly lays out grades and what he expects.  He is chili-pepper worthy as well.  His grades are fair, and if you know the content well you will easily get an A.  He is a better choice relative to Salau."
2522,1287524,1.0,5.0,Tests were free response with little multiple choice and VERY difficult. Class averages were consistently in low 50s and 40s. The class was flipped &amp; the online videos to watch beforehand were very short and barely explained any concepts. 90% of the learning in this class came from outside resources. Textbook required. Hardest class I have taken.
2523,1287524,1.0,5.0,Missed class probably 10 times. Very hard to do well in such a difficult class when the teacher misses that much class and leaves a TA to teach.
2524,1287524,5.0,4.0,"Truly loves Chemistry, one of the most knowledgeable professors I have had. Understanding on grades, looks for marked improvement, generally gives a grade no worse than what a student makes on the final. Engaging and passionate teacher, but no nonsense too. Better love chem if you take this class, though."
2525,1287524,5.0,3.0,Super motivated and helpful. He makes every class session a fun time.
2526,1287524,5.0,5.0,Awesome professor!  Organic chemistry is a very difficult subject but he makes it fun.
2527,478567,4.0,4.0,"You HAVE to participate if you want to pass her class. A lot of information is thrown at you and it is up to you to learn it on your own or ask her about it. She loves when you reach out to her outside of class and is VERY willing to change a grade or talk you through a question. The more effort you show, the better your grade."
2528,478567,5.0,3.0,"Super amazing! She's so friendly and really cares about her students. She speaks slowly and isn't strict on explaining or going over something more in depth. There's a lot of hw but it's easy and not for a grade, but if you aren't prepared it can be a mess. More work outside means more discussion and collaboration inside class - overall I love her!"
2529,478567,4.0,3.0,"You have to go to class and participate in the class. Points can and will be taken off for not showing up and for not participating. It's a fairly easy class if you're good at Spanish already but if you aren't as good, it will take some work. She helps if students have questions."
2530,478567,2.0,5.0,Do not take!!!!!!! Hardest ever n impossible to learn from her!
2531,478567,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Really wants to help, so speaks clearly and answers all questions. Love this class."
2532,478567,5.0,2.0,"Excellent!  Take her, if you can.  Note: goes by Irene Kaufman now."

2534,478567,5.0,2.0,"awesome teacher very easy and clear if you go to class and do your work, she is very helpful and understanding"
2535,1287528,3.5,3.0,"Even though his speech takes awhile to get use to, he is a very helpful teacher. Willing to help with any question."
2536,1287528,3.5,4.0,Nice guy. Very helpful.
2537,1287528,5.0,5.0,He's an incredibly talented professor.  He's very organized and fair.
2538,709995,1.0,3.0,Incredibly boring and highly unorganized.
2539,709995,3.5,3.0,Decent teacher but really boring.  Basically all memorization which I didn't have time for. Couldn't make myself pay attention.  Not an awful teacher but I wouldn't consider it an easy A like a lot of people.  Coming from a 4.0 Engineering student
2540,709995,5.0,1.0,Dr. Sisson was great.  He was excited about what he taught and he was always very helpful.

2543,709995,3.5,2.0,"Boring, but a pretty good teacher.  Pretty old.  I don't expect he'll be around that much longer."
2544,2024816,5.0,3.0,My boy is legit. He's super knowledgeable and if you listen his lectures you'll learn a lot. 
2545,2024816,5.0,4.0,Brilliant professor who shows concern for students. Lectures  big-picture analysis and practical application.
2546,2024816,2.5,4.0,Teaches practicality in a world of theory. Pay attention and you can get on his wavelength. Everything you need to know will be spoken aloud. Textbook is barely used at all.
2547,2024817,4.5,3.0,"Davis is retired, but is likely to come back. He is very clear about what is important and what is not. While seemingly easier, all other students are privy to the same tips and it makes the curve that much harder."
2548,826741,5.0,1.0,She is so easy. You have to go to class towards the end because she gives quizzes but she always tells the class what the answer is if you are there.
2549,826741,3.5,1.0,"Really great. Keeps things relevant by talking about how geology affects us, but also ensures that you know what you need to know. Provides extensive reviews that are essentially verbatim of the test, so if you take a recorder, you'll make an A no doubt."
2550,826741,5.0,1.0,Ms Grace is awesome! old hippie lady that loves her job and can teach and will help you with anything and extremely laid back... dont have to go to class but she knows if you do and takes that into grading
2551,826741,4.5,1.0,"Awesome teacher, Works with you all the time, final consists of your tests taken during the semester copy and pasted onto one test. Easy."
2552,826741,4.0,1.0,I had an 87 average at the end of the semester and she raised it to an A just because I sent her an email. She's awesome.
2553,826741,4.0,1.0,Love her
2554,826741,4.0,3.0,"This teacher is hilarious! Lectures are difficult to understand and consistently somewhat bland. But very helpful and will work with you and your grade. Take this class, better than Bio!!"
2555,1965429,4.0,2.0,"Professor Salau definately hammers down on lectures and some long reading assignments, but the work that he gives is typically very straight forward and easy to do. He can be hard to understand sometimes as he has a thick accent, but he is a fairly nice and understanding professor."
2556,1965429,1.0,5.0,"Unhelpful and insulted his colleagues in class.  He is a tough grader even on work that other professors had said was correct and fine.  He will often refuse admit he is wrong, even when it is clear.  I will never take one of his classes again.  I am a straight A student in history and made a C+ in the class when I made a 95 in a comparable class"
2557,2766200,5.0,4.0,"Drew cares about his students way more than most professors. Hes eager to answer questions and is a very relatable, easy guy to talk to. He gives lots of homework but plenty of time to do it. His lectures are sometimes a bit hard to follow but as long as you pay attention and ask questions you will be fine. The tests directly reflect class."
2558,1328513,1.0,5.0,Makes the class too extra and difficult for a simple class. Only accepts a daily discussion grade if its been worked on for 4+ hours
2559,1328513,1.0,5.0,"I am a straight A student in my junior year. I always go above and beyond for my classes. I have only made 2 A's in his class the entire semester and have put in EFFORT. Tests are essay format, for each question I wrote 200+ word responses and it seemed like every time he always finds something that was inadequate. It seems impossible to get an A."
2560,1328513,5.0,4.0,"Take him, you'll learn in an interesting way!!"
2561,1328513,4.5,2.0,"I appreciate Mr. Franks' style; he makes his classes easy to pass, while still expecting SOMETHING from you.  That is, all tests are essay format, but he gives you the questions ahead of time.  His lectures are fun too, if not always conspicuously relevant to the material.  Thumbs up for Franks!"
2562,1328513,5.0,1.0,I have taken several classes from this professor. He is awesome! I could listen to him talk all day long! He &quot;Rocks&quot;.
2563,1328513,5.0,1.0,I've taken several classes from this professor. He is awesome! I could listen to his lectures all day long. He's really great! He &quot;Rocks&quot;.
2564,1328515,5.0,1.0,Awesome teacher
2565,1328515,4.0,2.0,"She is a great instructor!  She teaches material from the textbook and tells you exactly what will be tested on. Her tests are worded to where you need to be familiar with the material to pass, but still not too difficult! Gives real world situations and examples with her teachings. She actually teaches and does not just expect you to read the book"
2566,1328515,1.5,4.0,"Did nothing but read from the textbook, only pointed out the bold stuff, and then tested you on everything in between."
2567,1328515,5.0,2.0,Wonderful teacher.
2568,1328515,4.0,2.0,No Comments
2569,875908,5.0,3.0,"She can go off on a whim while lecturing, however, she is very sweet and helpful. I emailed her several times while outside of class hours and she was always willing to help me. "
2570,875908,1.0,5.0,She does not convey the material in an understandable manner and makes it almost impossible to pass the class.
2571,875908,1.0,5.0,she just did not care
2572,875908,3.5,3.0,you have to work hard for your grade.
2573,875908,1.0,5.0,Tests were nothing like study guide. Difficult.
2574,875908,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2575,1351045,4.5,2.0,"He is very intelligent as a professor, but even separate from that, he is an interesting person to talk to. He is really engaging and always has good class discussions that challenge the students. While his grading can be a tough, he doesn't make ti impossible to get an A or B. You really have to try to fail his class."
2576,1351045,2.5,4.0,"Class is easy, but the way he does grades makes making an A really really hard. Missing a class will deduct points from your average. There are no tests, just essays which he grades really hard."
2577,2258309,5.0,4.0,she gives extra credit and is really good at explaining. she is also always available to meet with you if you don't understand something. she's good at emailing back and wants you to pass. never used textbook. she gives great notes.
2578,2151815,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Beene is keeps the material engaging and the directions clear.  Seriously, just show up and participate and you'll do fine."
2579,2631053,5.0,2.0,"Literally the best professor I've had at Ole Miss. She is so understanding and really wants you to succeed. Will make time to talk with you outside of class, and is very understanding and fair. Cares about students mental health."
2580,2639245,1.0,5.0,"The class is determined by one simulation that you do the whole semester and she doesn't ever give feedback on how you are doing, leaving it all up to you. There is no clear grading criteria either. With no feedback, no one knew how they were doing the entire semester until she posted our grades at the end. Everyone failed and no one knows why."
2581,1480082,5.0,4.0,"This man has completely made every idea I have had with my thesis take flight. Coming with knowledge and passion, Dr. Frezzo is a teacher and man that any student could look to as a role model and superb citizen. This man reached across his specific studies to embark on this thesis with me, only respect  and gratefulness for this man!"
2582,1480082,5.0,2.0,"Frezzo is an excellent teacher, passionate about the subject, and well worth taking any and all of his classes!"
2583,1480082,5.0,2.0,Great classes! Especially loved Peace and Justice (Sociology of)
2584,1480082,5.0,3.0,Interesting classes on peace and human rights.
2585,1480082,5.0,2.0,"Took Prof. Frezzo for several classes at his old University. Classes of 50 were instantly filled. If you didn't sign up the first day, you didn't get in. The reason: he's brilliant and will inspire you like no other professor. Make this your first course selection of the semester. :-) You will not be sorry!!!"
2586,2309526,1.0,5.0,"Expects you to read numerous 300 + page books under a week including one book well over 400 pages. The readings are extremely dense, and he expects you to cite all readings/articles in your exams/papers. The class is discussion based, although participation is only worth 5% of your final grade. By far the most tedious class I have ever taken."
2587,245143,5.0,2.0,"Honestly, she taught an interesting class. If you take notes and do a little studying, you can get an easy A in her class. If you don't, you won't do as well. The tests are worth a lot, so it's important to do well on them."
2588,245143,4.0,4.0,"Great Professor, but her readings are really hard, and her tests can be tricky."
2589,245143,3.5,1.0,"She's a very easy teacher/class. All you need to do is write all the notes, do your study guide, and it should be an easy A. I loved the class (Buddhism is an interest of mine)! Some bad things were that she is quite aloof, forgetful, and fickle. She gives two days to do her papers. Otherwise, it's an easy class."
2590,245143,5.0,5.0,"can't remember the number of the classes, but she is amazing!!!"
2591,245143,3.0,1.0,"ok class, easy grade, hottie"
2592,245143,5.0,2.0,She is a hippie who plays in a band. She seems really interested in what she teaches. I liked her a lot.
2593,245143,2.5,1.0,easy class. interesting subject but a less than interesting delivery.  this prof is fast becoming a hack who is clearly not interested in teaching.  it's a good A though and the course is interesting if you do a lot of work on your own.
2594,245143,1.5,1.0,pays little attention to students concerns. never in her office.  grades seem very arbitrary.  she's done this too long...her obvious disinterest makes this a tedious class.
2595,245143,4.5,2.0,"good enough I guess - knows a lot of facts and stories and ties them all together nicely, but doesn't really know religion.  we could learn just as well from an almanac.  I can't believe they actually payer her for this."
2596,245143,5.0,4.0,"Can't wait for classes to be over, but this is one course that I will miss.  Everyone should take at least one class from Dr. Cozad.  She's the best -- as long as you do your work (which is interesting and not that demanding)"
2597,245143,2.0,3.0,"do the assigments and get a B or an A.  Good course, but not so good a teacher.  Fairly regurgative."
2598,245143,3.5,2.0,very easy class - ok teacher but doesn't help beyond what we do in class - kind of aloof at times - never in her office
2599,245143,4.0,4.0,i enjoyed this class a lot. she's a good instructor -- knows her stuff
2600,245143,3.0,1.0,Ok class - teacher could be better; doesn't seem interested in the class or the subject - going thru the motions
2601,245143,3.5,1.0,"easy class, lazy teacher, intellectually unchallenging, easy grade - bad class - bad teacher"
2602,1398176,5.0,4.0,"His lectures are really engaging and he knows what he's talking about. He's funny in the dry professor sort of way that made the class fun. If I could take any class again, it would be this one. The class is test, discussion, and lecture heavy. I really enjoyed this class."
2603,1398176,4.0,3.0,great professor! interesting lecutres. take good notes and you'll be fine.
2604,1398176,1.0,5.0,such a boring teacher
2605,1398176,4.5,3.0,He is a very ggod proffesor. His lectures are engaging and he keeps the material interesting. He also challenges your views on what literature is all about.
2606,1398176,1.5,2.0,I'd never fallen asleep in a college class before his lecture.
2607,1398176,3.0,4.0,"He knows the material, but he's pretty boring.  Don't take a class with him thats over 50 minutes... you will fall asleep.  He also grades hard."
2608,638371,5.0,3.0,"She was very helpful if you needed any extra help outside of class. She also gives some extra credit. The only drawback is in this class there is a test every single Friday, but otherwise she is a very good professor."
2609,638371,2.0,5.0,Extremely hard class. You get 2 absences before your grade drops. She calls on you randomly and makes you answer even if you do not feel comfortable. A lot of homework. She will meet with you if you need help but it's almost like she judges everything you say. She thinks her class is only important and does not care about you outside of the class.
2610,638371,1.0,5.0,Horrible.
2611,638371,4.0,3.0,I really don't understand the students complaining about her. She's a very nice and understanding professor. She offers plenty of extra credit and tutoring/help outside of class. I recommend taking Dr. Ajootian for Latin if you can.
2612,638371,2.0,2.0,Very rude to students. Often would tell us when we were having trouble with a lesson she &quot;just doesn't understand why we aren't getting it&quot;. She is available after class often but I never went due to how mean she was in class.
2613,638371,1.0,3.0,Refused to help me and even stated she saw my email but ignored it. There was no way to know what your grade was in the class. She did not enter anything in blackboard and you were not told how much things were weighted to what items counted for a grade. When I asked how to determine my grade she said it was &quot;on me&quot; .
2614,638371,4.0,3.0,"She is always available to help students -- Zoom reviews, in person sessions, etc. She cares."
2615,638371,4.0,2.0,Ajootian genuinely cares about her students and how they perform. She is always accessible for help. She also selected textbooks which can be purchased affordably used. Highly recommend.
2616,638371,4.0,2.0,She is a very sweet and intelligent teacher. It is obvious she loves her job and her students. She tries her best to make sure her students understand and gives plenty of opportunities to learn one on one. She has become a friend and mentor who is very open and diverse.
2617,638371,4.0,2.0,Very sweet and obviously very passionate about her work.
2618,638371,1.5,4.0,"She clearly has disdain for Mississippi students, whom she views as stupid and not worth her time. She thinks she is better than the institution she works for, and that is reflected in her demeanor and the way she treats and talks to her students."
2619,638371,5.0,4.0,Nicest teacher ever!
2620,638371,5.0,2.0,"She's a very nice, helpful, and down-to-earth professor.  Certainly knows what she is talking about, but can get distracted or be drawn off-topic.  Overall a pleasant experience."
2621,638371,5.0,4.0,She is super sweet! She tells you exactly what is on the test and gives you plenty of time to cover the chapters.
2622,638371,5.0,4.0,I think she's awesome. She needs to get more respect. She's brilliant.
2623,638371,2.5,2.0,"By far the most bland professor I have ever had to sit through.  Lectures have little or nothing to do with the texts, or test/quiz material, instead wandering aimlessly through daily slide shows, with an attendance policy.  Spends 15 minutes per class complaining about how people are talking when she enters the room--- before class has started."

2625,2749859,1.0,5.0,"The hardest possible Spanish 111 teacher, very strict with the rules, would for sure not recommend taking her. Spanish 111 is already a hard class but taking her makes is 10x more difficult. Very strict for no reason"
2626,2735530,2.0,3.0,"She is an alright teacher, used npr as our textbook and assigned very long papers but if you participate in class she'll like you more"
2627,2266538,5.0,4.0,Very helpful with difficult concepts and responds immediately to emails.
2628,2266538,5.0,4.0,Very helpful and understands how to teach. I am grateful I took her class.
2629,2266538,5.0,4.0,Best class. Learned a lot of programming.
2630,2266538,2.0,1.0,It's an easy class to pass
2631,1893814,5.0,1.0,"Seriously, the nicest professor at Ole Miss. He gives you like a million opportunities for extra credit and seriously just want all of his students to get an A, which he makes as easy as possible. The class is still really interesting and the best days were when we were discussing a reading he chose. He's really smart and so nice!"
2632,1473983,5.0,2.0,"Nice, very helpful and understandable. Makes topic easy to understand"
2633,1473983,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. Explains the material really well. His test are kinda hard, but their not terrible, and you just have to study hard for them. Very helpful and willing to help you. You're TA will grade your test so your grade will depend on the TA not Dr. Montgomery."
2634,1473983,5.0,3.0,Travis Montgomery is the best teacher EVAR!
2635,2463169,5.0,2.0,"He's super chill. Any time I question if I want to be a lawyer, his class always makes me feel like it's something I want to do. There are only three grades, and they are all exams. There is not much guidance as to what will be on the exams but they are simple enough. He's super funny and is able to incorporate this quality into his lectures."

2637,2174413,5.0,2.0,"He's the best professor I've ever had, and I'd definitely take him again. He made Psych super fun and he was a pleasure to be around."
2638,2174413,5.0,2.0,"Take this guy's class if you just wanna get that psych 201 credit. Show up to class in case there's a class participation grade. Most of the time it's a quiz online or he'll just see if you showed up that day and give you the credit. He's young, funny, and understands other class loads. Final isn't cumulative. Posts his slides. Highly recommend."
2639,2174413,5.0,2.0,best. professor. ever. He's absolutely hilarious and nice to look at ;-)
2640,2174413,5.0,2.0,"He made lectures interesting by adding anecdotes throughout. If someone had a question, he would do his best to further explain the topic in question. The homework was of little difficulty and did not take long to complete. Great professor!"
2641,2174413,5.0,3.0,best teacher ever!!! he's hilarious and really good about posting reviews and notes. doesnt care if you come to class. didn't even need the textbook. he gives a test review the day before any tests and the review is literally almost identical to the test. lots of extra credit and super easy class!!
2642,2174413,5.0,3.0,Rogers is a good teacher! He is really good at describing the course material and at times he's funny! He gives you a lot of opportunities to make a good grade in his class. All you need to do is show up and listen!
2643,2174413,5.0,1.0,Extremely nice and kept class upbeat and interesting by cracking jokes and adding humor to his PowerPoint slides.  Very helpful and willing to give extra attention outside of class if need be. Gave a good bit of extra point opportunities and made it possible to recover from a bad grade.
2644,2174413,4.0,4.0,"First off he so cute literally every girl laughed even harder then they would because hes adorable, but he is funny. Really good lectures and a strong instructor however the tests were often times brutal. I ended with a B and I was siked however I also did 6 extra credit points so I barley made it. Just study really hard and you could get that A."
2645,2174413,5.0,1.0,"Best teacher I had this semester and he is only a TA.  It's sad that students themselves teach others better when they have full-time school work on top of teaching.  Great teacher, always helpful, good presentations."
2646,2174413,5.0,3.0,Solid class. Funny Guy too
2647,2174413,5.0,4.0,I loved his class!
2648,2174413,5.0,3.0,"Literally my favorite teacher of my first semester of college. Absolutely hilarious, and the class isn't that difficult as long as you pay attention during his lectures, which he always makes interesting and comical."
2649,2174413,5.0,3.0,Very good teacher; makes the content interesting
2650,2174413,5.0,3.0,"So great! Loved him, would definitely take his classes again."
2651,2174413,5.0,3.0,"He was my favorite teacher this semester (only a freshie.) He's literally hilarious and made everyone laugh every class. Cool teacher, would love to have him again. I actually learned things to- his jokes made theories easy to remember. COOL TEACHER"
2652,2174413,5.0,4.0,He was an amazing teacher that would be great for anyone to take! He is a comedian who knows when to be serious and to have fun!
2653,2174413,5.0,3.0,"Great, funny teacher. Probably my favorite on campus so far (as a sophomore)."
2654,2174413,5.0,3.0,"Made my first psych class one to remember! Awesome teacher, would recommend for sure."
2655,2174413,5.0,3.0,"Rogers is an absolute legend. Still a grad student, but if you get the chance to take his class, for the love of god, take it!"
2656,2489807,5.0,4.0,"Works hard to help students when they actually reach out for help. Is one of the nicest and best professors there. Really cares about his students, those that don't come to class are the ones who fail and complain."
2657,1451475,5.0,2.0,Bruh
2658,1451475,4.0,3.0,"Does a great job with an incredibly lengthy class. You will have your own handbook to statistics when you finish. Not a super easy class, but if you put in the work, you will get a good grade."
2659,1451475,5.0,2.0,"He is honestly so great. His class is very chill, but I feel like I have learned so much in a topic that I never thought I would find interesting."
2660,1451475,5.0,3.0,"Smart, thoughtful, and rational."
2661,1451475,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Hoeksema is by far the best teacher on the Ole Miss campus. I changed my major and no longer needed to take his class, but he made it worth taking. He is hilarious and really gets you interested in the material. I am so glad I didn't decide to drop it. I have learned so much about Microbiology. This class is not a blow off, work hard!"
2662,1451475,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Hoeksema was one of my favorite teachers. His class was intresting and lab was always fun! I had class at 8 am and your allowd to miss up to 4 classes, he gives you 100 points for just coming to class, the test are from his notes. You have to study alot, and I did that and got a B"
2663,1177054,1.0,3.0,don't take her if you actually want to learn something
2664,1177054,5.0,3.0,"Phenomenally helpful. She's as smart as they come, and a nice person, too!"
2665,1177054,5.0,4.0,"Excellent, clear.  Come to class, do work, the class is good.  Bonnie does a very nice job."
2666,1600998,1.0,4.0,Simply not a fan.
2667,1600998,5.0,4.0,"Class is enjoyable and she is understanding. I didn't realize I was taking a graduate level class and ended up doing half the work wrong, but I really made an effort and she gave me a good enough grade to get credit. It's easy to learn from her!"
2668,1600998,5.0,3.0,I took her for Social Psych and she was one of the best teachers I had in the Psych department at ole miss!!! She is a little intimidating but she is also very funny and if you will just do the work for this class youll make a good great. I loved her and would recommend her to anyone! The class just takes some effort.
2669,1600998,4.0,3.0,She makes class entertaining and her lectures are really interesting. The only test that we had all semester was our final exam.
2670,1600998,1.0,4.0,"Lectures are absolutely useless. Shows a couple of graphs each time and then describes them. Her homework is EXTREMELY arduous. Had 12 homework assignments, each of which took at least an hour to complete, whereas 4 of the 12 (&quot;Be the Test Bank) will takes around 2-3 hours each to complete. If they aren't EXACTLY to her specs, you simply fail."
2671,1600998,1.0,5.0,HARDEST CLASS EVER AND SHE DOESN'T HELP IN OFFICE HOURS
2672,1600998,5.0,4.0,Finally! A professor who actually cares whether or not I learn something
2673,1600998,4.0,4.0,"Not an easy class but she will help you if you work hard. Can be intense and scary, but is a great lecturer"
2674,1600998,2.0,4.0,"Literally if you can take anyone else please do so. I showed up for class everyday, wrote everything that came out of her mouth and would still barely pass her tests. She will not meet with you if its not office hours and she rushes you out. Comes off cold and stand offish not warm and inviting at all. Every test WILL be essay. No multiple choice."
2675,1600998,4.0,4.0,"She's tough, but if you do the reading and go to class you'll be fine. If you just want to show up and do nothing and pass, then she's not the teacher for you."
2676,1600998,5.0,4.0,"She's tough and just give you a grade. Her lectures are amazing and she really makes learning fun and interesting. Very willing to help, and will do whatever she can if you put in the work too."
2677,1600998,3.0,4.0,Her tests are extremely ambiguous.  Good teacher but tests are unnecessarily hard.  Vague questions but demand very specific answers.  Unless you have to as a pysch major DO NOT take this class.  If you have other classes that need a lot of your time don't take her class.  She wants her students to dedicate their entire day to her class.  Ridiculus
2678,1600998,3.0,5.0,"Good teacher, really interesting class. I learned a lot. Tests are impossible."
2679,1600998,4.5,3.0,Tough but awesome!
2680,1600998,4.0,3.0,"Attendance is not mandatory in class, but her tests are based mainly off of her notes. She is very enthusiastic about what she is teaching and overall is not a class I dread going to. Multiple choice tests are hard! Vote for short essay ones, easier grading and I did a whole 20 points better on it."
2681,1600998,3.5,2.0,Awesome professor! She is extremely nice and willing to work with you. Her tests are a bit tricky though. But not overly difficult. A+ =)
2682,770044,4.0,2.0,Professor McKee provides a lecture and discussion heavy class. She genuinely cares about her student's success. Her papers aren't always straightforward but she leaves good feedback so that you will improve on your other papers. The papers are short and sweet.
2683,770044,5.0,4.0,Passionate and interesting.
2684,770044,5.0,3.0,"She is very willing to clearly explain everything you have questions about. Although discussion is a large part of the class, it becomes very beneficial to engage, even if you're not particularly interested in English. She's a great teacher on every level."
2685,770044,5.0,4.0,She is the best teacher I have ever had.
2686,770044,4.5,5.0,No Comments
2687,1842672,5.0,1.0,"One of my favorite professsors I have ever had. She was not too homework heavy and she allowed at 48hr grace period after the due date to complete the assignment.  All she asks of you is to go to class, but overall she is a very caring person and if I could take her again I would."
2688,1842672,5.0,2.0,She cares a lot. Makes tons of jokes. You have to explain what your final grade should be.
2689,1842672,5.0,2.0,I loved Professor Bunde!! She was a great transition from High school writing into college writing. She give amazing feedback on your essays and ultimately wants you to grow as a writer and not focus on writing basic papers. She encourages changing up your writing style. She is super helpful! Loves to hear student feedback!
2690,1842672,5.0,3.0,"Very understanding, most important thing is to reach out if you need help."
2691,1842672,5.0,3.0,I loved Miss Bunde!! Do yourself a favor and definitely take a class with her. Shes always willing to help you with essays before turning in and she gives good feedback. Shes also just an overall very understanding and caring professor.
2692,1842672,5.0,3.0,"Bunde is the best professor I had at Ole Miss. I had her freshman year for WRIT102 and I was not having a great time at school, but her class was really the thing that kept me going. She was so insightful and inspired me as a writer. She was such a shining light in what was really a dark time for me. I couldn't recommend her more."
2693,1842672,5.0,3.0,"I highly recommend professor Bunde!! She was very understanding and easy to talk to. I normally dont like writing, but I liked her class."
2694,1842672,5.0,3.0,Professor Bunde is amazing! She really cares about her students and wants to be able to connect with each one. She appreciates when people participate in class. She was my favorite teacher by far for my first semester of my freshman year.
2695,1842672,3.0,4.0,"She is a hard grader. Also, you can never go to class and just sit there. You are always doing something, and it is usually with the textbook. It is a lot of work to be one of her students. She is nice, wants to help you, and cares though. I know other writing teachers that do not do this, so maybe look elsewhere if you want it easy."
2696,1842672,5.0,4.0,"She's really good at letting you write in any way that works best for you, and grading it according to that, unlike alot of professors who make you do things like unnessesary brain storm worksheets that won't help you at all. She's pretty funny and really nice and forgiving with assignments(like if you mess up, or need to turn something in late)."
2697,1842672,5.0,3.0,best teacher. one of my favorites. She really cares how you do in her class. Takes the time to meet and review if you aren't doing well. GREAT teacher!
2698,1842672,5.0,3.0,One of the best english teachers for this class
2699,1842672,5.0,3.0,"Had for both Writ 101 and 102. Excellent teacher. Is a fair grader and gives great feedback on papers. Eng is not my best subject and her class helped me get better. Clear on explaining exactly what needs to be done. Eng is a lot of work no matter what teacher you take, but she makes it easier to handle. One of the best teachers. Highly recommend"
2700,1842672,4.0,3.0,"Gives a lot of completion grades on homework (if done on time). Grades papers fairly, and she's super sweet. Easy to approach. Wish I could take her for Writing 102. She's my favorite teacher I've had so far in college"
2701,1842672,4.0,3.0,"Gives a lot of completion grades on homework (if done on time). Grades papers fairly, and she's super sweet. Easy to approach. Wish I could take her for Writing 102"
2702,1842672,4.5,2.0,She is a wonderful teacher she always is very clear on explaining and makes writing fun. I would recommend everybody to take her! 
2703,1842672,5.0,2.0,"I know it's just Writing 101, but Professor Bunde absolutely saved my life my first semester of my freshman year. She is very, very knowledgeable in her subject, incredibly well-spoken, and has a wonderful sense of humor. So much respect for this woman. I definitely recommend taking her class."
2704,1842672,5.0,2.0,Great professor! Uses interesting topics and assignments to make what could be a horrifyingly boring class into one I look forward to every week.
2705,1842672,5.0,3.0,She's willing to help with whatever you need and will always look over papers. Very genuinely nice.
2706,2727410,4.0,4.0,"Kinda intimidating but I really appreciate her, super lenient when it comes to missed work. Gives really good feedback on presentations but definitely be prepared to write and do presentations. Come prepared for class too. I like her though she gives lots of bonus opportunities"
2707,2727410,4.0,3.0,"Honestly I found her terrifying at first but she's definitely grown on me. Her class is almost entirely discussion based which is intimidating but I personally like the teaching style. She's pretty laid back when it comes to homework, but you have to do a lot of reading. I like her a lot though"
2708,2727413,5.0,4.0,"Class is hard because Arabic is hard. Its extensive Arabic, its going to be hard. But Dr Allen is hilarious and really cares to see you succeed. His program is top notch, he wrote the textbook, and you get what you want out of this class!"
2709,2727413,3.0,2.0,I took this as a summer course. He's a good professor but definitely eccentric. Very easy going but you have to participate in class. LOTS of homework. I've preferred other professors more but he's still a really solid choice and you definitely learn the material.
2710,2076157,5.0,2.0,My favorite math teacher I have ever had. She is the sweetest lady and always willing to help. She is super understanding. Only 4 tests a semester and they all have extra credit point opportunities. Always get out of class early and class during test week is optional. She helped me realize that I am actually pretty good at math and that I enjoy it.
2711,2076157,5.0,3.0,She spends less than half the class on the notes and then the rest of class you can work on homework and she will help you with any problems. She is super sweet and I feel like Im actually learning something. She gives us the steps and then lets us do the homework so that we learn how to do it on our own. 100% would take again.
2712,2076157,5.0,3.0,"One of the sweetest professors at Ole Miss. She keeps her lectures short and simple, and is always accessible outside of class if needed. Content of the tests are very clear, with review days and practice tests available to prepare. Take her class!"
2713,2076157,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Harville is one of my favorite professors. She's a little goofy sometimes, but it made class more enjoyable. Very down to earth woman. She cares about her students and will help you in office hours if needed."
2714,2076157,5.0,1.0,"very easy class, great professor :)"
2715,2076157,5.0,3.0,Absolutely incredible! She demonstrates how to do everything multiple times. All of her notes match up with both the homework and the tests. She's also bright and cheery even during an 8AM class! highly recommend and wish i could have her again!
2716,2076157,5.0,2.0,"Gives you time to do homework and makes it really easy to do well. Notes match exactly to every homework problem, and tests are the same format and similar questions to the study guides."
2717,2076157,5.0,2.0,Absolutely amazing. She explains everything very detailed. I really loved her class and I hate math. Would recommend 10/10!!!!
2718,2076157,5.0,1.0,The most amazing math teacher a college student could have.  She is there for you to pass the class.
2719,2076157,5.0,1.0,Awesome Prof! Super easy if you simply do the work. Tests are practically the same as the study guide. Gives homework. Loved her!
2720,2283006,1.0,4.0,AVOID THIS TEACHER IF YOU CAN!!!!! She is literally the definition of gaslight. I have never felt so disrespected by a teacher in my life. I have hated every minute I am in that class and I can not stress enough DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE!!!!! 
2721,2283006,1.0,4.0,"She is so rude to students and a terrible teacher. She loves to hear herself talk, and often talks for no reason about things that don't matter. She has a way of subtly belittleing students and is extremely passive aggressive. She is difficult to listen to and by the end of the semester, she has become just difficult to respect. "
2722,2283006,1.0,5.0,I wish that her body was not capable to process oxygen. She is an awful teacher and needs to be put down.
2723,2283006,1.0,4.0,The most passive aggressive professor Ive had yet. Do not take her if you dont absolutely have to. I have always been a very good student so dont think she just failed me so Im giving her a bad rating. She treats us like children and then acts as though were her friends. Sad excuse for a educator. Should have been a unmarried hermit instead.
2724,2283006,1.0,4.0,the worst type of professor you could have. She is extremely passive aggressive and makes you HATE every minute of the class. She acts like she cares about her students but actually treats us like we are little babies who are too stupid to learn anything. Never sign up for this class with her as your professor!!! She does not explain anything ever
2725,2283006,2.0,4.0,"Cooley has a severe lack of compassion for active military students. She doesn't seem to understand how an 8 am class differs from a 10 am class. Her grading is tough, as well as terrible because none of her comments actually help you improve on your writing. She also has a very passive aggressive nature that severely effects the attitude of class."
2726,2311678,3.0,4.0,"She was super cool and really tried to be entertaining but she is not good at teaching at all yet, partly because she's young. She just reads straight from the textbook and doesn't explain anything else so it's better to just do your own notes and teach yourself than trying to follow and copy her slides. The extra credit is nice though"
2727,1748480,5.0,3.0,"Love, love, loved this professor. Was very understanding of the current stress studnets are under. Lots of homework but graded for completion not accuracy. Tests are open notes. She's very good at explaining things you don't understand and she makes her lectures as engaging as possible over zoom. 10/10."
2728,1748480,4.0,2.0,If you only show up for tests and quizzes you will fail (I had an A- in the class but failed because of attendance). She sticks to her attendance policy. However there are plenty of extra credit opportunities and her tests and quizzes are easy if you pay attention in class and do the required reading
2729,1748480,2.0,3.0,"Do not take this class AND do not take this professor. I truly believe Roman Civilization could be interesting, however this woman makes it painful and boring. There is a list of awful things that I would prefer to attending her class lectures. Has a lot of passion for the subject but this lady just has no idea how to teach a large group of people."
2730,1826308,5.0,2.0,Hes awesome
2731,1826308,5.0,1.0,Travis was my teacher for the freshman course. The class isn't hard but you have to go to events you probably wouldn't if it wasn't required. Travis makes the class fun and he is easy to talk to if you need help. I actually went to him for advising even though he was not my advisor. And it doesn't hurt that he's cute ;)
2732,1826308,5.0,2.0,"He is a genuine teacher. He is always there when you have questions although you will rarely have any because he's very clear about what he expects. His tests are nearly verbatim to his powerpoint slides which he posts on blackboard. If you look over those, you'll easily pass."
2733,1826308,5.0,1.0,He is the best teacher I have ever had. He makes the class a lot of fun and gives the assignments for the whole semester at the beginning of the year so you can finish them whenever you want (They are unbelievably easy).
2734,1826308,5.0,2.0,This was a great course to take freshman year! A very stress-free class and Travis is the best teacher to have at 5pm :)
2735,1865222,1.0,5.0,I took this class online and she posted lecture videos for each chapter. Needless to say they were awful. Had absolutely nothing to do with the actual material covered in the book. Her accent is almost impossible to understand. Don't even bother with the videos. She is not helpful.
2736,1865222,1.0,5.0,"Literally the worst professor Ive ever had, absolutely hated this class. She was an awful teacher and was condescending when we didnt all get As because she cant teach. This class was so hard for literally no reason, I just had to teach myself statistics bc her instruction made no sense. Avoid at all costs!!!!!!"
2737,1865222,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Dang is nice! She cares about her students and wants everyone to pass. Three exams are worth 45% of your grade, so make sure you study. Statistics is not an easy course, but watch her lectures as they are super helpful. Do the homework because it'll help boost your grade. There's no extra credit, so you really have to work for your grade."
2738,1865222,3.0,3.0,A little bit of an accent and monotone. Math 115 with her isn't hard though if you study (I barely did and I got a B+). She curves a lot and counts partial credit if you had the right formula but messed up somewhere.
2739,1865222,1.0,4.0,Very hard class.
2740,1865222,4.0,3.0,"Thick accent, although generally understandable. Lectures are fine in explaining the material; willing and able to help you outside class; test grading seems to be rather liberal."
2741,1865222,3.5,3.0,"Statistics class for computer science, engineers, or math majors. Instructor was very knowledgeable on subject. Sometimes difficult to understand, but overall a good experience. Required an above average amount of study time. Grading policy did not appear to include much of a curve."
2742,2377238,2.0,3.0,She teaches very fast which is hard to keep up with. She claims she does partial credit but if you get the answer right and one part of the work wrong she will mark your answer wrong which was a big disadvantage for me.
2743,2377238,1.0,5.0,I hate her so much. She makes my life miserable. I would rather jump off the Pavilion than go to her class and have to make myself go daily. She takes points off for missing class! I have failed her test and cried very hard about it so yeah. DO NOT get her as ur teacher she sucks so bad.
2744,2377238,1.0,5.0,do not take her class.
2745,2377238,1.0,4.0,The worst teacher I have had in my education experience.
2746,2377238,1.0,5.0,Very rude and does not teach
2747,2377238,1.0,5.0,Ms. Cayson is out to fail her students. Do NOT take this class. Everyone I know failed. Did not explain lessons at all and was not kind.
2748,2377238,2.0,4.0,Did not like the way she lectured at all and made things 10 times more confusing. If you do bad on one test your whole grade will drop at least a letter grade. Would not recommend her unless youre good at teaching yourself the lessons!!
2749,2377238,5.0,1.0,Ms. Cayson is a really great teacher she explains the things that weren't explained correctly in high school. Common sense just show up to class and do the homework and you'll get an A
2750,2377238,4.0,3.0,"Very sweet and nice teacher. Good at what she does and cares about your success in math. This class is to help prepare you for college algebra, and she does a good job at doing so. Quizzes are at the math lab and tests are on paper in class. She gives back your tests in a timely manner. Definitely recommend, great math teacher."
2751,1685014,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely awful. I took her last semester and she genuinely went out of her way to fail me. I got a 46 on the first paper after I went to the writing center every single day, emailed her countless times and maybe missed one homework. The best grade I got was an 86 on the multimodal. Save yourself and don't take the class."
2752,1685014,1.0,5.0,Im appealing my grade yall should too
2753,1685014,1.0,5.0,Very unhelpful teacher who has a poor attitude. Awful at giving feedback that will help students get an A in her class. Avoid this teacher at all costs if you can. If you take her prepare to receive a bad grade in a class that should be an easy A.
2754,1685014,1.0,5.0,"Overall the worst teacher that I have ever had. I was taking this class alongside cal 2 and chem 106 and she is so awful that she managed to make her writing class harder than both of them. She is prone to ignore important emails and on all of my papers she would give me very positive feedback, but she never gave me an A for reasons unknown."
2755,1685014,1.0,5.0,Do not take this class if you are looking to get a good grade in writing
2756,1685014,1.0,4.0,"I decided to take her class online, thinking eh, it cant be that hard. Boy, was I wrong. Her class is FILLED with busy work, alongside quizzes that are basically for you to guess and hope for the best. Deadlines are strange and somewhat have a pattern, but make sure you write the dates down. Very tough grader and comes off aggressive via computer."
2757,1685014,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher I have ever had. She has a terrible attitude and is highly unprofessional. Expects 10 hours + a week on writing alone. There are discussion forums every week that take forever and she grades you super hard. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER, SAVE YOURSELF."
2758,1685014,5.0,2.0,"Professor Meek is a very laid back teacher. The majority of her lectures were kept interesting and class discussions were rarely boring. If you show up to every class, appear to be interested, and ask for help you will pass. Attendance is the only nuisance, I had an A+ in the class but it was dropped to a B for having to many absenses."
2759,2295322,1.0,3.0,"She is the WOAT. Sitting in the class isn't bad because she just asks how you feel about your writing process all the time,you could write a bomb essay and she will still manage to find a way to give you a 48/100. The class had not bettered my writing skills and it was my most miserable gen ed of the semester-and I am a journalism major. STAY AWAY"

2764,1007135,1.0,3.0,"I do not recommend taking her for an online course at all. Some of the quizzes have completely different answers than what she has told us they are in the lectures. She is not helpful, and I feel as though I am teaching myself the entire class. The exams are unnecessarily difficult compared to the ones given by other professors of this course."
2765,1007135,4.0,2.0,Learnsmart and Connect Quizes every week are due and are super easy. Class participation assignments are once a week and graded easily.
2766,1007135,5.0,3.0,"So easy!!! I made a 102 in Bio 102. She gives loads of extra credit and participation if you just show up to class. Tests are medium level, but all the Learn smart Assignment grades cancel them out. WOULD TAKE AGAIN."
2767,1007135,5.0,1.0,"Absolutely the best professor I've ever taken! Lecutre is a little dull, but it's biology. She gives so many bonus points and genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. Just attend class, do the assignments, and study because it's really that straightforward. There is no reason to have anything less than an A in Mrs Jackson's class."
2768,1007135,5.0,4.0,"Jackson is an awesome teacher. I am a Criminal Justice major and was not looking forward to having to take a Biology class. However, I attended every class period, took notes, and studied and made all A's on the test. Her tests are word for word from the notes you take in class. Outside of studying you have &quot;homework&quot; maybe three, times if that."
2769,1007135,5.0,2.0,Really great professor. Made biology fun.
2770,1007135,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Tests are exactly from notes taken in lecture. Write down everything she writes down, study it, and you will get an A on the tests. Quizzes every week but they are very easy if you study your notes from that week. Also advise to go to all of the SI sessions you can if available"
2771,1007135,4.0,1.0,She's very nice. Show up to class and take notes. Tests are based off notes and are your only grades. Study and you should make an A in the class.
2772,1007135,3.0,4.0,"Good teacher, but lectures are full of necessary information. 2 tests in class and 2 are online. Easier than most biology teachers that my friends had."
2773,1007135,5.0,3.0,"One of my best Ole Miss classes. Ms Jackson's expectations were the clearest I've had at Ole Miss. She tells you what you need to do, helps you do it. Yes, lectures are a little dulle but it's Biology, what do you expect. She will help you whenever she can. Unannounced in class quizzes are a pain, but she warns you about them."
2774,1007135,2.0,5.0,You need to go to class cuz she gives pop quizzes and study your butt off
2775,1007135,4.5,3.0,"I, personally, loved this teacher. I met with her on several occasions, and she was always helpful and kind. There was no homework in the course, but to study.  There were pop quizzes about once every two weeks or so! The book was not necessary; everything on the tests/quizzes is what she went over in class."
2776,1007135,1.0,4.0,Avoid at all costs
2777,1007135,5.0,1.0,"Writes all of her notes on the chalkboard, so it is easy to follow/write. She gives bonus quizzes, which are voluntary, to aid your overall grade."
2778,1007135,1.5,4.0,"She wrote on a chalk board. She has NO outside work, only 3 tests one of which is a drop grade. I would NOT recommend her."
2779,1007135,5.0,3.0,Biology isn't an easy class but Mrs Jackson is really fair and makes a lot of effort to help you learn. Uses the overhead which looks old school but really helped me. My friends told me she was way better than the professors that they had
2780,1007135,3.5,3.0,I was a little confused on the first test and emailed her and her response was to study more... Which I did and got an average grade the next test! Exams are the only grades (which sucks!) but she gives a ton of bonus points for the blackboard quiz's (DO THEM!!!) I hate bio though but she was a pretty good teacher
2781,1007135,4.0,1.0,Straightforward and fair teacher
2782,1007135,3.5,1.0,"Class is extremely easy, and if you show up to class with the powerpoint slides you have no reason not to do well on the tests. I chose to stop going to the class, using the study guides she gives for each test and filling it out on my own. Does not take attendance thus saved me from this giant waste of time."
2783,1007135,5.0,4.0,Very thorough and challenging teacher.  Go to class and take detailed notes. I learned a lot about Biology.
2784,1007135,1.5,1.0,"This class is very easy overall. If you go to class (which is hard because she is extremely boring), takes notes, and study for the test you will make an &quot;A.&quot; If you actually want to learn anything at all about biology, then I advise you to get another teacher. I may have received an &quot;A,&quot; but this class is worthless."
2785,1007135,3.5,1.0,"Easy. Go to class, and take notes. That's all you need. No need to buy the book, just pay attention in class."
2786,1007135,3.5,1.0,"Go to class, take notes. If you do that, you'll ace the tests. Don't bother buying the book."
2787,1007135,5.0,2.0,"If you go to class and take the notes, the tests will be a breeze!"
2788,1007135,1.5,4.0,speaks in a monotone voice and makes you wanna stick forks in your eyes you're so bored.
2789,1007135,5.0,1.0,She is very nice and explains every thing very well. I wish she could teach all my classes. She deserves 10 chilli peppers!

2791,2029091,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Grem is the best professor I've ever had.  He taught a history of southern music class that was fascinating. He even played guitar for our class. I took two classes from him and I wish I would have taken more.  His classes are not easy and take hard work, but that is what makes his classes so great. If you want to learn history, he is your guy."
2792,2029091,1.0,2.0,Dr. Grem is one of the most non understanding human I have ever met. He grades so strictly. I had his Southern Studies class and it is by far the most boring class you can ever take. Not a single person actually enjoyed the class. Dr Grem is a noticeable narcissist. He speaks so highly of himself and he really is not an interesting guy. 
2793,2029091,5.0,3.0,He's an amazing teacher and his class isn't too hard. Just do the reading before class and you'll be alright.
2794,2029091,5.0,4.0,Class isn't even over yet and I wanna marry him and have his babies and have intulectuall  discussions over bourbon at city grocery
2795,2225699,1.0,5.0,I'm sure she's nice but I wanted to literally change my major because of this class and I'm an imc major. No grades but 4 exams with no essays and few extra credit that was very hard and worth very few points.
2796,2225699,2.0,4.0,"Teaches like it is for the major, only grades are exams and pretty tough extra credit. Very sweet but not a fantastic professor and most of the lectures could be done in 15 minutes if not for the significant discussion times."
2797,2225699,3.0,4.0,"She is very into politics, so if you are a pol major, she is a good class. However, if you have no interest in the subject its going to be very tough"
2798,2225699,3.0,4.0,Go to class. She lectures and if you miss it you're honestly screwed. If you're not a pol major I wouldn't recommend her class. Her class is really difficult.
2799,2225699,3.0,3.0,She is an average teacher that I would not take again. I have had better and worse but she is a hard teacher to take especially if you just want the credit hours. She will give a pop quiz and is not always the easiest to talk to one on one. She is not horrible but there are easier better options.
2800,2225699,3.0,3.0,"Office hours are narrow, but the material is fairly easy to understand if you try hard enough. If you read the chapter and come to class you'll get a A-B. There is a discussion grade so beware of poly sci majors eating up all the time. You have to get a word in edgewise at least once."
2801,2225699,4.0,4.0,There's a ton of content and she doesn't really have much time to cover everything. She sets the class up in a way where you must participate and be ready to discuss topics covered in the textbook. Her lectures are interesting and she's very kind; this class is for really dedicated students though because there is a ton of reading and quizzes.
2802,2225699,4.0,5.0,She was accessible outside of class and was willing to help you but you have to really ask and make sure she knows you are struggling. She was a very though grader and you have to go to class in order to pass. For into to pol I wouldn't recommend trying to get a little easier teacher. She can be really helpful but you really have to reach out.
2803,2225699,1.0,4.0,She was a hard teacher to be teaching intro to politics. I would not advice if you are not a political science major!
2804,2242085,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lawrence is an amazing professor.  She is very understanding when it comes to missing class for a family emergency or a school related event. She also will help you understand the test material when reviewing your exam. The class is very easy if you are there to learn and actually pay attention to what she is teaching. I enjoyed her class.  
2805,2242085,1.0,4.0,Had a horrible attitude about people having computer problems and was very difficult to track down by email to ask questions if a student was struggling with a topic or had a question about test results. Grades on the tests were unbelievably low. Should not be teaching at a top 10 accounting school.
2806,2242085,1.0,5.0,This teacher is extremely disorganized and unable to teach. She reads off math and powerpoints rather than instruct and explain the topics. She even randomly assigned a project that was never in the Syllabus. I have never failed a class at Ole Miss but this might be the first time I do.
2807,2242085,1.0,5.0,"cut rate professor. Awful class structure. Even though I have done everything I can to pass her class such as 2 hour a day tutoring, Im still not doing well. This is not a good experience. She makes work a lot harder than it needs to be and is incapable of being professional. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER!"
2808,2242085,1.0,5.0,"Listen here Ive been going to school for five years never have I met a teacher that ignores messages, is so awful at writing Online tests, and some how bad at online lectures. Judy is THE WORST PROFESSOR I have ever had. I would wish this class on my worst enemy. She has literally been so hard to deal with and a little disrespectful."
2809,2242085,1.0,5.0,"Tough class, she rarely turned around from facing the board during class and had a way of making simple things seem even harder."
2810,2242085,4.0,4.0,"Though intimidating at first, Dr. Lawrence is a good accounting teacher who actually wants her students to learn. Her tests are easier than most other accounting teachers and she gives a good amount of extra credit!"
2811,2477616,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bondurant is one of the most knowledgeable professors Ive had. His feedback is genuine and he takes the time to thoroughly read your writing. If you want to actually become a better writer, take one of his classes."
2812,2477616,1.0,4.0,If it were not for the two amazing TA's I would have failed this class. Prof. Bondurant was absolutely horrible. Lecture was pointless as he just rambles and forces you to go. The only time I ever learned anything was discussion with my TA. SO thankful for my amazing TA. Dr. Bondurant on the other hand should probably try and find a different job b
2813,2477616,3.0,4.0,"There are a lot of reading assignments, but then again this is an English course. Sometimes in lectures, he went fast but the discussion is where you discuss more and go in-depth. You must show up to class because there is a quiz for each book and they do not tell you when you will have them so KEEP UP WITH THE READING."
2814,2477616,1.0,4.0,"He is VERY UNORGANIZED and dont even bother e-mailing him because he wont respond. He likes to ramble on and on and he likes to pick on students even when its noticeable that they dont really like it. Dude, its not funny. During whole class work shops, hes the main one talking and we have run behind because of this. The advice he gives is ok."
2815,2477616,3.0,3.0,"Here's the thing about Dr. Bondurant- he is a tough grader with a closed mind. He is especially well versed in the publishing industry, but not so much in the teaching field. He will talk the entire class, then get very angry (yelling, cursing, etc) that no one is talking. We are chronically behind in our syllabus as well."
2816,1166898,5.0,3.0,"great teacher, really fair with grading and isnt out to get anybody. He will help you out to get a good grade. the only way you dont get an A or B is by not showing up at all to class."
2817,1166898,5.0,3.0,Dr. Skultety's class was wonderful. He's very excited about his work and makes wonderfully nerdy jokes while still conducting a thought-provoking and fascinating class experience.
2818,1166898,4.0,3.0,"Skultety is an amazing professor, probably the best one I've at Ole Miss. He's very interesting, he didn't assign homework other than a couple readings that he would discuss in class. The tests were cut and dry if you paid attention to review day and all the lessons. LOVED his class so much"
2819,1166898,4.5,1.0,"The best teacher ever. Attend his classes, pay attention, review from his PowerPoint presentation and you will get a direct &quot;A&quot;. Moreover, he is so enthusiastic."
2820,1166898,5.0,2.0,"He's got a tough subject to make people understand but he does a good job. I wasnt really that enthusiastic about an 8 am Philosophy class, but with his three absence policy, I've been forced to get out of bed and go to class. He really does his best to explain the concepts to you.As long as you take notes and actually listen, he's a great teacher"
2821,1166898,4.0,4.0,Tougher teacher than most. Would explain things a lot. Tests were harder than normal philosophy classes were.
2822,1166898,4.5,4.0,"Great, great teacher. He is a young teacher who seems very excited and optimistic about what he is doing. He made me feel like even if I had a dumb question, it was important. That is very rare with professors, especially philosophy teachers who kinda have the tendency to intellectually slap you around every once in a while. He was different."
2823,1166898,5.0,5.0,No Comments
2824,1166898,4.0,1.0,"Great teacher. I enjoy his presentations a lot. If you take notes and study, you will do fine on the tests."
2825,597552,4.5,3.0,Great class.  She always has time to talk with students both after class and in her office.  Nice person and a good teacher.  Wish I was 20 years older!
2826,597552,5.0,2.0,good class.  knowledable and good lecturer
2827,597552,5.0,2.0,I would give her 100% on my class.  I was captivated from the beginning.  Now that I'm student teaching I can see how so much of what she taught applies to my work. Very knowledgable and has enthusiam for the material.  Explains in a way that is easily understandable.  Cares about us as students
2828,597552,5.0,3.0,A cool lady.  Knows her stuff. Not bad to look at.
2829,597552,5.0,2.0,Always relevant and entertaining.  She always keeps my interest in class.
2830,597552,5.0,3.0,I was entertained and learned more than in any other education class I have taken.
2831,597552,5.0,4.0,Taught to our needs and prepared us for both our next classes and student teaching.  I LOVE her.
2832,597552,5.0,2.0,A people person who knows her stuff!  Really good teacher.  She made me think!
2833,597552,5.0,2.0,Good teacher.  Fair in grading. Gives chances to improve grade. Love group work. Easy on the eyes. Great guest speaker on Eastern Philosophy.
2834,597552,5.0,3.0,Very concerned about students and their learning.  Ties philosophy and theory to real world of teaching. Excellent teacher.

2837,597552,2.0,2.0,Just reads the slides.  Many students do not like her.  You can pass if you just do the work.  She is a professor who only taught high school for like 2 years.  No real world experience.
2838,1166896,4.0,3.0,"He is over the chem labs, but you'll rarely see him and your TA is the one who teaches and grades all of your assignments, so they will make or break the course. Overall though the grading criteria for the course is clear, and there are a lot of points available so its not too hard to make a good grade. "
2839,1166896,5.0,2.0,Professor Wiginton actually cares about his students and their success. If you attend class regularly you will obtain a lot of extra credit. He gives feedback on homework assignments and his homework is actually useful. The textbook is only used slightly and the online version is better than the physical. The lab with this course is also easy.
2840,1166896,4.0,4.0,Takes time to answer and explain questions during lecture
2841,1166896,5.0,3.0,He is an excellent teacher and he will help you when you dont understand. He gives extra credit. You can not skip because some things you learn will be used and needed in the next chapter. I enjoyed his class. I got sick and couldnt finished the class.
2842,1166896,4.0,3.0,"I believe Wiginton truly cares about his students. He was willing to work with me on multiple accounts to make my schedule work. He is not a big lecturer, but will explain anything to you as long as you ask."
2843,1166896,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Wiginton made lab miserable. Our TA was decent, though sometimes ill prepared for class. But Wiginton (who we saw once the whole semester) changed grading criteria, added extremely difficult quizzes at the end of the semester, and was incredibly unhelpful when students sought help. Unfortunately, I don't think you can take Chem without him."
2844,1166896,5.0,3.0,Great teacher who actually wants his students to pass. Gives lots of extra credit opportunities. If you don't understand something go to his office hours or GO TO SI. If you actually try you should manage to get an A
2845,1166896,4.0,3.0,"Not the best at teaching material, but he gives TONS of extra credit if you just come to class. Beware of ALEKS, program that supposedly helps you with chem and counts for grade. It was just tedious, but you just had to get through it and your grade would be ok. Go to SI sessions before tests bc he gives the SI leader the test. Wink wink"
2846,1166896,5.0,3.0,TAKE DR WIGINTON FOR GEN CHEM! He is the absolute best. He gives you every resource to succeed. His office hours are all the time - just go by whenever. He will go over anything you don't understand or help with homework or book problems. Gives so much extra credit. Works closely with SI leader in order to make that helpful too. Best teacher!!
2847,1166896,4.0,3.0,One of my favorite professors ever!! So helpful in his office hours and works with his SI leader to ensure the SI review is similar to the test and actually HELPFUL. Lecture is kind of boring and tedious to attend since there is no attendance policy but he will randomly give extra credit at the beginning of class so I recommend going.
2848,1166896,5.0,3.0,"The best teacher you can take for 105-106. He also works very closely with his SI leaders so if you actually go to SI test review and understand the practice test, you will do very well on the tests. He gives a lot of extra credit so there is really no excuse not to at least get a B."
2849,1166896,5.0,3.0,He is awesome. He gives a lot of extra credit points for tests. Best chemistry teacher. 
2850,1166896,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher. Explains things very well. Answers all questions, even the slightly dumb ones, asked by the students. Will re-explain things if you need him to."
2851,1166896,5.0,3.0,"Really nice teacher. Wants you prepared for the ACS final and teaches you what you need to know. Have to work hard and put in the time, but he's got everyone's best interest in mind."
2852,1166896,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, he teaches you what you need to know and not any extra fluff."
2853,1166896,4.5,1.0,"Does a lot of examples in class. All the test questions come from homework. There is a lot of homework, but you only have to get 80% right to make a 100. Extra credit is offered throughout the course."
2854,1166896,4.0,2.0,Lots of labs.

2856,2309698,5.0,3.0,Giovanna is an absolute gem of a professor! I struggle with learning a different language but takes the time to help you and find out where things go wrong. She does her absolute best to give you as many points as possible during grading. She also manages to make class easy to participate in. she somehow makes class very energized.
2857,2309698,5.0,3.0,"Giovanna is a witty, caring instructor and she really loves what she does. If you take her as an instructor, you will start to look forward to her class. She is honest about how she feels about America, which is hilarious at times. If you do well in her class and try your best, she will go out of her way to help you if you need it! Highly recommend"
2858,2375234,5.0,2.0,"The material was not all that interesting to me because I don't like philosophy, but Professor Graham made it interesting. His tests are easy. I was able to study before class and always make an A. His lectures are hilarious if you get that nerdy kind of humor. Furthermore, he is SO HOT! And he went to Harvard Law School. How cool!"
2859,2375234,5.0,2.0,He really enjoys what he is talking about and nice to listen to. Most of us just listen and would pass his tests. Your grade is only determined by four tests though but they're not hard. And hes hot.
2860,2412101,4.0,1.0,"Love this dude. Anyone who has anything bad to say about Dr Husni - I would not trust them. If he does not like you, it is your fault."
2861,2412101,3.0,4.0,He is very enthusiastic about the class but often goes off on long tangents about off topic things instead of teaching the material. He also travels for work a lot so it is not uncommon for him not to be there and you watch a random video instead. He puts nothing online so you have to go to class to learn the material.
2862,2412101,4.0,3.0,He is a great professor. I would advise anyone taking his class to make sure that you go to class and engage in the conversations when he is lecturing. You do need to go to class but it shouldn't be a problem for you to go because he is really funny and nice. It is essential for you to go to the lectures!!!DO ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT HE GIVES! hes gr8
2863,2412101,2.0,3.0,"He's very conceded and shows videos that he's in at least 2/3 classes that we meet weekly. We haven't had an actual lecture where I learned something since the first week of school, so be prepared to watch pointless videos EVERY DAY, and not learn anything. He's very smart and knowledgeable on the subject, but doesn't lecture at all."
2864,2180674,5.0,3.0,"Funny non mandatory lectures, gives study guides, helpful"
2865,937547,4.5,4.0,He is always on time.
2866,937547,5.0,5.0,Take him!
2867,937547,4.5,3.0,Good teacher
2868,1705548,4.5,3.0,"Shes's amazing!  One of the sweetest teachers I've had and one of the best at explaining things.  She takes some of the harder topics and shows us how to do them ""her"" way which is soo much simpler.  Definitely take this class with Mrs. Williams!!"
2869,1705548,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Williams is the best teacher I've had at Ole Miss so far. She is knowledgeable, no question is a bad question. I think it is because she is a mom that she is so patient. Bring your book and calculator everyday, pay attention and you are golden. Also, she loves anyone that talks in class, even if you are wrong. She makes accounting approachable"
2870,2485837,5.0,3.0,"He is the most down to earth, easy person to talk to. As someone with severe ADHD, he teaches in a way that I am able to actually comprehend what he is saying without it going in one ear and out the other. Not to mention, I am awful at computer science and testing taking but he makes it interesting which resulted in an 85 on my first exam. Take him"
2871,2485837,5.0,2.0,"I took this online, and it was nice to work at my own pace. As long as you do the assignments that are assigned each week, you will make an easy A. You get multiple attempts at the assignments and it tells you what you did wrong."
2872,1576528,2.0,3.0,A tool.  Don't take him unless you have to.  He doesn't explain material well and I learned nothing.  He gets mad and wonders why nobody understands what the heck he's teaching and doesn't realize that he is the problem...
2873,306768,5.0,3.0,"This was a challenging and rewarding course. Discussion is emphasized, which both tests and enhances your critical thinking and analytical abilities. Dr. FW is a tough but fair grader. You get what you put in, essentially. She's pretty laid-back & easy to talk to, & I definitely have a greater appreciation for American lit after taking this class."
2874,306768,5.0,1.0,"Any person with a remote interest in the environment should take this as the humanities requirement.  You read quite a few books, but if you do the pretty nominal work you will make an A.  Really cares about what she teaches, and totally fits your image of who would teach an environmental studies class.  One of the best teachers I have had here."
2875,306768,5.0,3.0,Amazing energy. So helpful! Fantastic teacher
2876,306768,4.0,3.0,"awesome and really out there! will do yoga in class if you ask her too. she has a real passion for life. you'll get out of the class what you put into it. we read Anna Karenina, which would've been BORING if read alone, but she breathed life into the book. she has an unforgettable spirit and if u have an open mind, you'll love her."
2877,306768,1.0,3.0,"did not enjoy the class, she worships certain weird poets and you have to just worship them with her. you get the feeling she would rather be anywhere but where she is. dreaded the class, it was too creepy."

2879,306768,5.0,3.0,Super Cool!
2880,306768,2.0,3.0,"She's hot and cool at the same time, but she will mess with your head and make you feel kind of creepy."
2881,2389587,1.0,5.0,"Besides the point he stares at the girls chests all of class, he is a seriously tough grader. He goes against his word and has not sympathy. Hes also kinda off, the first day he had change in his pocket and moved it around the entire time he lectured. He also blinks a lot and it makes it difficult to focus on his lectures that he drags on"
2882,2670167,1.0,5.0,Very demanding. Asks you to spend anywhere from $400-$1000 on equipment and gets mad when you cannot afford it. 
2883,728664,2.0,2.0,"Dry lecture, might of been in the industry yeas ago, but little grasp on what really is going on. if you show up the the class you get a decent grade, but you'll need something to stay awake during discussion. Always talks about the money in industry, but is irrelevant in his dated view on the industry. "

2885,728664,4.5,1.0,"Tobin is a really really really nice guy.  He will try to give as many high grades as possible, very genuinely likes his profession and subject (even though it is a little dry).  If you take this course, do whatever you can to take his class."
2886,2805338,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor. Would love to take her class again. 
2887,503392,5.0,2.0,Dr. Torma is just about the best youre going to find in terms of basic science professors. He is funny and very understanding if you have a scheduling issue. His class is easy if you pay attention which is not difficult. He is passionate about astronomy and that makes his lectures entertaining and engaging. Take this class.
2888,503392,2.0,4.0,"You literally cannot skip one class. There is a quiz every single day that serves as attendance and is graded for correctness. If you like astronomy, take it... but it is awful. super hard and his accent is hard to understand."
2889,503392,2.0,2.0,"Astr 104 is easy enough .The lectures are really boring and he puts up the slides later so just study those, but tests are hard.  But you do have to go to class at least to fill out a scantron. Textbook?I haven't even opened it. If you really do want it just buy the oldest/cheapest edition. Don't take honors lab! So much harder and not worth it."
2890,503392,4.5,1.0,"I took this class mostly because I am not a science person & had to have a science class with a lab. However, I really enjoyed it -- Dr. Torma was great (if you sit in front he isn't hard to understand) & I had his daughter, Tiffany, as my T.A. Both of them worked really hard to make the class & lab fun and easy to understand!"
2891,503392,1.5,1.0,"Really a bad teacher with a boring useless class. If you what an easy A, go for it. I learned literally nothing the whole semiester, which was a disappointment. Between his accent and the poor quality of the sound system in the auditorium where the class takes place it can be between difficult to impossible to understand him."
2892,503392,4.0,1.0,"Good teacher, really easy class."
2893,503392,2.0,2.0,"Dr. Torma's lectures could cause insomniacs to sleep at night, but his class is pretty easy. If you're looking to rid yourself of the science + lab requirement, take him."
2894,503392,2.5,2.0,can be hard to understand so i had to listen closely but overall not a bad teacher. subject matter can be extremely boring but tests/quizzes are not very challenging
2895,503392,4.5,1.0,Very easy!!!

2897,503392,4.0,1.0,Really easy teacher.  Has a Hungarian accent but it's not too bad.  Quizzes in class are really easy.  Tells a lot of old corny jokes and is really easy to get along with.
2898,503392,3.0,1.0,"Want a rating&#63;  He's a Slavic Astronomer.  Doesn't speak English very well, but he doesnt need to.  Everything comes from the notes.  Quiz every day that you can copy.  Funny guy because if you talk fast he cannot understand you.  Easy A, If you cannot get an A you need to quit while your ahead"
2899,503392,2.5,3.0,I had his class in the summer and he was easy.  He did not give many notes and the tests were taken from the notes.  It is best to listen to what he says because a question might show up on a test that was not on a slide.
2900,503392,1.0,2.0,I felt like he talked down to me tremendously if I had made a mistake or had been affected by a mistake someone else had made.
2901,2440807,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor, he could be easily teaching at an Ivy League school. Took the honors section. Its hard, I wouldnt recommend it if you arent interested in accounting or finance as a profession, but if you want to really learn accounting, Dr. Cantrell is the way to go."
2902,2440807,5.0,4.0,The smartest professor I have ever had. I took his honors accounting 201 class and I've never worked harder for a grade but I think the way he grades truly reflects what you deserve. I feel like I learned tons more than the other classes and I feel so prepared for future accounting courses.
2903,2827884,4.0,3.0,"Listen carefully, His slides don't have the notes on them. "
2904,2827884,1.0,5.0,"This professor is very lecture heavy. He says umm way too much. He asks for questions and when no one has any, he sits there in silence. Everyday we do same thing and he talks the whole time. He grades the papers very hard. I would not recommend taking this professor especially if you enjoy history and want to learn.  "
2905,2827884,2.0,3.0,"Super long and boring lectures. Ask for questions from the class then makes you feel stupid when he answers. Attendance is mandatory!!! If you miss one day of class, your grade will drop significantly since there is not a lot of grades. Spent $100 on books we never even used. He also says um a lot. Genuine guy, wouldn't recommend as a prof."
2906,2827884,1.0,4.0,I would rather rip my ears off then listen him say um 247 times in 50 minutes. If you miss 1 lecture your grade drops 20 points. He makes you buy textbooks that you will never open. If he asks the class to participate he will degrade you until someone answers. Tests are all short answer questions no multiple choice. DO NOT RECOMMEND!
2907,2827884,1.0,4.0,"Scanlon was overall not a good professor. His classes, assignments, and texts are very hard to succeed in due to the teaching. His teaching is very hard to follow and it leaves room for a lot of error. His grading is harder than it should be and he is very up tight when it comes to little things. "
2908,2707057,1.0,5.0,"If you're not majoring in art, take theater or intro to music to fill this credit and save yourself the trouble. This course deals with a lot of history FYI. I worked very hard in this class, I am a straight A student and while her class is not impossible, the final is worth 25% of your grade and she does NOT round your grade, I was left at a 79.6%"
2909,2707057,3.0,2.0,Lectures are very boring and all of the information for the tests can be found in the Powerpoints she posts to Blackboard.
2910,2707057,2.0,3.0,"I only took this class for a requirement, and it has to be one of the most boring lectures you'll ever sit through in your entire collegecareer. The PowerPoints she goes over in class she posts to blackboard and really doesn't add anything else in class so you might as well just show up. Attendance is mandatory but honestly just scan in and leave"
2911,1009266,4.5,5.0,Great teacher!!! He is so nice! Loved everything in his class. Charmimg and funny. Friendly with all the students. I kind of thought too friendly. But take him and you will not regret a moment. Behaves more as a TA than a professor. So take him.
2912,1009266,4.5,2.0,Great teacher. You will learn a lot.
2913,1009266,4.5,2.0,Great teacher
2914,1009266,1.0,2.0,Really hard professor. Tough to reach after class. Not very nice to talk with. Tests are way too hard for the subject. Avoid like the plague.
2915,1009266,2.0,4.0,He's OK- all of his tests come off powerpoints. Very strict prof and his tests are hard. Quizzes every class. Must go to class to get the notes. Hard to understand. But he knows what's he's talking about. Would avoid if you can
2916,1009266,4.5,4.0,"He is a great teacher, once you can deal with his quizzes. Over all, great class. You will learn a lot."
2917,1009266,3.0,3.0,I have no idea why there are so many negative comments... I actually find this instructor very interesting. He helps the student and if you have any problems he is welling to work it out with you. He is extremely knowledgeable.
2918,1009266,1.0,3.0,"This guy's class was ridiculous. The material you have to know for the class is extremely easy. However, in class, it is like listening to Jar Jar Binks Speak. He gives quizzes so you can't skip. His strategy sucks because he leaves out words on the powerpnts so you have to come to class to get the words. How is this supposed to help anyone learn&#63;"
2919,1009266,4.5,2.0,Very Interesting class. He makes the class more fun attend.
2920,1009266,4.5,3.0,He is a good teacher
2921,1009266,2.5,5.0,If he can avoid him I would. He is very hard to understand. Most of the time you cannot understand what he is saying. You have quizzes every class although he does not take attendance. The exams are very hard and you have to memorize a lot
2922,1009266,4.0,5.0,It seems to be ok. He is helpful and quite knowledgeble. His grading is tough. And there is almost no curving. Too bad. But otherwise I feel that this class. Though his subject is boring :(
2923,1009266,3.5,3.0,"He is quite nice and makes himself available to students. He works very hard to give us clear notes and tasks, but he is too objective. Give us some slack we need it (by we I mean the students)"
2924,1009266,1.0,5.0,I passed it!
2925,1009266,1.0,5.0,thanks God is over
2926,1009266,1.0,5.0,"no comments, just ratings"
2927,1009266,1.0,5.0,"could you please tell them to appoint another instructor!!! he is poor at eplaining tasks, though he wants to be liked by everybody!!!"
2928,1009266,2.0,3.0,"I like our firld trips and he is hot, but I hahte his tests, and he gives tests very often"
2929,1009266,1.0,5.0,"there are so many tests that you can not keep up with the course, it is as if the only thing that you need to do is study for the tests"
2930,2397809,5.0,2.0,"Honestly one of the best teachers I've had while attending university. If you're interested in the subject of the class and can discuss things with a relative objectivity, you'll do fine. Her exams aren't hard, and the reading are, for the most part, interesting. Class participation/discussion was a big deal, but lecture was also important."
2931,2397809,5.0,4.0,she is so rad. def would take her again
2932,2707058,5.0,3.0,"Love Professor X he's so passionate about physics, and that makes it easier to understand the content. He does lots of demonstrations, and he is hilarious and cares about his students!"
2933,2707058,5.0,3.0,Was energetic and willing to help out of class
2934,1283705,1.0,4.0,"Take anyone else for this class.  He only gives two tests for the entire lecture, which count for 60% of your grade.  Highest grade on the first test was a 63.  Thank God he curves but even then most students only had a 60.  Not a very good lecturer, tends to ramble without outlining clear, concise learning objectives.  Had all A's til this class."
2935,1283705,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, fun class."
2936,1283705,1.0,5.0,"His power points are straight from the textbook. He gives pop quizzes all the time. And his tests are multiple choice, where it can be one answer, all the answers, or any combination of the answers"
2937,1283705,2.0,5.0,The worst teacher if you actually care about your grade. The class average for the midterm and final (only 2 tests) was a D. Thinks all the students are ruining the earth.
2938,1283705,2.0,5.0,"This class should be avoided at all costs. He makes General Ecology seem like Neuroscience. There are 2 outside books you must read and lab lasts the entire period every time, and the TA will make any excuse to lower your grade. They are extremely condescending and rude to students. By far the worst class I have ever taken."
2939,2172541,1.0,3.0,"Whenever I walked to her class, I would close my eyes while crossing the crosswalk hoping that I would get hit by a car. I genuinely did not want to attend her class. All I did was suffer. You can't live laugh love in these conditions."
2940,2172541,3.0,3.0,"Ms. Meisel is a great person, but her class wasn't enjoyable. I feel like it's more the class's fault than hers, though. Lessons were over basic writing skills that most people have probably been using since 8th/9th grade, like how to write a thesis statement, use ethos/pathos/logos. Really wish the class wasn't required, felt like a waste of time."
2941,2010754,5.0,3.0,"I loved taking this class from him! The material itself is pretty average difficulty, but he explains it very well. As long as you actually do the practice test and the homework, it's pretty easy to make an A. Going to class is key because you need the notes. If you need extra explanation, he's almost always available after class. Take him!"
2942,2010754,1.0,4.0,This is the hardest class I have ever taken. I have a 3.92 GPA and have never even made a C. I am currently failing this class. He does not teach the methods and does not explain. Tests do not cover what is taught. Takes off points if not done the way he wants and not fully explained.
2943,2010754,2.0,3.0,"He teaches very quickly and while the subject is fairly easy, he grades harshly. I wish I did not have this teacher."
2944,2010754,2.0,5.0,"Just never take an online math class... His online lectures are not very helpful, and the audio cuts out sometimes which defeats the entire purpose. He also takes forever to answer emails back. I still have an emailed he has yet to reply to."
2945,2010754,4.0,5.0,"I like math, but this class was the hardest one I've ever taken. Me and the people sitting around me struggled. He was always available during his office hours and was always able to answer my questions. He is a great instructor, however the work is really hard. Even after nights of heavy drinking I came to this class. Attendance is key"
2946,2010754,5.0,3.0,"I am terrible at math and always have been, but his Cal 1 class was great. He is always available to help outside of class and his notes are great! I do recommend printing the templates he puts online otherwise your hand will fall off!!"
2947,2010754,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Wimberly is great! His class is no cake walk, but if you really want to do well he will definitely work with you. He's always available during his office hours and he's even available for appointments outside of his office hours. His explanations are great and he will explain a concept several different ways to help you understand."
2948,2010754,2.0,4.0,"I've always been good at math and never struggled, in fact I actually liked going to math class. Until I took this class. He never slows down to let you ask questions. He never checks to see if the class understood it (from what I'm hearing I'm not the only one doing poorly). He belittles people and gets mad when we don't understand a concept."
2949,2010754,4.0,4.0,"Mr. Wimberly was a very nice teacher who was willing to help if you needed it. I found his class to be challenging, but I'm not strong in Math. Overall, he was a good, easily understood professor who cared about his students."
2950,2010754,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Wimberly is the best math teacher I have ever had. I took him for Pre-Calculus and it was great. He gives very clear notes and posts them online. His tests are reasonable, but if you know the material, you will get an A. He is always willing to help you one on one if you need it. "
2951,2356869,2.0,4.0,Lots of work outside of class
2952,2260617,3.0,5.0,"He's hilarious but it is so unnecessarily difficult. It's supposed to be an introductory class and he throws in calculus and all of these complicated concepts. The tests also do not reflect the notes whatsoever and he gives no practice problems, just lectures and then expects you to be able to apply everything to conceptual questions"
2953,2260617,4.0,3.0,"Quite an amusing person. The way he explains the material really helps you to understand it; unfortunately, the class was designed the way the students present most of the material, which turns  out quite messy. Exams are unpredictable and sometimes completely irrelevant to what's going on in class; he seems to account for it while grading though."
2954,2166411,5.0,3.0,Very good lectures. Helps build a portfolio for interviews.
2955,1793682,1.5,4.0,"Absolutely terrible professor. Nice lady and interested in her material, but the class is devastatingly boring. Maybe .5% of what she ever says is relevant. Very hard tests with barely helpful study guides."
2956,1793682,1.0,5.0,Terrible teacher. She has no idea what she is talking about.
2957,1793682,4.0,3.0,Very knowledgeable and excited about the subject. Lays expectations out and is willing to help if you're honest and go talk to her.
2958,1205906,5.0,3.0,No Comments
2959,1205909,5.0,4.0,"Professor Balach is a delight. If you have the opportunity to take one of her classes, please do! You won't regret it."
2960,1205909,5.0,4.0,Great discussion environment.
2961,1205909,5.0,4.0,"She is one of the kindest, most involved teachers that I have ever had.  I've had her both as voice teacher and diction professor.  She's full of enthusiasm,knowledge, and genuine care for her students progress.  She's challenging, but the work is definitely worth all of the effort you need to study with this amazing woman."
2962,1205909,4.5,4.0,"Seriously one of the most amazing vocal teachers I've ever had the pleasure of studying under. You'll never have to worry about running out of things to learn, whether in her studio or diction classes."
2963,2528929,3.0,3.0,"Nice guy. His notes are a little confusing, so it's imperative that you go to class. However, he likes to ramble a lot so if you have trouble following along, I wouldn't recommend. Grades consist mostly of tests and quizzes. He doesn't give extra credit and he won't let you retake any quizzes. SO DON'T MISS ANY !!!!"
2964,2528929,3.0,3.0,This year everything was on zoom. He did record lectures. He is very passionate about his job. Sometimes it can be hard to follow along. He does try to help the best he can. He worked with my class very well.
2965,2528929,5.0,3.0,"Hes really nice, easy guy to get along with! Passionate about philosophy. Although he does have a tendency loose your interest and ramble a lot. He will work with the whole class on making everyone do well though, and is invested in helping you."
2966,1582755,5.0,5.0,"This class is not for losers. If you don't take class seriously, if you don't plan ahead, and if you don't do your work, you will not pass. This professor also doesn't tolerate laziness or rotten attitudes."
2967,1582755,1.5,5.0,"He isn't very nice, does not have much personality, and is rude to students. While laughing at you, he also tells you to look at your textbook when you don't understand as if you don't already know you can do that. He doesn't know his material well enough to be a strong teacher."
2968,1582755,5.0,3.0,The lectures are interesting and memorization is key for the tests. Dr. Bowlin makes  class enjoyable.
2969,1582755,5.0,3.0,Great professor.  Always available for office hours and more than willing to help students
2970,2696870,1.0,4.0,"She takes FOREVER to grade and she will use the excuse that the two grade books aren't synced. She submitted final grades without grading three of my assignments, resulting in a C until I emailed her to correct her mistake. She sucks at responding to emails and she thinks that everyone is rude to her, yet she responds in a petty manner. Good luck!"
2971,1810091,5.0,2.0,Test are from given notes
2972,1810091,4.0,3.0,He does well at explaining concepts and the tests arent bad if you study and pay attention in class
2973,1810091,4.5,3.0,One of the best and nicest professors I have ever had. Professor Jackson is extremely knowledgeable and also quite funny. You don't need to do the reading to get an A but it really helps.
2974,775854,4.0,5.0,pretty difficult class
2975,775854,4.5,2.0,Good teacher...makes things interesting and she is cool too...lack of attendance policy makes it an easy skip as long as you keep up with your readings
2976,775854,5.0,4.0,I bombed the first exam but she helped me realize that I could still make a B in the class(and I did). Her understandable teaching and helpful personality provide every student with the ability to make a good grade. This is a hard class but she makes it interesting enough to show up even though there is no attendance policy.  I highly recomend her.
2977,775854,5.0,4.0,she has made this class worth going to.  very interesting teacher.  its a very good class.
2978,775854,5.0,3.0,You can tell that she likes teaching.  One of the best teachers I have had here.
2979,775854,5.0,4.0,"Class is tought, but the teach is good.  Very energetic.  It is good class."
2980,775854,5.0,4.0,Great class.  Great teacher.
2981,775854,5.0,4.0,"Prof was new, but she was good.  Very clear.  Class was really challenging.  Show up and do your work you'll do fine.  Good class."
2982,775854,5.0,4.0,"This was a tough upper-division course, but I am glad that I took it.  I learned a lot.  There is a lot of reading.  Professor Shannon is a very good teacher--she knows the material.  I highly recommend this class."
2983,775854,5.0,4.0,"This was not an easy course, but I learned a lot.  Prof. Shannon did a great job presenting the material in a clear and understandable way.  There was a lot of reading.  She is a tough but fair grader. I highly recommend--but be willing to work!"
2984,775854,2.0,3.0,"The lecture and notes are very straight forward.     However, the tests require rote memorization of the books.  A great deal of outside reading is required to get by in this class.  5 books were required for my class, any part of which could appear on any test.  Unless poli sci is your life, take another course before this one."
2985,775854,5.0,3.0,"This class was really good.  I liked going to class--the professor was smart but fun too.  She's a good teacher, and willing to help if you need it.  She doesn't talk down to students.  Really good."
2986,775854,5.0,4.0,"This class was NOT easy, but Dr. Shannon did a good job with it, and you can tell that she knows what she is talking about.  She is definitely knowledgable, and she is willing to help you outside of class.  This class is not an easy A, unless you read and study (duh!).  Good class--I highly recommend."
2987,775854,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Shannon was very good.  Lectures were okay, and she was interesting.  Good class."
2988,775854,4.0,4.0,"Professor Shannon knows a lot and clearly likes to teach.  She doesn't talk down to you.  Her tests are not easy, you will have to study.  But if you do, you will do okay.  I would recommend this course."
2989,2141872,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Miller, really made me love to write. I had his class at 9 am but because he is such a great professor I wanted to get up and go to class every week. Definitely participate in class and ask questions to show him you're interested. Truly cares about his job, He cares about his students he's teaching and wants them to succeed. "
2990,2141872,2.0,4.0,"lots of outside reading, rude feedback that is unhelpful, few papers, takes over a month to grade"
2991,2141872,1.0,5.0,"He gave everyone in class terrible grades, and does not provide much constructive feedback on papers. All in all would not recommend."
2992,2141872,4.0,4.0,"Cares about you both as a student and on a personal level. Mr. Miller is passionate about what he teaches and is very open to ideas. He always finds something to say back to a student to relate with them. He wants you to engage in the classroom!!! Not an easy A, but really put effort into your writing and speak up in class and you'll be just fine."
2993,2141872,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Miller truly cares for his students and their ability to write well. However, he does not hand out free A's. His class is not a ton of work, but you have to do your best on the assignments that he does give. All in all, one of the best professors on campus. If you get a chance to take one of his classes, definitely do so."
2994,2141872,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Miller has helped me develop immensely as a writer & I would definitely take his class again. My only knock is don't take this course expecting an easy A. He makes you work for it. I went to office hours multiple times & he is always happy & willing to help. He is more concerned with your development than a lot of other professors.
2995,2377400,5.0,3.0,"She is extremely friendly, always insightful."
2996,2119352,4.0,2.0,"He gives tons of extra credit which is so nice!  His tests aren't that hard, but you need to pay attention in class if you want to do well.  He is super laid back and funny which makes the class more enjoyable."
2997,1169082,4.5,2.0,Valentina Borisevna is an absolutely wonderful Russian professor. She loves teaching the language and keeps you on your toes. It's much easier than you'd think it would be! She is a GREAT instructor to take beginners Russian from!
2998,2119355,5.0,3.0,He is super nice and great at explaining. Gives a chance for extra credit to go on the exams. Make sure you study for the exams. Will fail if you don't. He will not let you turn in anything late even if its by a minute. The assignments are not hard at all and can really help you learn about what is happening in the world. Would take again!
2999,2119355,4.0,2.0,"Participation isn't mandatory but, defintley would attend in order to understand the material and have a good discussion about journalism. Defintley need the textbook to get a good grade. Read the textbook and turn work in on time and you'll do fine."
3000,2119355,1.0,3.0,Literally emailed the whole class a week before exams saying &quot; do not contact me&quot;. Hated him he sucked so bad this year and was so boring.
3001,2119355,4.0,2.0,"Took Dr. Morgan this semester for JOUR 101. I liked him and the assignments were easy. Know that exams will be based largely on the textbook and will cover info that may not be discussed in class! Overall, I'd recommend him."
3002,2119355,5.0,2.0,Definitely need the textbook. Participation not mandatory but stuff said in lectures will be on tests and gives drop grades when there's low attendance. Doesn't grade on much and has strict deadlines so don't fall behind. Tests and exams are VERY heavily on the textbook. Lectures are always very interesting and helpful so worth taking for sure.
3003,2119355,5.0,1.0,"Easiest class I took this semester. I hardly ever went and still finished with an A. As long as you do the homework and study for the couple of tests in there, you will do completely fine. Dr. Morgan is also very laid back and fun, so class wasn't miserable whenever I did go. Probably the easiest A you will ever make if you just keep up with work."
3004,2119355,5.0,3.0,He is hilarious and super helpful. If you're a slacker he will very obviously dislike you. I've never  cracked up in a class like I have in his. Loved him and decided to take him a second time.
3005,2119355,4.5,2.0,His class isn't that hard if you're ready to put the work in. He pays attention and is more willing to give extra time to students he can tell are working hard.
3006,2684605,5.0,3.0,"She is really good at lecturing and keeping you engaged. She gives you plenty of notice on when assignments are due, and doesn't try to trick you on them. She only tests you on things we covered in class. No homework or assignments besides three papers (two pages long) and two tests. She is very understanding if you can't come to class. She's great"
3007,1169083,1.0,5.0,"Took this class online. Attendance is not mandatory, but thats the only good thing about this class. Only grades are 5 exams, each worth 20% of the grade. Only gives 60 min for impossibly hard questions and wont offer extra credit if you fail one. Expects you to know everything and questions are unspecific but grading is hard. Do not take."
3008,1169083,3.0,5.0,Took this class online and it was extremely hard. The study guides where basically everything you learned so didnt help much. Make sure to watch the lectures and read the book or your fail but honestly youll probably fail regardless. Spent a lot of time studying to no avail
3009,1169083,2.0,5.0,The tests are impossibley hard this was the hardest class i've ever taken
3010,2743995,5.0,4.0,"Hard class, but great teacher. Stick to the powerpoints &amp; anything else she adds &amp; you will be fine. She is a great mentor &amp; teacher."
3011,2743995,5.0,3.0,Dr. Xin is my favorite teacher so far. She is great at explaining things and very caring. Would recommend her to anybody.
3012,2012864,1.0,5.0,Horrible
3013,2012864,1.0,5.0,Not one nice thing to say about this professor. Thats all im going to say.
3014,2012864,2.0,5.0,"I took it online, and I've only emailed him one time, and he was very short and not super helpful. I wouldn't recommend taking this class online at all. It's a lot of work, and the program is unhelpful. The tests were really hard, and I typically don't struggle testing. It was hands down my hardest class, and I wish I had done it in person."
3015,2012864,1.0,5.0,"Was not fond of this guy. if you ask him any type of question he refers you to the syllabus in a rude manner without even answering your question. Even though I passed all of his test, I still didnt pass the class because of his dumb homework site which doesnt allow you to complete questions unless you get them right. Do. Not. Take. This. Guy."
3016,2012864,2.0,5.0,"He really wasnt that helpful. The tutors were nice, but the first few times I went.. they couldnt even help me with my homework. HW is insane. Hawkes doesnt give detail into how to do anything, and google is just as bad. If you take stats, its best to take it in person and even better if its not with him. 10/10 wouldnt recommend"
3017,2012864,4.0,3.0,Dr. Prins is a good choice. The online lectures are super helpful because you can pause and rewind etc. Prins is helpful and the lectures are easy to follow. You just have to do the work! If you dont practice you wont succeed. People dont do ANY of the work/watch lectures and then complain about how hard the class is. Its not hard if you try.
3018,2012864,2.0,4.0,"Usually, I'm pretty good at statistics. However, I feel like this professor's lecture videos are very long and very unhelpful. If you take this class, you can expect to teach yourself a lot. It seems like everyone is struggling a lot. My grade is pretty good in the class, but if I didn't do the work or couldn't teach myself how to do it..."
3019,2012864,3.0,3.0,"He was a decent teacher. As long as you do the homework and run over how to do the tests, you'll have a decent grade. Also, there's a tutoring lab where they'll work with you and show you how to get the correct answers so there's no reason for you to not have A's on all your homework."
3020,2012864,3.0,3.0,He is funny but can be hard to understand sometimes. Read the vocabulary in the textbook
3021,2012864,3.0,3.0,"Go to his office hours!! He will help you with your homework which is worth 20% of your grade. The test aren't too difficult, but they're no walk in the park. Studying the homework is the best way to prepare for tests in my opinion. He's a good teacher as long as you actually put in the effort to let him teach you."
3022,2012864,2.5,3.0,"He has a thick accent (Nordic?) that, to me, was hard to understand. Sit close to the board if you can't see or hear! You aren't required to, but if you go to office hours for homework help, you get full credit on it which REALLY helps your grade. His tests are hard, but if you go to office hours and really do your homework you can pull a B."
3023,2012864,1.0,5.0,"I wish there was a rating lower than 1. Homeworks are okay, tests are crazy hard"
3024,2012864,1.0,5.0,Tests are impossibly hard. His lectures are confusing and he's not good at clarifying or explaining stuff.
3025,2012864,2.0,4.0,Awful teacher. Very rude.
3026,802499,2.0,5.0,"She is older and tends to ramble on instead of getting to the point. Her voice puts me to sleep and personally when I have asked her questions her response is either snappy or some vague, 20-minute long explanation that left me more confused. I recommend you seek another teacher unless you already have a good basis of knowledge in biochemistry"
3027,802499,1.5,5.0,"Really sweet lady, but she doesn't seem to be 'all there' sometimes. Scatter brained beyond belief. She's very honest, and will tell you if she doesn't know the answer to your question instead of making something up. Her tests are brutal. "
3028,802499,4.5,3.0,"caring, interested, polite, disorganized, a little shallow on the material, understanding"
3029,802499,2.0,5.0,Her class is way way way harder then biochem in medical school is.  She thinks its crucial to know the structure of everything in CAC.  When was the last time your Doctor looked and a Fisher projection and said...  No no no.  thats all wrong...the oxygens should be on the other side and this should be in the chair conformation. He'll never make it.
3030,802499,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3031,802499,2.0,5.0,"You must read your book, becuase class lecture notes are useless, as well as old test. She is very scatter brained"
3032,2418381,4.0,3.0,"Had quizzes on average every two weeks, which were very fair and helped as a grade booster. He teaches well and the lectures are easy to understand, his office hours were at 10 AM so it may be hard to get help outside class."
3033,1896145,2.0,5.0,"Assignments were never returned in a timely manner and the grading was very unforgiving. The grading was never unfair or nonsensical, but there was very little room for error on tests or homework, which is made even worse given the lack of timely feedback. Not a horrible instructor, but I often found this class frustrating. Avoid if possible."
3034,1896145,1.0,4.0,takes forever to grade any work. Makes useless study guides. Homework is way harder than the problems she goes over making you have to figure out how to solve stuff she doesn't teach you. lectures teach you about 10% of what is actually on the test as well as the test go over thing she never teaches you
3035,1896145,5.0,2.0,"She does lectures online and then works through questions in class. She is clear and thorough and will always answer questions. It's very important to watch the lectures. If you put the time in, it's an easy class."
3036,1896145,1.0,3.0,"On numerous occasions, she failed to answer emails that needed responses. My grade was negatively impacted as a result. She gives out homework assignments that are impossible without some sort of assistance, yet she looks at those assignments under a microscope when grading-even during a pandemic. Pick a different professor."
3037,1896145,1.0,4.0,You might as well teach yourself.
3038,1896145,3.5,3.0,"She's nice and willing to help when asked, but the material itself is fairly difficult (in my opinion). Even though I failed the class, I still think Mrs. Sheppardson is a fairly good professor."
3039,1896145,4.0,3.0,Covers material slow and in detail which is nice. No complaints. A teacher that shows up each lecture and performs her job.
3040,569043,1.0,5.0,"Egotistical would be an understatement. He likes the kids that understand whats going on, and ignores those who are falling behind. He assigns way too much reading in between each class to allow one to do any other homework. HE DOES NOT TEACH, he hosts a book club and thinks he is brilliant because of it. He is awkward and blatantly rude."
3041,569043,5.0,4.0,"I loved taking Professor Howard's class so much. I had to take his class remotely, which was a bit more difficult than I think it would have been in person. But, nonetheless, he cares so much about his students and his course subject. You can tell he loves teaching, and he is extensively knowledgable on his materials."
3042,569043,4.5,3.0,Great lectures. He's able to explain Chinese poltical and labor history in a way that makes it interesting and fun.
3043,569043,4.0,4.0,"Nice Guy, good classes.  He knows his material.  He is somewhat awkward, but i find it entertaining."
3044,569043,1.0,5.0,Very timid and nervous when giving lectures.  When asked a question he stalls for several seconds before he is able to respond.  very weird
3045,1345238,2.0,1.0,"Do NOT take this woman. She is sarcastic and full of herself. She claimed on the first day that if we did not buy the $180 textbook, we would fail the course... I missed 2 classes and did not buy the book before the first test and made an A on it. This class is tedious and a waste of time. You're not going to learn a thing."
3046,1345238,5.0,5.0,Cahryn is the best!
3047,1345238,5.0,2.0,She's an awesome teacher. Study sessions really help out before the test. She will basically go over the entire test and explain the answer.
3048,1636056,3.0,3.0,"Kind of boring which made the material hard to learn, but Chuck is a really cool guy. Hard quizzes though"
3049,1636056,5.0,3.0,Awesome guy
3050,1636056,5.0,3.0,Best PoliSci professor at UM
3051,1636056,5.0,3.0,Tests are exactly what you'd expect from attending lecture. Easy A if you show up to class.
3052,1636056,5.0,3.0,Far and away my FAVORITE teacher at Ole Miss ive had. His attendance isnt mandatory but he boosts your grade depending on how often you show and he uses a some questions on the test off exactly what he said in class that you cant get elsewhere. If you interested in poly sci and go to class/pay attention you can get good grades. Made A in each class
3053,1636056,5.0,3.0,"He's tough.His tests are, at least.However, after you take the first one, you get over the format and the distractions of a no-doubt huge class.He is entertaining, and is quick to criticize any politician regardless of party.He makes politics easy to understand and it's his personal goal to educate us young people so we wont fail the system, again!"
3054,1595100,3.5,5.0,"She is an alright teacher, but you do not want to have her in the morning. Also be prepared to print out a lot of stuff from the internet and be sure to keep up with it since she likes to use material from the beginning of the course until the end of the semester. Also, make sure you know how she wants things presented to to her, she can be picky."
3055,1595100,3.5,5.0,"She's an alright teacher, but you don't want to have her early in the morning. Also, be prepared to print off a lot of things from online and keep up with things because she likes to use material from the beginning of the course as well as new learned things. Also, make sure you know how she wants things presented to her, she can be a bit picky."
3056,1595100,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Foulkes-Levy is an amazing teacher. Attend class, pay attention and put forth effort and you should have no problems passing her classes. She's always willing to help if you don't understand."
3057,1636062,2.5,1.0,"If you were any good at calculus in high school, take this class. Otherwise DO NOT! Ms. Payne is a very easy teacher, however, she does not explain topics well at all. There is no attendance policy even though the syllabus states there is. Easy A as long as you can do basic calculus and don't need any further instruction."
3058,1636062,1.0,5.0,"spend no time on the material, then makes the test 10x harder than anything we have learned."
3059,1636062,1.0,2.0,I took business calculus from Mrs. Payne this semester and it was terrible. Anything I learned came from the Hawkes software that she depends on way too much. She isnt helpful when you ask questions and she is never motivated to be there. Which of course does not make me want to be. AVOID HER LIKE THE PLAGUE.
3060,507615,5.0,4.0,Awesome
3061,507615,3.5,3.0,No Comments
3062,507615,2.0,5.0,Needs tp apply more application and less wrote memorization.
3063,507615,5.0,4.0,Great techer for the 680 681 series in statistics. Best teacher for stats on campus
3064,136929,5.0,4.0,Great class.... Dr. N kept it objective till the last day when he told us which theory seemed the most plausible to him. Would've loved more classes like this.
3065,136929,5.0,3.0,this is a totally awesome professor. he knows his subject topics and has a clear way of conveying them to the student. I have always been ready for his test. I have took him for more than one course and I will take his future classes. a great teacher with a perfect way of giving the information.
3066,136929,4.0,3.0,"He's totally misunderstood judging by the comments on this site. He is demanding to the general slackers out there, but he's a good teacher and a good guy."
3067,136929,3.0,2.0,"Had him for Mississippi History.  Personally, I love the guy.  He's hilarious, and very knowledgeable.  If you act like a butt towards him when he calls on you, he'll make your life hard."
3068,136929,1.0,5.0,"One of the worst ""teachers"" I've ever had. He doesn't care about you and will openly admit it. He purposefully makes things more difficult than they should be. Make sure you read all the materials and know them better than your own name because he will definitely drill you on them. If you have the option, get out while you can."
3069,136929,2.0,3.0,im not sure if he is still teaching...but if he is and u have him...stay in the class. u will learn so much. the funny part is that this italian yankee is quite conservative. he HATES Obama and it's hilarious. he has a  very difficult personality but his knowledge of US History us second to none.
3070,136929,4.0,4.0,"Took US History since 1945 and loved it. Namorato isn't exactly easy to get along with, but if you show up on time and participate in class, he's sure to like you. Namorato is extremely knowledgeable, so even if you do not like him you're sure to learn a lot."
3071,136929,1.0,5.0,"I think having aids would be more fun than taking this class. This guy hates his life and it shows by the way he teaches. Also, Katrina Simms, one of his TA's, is much more rude, angry, and just un pleasent.  Don't take this guy ever."
3072,136929,1.0,5.0,The worst teacher you will ever have. Get out as soon as you can. He clearly said to not look at him during class and acts as if you have an IQ of a bug!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET OUT!!!!!!!!
3073,136929,1.0,5.0,"extremely unenthusiastic, rude, and the TAs do a lot more than he does. he is absolutely worthless!"
3074,136929,3.5,4.0,"Challenging teacher, often comes off as pissed off at &quot;young people who don't know whats going on in the world,&quot; But if you put effort into this class you will learn immense amounts of information, most of which seems to be from the correct perspective.  Worth your time, but requires much of your time."
3075,136929,4.5,1.0,He gives you everything you need for the mid-terma and final...including the questions.  You just have to pay attention.  While he may be a bit bad tempered I enjoyed his class and especially his TA's.  The TA's also do all the grading...btw
3076,136929,1.0,5.0,"Very hard teacher. Hard to understand in class and take notes. Thanksfully, i had a really good TA who helped me get a good grade in the class. I would avoid taking this class if he is teaching it!!!!"
3077,136929,1.0,5.0,"Wouldn't respond to e-mail and vm requests for textbook/material info weeks in advance of class.  Found out in class that WSJ was needed, but couldn't get a subscription in time. E-mailed him for support to avoid drop-class fee and he finally e-mails back saying it's not his problem.  This guy's not there to teach...just to draw a paycheck.  Avoid."
3078,136929,2.5,4.0,He is about as cool as a hangover!  He talks to our class like we are complete idiots and is extremely insulting.  He totally has favorites and if you are already on his bad side drop the class if you can.  He is the meanest teacher I have ever had and I have been here 3 years.  Dont state your views if you do not want to be berated or infantilized
3079,136929,1.0,5.0,Terrible professor.  He is pro history grad students.  If you are an education major taking a history class he will give you an automatic letter drop.  Complete jerk.  Gave us a oral final just so that he could fail people.  I am now a professor and will never be like him.
3080,136929,1.5,5.0,He hates you already. Get out before it's too late non-majors!
3081,136929,2.0,3.0,Very arrogant and opinionated; he knows his stuff and seems personally insulted when questions are asked; make sure you follow his assignments precisely--and just regurgitate his information or you will drop a letter grade.  This is not a class for differing opinions or creativity
3082,136929,5.0,4.0,Best teacher you will ever have! No doubt the best at Ole Miss!
3083,136929,2.5,3.0,"He may be popular with the history majors, but among people who take real classes which require critical thinking skills, like math and science, memorization is boring and pointless, and he requires an insane amount of memorization. Boring. Unenlightening. Stodgy."
3084,136929,1.5,4.0,lack of personality
3085,136929,2.0,3.0,"He is one of the worst profs I've ever had (including the idiots I had in the School of Ed). He is unyielding, insulting, and boring to the point of inducing comas. He should stick to writing crappy books that no one will ever read."
3086,136929,2.0,5.0,Very Hard. Not friendly. Moves way too fast.
3087,136929,4.5,2.0,Good teacher.
3088,136929,4.5,3.0,Excellent knowledge of subject; heavy on economic theory and economic history. Can be very detailed if the subject matter demands detail.
3089,136929,2.0,2.0,"He is judgemental, belittling, and boring with a crappy attendance policy. He knows the material; however, he does very little to convince students that the material is either interesting or worth knowing. He's not engaging, interesting, or entertaining."
3090,136929,4.0,4.0,Good at teaching. offers all angles.
3091,136929,5.0,3.0,"Took Namorato for a number of classes.  Excellent, engaging professor and genuine scholar.  Popular among history majors.  However, among mouth-breathing near-literates, not so popular . . . apparently."
3092,136929,1.5,3.0,"Uninspiring. Also, refused to return my final exam the next semester."
3093,136929,1.5,1.0,No Comments
3094,2817764,1.0,5.0,Dr. Bynum has no idea how to use technology. He never posted the correct due dates or directions for paper. When i would email him about questions he was not helpful and say it's on blackboard. DO NOT RECOMMEND 
3095,2615014,5.0,3.0,Shes super fair and if you do all the modules youll do great in her class
3096,2615014,5.0,3.0,Professor Ferry is a really easy going professor who cares a lot about her students. The class itself was very easy. You have monthly assignments and two tests which are completely based on memorization. She is super easy to talk to and her lectures can be boring but they are easy to understand. If you don't succeed in her class its your fault.
3097,2615014,5.0,2.0,"I took two classes with Professor Ferry ( pol 103 and politics of the world economy 300 level) and they were both very well put together. Professor Ferry is the sweetest professor I've had and her lectures are super easy to understand. She tries to make the class engaging. Not much homework, some reading and tests aren't that hard. TAKE HER CLASS."
3098,2631402,5.0,2.0,Loved her so much! She really made me want to learn about bio even though its not my major. Really felt like she cared about all of us. 10/10 would take again!!!!
3099,2631402,5.0,2.0,"I love Ms. Miller! She really cares about her students and what she is teaching. There's minimal homework and it's easy, the exams are open-note, open-book, and you can take them twice. She doesn't expect you to learn super in-depth information since it's for non-science majors. She's funny and chill, and I wish I could take more of her classes!"
3100,2631402,5.0,2.0,"Love her and would take her again. Lectures based off powerpoint which she posts on blackboard. Doesn't expect non majors to learn in detail, things are pretty basic. She really cares about her students. Online tests you can take twice. Online homework &amp; quizzes. She is really funny and keeps her lectures interesting. Would highly recommend, easy A"
3101,2631402,5.0,2.0,I would highly recommend taking her class if you are not a science major. She sends a weekly email of what you need to get done that week. The homework assignments are easy and you get multiple attempts to get a 100. Quiz and exam answers can usually be found on quizlet. Her exams and quizzes are open note and not proctored. She is also hilarious
3102,1980139,4.5,2.0,She is one of the nicest and caring professors I've had. She is young and as long as you go to class you will pass the tests. You could have up to 6 absences in my class which is a lot. You never have to read- I wouldn't even buy the textbook. Highly recommend taking her.
3103,894702,5.0,4.0,"he grades very critically in the beginning, and much more considerately near the end"
3104,894702,2.0,1.0,Dont take his classes
3105,894702,4.5,5.0,Great guy.  you work hard but it's worth it.
3106,894702,1.0,3.0,This guy is an a**.  He thinks he's the stuff.... but he surely isn't...
3107,894702,4.5,4.0,prof breland's class is tough but he helps alot.  he' wants us to work hard and gives us alot of examples to the ones in the book.
3108,2019060,5.0,3.0,She is knowledgeable and connected to her class even in online atmosphere. Dr. Crutchfield is fair and applies the reading to assignments and quizzes. Her feedback is positive and she encourages her students.
3109,2019060,5.0,1.0,She is very excited to share with us the material we needed to know to be successful in her class. I like the way she response to email very fast and she do not mind explaining material to you that you may not understand. I would love to take more classes with her she has a lot of information to give and she knows her stuff she is a wonderful
3110,2019060,4.5,3.0,Paying attention during lectures is very important. Take good notes and you will be fine. She is very sweet and always willing to help her students. She speaks clear and I could tell that she was passionate about what she taught. There was never a dull moment during the lectures. You will laugh and learn a lot. Take good notes and you will be fine.
3111,2019061,3.0,2.0,"Go to class! He gives at least four of five quizzes that are worth 25 points each. He uses the point system. If you can get to 450 you will earn an ""A"". You also have an option of going to Research studies for extra credit. He is a great professor and loves what he teach. Go to class and take notes. He also gives study guides so that's a plus.  "
3112,2500341,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fortenberry is AMAZING! Hard professor, but he genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Lectures are based on the homework, so do that ahead of time. His office hours and SI are helpful! Without attending both, I would not have gotten an A. The weekly quizzes forced me to study for this class. Overall, one of the best!"
3113,2500341,3.0,5.0,"Ryan Fortenberry is a great man, he loves to make his students laugh. Though his class can be extremely tough if you do not give it the proper attention. Lectures are based on material you should have already learned from the hw, so be sure to do it a good bit before the due date, and please make use of SI sessions, they are a tremendous help."
3114,1302264,1.0,5.0,She was aggressive towards all students in the class. Her one on one conferences were useless as she refused to really help you. In addition to this she made up assignments on the spot for things. Basically she was not a good teacher. I do not recommend her to anyone.
3115,1302264,2.0,4.0,terrible teacher...nice lady though...you have to go to class or points off for every absence...don't bother taking notes just summarize the book and you'll pass no problem....she will probably just confuse you anyways
3116,1302264,1.0,4.0,Horrible teacher.
3117,1302264,1.0,2.0,"Sure, she's not THAT bad.. if you don't mind being screamed at constantly and treated like an imbecile. I literally took tylenol after every lab session."
3118,1302264,3.0,1.0,she's not THAT bad.  it's an easy A if you can tolerate her annoying voice and being taught like 2nd graders.
3119,1302264,1.0,2.0,Has one tone of voice: screaming. Will rake you over the coals for asking simple questions (which you will do because she doesn't explain anything). I would rather drive screws through my toes than take her for lab again.
3120,1302264,2.0,4.0,"Horrible for teaching lab.  Suicide is right, I'd rather spend 2 hours in hell."
3121,1302264,1.0,4.0,"If you want to become suicidal, take this lady for lab. She is AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3122,1748731,5.0,3.0,"I loved her. 10/10 would take another class with her. It&#39;s not a super easy class or anything, but the lectures are good and I learned a lot."
3123,1748731,4.0,4.0,"I took a 4400 History of American Law as a sophomore, and it was a great class. I liked Professor Twitty as a person, and her teachings were very thorough and helpful. She does have a political disposition and is more so left in her ideology, but I was never bothered by it as she treated discussion with civility. I lean to the right for reference."
3124,1748731,5.0,3.0,The goat
3125,1748731,1.0,5.0,Worst class I have ever taken it honestly was the hardest class ive taken in my life for no reason I have learned nothing but how to get the homework done as fast as possible after reading and entire book considered as one chapter. I know my answers were right but were still graded as wrong!
3126,1748731,3.0,4.0,This class was very test heavy. Lectures were way too much information.
3127,1748731,2.0,4.0,One of the hardest courses I've taken. she talks a mile a minute and expects you to get every note.
3128,1748731,2.0,4.0,She talks way too fast and does not stop to answer questions. Her slides have one word.
3129,1748731,5.0,3.0,"Really great lectures, inspirational- if you enjoy history you will enjoy Professor Twitty/ she has been my favorite teacher at ole miss!! :)"
3130,1748731,4.0,5.0,"This class is not easy!!! It requires a lot of reading, almost 100+ pages a week. The professor is very passionate about the material and gets into it. She lectures the entire class and is sometimes hard to follow, but due to the fact that she knows almost everything related to American history, she is eager to help. Just a warning, NOT EASY!!!"
3131,1748731,1.0,5.0,what ever you do do NOT take this class you will not get above a C even if you study 5 hours a night
3132,1748731,1.0,5.0,The class is going to seem easy at first. Do NOT be fooled. This class was the most challenging and ridiculously hard class that I have taken- being that it's not a class in my field. You have to read almost 100 pages every week for a quiz every Friday. The exams are all on Key Terms in the Give Me Liberty book and lecture terms. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!
3133,2785021,5.0,2.0,"Sweetest woman I have ever met. Iff you put in the effort and show you are trying, you will succeed in the class. Very helpful with giving feedback when writing essays and papers. If you get the chance to take her, do it!"
3134,1613566,5.0,1.0,"Valerio Cappozzo is a superior teacher who offers so much to students. He teaches in a multi-dimmensional fashion, which allows students to learn not only the language but also about the culture of Italy as a whole. Often in his class I felt a little unworthy because I know he has so much more to offer this University that just as a language prof."
3135,1613566,5.0,2.0,Superior
3136,1613566,5.0,1.0,Take intro to Lit with Dr. Cappozzo. Best prof ever! 
3137,1613566,4.5,2.0,He made learning italian seem natural.  really cared about the students and eager to share about italian culture.
3138,1613566,4.5,3.0,"If you show him you're working, he'll go the extra mile to help you"
3139,1613566,5.0,3.0,Love him!
3140,1613566,5.0,3.0,Very good professor!
3141,2467586,1.0,5.0,Very vague reviews and study guide for exams. Does not use powerpoint or any sort of visual aid. talks extremely fast.
3142,2649859,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Hill's online sociology class was pretty easy. He's a super nice guy that cares about his students, even the ones he never meets during online. Classwork is relatively normal, about a chapter a week or so. Very easy to make a high grade in this class because he grades super easily."
3143,2649859,5.0,2.0,Hes a good really good professor! Easy class . Literally a weekly discussion every week which is easy and a quiz based on the chapter . Highly recommend
3144,2770695,3.0,4.0,"He is not necessarily a ""bad"" professor but I personally am not a fan. He gives more work than you'd normally expect for a freshman-level course but it's not completely overwhelming. Just be ready to do a lot--like, a LOT--of reading. On the upside though, he offers extra credit & helps students when they need it. "
3145,2770695,4.0,3.0,I took this class my freshman year and I really loved Mr. Billings. He is very upbeat and enthusiastic about religion. He plays lots of games like jeopardy and he shows lots of movies to help you understand the material. You really have to prepare and listen for the tests and exams so be prepared for the tests and quizzes.
3146,282381,1.0,4.0,"There is only 4 tests over the semester and one paper. Lectures start as soon as she walks in and turns the lights up. Lectures are long and it seems the test ?'s don't even come from the lectures. She does review the class before the test but none of the ?'s are helpful. One exhibition review that is graded so hard, rough class all together."
3147,282381,1.0,5.0,"She only gives 5 grades a semester. One is a heavily graded paper from a museum visit which you have a week to write and the others are impossible tests with random questions that don't relate to what she emphasizes in class at all. Goes too fast, calls out individuals to answer random questions. Even art majors are failing, impossible! Do not take"
3148,282381,2.0,5.0,"Most of her tests rely on the images from the power points and from the image sheet she gives you, and true and false questions. However, you have to not only memorize the name of about 20 images, but also the time period and what era. Some of the images that were on the test she did not even go over. Take pics of the power point, save your hands."
3149,282381,2.0,4.0,"She goes through the powerpoint a mile a minute, and says to study the book but most times information on the test isn't from the book. In the end of the semester you finish with 4 exams and a paper. So one failing grade can hurt you in the end. She docks points of the paper for specific details that may be harder to fix if you're not an art major."
3150,282381,1.5,4.0,"This class was a nightmare. She is hard to understand and flies through the power points! If you are taking this class with the impression that it will be easy, think again! Her tests were so hard, filled with random material that she does not discuss in class. She is not willing to work with you either, so Xtra Credit is CRUCIAL. Save yourself!!!!"
3151,282381,1.0,5.0,The absolute worst class. I worked so hard and failed every test. She shows no mercy. I now have to do freshman forgiveness. Please save yourself!
3152,282381,1.0,5.0,"To call this woman a teacher would be lying. She goes through powerpoints in class at 90 to nothing, tells you to study the book for a test but then adds information that isn't in the book.. You WILL fail unless you've had art history before and already know most of the material. Save yourself now!!"
3153,282381,1.0,5.0,Couldn't understand what she was saying half the time. Power points sucked. She blew thru them so fast no one knew what to expect on the tests. Tests were hard. Random material on the tests that you couldn't study for. Extra Credit is crucial to survive this class. Even art Majors had trouble with this class. Was not helpful at all.
3154,282381,4.5,4.0,"Great Teacher, fun, very interested in the subject matter, fair."
3155,282381,1.5,4.0,"Not an easy class.  In my section, i sat around several art majors who had failed the class already.  A lot of studying is required... 12 hours of good study time will earn you a quick F.  there were at least two outside projects.  From what I gathered, even those very interested had a lot of trouble with this class."
3156,282381,5.0,4.0,Great teacher!  Ask any question and buckle up for a complete answer beginning with the Big Bang! Loved every minute of my years with her. You couldn't ask for a better teacher - IF you are interested and are willing to work.
3157,282381,4.0,2.0,N/A
3158,214799,2.0,5.0,"No excuses for anything related to participation, must attend class. The only way to potentially miss class is with a legitimate doctor's note which must be approved by the Dean. Good teacher but lots of homework and you must participate in class. If you have no experience with Spanish, do not take Cotelo."
3159,214799,4.0,5.0,"DO NOT take this class unless you want to work extremely hard. I went into this class with the wrong mindset, and it hurt my grade very badly. He does come off as rude and condescending A LOT, but once you are in his class for a while you understand that he means well. If you take Cotelo, be ready to really learn."
3160,214799,1.0,4.0,"Hard and not in the &quot;I'm glad that I'm being challenged and am learning a lot&quot; way but in the &quot;tons of work by an obscure professor with lots of weird requirements.&quot; Stay away unless you absolutely have to take this class. On the bright side, there's a lot of extra credit which you will need."
3161,214799,1.0,5.0,"Rough class, wants you to analyze writings and authors more than learn historical facts"
3162,214799,3.0,3.0,"The class itself isnt difficult, however there is a lot of outside homework to prepare for class. You must attend class, and you MUST participate. However, Professor Cotelo often comes off as condescending and rude when students answer incorrectly. It does not feel like a safe learning environment."
3163,214799,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Cotelo wants you to learn the material, and shows this in a way that may come off as crude or even condescending. I am sure there are easier professors for this course, but if you want to learn and understand Spanish after, take Dr. Cotelo. Just do not wear your feelings on your sleeve and prepare for class."
3164,214799,1.0,5.0,"This was the hardest class Ive taken and I had to drop it after a week. He is extremely rude and when you answer a question in class he make you feel stupid if you get it wrong, and you have to participate. DO NOT TAKE HIM"
3165,214799,2.0,4.0,He makes you do all the classwork outside of class even if the syllabus says that it is optional.  He makes it very intimidating to raise your hand and speak during class.  If you skip class too much you will definitely fail.  Be prepared to do a lot of homework and be stressed out a lot.
3166,214799,1.0,4.0,"He has no consideration for any student that is not one of his favorites. He favors a handful of students and completely disregards the rest. He decides if you have participated enough, so if you are not a favorite, don't expect a good participation grade (which basically dictates your final grade). No extra credit & no tutoring."
3167,214799,1.5,5.0,"Cotelo is NOT my favorite teacher. Matter of fact, he's pretty terrible. You can ask him questions and he may say ""this is 202, you should know"" He also would speak down as if you were stupid if you didn't understand. He also doesn't cut any slack on essays or tests. He's pretty inconsiderate for the Spanish learning student.  SO MUCH HOMEWORK"
3168,214799,1.5,5.0,Horrible professor. Im sure he is a great instructor for a 201 or 202 class. I had him for 102 and he failed me. I never got above a 60 in participation even though I sat right in the front. I had never made a F in my life until I took him for 102. I am now retaking 102 and I have an A. If you want to pass 101 or 102 DO NOT TAKE HIM. Hard grader.
3169,214799,5.0,4.0,"Span 121 is my favorite class. Cotelo is a great professor, and I plan to take him for 201 as well. He changes his voice and makes funny faces. He is very interactive. The class is very fast-paced, but I am actually learning a  lot. It isn't a class that you can just &quot;float by&quot; on. You have to study every day and volunteer in class."
3170,214799,5.0,4.0,"Best Spanish instructor I've ever had. Makes you want to do well in Spanish. He is a somewhat difficult and engaging teacher though, so I would only take him if you are very interested in Spanish, and not just trying to get through it."
3171,214799,5.0,2.0,Very helpful in devoloping my Spanish.
3172,214799,2.5,4.0,Not fun!
3173,214799,4.0,3.0,He's from Uruguay you dummies!  He's very down to earth and is only arrogant toward Americans that are half retarded.
3174,214799,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3175,214799,5.0,4.0,"No he's not from Mexico. He is the nicest most caring professor, but he hates when people don't try. Only thing bad about class is the added internet homework, but that's the university's fault, not his. Take it at night, it's easier then."
3176,214799,5.0,4.0,i disagree.  he is a very competent instructor and if you come to class prepared you will have no problems.
3177,214799,1.0,3.0,"He's very arrogant and he likes to pick on students by using intimidation tactics..which makes the class difficult because participation is a large part of your grade.  Also, he has bad mood swings."
3178,214799,1.0,5.0,Very arrogant. He thinks that Americans are stupid and doesn't hestate to hide it in class. He's from Mexico..I think.
3179,1703699,1.0,5.0,Very rude with feedback
3180,1703699,5.0,1.0,Sorry guys I commented so many things about her when I was young. She's my mom and I would comment anytime she pissed me off. Sorry mom
3181,1703699,1.0,5.0,Didn't even finish the class. I have a 3.9 GPA and am a senior. There is no reason to have a C in a freshman year writing course. Very much a her way or the highway professor. Her grading is ridiculous. I don't recommend taking-even if gifted. I read these beforehand and still signed up. Don't do what I do--make sure to stay clear.
3182,1703699,1.0,5.0,This teacher is one of the toughest graders you will ever find. There is no slowing down in her courseload and expect not to receive an A unless you are a truly gifted writer. She tends to be unreasonable in her essay demands and leaves very little to no instructions. Tardiness receives a two-point deduction on your next essay.
3183,1703699,4.0,5.0,"A lot of people complain about Prof. Flaschka because she's demanding, but you'll come out of this a better writer. She's great about looking over drafts and giving feedback before you submit them (even the night before), so if you're way off track, that's on you. As for the people being like EVERYONE FAILS, my *lowest* grade on an essay was a B+."
3184,1703699,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXCELLENT WRITER BECAUSE YOU WILL FAIL! My class started with 25 people and after the midterm, there were only 8 people for the rest of the semester. Every time you are late there is a 2 point deduction on your next essay."
3185,1703699,1.0,5.0,"The absolute worst professor i've ever had, avoid at all costs. She thinks she can do anything she wants, like assigning an essay due on a university mandated week off of school due to a national pandemic. I genuinely would not even pee on her if she was on fire. SHE IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST."
3186,1703699,1.0,5.0,"Get ready to write away. Majority of people in my class failed or got D's, there are quizes everyday and a lot of papers. She is a tough grader and if you do the extra credit you are lucky if you even get 5 points back."
3187,1703699,1.0,5.0,"Never take this teachers class. She grades so hard and will not help you on anything. Also you will have homework back to back, avoid at all cost."
3188,1703699,3.0,5.0,"very difficult grader. No one in my class made an A, even the students who were superior."
3189,1703699,1.0,5.0,"Not engaging, hard grader and work overload"
3190,1703699,2.0,4.0,Her whole class seemed to build. Didn't do good on the first paper? Too bad everything else will be related to it.
3191,1703699,1.0,4.0,Very heavy and strict on tests and after work. The papers don't stop.
3192,1703699,1.5,4.0,"She gives random(unannounced) quizzes that count significantly toward your grade. She teaches on the same level as a high school teacher; but grades much harder. She is very unclear about the writing assignments, their overall directions, and gives very little time to complete the assignments. She is a stickler with the writing process as a whole."
3193,1703699,2.5,4.0,I felt like she favored all the girls in the class and was not helpful what so ever.  Not a terribly hard class but would recommend taking someone else.
3194,1703699,4.5,4.0,"She does not give enough time for each assignment and grades hard. Very nice teacher though, and loves what she does."
3195,1754899,4.0,2.0,Makes cal 2 very easy to understand. The tests are very similar to the review. Gives partial credit on tests
3196,1754899,5.0,2.0,"The greatest math teacher to live. Makes Cal 2 the easiest it can be, highly recommend."
3197,1754899,5.0,3.0,great teacher and gives you opportunities to ask questions and meet one on one. makes the hardest stuff seem so easy. 1000% recommend taking him if you have to take any math course.
3198,1754899,5.0,3.0,A really good guy and the class is easy to keep up with if you do your homework as you do the lessons.
3199,1754899,5.0,2.0,"very caring, casual, and funny. explains everything clearly and is an easy A as long as you turn assignments in on time. the tests are just like the practice tests that he gives us. offers lots of extra credit and gives us plenty of time to get assignments completed. great professor!"
3200,1754899,5.0,2.0,Mr. Holmes is a great professor and if you have the chance to take him I highly suggest him. He actually cares and has reviews and other things to help you do better on tests.
3201,1754899,5.0,1.0,"He is very understanding and helpful. Flexible office hours, always willing to help if you are confused about something.The workload is very minimal,homework/quiz at the end of each week online. This class is an easy A, I would highly recommended him to anyone."
3202,1754899,5.0,2.0,"Awesome teacher!! He will explain until you understand!! If you need it explained in a different way, he can do that too!! I would recommend him to any one for any math!!"
3203,2461460,1.0,4.0,"It was so bad. Randomly assigned, semester-long group projects. She didn't do jack to actually teach us about groups and she grades insanely unfairly. Most days she told me to stop answering questions and I was given marks off of my class participation grade at the end of the year. She didn't care, had no empathy, and seemed to set us up to fail."
3204,2240276,1.0,5.0,"NEVER take a class with this man. HE does not care about his students, HAS no soul for teaching, and is a TERRIBLE professor. He spent the whole semester expecting us to teach ourselves using his glassworks&quot;, then graded those for a test grade. It's a travesty that this man is allowed to decide the fate of students like myself."
3205,2240276,3.0,5.0,Tony grades fairly harsh and cares a lot about notation and will take off a lot of points for things like that. He has office hours very frequently and can be quite helpful if you have a question.
3206,2240276,1.0,5.0,"The most obnoxious grader I have ever had. Made it through 3 semesters of calc with high As and cant make more than an 80 on his exams. On one exam I got every answer right and made a C. Obsessive over notation and will mark off half of the points for a question if he doesnt like the way its written. Very unclear grading criteria, unhelpful."
3207,2240276,1.0,4.0,"Worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Does not know what he's teaching, cannot answer questions, and deducts major points and offers absolutely zero help. Tests are difficult and doing homework doesn't necessarily help."
3208,2240276,1.0,5.0,"Knows what he's talking about, extremely tough grader. Very specific with his answers, if you have one thing wrong he counts the whole problem wrong or deducts major points."
3209,2240276,1.0,4.0,"Probably the worst math teacher I've ever had. Clearly a very smart mathematician, but he should not be teaching freshman who have to take this class for credit. Grades way too strictly and does not teach. Expects you to just get it the first time and doesn't answer questions."
3210,827164,1.0,5.0,Created an account just to rate this teacher because she is so bad. Respectfully this lady can't and shouldn't teach. SO RUDE and not understanding what so ever. She's not emotionally intelligent and will take her bad day out on her students. Class is not well structured and a waste of time.
3211,827164,1.0,4.0,Gets distracted easily and gives long reading assignments 
3212,827164,4.0,4.0,"She is a great person. I definitly reccomend going to her office hours. Her lectures are not helpful at all, and are not structured well. Her study guides are not super helpful. The quizzes are the best study aid. I definitly reccomend having a study group for this one. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you won't get the content if you don't attend."
3213,827164,2.0,4.0,Honestly it is very hard to make a 100 on an assignment of hers because she will take a point or two off for everything. Have fun remember each detail from each 50 page chapter for a test over three chapters. You better find a different professor or class ASAP
3214,827164,2.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Thurlkill for REL 103. While she is a sweet person, I would not recommend her as a professor in the slightest. Her lectures and PowerPoints are no help whatsoever, and I truly think the only reason I passed this class was because of the textbook. The curriculum also includes very few grades. Overall horrible class; just do not take it."
3215,827164,1.0,5.0,"awful professor, only grades in this class are tests and quizzes, hard to pass unless you read every sentence of the 500 page textbook, does not want to help students, tried to go to her to tutoring once and was sent away and had to find another religion teacher to help me, highly do not recommend."
3216,827164,1.0,2.0,"one of the worst teachers at ole miss would def no recommend, does not care at all about her students"
3217,827164,5.0,3.0,"So, so sweet. It was obvious she is very passionate about what she teaches. Quizzes are hard but tests are much easier. Lectures are a bit boring but that's more the subject than her. She makes it as interesting as she can and is funny."
3218,827164,1.0,4.0,My problem with the course is that it is very poorly structured and leaves you not knowing what to expect on tests. The lectures always end up off topic as well. The study guides you receive are crossword puzzles and for the optional final there was no study guide whatsoever. I have made A's and B's every semester until I took this class.
3219,827164,5.0,4.0,"Amazing human, AMAZING professor. The university is beyond lucky to have Dr. Thurlkill as an employee. The U of M needs more professors like her."
3220,827164,5.0,4.0,Dr. Thurlkill is an inspiration. Even if you're taking one of her classes for an &quot;easy A&quot; you will walk away thankful to have met her. She's an extremely intelligent woman who makes the University of Mississippi a better school. I am so thankful to have had her as a professor.
3221,827164,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Thurlkill is an amazing professor. She is extremely knowledgeable and her lectures are fascinating. While she may be a little flighty, this does NOT detract from her as a professor- if anything it makes the class more enjoyable. She's an unbiased prof but still passionate. Anyone who gives her a low rating probably just did poorly in her class"
3222,827164,4.0,2.0,It was a smaller class so she was very relatable and down to earth.
3223,827164,5.0,2.0,She is an awesome and funny teacher. The class is very enjoyable. She gives study guides that help make 100's on everything. Participation is the most important part of this class.
3224,827164,2.0,2.0,"Dr. Thurlkill has, quite honestly, a bit of a grating personality that definitely isn't for everyone. Her pronunciation of Hebrew and Arabic terms is also really poor, so if that's something that bothers you, you should avoid her classes. She's an easy grader, but attendance is required and attending is almost intolerable."
3225,827164,4.0,2.0,"This class is not boring at all. She is quirky and kind. There are a few projects to be aware of, but once you get through those, it's not a bad class.  Her exams would be impossible if you don't study, but she makes a clear study guide. Her study guide is exactly what the test is, so it is easy to make an A."
3226,827164,1.5,3.0,"Like some of the other comments she was constantly off topic and being someone who has to deal with Abrahamic Religions as my job, she had no idea what she was talking about."
3227,827164,4.0,3.0,"I've had this professor multiple times, and while her exams can be a little tricky, she's one of the better Religious Studies profs.  Anybody who complains about the exams being hard because they're based on the readings doesn't understand that Religion courses are at least 2/3 reading-based.  Don't take a religion class if you don't like reading."
3228,827164,2.0,4.0,I took it for wintersession and she would constantly go off topic. She talked about chocolate and her nephews way too much. Everything that was on the quizzes and tests was in the book so if you didn't read you were screwed. Her lecture literally helped ZERO. Know the key terms and main people in each section and pay attention to the headers.
3229,827164,1.5,3.0,Did not let me see my final exam.
3230,827164,3.0,3.0,"A very knowledgeable teacher who can be very witty, but test can be hard."
3231,1963806,2.0,4.0,Teaching method is not great. She makes the problem a lot harder than it can be and refuses to answer questions with an explanation and just says &quot;yes or no&quot;. You will be teaching yourself and you are better off taking a B-Cal class even if you aren't a business major.
3232,1963806,5.0,4.0,best math teacher I've had. always available to meet with you after class if you need help. super caring. never used the textbook. test reviews are basically identical to test. she wants you to do well and will work any problem you need help with. also do test reviews together as a class. great explainer!!
3233,1963806,3.5,1.0,"Very sweet and helpful, even though the English was a little tricky for her. "
3234,1963806,4.0,3.0,You can't miss more than 5 classes or points will be deducted. She offers great Extra Credit but it is not easy.. lots of stuff to get the points. She will go out of her way to help you get a good grade but you have to apply yourself. If you are not a math person she will help you understand the material. 
3235,204576,2.0,3.0,"This class is completely useless. Anything I have learned about Brit Lit, I have learned by reading the book myself. We have discussed less than half of the readings in class, though they will all be on the test anyway. Ridiculous waste of my time."
3236,204576,3.0,4.0,"Not a bad teacher, but...Keep in mind that you are in MS and there are people offended by the thought that some people might not be Christian.  He took offense to one of my papers, without knowing what my views are; I felt like he judged my paper before he read it."
3237,204576,5.0,2.0,One of the better classes in our sociologically inclined English department.
3238,204576,4.0,3.0,No Comments
3239,204576,5.0,4.0,provides awesome insight into literature and has a great taste in literature himself
3240,204576,5.0,3.0,Schroeder would make Lord Byron proud.
3241,827169,5.0,2.0,"Caring, talented, intelligent, and a good person"
3242,827169,5.0,1.0,You will throughly enjoy the man's classes. His excitment will carry over to the students.
3243,2440996,3.0,3.0,"He did teach fairly well, but in the end I don't believe I deserved the grade that I earned. Thought I had an A the whole semester till the last week of school. Entered all of my grades at the last minute and I ended up with a B. Wish I was not led on..."
3244,2440996,5.0,2.0,"He gives 1-2 weekly assignments which are worth either 1 or 3 points. If you turn the assignment in, you get full credit. There are no quizzes/tests, just progress notes about what you're thinking about on the lecture topics. There are a few papers but not many. Highly recommend"
3245,2440996,1.0,4.0,Sounds like a nice guy if you&#39;re taking the class in person but online seems like he didn&#39;t really care and just threw a class together. Doesn&#39;t do a great job making online lectures engaging and exams are confusing in their wording.
3246,2440996,4.0,3.0,"Hes a basic professor. Reads from slides and answers questions. However, beware that this class is NOT just a class of logic. Theres a lot more than just thinking involved. You do have to keep up; if you get behind in a unit, its not super easy to catch up. Attendance isnt mandatory. As long as you do the work, youre good. Pretty easy overall."
3247,2440996,4.0,4.0,"He's a pretty good instructor. He basically just reads from the slides and explains. He assigns a few homework assignments and quizzes, and the tests aren't bad. You do have to keep up with the material, and it's not a class where you can just not pay attention. But don't go into a logic class and expect it to be critical thinking skills."
3248,2440996,5.0,3.0,"Took him for both Epistemology and Philosophy of Technology and they were both great. Your grade is based on just a few assignments but he is pretty lenient with the grading. Also, he doesn't really care if you show up as long as you do the work outside of class."
3249,1783591,5.0,3.0,Would very much recommend. Loved this class. Young and helpful.
3250,1632252,5.0,1.0,"She is a southern Lauren Conrad, haha. Super sweet."
3251,1632252,5.0,1.0,"Only grades are weekly online quizzes that you can take 4 times with the highest grade that you make counting. Plus, you can go to her office and she will take it with you. SO EASY. Take her if at all possible."
3252,1632252,5.0,1.0,super easy and helpful! you can take the quizzes in her office and she will help discuss the answers with you! LOVED having her as my teacher!
3253,1632252,4.5,3.0,Double dayuuuum
3254,1632252,5.0,1.0,dayuuuum
3255,1632252,5.0,1.0,"Class is easy. a quiz every week that you can take up to 4 times, so you are pretty much guaranteed an A. Knows her stuff, not to mention....she is a stone cold fox"
3256,2146098,5.0,4.0,Shes very caring and open towards her students and is very participation oriented during lectures which makes it a much better learning atmosphere overall. I also gained valuable insights from different perspectives in class over the course of the semester. If you are open minded to different views/ideas this class should not be hard for you.
3257,2146098,5.0,2.0,I love the weekly journals. Easy A!!!
3258,2146098,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Wronski was an amazing professor who loves her students. Anytime a student had a question, she was incredibly helpful. If you show up and take notes, you will have no problem getting an A in this class. It's not like 101, it actually takes critical thinking to succeed"
3259,2146098,2.0,3.0,"Wronski cares about her students, I can say that much. However she seems out of her depth teaching 251 as it is essentially a basic statistics class, her TA can't answer any students questions and Wronski herself doesn't explain anything well in lecture. The majority of the class is left looking around wondering what on earth is going on."
3260,2146098,5.0,3.0,Dr. Julie A. Wronski is very passionate about the subject and works humor into lectures. She actually made politics interesting and explains everything very well. Often shows related videos and gives interesting lectures. Pop quizzes and response papers but they are usually easy and mostly just for attendance purposes. Overall great professor
3261,751415,3.0,4.0,"Dr. B is a good teacher, he is very insightful and helpful when he needs to be. With that being said, at times he can be rather stand-offish, rude, and unfair. He expects a lot out of his students (which is not a complaint rather an observation) and expects you to know the material. Sometimes he would put chapters we did not cover on the tests."
3262,751415,3.5,2.0,I enjoy going to this class.  He can be funny and get the class laughing.  He will call you out if you are texting in class.  He really knows his stuff but sometimes goes really fast through the slideshows. Learn shorthand to take his notes. He gives a lot of in-class quizzes but he drops your lowest two quiz grades.
3263,751415,5.0,2.0,"Dr. B is a GREAT professor. He really knows his stuff, and he's clear when teaching it. Some of the quizzes (online) are kinda tough, but you can take them as many times as you want until you get the grade you want. oh, and he's a bird expert...and can make his students laugh over anything- whether it be reproduction or cellular respiration."
3264,204604,5.0,2.0,"By far the smartest, kindest, caring, and nicest Professor I have ever taken! He loves what he does and cares about his students. If you ever have any questions he will happily help you. He loves to hear students opinions and wants you to participate so you can learn and engage. Also, he's very laid back and humble. I would take again any day!!!"
3265,204604,3.0,3.0,"Galef is VERY enthusiastic about english. There wasn't much work to do in this class. Aside from the discussion groups, it was something like 3 papers(which weren't very long), a midterm, and a final. Don't be afraid of reading out loud, he calls on students to read from the book."
3266,204604,5.0,5.0,"Brilliant, funny, stylish, and excited about the material -- he makes the most boring novels come alive."
3267,204604,5.0,4.0,one of the best profs i've ever had. you can't go wrong with this one.
3268,204604,4.5,2.0,He was really nice.  I liked his sense of humor.  He only gave two papers and they were very easy topics.
3269,204604,4.0,4.0,Had a wonderful time in his class. Love his sense of humor. He really cares.
3270,204604,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3271,204604,5.0,2.0,"Excellent professor, entertaining class lectures, a variety of course material to keep your mind happy."
3272,902973,5.0,3.0,Has the ability to explain even the most complex topics in a accessible manner. Highly recommended.
3273,902973,5.0,2.0,this man is such a g!!! great professor and does a great job explaining
3274,902973,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. Highly recommended.
3275,902973,5.0,5.0,:)
3276,902973,4.0,4.0,"Focuses more on understanding and proofs rather on computations. Lots of homework, tests are hard, but fair. Very nice personally"
3277,902973,5.0,4.0,Great teacher.
3278,902973,4.5,2.0,Read your book! You can easily get an A if you try. Do study guides and homework!
3279,907071,2.0,4.0,"Grades language exercises as if they are math tests, with no leniency or partial credit. If you miss more than 3 classes in an intensive course (which meets everyday) your grade suffers. Expects you to teach yourself more than she teaches you."
3280,907071,5.0,4.0,I loved being in Marta's class! I took her 111 class and loved the way in which she taught and her personality. I'm excited to be in her 211 class in the spring.
3281,907071,4.0,4.0,"Marta is a great teacher, a very hard class be ready to work. If you ever need help Marta is more than willing to go out of her way to make you understand it, but you have to be willing to meet her halfway! GO TO CLASS, perfect attendance will save your grade I promise you. Recommend her as FR211 teacher!"
3282,907071,5.0,4.0,"Awsome teacher. She has been the best French teacher I have ever had. She does expect a lot out of you, but she goes out of her way and beyond to help you understand everything. She makes French fun and spend a lot of time out of class preparing extracurricular things."
3283,907071,3.5,4.0,"It has been a very difficult transition trying to understand her way of submerging us into full-throttle french.  Scary even.  She's very helpful, but has too high of expectations on what french content students should already know coming into her class."
3284,2484033,1.0,2.0,"Bad at returning grades timely, shows no care for her class."
3285,2010953,4.0,5.0,HARD but I did get an A in the class. I studied my butt off though. Lectures are boring and the homework is intense and time-consuming. I had to go to tutoring 3x a week to get an A. The final exam is absolutely insane - almost everybody failed. He does give lots of extra credit though for showing up.
3286,2010953,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Rowland always put the material in an easy to understand way. If you show up to class and do the homework, you should easily get the grade you want."
3287,2010953,4.0,3.0,"Attendance is not mandatory, but highly recommend going because he often gives out extra credit points. even so, I skipped almost every Thursday after spring break and still got all the extra credit points. Try on the homework because he takes it out of 50 points and SI is really helpful. be prepared to put some work into the class"
3288,2010953,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. He really cares about his students and was always willing to explain concepts on the blackboard outside his office. Organic is hard, but he never had tricky questions on exams. You know exactly what to expect. Loved this professor and would absolutely take him again!!"
3289,2010953,5.0,2.0,"Rowland is the best chemistry professor on the Ole Miss campus. He will help you as much as possible. I found the class extremely easy; I never really went to class but I got an A. There is a drop test, and the final is only weighted 25 points more than the regular tests. Plenty of extra credit if you go to class."
3290,2010953,5.0,3.0,"The best Organic chem professor at Ole Miss period. Do not skip class though, he often gives opportunities for bonus points just for showing up. No matter who you take for Organic it will not be easy, but Rowland gives great lectures and his exams are very fair. SI is very very helpful."
3291,2010953,5.0,5.0,Great professor dont skip class though because he frequently gives extra credit on fridays just for showing up
3292,2010953,5.0,4.0,"I took him for Organic Chemistry. THE BEST POSSIBLE ORGANIC TEACHER FOR YOU TO TAKE AT OLE MISS. He is very helpful outside of class, and genuinely wants you to succeed.  Understands that its a difficult subject, so he makes the tests really fair. I would highly recommend getting into his class if you can! (It will be full by the 2nd day of regist)"
3293,2010953,5.0,3.0,Great professor; enjoys material he teaches; gives help whenever needed
3294,2010953,5.0,3.0,Rowland is by far the best chemistry professor. His lectures are extremely easy to understand. He goes pretty slow on most of the material and his tests are way easier than any other chemistry professors tests. I would highly recommend taking him for any chemistry you have to take. 
3295,1824585,2.0,5.0,not the best professor
3296,1824585,1.0,3.0,Susan Wood might be the worst English/writing teacher I have ever had. Her mannerisms and speech has a lingering sense of entitlement and superiority over all others. Do not go below the word count or Susan Wood will deny you ferociously from a grade for a measly word count no matter how close. Over all the work is not difficult just tedious. 
3297,1824585,5.0,2.0,"She was a good teacher, if you interact in class she will love and appreciate you."
3298,1824585,4.0,1.0,"Okay writing class.  Lots of homework that did not seem to matter, but nothing was hard.  Directions for every assignment are easy to follow.  Gives any extension just ask. "
3299,1824585,1.0,3.0,"This professor is as strict as it comes. She is a stickler for the rules and probably the worst professor I ever had. She gives loads of work, (sometimes just busywork), and is ridiculously strict with grading. Make sure you aren't under the word count! Bogus"
3300,1824585,5.0,3.0,great professor. assigns a lot of work but thats just because its a writing class. very specific grading rubric. IF YOU DONT MEET WORD COUNT SHE GIVES YOU AN F with no questions asked.  very nice lady. wants you to do well
3301,1306444,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ledbetter is an awesome teacher. His class is very laid back and definitely a discussion based class, which I personally enjoy. You can tell he genuinely enjoys what he is talking about and his class is structured very well. Basically, if you show up and read the material, you will easily get an A."
3302,1306444,5.0,1.0,"Take this class! 2 absences allowed. &quot;Click&quot; in for attendance. Usually counted present even if you're 30 minutes late. I had around 400 ppl in my class so he never knew who was late or who left early. Go to class, take notes on everything, & attend the 3 plays. Tests online=open book/notes. No papers written on plays. Final=open note/book. Easy A."
3303,2051919,3.0,2.0,"Good, sweet teacher, but the class is mainly based around group projects in a way that the students are meant to teach each other the material. Probably easier as an online course as long as you're fine with reading the textbook and answering short answer questions."
3304,2121553,3.0,4.0,"this Prof doesnt have enough teacher &quot;acumen&quot; or common sense to realize that when a student turns in a draft copy, the ostensible comments should be to improve that assignment to great result. suggested changes and then graded the final copy with all new changes -- leaving the grade at B+.... What was the point of that?"
3305,2121553,1.0,4.0,"I cannot give a recommend for this professor's class. Her grading of assignments, essays, etc come out of nowhere - IE - she isn't giving out the information in class that you will be graded against. Further, she made assumptions about what students knew and then graded them on said assumptions. When this was pointed out, she ignored it."
3306,2121553,1.0,4.0,"April Holm is an expert on the Civil War. However, her Teaching competency is amateurish at best. Graded assignments on expectations not known before the assignment. We were given examples/model for assignment and then graded on a standard not matching her model. Refused to correct these issues. Take another prof for history!"
3307,1935186,5.0,3.0,"He's actually one of the nicest and most understanding professors I've had. The assignments can sometimes feel like a lot, but he gives extensions if you ask for them. Participation is important but he makes an effort to make his lectures interesting and wants his students to do well. Overall it's clear that he cares for and respects his students."
3308,2639704,3.0,5.0,Easy workload throughout year. VERY hard midterm and final though. You will have to study ALOT of info for the final and midterm to do good.
3309,2639704,2.0,4.0,Not hard workload but very bad at teaching and extremely hard midterm and final. Do not take this class if you want to study on your own. Does not tell the truth on what exactly is on midterm and final and both are worth way to much credit.
3310,1376087,4.5,3.0,He is a pretty solid professor when it comes to the material and stuff. He is very bland but clear. He provides study guides for his exams so that clears up what you need to study. Just take notes from the power points and you'll do fine
3311,2770778,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Jones wants everyone to succeed. Lectures with enthusiasm and made a late pm class not so bad. Good professor and explains everything very clearly. Homework can be a lot sometimes but doing the homework will prepare you for the exam.
3312,2414427,1.0,4.0,"Unorganized, forgetful, snarky, and rude. She constantly berates the class for asking when assignments are due because she swears she went over this multiple times already.. but never did. The work load is extremely heavy, attendance is mandatory, and she is not compassionate or understanding at all."
3313,2414427,1.0,1.0,"This was not an enjoyable class. The speakers she brought in were questionable. She did NOT help us get internships. She aint gonna answer emails, or get back in a timely manner. It is the last day of finals and 80% of our stuff has not been graded. Class is cancelled last minute, and we feel unprepared and anxious for our internships."
3314,2414427,1.0,2.0,"She was not present majority of the time, although this was due to a family crisis. We knew this. We understood this. However, it is not excuse for that semester went. Assignments were given and never taken up, assignments were sprung up the day before hand, expectations changed constantly. She doesn't listen to what her students say, nor care."
3315,2408285,2.0,3.0,Took his online class and honestly pretty mid.  It wasn't crazy hard but it was definitely not easy... all I was able to do was watch the lectures and take notes.  The lectures are LONG so be prepared.  Our grades were determined by 3 tests and the final.  Wouldn't take again just because it was pretty boring.  He is a really nice guy though! 
3316,2408285,1.0,5.0,Quite literally the hardest class I have ever taken for no reason. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Just take it at Tupelo
3317,2408285,1.0,5.0,This is by far the worst professor I have ever take. Please spar yourself the time and money you will waste by taking him. The only grades were the exams and final that were nearly impossible. It seems that every question was a trick question. He only thinks he is right and will never take constructive criticism or listen to any students struggling
3318,2408285,1.0,5.0,"This course was unorganized, extremely difficult for no reason, unhelpful, and everything in a course you would not want to be enrolled in. I would love to see the professor take the tests he makes with solely the notes and materials he gives us and watch him fail like the rest of us. Truly insane."
3319,2408285,1.0,5.0,Very hard to pass. He doesnt give any slack and people have taken the class multiple times and continued to fail. And majority fail. I am smart and had a 4.0. Now I am failing a class and will lose my financial aid and it has ruined my college career. Id rather go to a different university than take this class with this teacher again.
3320,2408285,1.0,5.0,"52 pages for one test, situational tests that are impossible. Can bring notes to test but it doesn't help any. No response to emails from the professor. Don't know how many pass this class with a C or above."
3321,2408285,1.0,5.0,These tests are impossible to pass.
3322,2408285,1.0,5.0,Terrible Teacher
3323,816989,3.0,4.0,"I actually kind of enjoyed BISC160 with Jones. He's really dry and super monotonous. Unfortunately, halfway through the semester, we had to switch to Symula, and I really could not stand her."
3324,816989,5.0,3.0,Jones is a solid professor. He knows his stuff.
3325,816989,4.0,1.0,"If you can choose Professor Jones for BISC 164, I would. He gave us one reading per week and the same three-question sheet to fill in before class. The readings were around 4 or 5 pages, and the sheet took no more than 10 minutes. He also reviewed us on the days before tests. Honestly, just participate in the class discussions and you're good."
3326,816989,2.5,5.0,"Read the book before class so that the lectures are a review. Very hard class but possible if you don't fall behind. Stay on top of the work from the very first day and study study study. No joke, study. Also, labs are really helpful if you are caught up in class and have a good understanding of the current lecture. Don't fall behind."
3327,816989,4.5,2.0,"Professor Jones speaks very clear. He tells you exactly what you need to know. His tests are MC and short essay,but he tells you what the essay questionss are by doing the problems book. The lab is very very easy just make sure you go. This guy is AWESOME!"
3328,816989,4.0,1.0,easy as pie! Just study old quizzes and exams! I aced this with my eyes closed!!!
3329,816989,4.5,4.0,Find copies of the old exams and this class is cake!
3330,1371999,1.5,4.0,Bad advisor. Bewarned.
3331,2441056,5.0,3.0,"Josh is amazing. Very caring and wants you to improve. Very fair grader- as long as you put in effort, you will get an A. There's 2 short artist papers you do, but as long as you do them you will get A's. There's probably 4-5 hours of homework per week sometimes less, but he was always willing to work with you if you needed more time. Wonderful guy"
3332,2414429,5.0,4.0,"One of the most accessible professors Ive ever had - she responds to every email you send right after youve sent it, is super considerate and willing to help you succeed. She also offers a ton of extra credit opportunities throughout the semester which are really helpful. Shes overall such a sweet and very passionate professor!"
3333,2414429,5.0,3.0,Dr Lee is amazing. She has expectations of her students and she knows who goes above and beyond. She will work with the class as whole and grades fairly. You have to show up and pay attention but it's a solid class. She cares and wants her students to succeed. One of the best teachers I have had at this uni.
3334,2273118,5.0,1.0,"This is a great class and professor to take to get your science credit. The lab with it is Geol 115, yet easy, was a little irritating at times. However, if you go to class and take notes or keep up with the posted PowerPoints, you will be fine. She is also understanding and accessible if needed. "
3335,2273118,5.0,1.0,Probably the easiest class I’ve ever taken. If you look over the material once before class you will get an A on every test. 
3336,2273118,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Inoka is a wonderful professor. Makes material understandable. She is very passionate and genuinely wants you to learn and succeed. I loved her class and would recommend her 100%. TOPHAT quiz questions during lectures, just pay attention and theyre easy. Study guides closely resemble tests, which are easy. Just understand physical processes"
3337,2273118,5.0,1.0,"Inoka is one of the best professors you will ever have. Her exams are like the study guides and there are no surprises. Shes is such a great and caring teacher. If you see her in office hours, she might even help your grade as long as she sees you putting in the effort"
3338,2273118,4.0,5.0,Very hard to understand
3339,2273118,5.0,3.0,Good teacher. Very considerate. Cares about students tries to make geology interesting
3340,728935,2.0,5.0,If ur not willing to study everyday and take insane tests then take someone else for chem105
3341,728935,5.0,4.0,"From a $$$ standpoint, you get the most bang for your buck with Tschumper.  He is difficult but you will LEARN which is what higher education is all about.  He will help you if you put forth the effort.  I highly recommend him."
3342,728935,3.0,4.0,"Not an easy teacher by any means. He started in the honors college and went to lecturing freshman with seemingly little adjustment. His class is fast-paced and easy to fall behind in. Tests are extremely hard and the class averages are usually in the 40-50s, but an 85 in the class will get you an A-."
3343,728935,4.0,5.0,"Extremely hard class. He is a great teacher and very clear about assignments; however, he teaches at such a fast pace that it is very easy to fall behind. He gives only quizzes that are very hard, and his in class tests are even harder and rushed. If you are not a hard worker or do not learn at a fast pace, I do not recommend this class."
3344,728935,3.0,5.0,"Tough class, don't fall behind. You take quizzes online that are tough to score well on. His tests are super hard and rushed. He has a good personality in the classroom, but sometimes blazes through powerpoints at incomprehensible speed."
3345,728935,4.0,4.0,"Go to his office hours. He's extremely helpful if you put in the effort. Enjoyable class. He's got a good sense of humor and is very interesting. However, tests and quizzes are extremely hard. Homework is optional, but do it and ask questions if you want to do well. The kids that frequent his office hours do the best in the class. Tough class."
3346,728935,3.5,4.0,"He is not easy, but it is realistic to pull out an A if you put in the effort as an 85% and up is an A.  Make sure you pay attention, but he gives you ample opportunity to succeed if you take the initiative."
3347,728935,5.0,1.0,"Beware.  Asking questions in class can throw him off and he'll get agitated and start speaking louder.   Other than that, very handsome to look at."
3348,728935,5.0,2.0,I took this class just to see him three times a week. :D
3349,728935,5.0,4.0,Best. teacher. ever.
3350,728935,5.0,4.0,Dr. Tschumper is like soooo hot and sooo smart. He makes class FUN!!!
3351,728935,4.0,3.0,No Comments
3352,728935,4.0,5.0,"Be prepared to study like you've never studied before. He's a great prof-very helpful and brilliant. However, he's tough and he won't lower his standards for you."
3353,728935,3.0,5.0,"His class tests are extremely hard, the class average on most tests is 50-60%. you will learn a lot, but your grades may not be very good. Beware!"
3354,2211689,4.0,4.0,Very helpful when it comes to your writing! She is also very considerate. My friend got food poisoning and could not come to class. Dr. Myatt email her and they communicated about her assignments and grades. She likes to have some fun day. Loves group responses.
3355,1777519,4.0,1.0,Very easy to make an A in this class whether you're a CJ major or not as long as you read the book and go to class. She says &quot;test&quot; on literally everything that's on the test and the tests and lectures are all based straight off of the book. Tests are the only grades minus occasional EC so if you're not willing to read or show up then don't take it
3356,1777519,4.0,2.0,Reading and participation are a must. Calls on students at random to answer questions. Extra credit opportunities and occasional homework. Very passionate about the subject and explains things well. Absence policy (automatic failure after 7). Great instructor and overall good class
3357,1777519,4.5,1.0,Pay attention and you will pass. She explains everything.
3358,1777519,1.5,4.0,I do not think her tests matched what she taught at all. I took law enforcement at the same time and got an A in there but a C in her class. Does not make sense. She only gives 3 tests and does not tell you when they are until 2 days before the test. So stupid! I will not be taking her again 
3359,1777519,5.0,1.0,"VERY awesome professor. Very passionate about class. If you go, you'll learn the material. The tests are straight forward and multiple choice. If you want an easy A and aren't a CJ major I recommend taking this class!!"
3360,2684790,5.0,2.0,"Read test questions thoroughly. Law is very specific. LARGE curves. Go to class because he didn't know how to record lectures. He was a funny guy in what he said and examples he gave. Very lenient. Just go to class and write notes, especially when he gives examples!"
3361,2684790,4.0,3.0,"I would take this class again. 3 exams all semester and no homework. Read his exam questions carefully! Participate in class and get to know him and it'll make class a lot more enjoyable! Sometimes his lectures can be on the boring side, but he is a nice guy."
3362,1918845,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Cantrell is an amazing professor. She is passionate about her class and wants you to learn as much as possible. She gives quizzes on the reading, but if you pay attention in class and read, you will pass. She is very caring and understanding. If you don't understand the material in class, ask questions."
3363,1918845,5.0,5.0,She is amazing! She gives you feedback on think pieces at the zoom office hours and meeting opportunities. She met with me twice extra. Would definitely take again.
3364,1918845,3.0,3.0,"Although I enjoyed the class material, I think it could have been taught better. The entire class was very one sided on every issue discussed. There was also zero feedback on any of the writings we did. All 6 writings and the 4 responses were grouped together for one 100 point grade, which I think is ridiculous."
3365,1918845,4.0,4.0,She really cares about the well being of her students and is always helpful outside of class.
3366,1918845,4.0,4.0,Way too much work to keep up with to be an online class. There is not enough discussion on the readings to take the quizzes and respond in such a deep thinking way. Great teacher just gave wayyyyyyy too much work for an online class. 6 papers in 1 month is excessive
3367,1918845,5.0,4.0,Enjoyed the class. it was challenging to keep up but not unmanageable. She showed she was willing to work with the student if problems arose. the class will address things that you may not have been exposed to.
3368,1918845,5.0,2.0,"I LOVED this class! It was very interesting. I enjoyed having a class that wasn't as difficult and as demanding, since I was taking Bisc 162/163 at the time. If you're looking for a fun elective or love Dr. Cantrell as much as I do, take this course!  If you turn in all assignments and participate, you'll do great in the class!"
3369,1918845,5.0,4.0,The class has really helped to open my mind to alot of things going on in the world around us that we really never give a second thought. Dr. Cantrell is very helpful and always gives feedback in a timely manner when i need it.
3370,1918845,5.0,4.0,Dr. Cantrell was one of the best professors I had at Ole Miss. She is greatly respected and is very knowledgable about her subject matter.
3371,1918845,5.0,2.0,"A lot of reading and writing, but that's what you should expect from that kind of class. Lectures are really good and grading is rather liberal."
3372,1918845,5.0,4.0,One of the best English professors I've had at Ole Miss. Highly recommended
3373,1918845,5.0,3.0,"The reading materials are fantastic.  Dr. Cantrell is very open-minded, and elegant in discussing topics that may be controversial or uncomfortable. She is extremely fair in teaching literature that covers all walks of life. Her enthusiasm and humor makes the class a joy to be a part of."
3374,1918845,5.0,3.0,"Very kind and willing to help, wants her students to succeed!"
3375,1918845,1.5,5.0,Good luck tryna take notes cuz you can't have a laptop or tablet or anything and she goes through the slides too fast. The reading responses are hard bc she doesn't explain what she wants at all
3376,1918845,4.5,4.0,Take her class she's good
3377,1918845,3.5,3.0,ADORABLE
3378,1918845,4.0,4.0,"a bit confusing at times but has opened my eyes to understanding different kinds of analysis, deconstruction in particular. "
3379,1918845,4.5,4.0,She is a great professor. Just be come to class having read and you'll pass. She is helpful if you go to office hours.
3380,1918845,5.0,1.0,"Don't miss the chance to take her. She's hilarious! I didn't want to take this class, but by the end of the spring it was my absolute favorite."
3381,1918845,5.0,1.0,"Completely amazing professor. She really made herself available for others and would be willing to help you in any way she could. Coming from a background in which I hated literature, she made it fun and exciting and helped me to understand the significance of American literature."
3382,1918845,5.0,3.0,She really just wants you to care.
3383,1918845,5.0,3.0,she makes you read but it's worth it
3384,1918845,5.0,4.0,Dr. Cantrell knows her stuff and is so funny!
3385,1918845,5.0,3.0,"This was my last college course and I would like to say this class was the only one in my four years were the discussions were executed correctly and thoroughly. It was actually easy to speak your opinion, most classes it is hard to have a view on things. An amazing job of analyzing literary works and getting students to give their opinion."
3386,1918845,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Cantrell, I really enjoyed your class this summer. Thank you so much for the enthusiasm with the course material. I haven't taken many classes in my college career that teachers seems to be so passionate about what they were teaching. Thank you and best wishes in the future!"
3387,1918845,5.0,1.0,"I loved her! She's young, quirky and extremely personable. I would recommend her to any friend of mine that needs English Literature credit. If you put in the work, you'll be just fine! Really enjoyed her class. "
3388,1918845,4.5,3.0,interesting class and the professor was into it
3389,1918845,5.0,3.0,Would take her again if I didn't graduate!
3390,1918845,5.0,3.0,"I just wanted to say how much of a joy it has been to be your student. You have endlessly given to the two classes of yours I took, and you opened dialogues about issues no other professors dared to encounter. Thank you for being open, honest, and enriching; it has been an honor. "
3391,1896320,5.0,3.0,"The best Calculus professor you will ever have. He explains things so well and gives great study guides. As long as you know the study guide, youll do fine on the exams. Calculus is a hard subject but he makes understanding it easy"
3392,1896320,5.0,2.0,Had him Spring 2014 for Elementary Stats. Very good teacher. Extremely helpful.  Good-looking.
3393,1376131,1.0,4.0,He does not use Blackboard properly and has stated multiple times that he would prefer for turning in assignments to be easier for him than the students. This is the most work I have ever received for a 100 level class. He will stack assignments on top of eachother and assume that the students have no other assignments. Worst professor Ive ever had
3394,1376131,2.0,2.0,"Creates the dumbest homework assignments for your paper that do more harm than good. The assignments are tedious, long, and completely useless. Not only does he not realize this is a required Gen Ed for most degrees, but he seems to think this is the only class students are enrolled in. "
3395,1376131,1.0,5.0,He is so rude when you have a question. If you skip this class there is no way you will pass and he just told me I am going to fail but to turn in my paper.
3396,1376131,2.0,3.0,"A harsh grader in the sense that you'll never get 100. The final was a collaborative timed essay, meaning even if you did amazing, if someone else in your writing group bombs, everyone's grade is going down. Not good if you have trouble completing busywork, because it'll be due at the end of the unit and take points off your essay."
3397,1376131,1.0,5.0,This man makes the MOST tedious assignments. On glizzy
3398,1376131,2.0,4.0,Makes it very easy to lose points but hard to gain any back.
3399,1376131,5.0,4.0,"Awesome teacher. Wants you to succeed and become better writers. He grades kind of difficult, but following the rubric for each paper will get you a passing grade. Don't miss more than the given absences or it will reflect on your grade. He's funny and an enjoyable professor. Definitely recommend."
3400,1376131,2.0,4.0,I dreaded going to this class. He grades hard and the assignments never make sense. 
3401,1376131,3.5,4.0,His class so. alful. i cnat even use complete sentence?
3402,1376131,5.0,2.0,"Great guy, he's very reasonable and helpful. highly recommend. definitely was my favorite class freshman year, and grew up hating english."
3403,1376131,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, easy papers espeically if you go to his office hours or the writing center."
3404,1376131,4.0,1.0,"very reasonable, no long papers, very open minded on paper topics, probably my favorite class that semester and i hate english."
3405,1611653,4.0,2.0,"Class is almost all writing. He teaches you how to do well on your essays though. Lectures are good, though I skipped a number of them. Class is pretty chill. Just find the text online though don't bother buying the books."
3406,1611653,4.0,2.0,Very nice and cool guy. Easy class if you do the essays. Super laid back.
3407,1611653,4.0,2.0,He is willing to work with you and help you out whenever needed. He takes jokes easily and not bad to look at.
3408,2430857,5.0,2.0,Best professor I've had so far. Lots of homework like all the other math courses. Provides study guides exactly like the exams. 10/10 would take again.
3409,2430857,3.0,5.0,"Kains' class is the only class I have ever failed. He was available a couple of times when I needed help. The exams are brutal, but he does try to give you as much credit as he can. Write stuff on the question even if you don't know the answer. He is super boring.  At 8 am, his lectures were unbearable."
3410,2430857,5.0,2.0,"He’s awesome, definitely recommend him. He is super clear on what he wants on things and is very nice/easy to talk to. He sends out study guides before the test and those are EXACTLY like the tests. If you can do well on the study guides, the test will be a walk in the park."
3411,2430857,5.0,3.0,Mr. Kains does a great job teaching calculus. He is easy to understand and will not hesitate to help you if you ask. He is a generous grader and if you pay attention in class and do the homework you will pass easily.
3412,2430857,5.0,2.0,"Best math teacher you will ever have. He teachers everything in a very clear manner and goes out of his way to make sure you understand the material. His exams are exactly like his study guides, so do them and the test will be a breeze. You'll have to buy an online program and have on average 2 homeworks a week, but they're never too difficult."
3413,2430857,5.0,3.0,"Mr Kains is by far the best math teacher ever, coming from someone who struggled to pass Algebra in high school and ended up with a B+ in Business Calculus both spring and fall semester as a freshmen. He is so nice, easy to talk to and super helpful when it comes to topics you might have trouble grasping he wants ever one in his class to succeed."
3414,2430857,5.0,3.0,Professor Kains is one of the best professors that I have ever had. You will have four tests and a final exam. He is good at helping you understand math and will be willing to help you with anything that you are struggling with. Go to his office hours and ask questions in class on what you are confused on. Not going to class will make you confused.
3415,2430857,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Kains is the bomb dot com. Half mathematician, half starry-eyed dreamer. One-hundred percent authentic human being. He is a finger pointing to the moon. (Most math teachers, sadly, only ever gesture towards eternal conscious torment) But don't focus too much on the finger or you'll miss out on all the heavenly glory. Hehehe. ;)"
3416,2430857,5.0,2.0,"He's a great dude, very young. Class is easy to understand and most of the time we got out of class 15-20 mins early. It was a MWF class but we didn't meet on Fridays. His print-outs that you fill out during lectures are extremely helpful and have example problems that are almost word for word the same on the quizzes/homeworks/tests. Take him!!!!!!"
3417,1951625,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, she's funny and makes class interesting. She does activities to help you to understand the material. Go to class and you will make a good grade. Multiple quizzes, a good bit of homework, and an optional lab practical final that can replace your worst programming assignment."
3418,1951625,5.0,3.0,"Every semester I try to take a course taught by this professor. The material is usually challenging, but she is an amazing teacher that manages to make the courses interesting. Once for 531 she had us play board games during class to get a better understanding of how to write an AI program to play against a human opponent."
3419,1951625,4.5,3.0,Wonderful course. You will get to know about different data structures. Class is primarily based on reading research papers about different data storage and retrieval mechanisms. This class is more kind of group discussion. You have an option to research or implement an efficient data structure.  
3420,1951625,4.5,3.0,Very useful course if you are into natural language processing and machine learning. Individual projects help you apply everything you learnt in the class. The professor will always be there for you to help with the projects.
3421,1087371,3.0,1.0,"The course layout on-line lacks, over the course the processes and methods to find feedback was not clear. The instructor was hands-off during this class and this left us students confused most of the time hoping we were doing the assignments correctly. Communication Lacked throughout the course."
3422,1087371,5.0,3.0,I took several of her classes from 2010-2012 and can honestly say she is the most inspirational teacher. She cares deeply for her students and strives to help everyone succeed. Her passion to teach is obvious and contagious. A haiku about her class: if you come to class- and do the class homework tasks- you will surely pass.
3423,1087371,5.0,4.0,Great human being.
3424,1087371,5.0,4.0,Great teacher!
3425,1087371,5.0,1.0,Thumbs up
3426,1087371,5.0,4.0,Great soul. Wonderful experience.
3427,1087371,5.0,3.0,"If you don't love this prof, you have some serious personal issues! She is understanding, interesting, and actually cares about her students! Best teacher ever!"
3428,1087371,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Ms. Ruckel is the best woman in the world. I was going for my dental degree but after witnessing Ruckel's graceful nature and amazing understanding of life, I decided to change my major to English. I seriously suggest everyone to take her. You barely even have to come to class, just keep in contact with her and do the homework."
3429,1087371,4.0,5.0,Awesome professor who cares about her students. Very interesting lectures.
3430,1087371,4.5,5.0,Dr. Ruckel was very fun and interesting. I enjoyed the class.
3431,1087371,4.5,4.0,No Comments
3432,1087371,1.5,1.0,Lectures based directly from sparknotes.com and wikipedia.com.  Wastes students' class time and money.
3433,1376139,4.5,1.0,"Great teacher,really laid back. Doesn't really like Friday afternoons."
3434,1376139,5.0,1.0,"Very laid back and is very nice and considerate to students who participate and come to class. One of my favorites I've had at Ole Miss. I was in his Zombie section of LIBA 102, and he was so enthusiastic. Also we watched lots of movies like, Dawn of the Dean, Shawn of the Dead, and 28 Days Later. He made coming to class fun instead of a chore."
3435,2502545,4.0,2.0,I took this course during the first summer term online and thoroughly enjoyed it on its own. Dr. Roberts is very friendly and gives great feedback almost instantly. He offers a fair amount of extra credit opportunities and cares a great deal about your passing grade. Definitely recommend for Psychology majors or even as a filler.
3436,1886099,5.0,3.0,"I loved taking Dr. Bu's class. Everything was clearly written down, quizzes were pretty easy, tests were harder, but not too bad. I will take him again, given the choice."
3437,1886099,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bu is one of the best professors you can choose for any math class. If you write down everything he puts on the board, you will get a good grade. He is definitely one of the best teachers you can have in the math department!!! His test reviews are SO helpful and he's such a great teacher!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
3438,1886099,5.0,2.0,"Awesome teacher. His English isn't perfect, but he's willing to give you help if you need it. He's a lenient and an understanding grader. Would definitely take him again. Just pay attention in class and you'll pass. People who've told you to not take his class clearly DID NOT study and pay attention, so don't listen to them."
3439,1886099,4.0,4.0,"His English sounds a bit weird at first, but he writes literally everything on the board. Grading is rather compassionate and liberal. Very nice and helpful personally."
3440,1886099,5.0,3.0,Great!
3441,1886099,4.5,1.0,"Extremely easy as long as you go to class and copy down his notes on the board. Everything on the tests are word for word on the study guide, which come directly from the notes on board and homework. No real surprises on the tests. Attend class, and study your study guide enough, and it's an easy A (or at least an easy B) class for math majors. "
3442,1886099,3.0,2.0,"Does not speak clearly, but that doesn't matter because he has great board notes & everything is explained well through his writing on the board. He goes through a study guide the class before a test and it is identical to the exam. I took an Honors section, & he was much better and thus it was an easier class than when I took a non-honors teacher."
3443,2559894,5.0,1.0,"David was one of my favorite teachers. He is an easy grader, but he takes a long time to grade- like at least a month or more. He made the class fun and he does lots of creative writing assignments, which can be challenging, but he is always willing to help you out and answer questions. He involves everyone and is great at bringing class together"
3444,2559894,5.0,3.0,Daily homework online and many small assignments in class. Occasional group speaking tests. Pretty lenient in grading
3445,1609622,1.5,3.0,She is awful!!
3446,2289568,5.0,1.0,"Grant is the best professor I have ever had. He is absolutely hilarious and randomly gives extra credit just for showing up to class. It's an easy A as long as you show up to class. If you are taking Pol 101, TAKE GRANT. It will be a huge mistake for you not to! He is hilarious and his lectures are very interesting. He also brings candy!"
3447,2289568,5.0,2.0,"Overall a fantastic professor. Young enough to connect students, old enough to understand politics."
3448,2174881,2.0,3.0,"Doctor Skipper is probably the most boring professor I have ever had. Her lectures feel like they go on for 10 years. No matter what kind of notes you take for her lectures, the material taught in the lecture will not be on your test. The professor she was teaching the class with FELL ASLEEP IN HER LECTURE. Do not take if you want to stay awake."
3449,2174881,1.0,4.0,Assigns papers with very short deadlines. Lectures drag on a little too long. Very Tough Grader. There are much better Honors 101 teachers.
3450,2174881,4.0,4.0,"Her lectures can be a bit dry but she's a great teacher. Has a really interesting approach to the novels read during the class and tackles tough topics. You definitely have to read a lot and be able to write well though, so if you're looking for an easy A this likely isn't your class. Gives you a great perspective though!"
3451,2174881,3.0,4.0,"For a low level class, she is very tough. She almost expects her students to already know what she's talking about."
3452,776098,3.0,4.0,"Read the textbook
Grading system is good, 85 = A"
3453,776098,5.0,3.0,GOAT
3454,776098,1.0,5.0,"Cleland is nice but so disorganized and usually late for class. We had multiple homeworks with 100+ problems, the tests are nearly impossible and you do not get any equations/formulas, you are expected to remember them all. I took a different honors professor for 106 and it was so much better. Only take Cleland if you are extremely good at chem."
3455,776098,1.0,3.0,"While Dr. Cleland is a nice guy, I can not stand his teaching. His lectures were the most dreaded part of my week, his homework was ridiculously long, he provided no study guides or extra help for tests with the exception of one general help session a week (that happened to be at the same time as my Chem lab), finally, his tests were impossible."
3456,776098,1.0,4.0,"Literally the worst class I have ever taken. He takes forever to grade tests and quizzes. The homework he assigns takes FOREVER simply because of the amount he assigns. He's a nice guy but for me personally his teaching is awful. If you don't already have a good background in chemistry, I would not recommend Cleland."
3457,776098,5.0,4.0,"I think Dr. Cleland is one of the best professors I've ever taken.  He likes the subject and he interacts with the class well.  I like the fact he assigns problems from the book, because many other professors don't even use the book and that's a waste because then you don't know what is expected. I truly understood chemistry after his class."
3458,776098,4.5,4.0,Dr. Cleland is a great teacher! I had him for General Chem and I learned so much from him. He really likes what he does. His notes do come from the text but it saves you having to decipher the good from the bad. Do the problems in the book and you will be fine.
3459,776098,1.0,1.0,"He is the most boring Professor ever.  He, um, is just, um, like, um, Mr. Mackey, um, on South Park, mkay.  His notes are straight out of the book.  I do not think that he actuaaly understands inorganic chemistry.  He is the worst professor ever. MKAY"
3460,2174887,1.0,3.0,AWFUL!!!!! She is new and it is obvious.
3461,2174887,4.0,3.0,"Class is easy, if you show up. Very big on lectures."
3462,1048488,4.0,5.0,"This class is hard, but will definitely weed out the actual econ students versus the business majors who never had to do actual thinking."
3463,1048488,1.0,5.0,The worst econ professor ive ever had. Doesn't use blackboard and doesn't discuss tests at all before youre expected to take them. Is rude when you ask questions and could care less if his students succeed.
3464,1048488,3.0,5.0,"Amazing economist, yet questionable teacher. The material he gives is absolutely priceless and hard to find anywhere else; yet it will turn your head into a mess unless you are already pretty deep into macro. There are number of papers to read that are on the tests. Grading is quite harsh, yet uses curve. Overall, must take for Economics majors"
3465,1048488,2.0,4.0,"The man is condescending to put it lightly. I asked a question one time and he made it seem like I didn't understand basic shapes. If the students in your class were really that dumb, wouldn't your teaching at such a university be a statement about how good of a professor you are? "
3466,1048488,1.0,5.0,Most miserable man on earth. Avoid taking him if at all possible. Very difficult tests. Laughs at you if you ask questions in class. Mean person
3467,1048488,1.5,5.0,He hates the world and is one of the worst teachers i have ever had
3468,1048488,4.5,2.0,Not even that bad.  He is a wake up call to some immature students because he doesn't just give away grades and he isn't a pushover.  Probably the man MOST responsible for ensuring would-be econ grads are weeded out before they waste too much time learning they can't hack it.
3469,1048488,2.0,4.0,He is a very boring and unfriendly teacher. I also found him to be strange and unhelpful when asked questions.
3470,1048488,1.5,5.0,No Comments
3471,2365353,5.0,1.0,"Online THEA 201 is pretty easy. Just keep up with the work and go to the 2 required plays, and you get an A. The work can be a lot sometimes, but this is definitely the best class to take for a fine art credit."
3472,2365353,5.0,1.0,"This was the easiest class I've ever taken. Everything is posted at the beginning of the semester and you can get ahead easily. One of the most understanding teachers. If you need an elective I def recommend this one. You have to attend two plays during the semester but you only have to watch them, no assignment attached and they were interesting. "
3473,2365353,5.0,1.0,This was a really simple online class. Deadlines are given on the syllabus at the beginning of the semester. You will have to attend two plays (both are free) but just have to attend and have good theater etiquette to get credit. There are two essays throughout the semester that are fairly simple. Lessons are easy to understand. Amazing teacher.
3474,2365353,5.0,2.0,He was great homework would be due every couple of weeks. There were two main essays and seeing two plays were also required. If you have to take an elective this one is not bad at all. 
3475,2365353,4.0,2.0,Pretty easy - homework due every few weeks. a few papers are due throughout the semester but not difficult.
3476,2365353,5.0,1.0,Easiest online class you can take at this school. Very little weekly workload. Textbook definitely required.
3477,2365353,5.0,1.0,The textbook is required cause it holds all your homework which are all participation grades. He gives a paper with all the due dates for the class on the first week and never added any assignments or changed dates (unless giving extensions) very easy and interesting class. Would recommend taking him.
3478,2365353,4.0,1.0,He gave us a list of due dates for the entire semester. 10/10
3479,2365353,4.0,2.0,This was a great class. Just make sure you do your book work on time. You have plenty of time to do the work and it is not hard. You have to write a few things but they are not long. He does give extra credit. It's a great class and you learn a lot. He seems very helpful if you need it. You know exactly what to do each week.
3480,2365353,5.0,3.0,"he's good, I like him."
3481,2365353,3.0,2.0,"Easy class. Boring lectures that aren't mandatory (but lectures help paper prompts). As long as you do the homework and attend the plays, you'll be fine."
3482,2365353,5.0,1.0,"He's easy. Class is boring, but not mandatory. Grades on participation. Easy A. Just go to the two required plays and do the easy homework and you'll pass with an A+."
3483,2365353,3.0,1.0,easy a if you do everything worth an easy grade stated in the syllabus I missed a play and didn't realize it was worth so much of my grade so went from an A to a C so be careful
3484,2365353,4.0,2.0,This class was so easy. 2 papers and 2 online tests. Easy A.
3485,2365353,2.0,1.0,"hardly ever went to class, but I did all my homework online and studied outside of class. I still made an A, but many people who didn't go wouldn't keep up with homework and would not pass. People who did show up to class sent notes and we all passed tests."
3486,2160555,5.0,4.0,"Amazing teacher! 
lots and lots of reading but he is a very good teacher who really loves to teach.
there is plenty of opportunities to boost your grade with quizzes and extra credit."
3487,2160555,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Cook is amazing! He is one of the smartest people I have met. He is energetic and makes class interesting. He gives a lot of work but grades fairly and always gives feedback! He is not for the faint of heart, but his class is an amazing experience!"
3488,2160555,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Cook is amazing! I have taken him for two classes now and he is one of the best professors I have ever had. Even over Zoom, he makes learning ancient Greek really fun. It's a tough subject, but that is not his fault. Take his class!!!!"
3489,2160555,5.0,3.0,"Honestly, I don't recognize the dude the two other students are complaining about. Dr Cook is pretty great. In my class he gave extensive feedback, loads of extra credit opportunities, and tailored assignments to give you a crystal clear idea of what will be on the test. He's very nice and caring,too. He teaches a tough subject, but he knows it!"
3490,2160555,1.0,4.0,"Cook manages to make something as cool as Greek History and Mythology mind--numbingly boring. There is a quiz every day with confusingly worded questions. His phrasing is almost always convoluted and reads like Yoda speaking. On top of his confusing wording, he grade's his papers and weekly artifact responses harshly. Do not take his CLC101 class."
3491,2160555,2.0,4.0,"This is the hardest 100 level class I have taken in my 3 years of college. I took the class because I enjoy the classics, and I did enjoy learning them in this class but this class takes so much work. Quiz over reading every class, the readings don't always help for the papers. The final was absurd and couldn't find enough topics to write on"
3492,1269675,3.0,5.0,Seems to not keep his word always.   I'll leave it at that.
3493,1269675,4.5,3.0,"He's a pretty cool professor, very laid back.  A good % of his test comes word for word out of the book.  He even provides study guides ^^.  His assignments can be very difficult though, but he'll help you out or point you in the right direction if you'll just ask him."
3494,2494384,1.0,4.0,"Doesn't teach do not expect to be able to communicate. Emailed her to ask a question, took her 2 days to reply and she said to, ""ask the class discussion board"". Her responsibilities include: Assigning a program for assignments that she didn't make, discussion posts she doesn't participate in, and failing to post study guides."
3495,2494384,1.0,5.0,I cannot stress enough how much you should not take her course for marketing principles.The amount of work she requires is absolutely insane for such an elementary class. I am only in the third week so I am unsure about tests. It is very obvious as well that she only understands the very basics of marketing and no more.
3496,2494384,1.0,3.0,"One of the worst professors I have ever had. She is incredibly rude and condescending and refuses to offer any help within the course. Your grade is determined by the amount of time you put in and super specific guidelines, not by the grade you receive."
3497,2494384,1.0,4.0,This professor will put tons of hurdles in your way of passing the class. She makes a normally enjoyable class into an awful class.
3498,2494384,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Babin is the worst professor I have ever had. incredibly rude, busy work is the bulk of your grade, unclear guidelines for studying, unwilling to help.

None of these reviews are over dramatic or poor students. She really is that horrible. I would recommend just waiting another semester if she is your only option left this semester."
3499,2494384,1.0,4.0,She is rude. There is no other way to put it. The blog posts that counted for a grade where useless. She made us write blogs on articles that had nothing to do with the material of the class. She also doesn't even post lectures.
3500,2494384,1.0,4.0,She is super condescending and not kind to any students. Do not take her
3501,2494384,1.0,4.0,"Do not take her if you can avoid it. SO much work assigned every other day with a ton of content. There is a test every other week. I spent hours and hours studying to get my grade, and I was still on the edge with my grades. She is not someone to work with and is very harsh. If you want to have time to do your other classes, do NOT take her!!!!!"
3502,2494384,1.0,1.0,"Her online class was a joke. Rude and unhelpful towards students. The &quot;blog posts&quot; you are required to do are absolutely pointless and are not useful for the class. If she doesn't agree with your post, she'll remove it without telling you. I would recommend waiting until next semester if Professor Babin is your only choice left."
3503,2494384,3.0,4.0,"There are a lot of aspects to this course... Participation heavily matters and you are graded on participation, homework, quizzes, exams, and much more. It is a lot of work. Sometimes the professor makes you feel stupid if you do not know something or get an answer wrong... Other than that, she is OK."
3504,2494384,3.0,3.0,"She treats her students based on if they show up to the Zoom meetings or not. I missed a few and my grades for the following assignments reflected that, it wasn't that I missed that many points in the actual assignment."
3505,2494384,1.0,5.0,"Least understanding professor I've ever had. I highly recommend not taking a class instructed by Professor Babin. Multiple things due every week, I did more assignments in this class than all my other classes combined. An absolute ridiculous professor. DO NOT TAKE HER."
3506,2494384,1.0,5.0,"Do not take Dr. Babin. Instead of teaching the material, she shares useless information about her life. She is strict and offers no leeway even if you go to class everyday when over 75% of the class never shows up (for good reason). When I went for help, she was disrespectful. There is no implication that she wants her students to succeed."
3507,2494384,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Babin is the professor I have ever had in my 4 years of a college student. She is disrespectful, rude, condescending, and will laugh at you if you come to get help. She does not care about students unless they are her favorites. She is subjective in her grading and is not fair. I STRONGLY advise finding another professor."
3508,2830257,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Nahm is very nice and gives good lectures. The class definitely has a heavy reading load, but you have to pay attention or else you will not do well on the papers and exams."
3509,2590642,1.0,5.0,bad
3510,2590642,1.0,5.0,Horrible. If you get her for your teacher drop the class before it's too late. You will thank me when you hear about her from other people. Horrible. Awful. The worst. Who let her become a teacher?
3511,2590642,1.0,5.0,Worst teacher I've encountered. Insanely passive aggressive and disrespectful to students.
3512,2590642,1.0,5.0,N/A
3513,2590642,1.0,5.0,Very bad attitude! She can not give you good feedback whatsoever. I think she grades you based off of your overall gesture in the class.. wears the exact same outfit everyday. complete psycho
3514,2590642,1.0,5.0,"bad. bad. bad. The highest grade in our class is an 85 and thats to a freshman speech class. She has a nasty attitude and someone has hurt her real real bad. She grades harder than the ACTs which i got a 33 on. She is the worst teacher ever and needs to be kicked out of here and banned from never working again. I dont hate people, but hate her sm."
3515,2590642,1.0,5.0,You might look at my tags and say oh shes not entirely bad. Wrong. Online savvy by the way she loves to mess up grades. Shes very savvy with putting hard working kids into gpa hell. Then you might ask well is she funny. I put hilarious because she is a joke of a teacher. DO NOT TAKE THE CLASS. SHE IS THE WORST TEACHER AT OLE MISS.
3516,2590642,1.0,5.0,She makes speech class 100 times harder than it should be. Whenever you have a question to asks she downgrades you and ultimately helps nothing. She never likes your topics for outlines but the way she explains them make no sense. She is just trying to be mean at this point. 0/10. 
3517,2590642,1.0,5.0,Overall worst teacher I’ve had at Ole Miss. over 4 years of classes I’ve never had a teacher be so out of touch with students and be condescending. Making the class more difficult than it ever needed to be by put unnecessary restrictions on speech topics. Instead of letting students express topics they enjoy. AVOID THIS PROF AT ALL COSTS
3518,2590642,1.0,5.0,"The worst professor in the history of professors. Very rude, horrible feedback, doesnt want to see students succeed it seems like. Condescending and vague when it comes to feedback, even when you do what she says shell find something else thats wrong. A 100 level class yet she grades unnecessarily hard. Take another teacher if course is needed."
3519,2590642,1.0,5.0,This is the WORST professor I have ever had. Her grading scales are inaccurate to her grading. The example outlines she uses for your speeches are not good examples. She gives terrible feedback. She is very rude when you ask her questions. She thinks her sarcastic jokes are funny. She has an attitude problem. If I could rate her a 0 I would.
3520,2590642,1.0,5.0,"By far the most rude, backhanded, and passive aggressive Professor I have ever and will ever take. I put my ALL into this class and still came out with a C-. Even when I did what she asked, I was somehow always wrong. I was not the only student who felt she treated us unfairly. Overall a very bad experience and I do NOT recommend taking her class."
3521,2590642,1.0,5.0,"It may be that this is a one month online version of speech 102, but the difficulty of this class is absolutely ridiculous. It's not the hardest class I've ever taken, but Dr. Brown grades outlines of speeches (not even the actual speeches) like they're capstone course final projects. Very vague assignment descriptions you have to look for to find."
3522,2590642,1.0,5.0,&#55358;&#56622;&#55358;&#56622;&#55358;&#56622;DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. Just not the move
3523,2590642,1.0,5.0,"Any positive feedback had to be written by her because there is no way a student who actually took her course would have anything positive to say. She is not the type of professor who wants to see her students succeed. Instead, she tries her hardest to fail them. If you ask anyone who has taken her class, they will tell you she is the worst."
3524,2590642,1.0,5.0,worst teacher i have ever had. rude and grades hard for no reason when it's an intro class
3525,2590642,1.0,4.0,"Victoria Brown is probably the least helpful professor I have ever had. Her instructions are unclear, her grading critiques do not help you to improve and she has a very passive agressive attitude. Overall, she is not helpful and I did not learn much of anything."
3526,2590642,1.0,5.0,This is by far the worst class I have ever taken. Being online and having the class be an intro class she expects way to much. I feel like I am drowning in work. I spent 6 hours straight doing an assignment for her and proceeded to make a failing grade. I would not recommend at all.
3527,2590642,4.0,2.0,Easy class. Mandatory class for many majors having to do with Business or Communications. I am a IMC Major for example. Some reading and open note quizzes so take notes outside of class. You don't really have to try.
3528,1812406,1.0,5.0,He asks a lot of redundant questions and does not offer the floor to his students. Very pompous. He raised his voice to us in class because he didn't like our papers. Loves red ink and had the nerve to replace my prepositions on my paper because he didn't have anything else to complain about.
3529,2435007,3.0,4.0,Definitely need to pay attention to her lectures or you're screwed on the test. Her test are very heavy on what she discusses during the lectures not so much on the powerpoint. It's a lot of work so be prepared. It's clear she's passionate about history but kind of difficult to follow along during lectures.
3530,2639824,5.0,4.0,"Love Lin Laoshi! She is very sweet and fun. Her Chinese class is definitely the best one I've ever taken. Her teaching style is more conversational and less rigid. It's fun when she learns little facts about you and weaves them into her questions. Still, be prepared for involved lectures and lots of homework, like any other Chinese class. "
3531,2117585,5.0,3.0,Great professor! Takes notice of who shows up to class and who participates and offers great feedback if you show interest in the assignments and his help!
3532,2117585,2.0,2.0,"If you take this class, be prepared to lose a bit of your soul. I went into this course thinking that it would be fun but I felt like complete crap after. The material isn't hard but Dr. Thomas is very strict on grading and attendance. Do work on time or prepare to get zeroes. He is very unforgiving. But, the lectures are interesting."
3533,2117585,5.0,3.0,Took Dr. T my first semester (Fall 2018). He was really solid. I liked him a lot. The readings are next level though. STUDY BEFORE EXAMS!
3534,2117585,1.0,5.0,"A firey and angry ideologue masquerading as an academic. This guy is completely inflexible; if you take his class, you better be prepared to blow him, because he wont let you pass if you have even the slightest disagreement with him or his outlandish opinions. In short, dont. Just dont."
3535,2117585,5.0,5.0,"Great guy that goes off of a single slide in a PowerPoint everyday. His class is different that others in that there are no tests. Instead, he grades you off a combination of an online notebook, quizzes, film analysis, and assignments.  His TA grades most everything in the class except the online notebook so difficulty may vary. Recommended"
3536,2117585,5.0,3.0,Phenomenal!
3537,2826208,2.0,4.0,"This class is basic college algebra, but still was difficult. His accent made it pretty hard to understand what he was saying. He's a really nice guy, but he is a new teacher so the material is not explained in the best way. Not the class for you if you don't remember all this material from high school. "
3538,1529828,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Loftin is a great teacher. Attendance is mandatory though and don't ever think about sleeping in his class. He can be funny, but he's also pretty intense. Take his class if you can!"
3539,2723812,1.0,4.0,"Tons of writing assignments. Readings upon readings upon readings. I had this as an 8:00 am and needless to say, I did not enjoy going to class. Doesn't allow submission of late work and assignments are due at midnight the night before class so pay attention. Lectures are boring. Can't recommend. "
3540,2723812,2.0,4.0,"Worst professor I have ever had at this university. Seemed like a nice guy, but is a total narcissist. Has no background in marketing yet thought he knew EVERYTHING about marketing. A know it all who wants to create an organization that he fails at year after year, so he bases the whole class around having students trying to make what he can't."
3541,1333226,5.0,1.0,I loved her! 
3542,1333226,5.0,2.0,Easy professor. Gives a lot of homework and a hefty paper that is to be due on top of the homework due every night for the end of the class. Watch a lot of movies in class (that actually pertain to the subject) and guest speakers (that are not boring).  Probably one of the coolest teachers I've had here. Very willing to help the individual.
3543,1333226,5.0,1.0,Awesome
3544,1333226,5.0,1.0,Awesome rack
3545,1333226,5.0,3.0,I wish she would go out with me !!!
3546,1333226,5.0,1.0,This was Dr. Keena's first year at Ole Miss. I had her for a 2.5 hour class and found myself not wanting to leave many nights. She makes class interesting with her jail/probation stories. And i don't think i have to mention her charm.
3547,927723,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor who genuinely cares about his students and how they're doing. What you put into class, you'll get out. If you get the chance to take Hon 101 or 102 with Prof. Brown, do it."
3548,927723,5.0,3.0,"I took Mr. Brown my freshman year (Spring 2019) and LOVED him! He was easy to connect with and super understanding. If you show you actually wanna try, he WILL help you."
3549,927723,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Brown is by far the best professor I have had in my 6 semesters. He is hilarious, very knowledgable, engaging, and caring"
3550,927723,5.0,2.0,one of the best teachers ever. puts everything into perspective and really makes you think. highly recommend
3551,927723,5.0,2.0,Favorite teacher I've ever had. Hands down. 10/10
3552,927723,5.0,3.0,Great professor! He told us exactly what we needed to know when we wrote our papers and how to fix them if there was a rewrite. Lectures and discussions are engaging.
3553,927723,5.0,2.0,Robert Brown is the most amazing professor I have ever taken. Easy class but also inspires you to learn and think. Take him!!
3554,927723,5.0,2.0,"Extremely good professor, knew what he was talking about, and it's always funny to hear the people who think they know what they're talking about get schooled by him."
3555,927723,4.5,2.0,Take him for Pol 101. One of my favorite professors I've had so far at Ole Miss.
3556,927723,5.0,1.0,this guy is awesome. take him. he puts all of the lectures and study guides on blackboard and he doesn't take attendance. but he's worth going to class for.
3557,927723,5.0,1.0,this guy is awesome. take him. he puts all of the lectures and study guides on blackboard and he doesn't take attendance. but he's worth going to class for.
3558,927723,3.5,2.0,No Comments
3559,927723,4.5,2.0,He is such a fun and interesting guy. Always starts the lecture by talking about actual stuff going on in the news... Liberal attitude and does a great job preparing students for tests. He literally puts his lecture notes online. Great class discussion and overall fun experience. Made a required class feel like an elective.
3560,927723,5.0,3.0,No Comments
3561,2189292,5.0,3.0,"Professor Bowen-Moore is a fantastic professor. She'll always respond to your emails, and if you're confused about something, she'll explain the instructions in great detail. She's super transparent and flexible. She's a pretty tough grader though, but if you're stuck on something, you can ask her and she'll help you in any way she can."
3562,2189292,1.0,4.0,Do NOT TAKE. Never answers any questions you ask. Not helpful at all. The most time consuming class I have taken at ole miss. She is just rude.
3563,2189292,3.0,4.0,She grades pretty tough. She is not clear all the time for what she wants in a project. Her grading sometimes did not reflect the comments she gives in class.
3564,2355178,5.0,4.0,"Probably one of the best professors in the country. He won an incredibly prestigious award as a graduate student at Yale, and is an incredible lecturer. There is a decent amount of work due in his class, but he makes it perfectly clear what is expected so there are no surprises."
3565,2355178,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Peterson is very knowledgeable in European History. His classes inspired me to do more research on my own because of the thought provoking lectures he gave. Overall, Dr. Peterson is one of the best professors in the world!!!!"
3566,2355178,5.0,3.0,"A good amount of reading in the class, book wise. As well as, like a short story to read and get quizzed on once a week. Intense lectures, but they're super interesting. A really nice guy."
3567,2355178,5.0,3.0,Amazing
3568,2355178,5.0,5.0,The best professor Ive ever had. Very engaging and someone you can tell is really knowledgable.
3569,927727,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. A little tough to meet with after class, but always helpful to email and speak with about tests. Really fun class and funny guy."
3570,927727,5.0,3.0,"He was a great prof, very cool... Not to mention his super sexy buns and Grecian sandals."
3571,2494449,2.0,5.0,Often yells at students. Very often. He counts off for things that he never mentioned and werent in the rubric. He doesnt let us take notes and doesnt record lectures. He is very short and condescending to students who ask for help. I would like to learn from him but he makes it impossible. Very upsetting to have him as a professor.
3572,2494449,3.0,4.0,"Has helpful lectures. When TA's do the grading things go pretty smoothly, but when he grades I often find that he counts off for things that were not specified in the prompt. I had one remote class with him; Attendance was optional, but he would rant during class time about students who didn't show up. He is not always clear &amp; often frustrated."
3573,1040370,5.0,3.0,"She is a wonderful professor! Just be sure to remember her little &quot;a+b+c=d&quot; when writing papers! She seems tough, but she just wants you to do your best on papers and come out of her class with more than just text book knowledge.  She seems very international and has a lot of knowledge of the world!  Wonderful lady and teacher!"
3574,1923059,5.0,1.0,maggie is the best
3575,2525172,5.0,2.0,Very interesting and enjoyable class. More classroom disc than anything else
3576,2525172,4.0,5.0,Easy A for any of his courses. His review covers the same exact questions for the exams just show up for review and you get an easy A
3577,2494452,4.0,4.0,"Lecture can be boring, but there is a grade for attendance. Lots of homework but it's straight out of the book. 2 Java programming assignments. 3 tests and an optional final to replace your worst test grade."
3578,2494457,5.0,3.0,"I've had her for a couple of CS classes. very clear rubrics for assignments. she is very receptive to questions and will help you with anything. she emails us reminders about tests, quizzes, and homework. she provides study guides and optional printouts to take notes on during lectures. overall one of my favorite professors. highly recommend."
3579,2689018,3.0,3.0,The issue is his neglect of teaching important topics. He would focus on culture/speaking and test us on grammar/vocabulary that we barely discussed. He does not answer questions adequately. Prepare to essentially teach yourself important topics. The online platform also is horrid. Would not have done well without 4 years of high school French.
3580,2689018,2.0,4.0,Honestly. Do not take him. He never answers questions right and goes way too fast for one to even understand whats going on.
3581,1705980,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Fuller's class is EXTREMELY difficult and does not have a textbook for reference, but of all the classes I've taken, I learned the most in this class. It consist of case studies (which are hard and take 10+ hours/week) and 2 test (final is bluebook case study), but if you want to learn finance, take Dr. Fuller's class and put the effort in."
